Oversight chairman tells Ross he must show up as scheduled Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was warned that he must not try to put off a scheduled public hearing before a U.S. House committee next week, where a main topic will be his role in seeking to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.The warning came in a letter to Ross on Wednesday from House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, after Ross requested more time to prepare for the hearing that\u2019s been scheduled for March 14, according to an official familiar with the matter.\u201cWe have had many very serious questions for Secretary Ross since we invited him to testify several months ago, and we will finally have a chance to ask him these questions -- under oath -- at our hearing next Thursday,\u201d Cummings said in a statement Thursday.Ross\u2019s reason for asking for a delay was that the scope of topics had been broadened from the original request for him to appear in January. But Cummings, in his letter, said that while he would narrow some of the issues to be discussed, he also insisted that Ross appear as scheduled, said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the proceedings.A main topic of the hearing is to be allegations by committee Democrats that Ross has given misleading testimony on multiple occasions to Congress about the citizenship question. Democrats have said Ross may have committed a criminal offense if he wasn\u2019t truthful about how that decision came about.In a letter to Cummings, Michael Platt Jr., Ross\u2019s assistant secretary for legislative affairs, said the Commerce Department needed more time because the committee now is indicating it wants documents about topics including the secretary\u2019s \u201cpersonal finances and ethics obligations\u201d and reports of a \u201ctechnology transfer to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\u201cTo be clear, the secretary has every intention to appear before the committee and continue assisting in your oversight capacity -- the department simply needs more time to produce responsive documents and prepare to testify on the broad range of important topics raised in your letters,\u201d he wrote.Earlier: Top Ethics Watchdog Rejects Ross\u2019s Financial Disclosure FormYet the focus on the census issue is especially timely. On Wednesday, a federal judge in California became the second to strike down the administration\u2019s effort to add the citizenship question, after a New York judge in January previously ruled that Ross exceeded his authority under federal law. The Supreme Court had already scheduled a hearing on the matter for April based on that earlier ruling.Democrats and other critics say the citizenship question would impede the Census Bureau\u2019s count of the U.S. population.Democrats worry that adding it now could suppress the response rate among immigrants and non-citizens. That, in turn, could affect some states\u2019 number of congressional seats, Electoral College clout and federal funding. California is among states that have filed legal action to block the inclusion of the question.Ross\u2019s role has come under scrutiny of Democrats because he and other Commerce Department officials have asserted multiple times that the decision to include the citizenship question stemmed solely from a Justice Department request in December 2017.Read More: Ross Eyed for Early Testimony as Democrats Take Over House PanelBut the Democrats said internal documents show Ross was taking steps to add the question long before then. The Justice Department said in a court document last October that Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, was among those Ross spoke with before including the question. Census-takers started asking about citizenship in 1820, but haven\u2019t posed the question to every household since 1950.The committee also is expected to look into the ethics office\u2019s refusal to certify Ross\u2019s latest financial disclosure because -- after reporting that he had sold off his shares in BankUnited Inc. in 2017 -- he actually sold the stock in October 2018. According to a later filing, he said he mistakenly believed that the shares had been sold earlier. ","1":" Norway is about to decide whether to let its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund dump all its oil and gas stocks. After more than a year of closely held deliberations, the Finance Ministry is set to reveal whether its massive fund will be allowed to divest close to $40 billion in oil and gas stocks. The decision will be made public around 11:45 a.m. in Oslo.   Here\u2019s what you need to know.The fund contends that it makes little sense for Norway to be doubly exposed to the oil markets. As western Europe\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer, its fortunes are already heavily linked to petroleum, deriving almost half its exports and more than 20 percent of the state\u2019s revenue from the commodities.The central bank, which oversees the fund, insists that the plan is based solely on financial considerations and that it doesn\u2019t reflect a particular view of the oil industry\u2019s prospects.The proposal shocked markets when it was revealed in 2017, sending oil stocks broadly lower. The plan was hailed by activists around the world as a monumental step in getting investors to back away from fossil fuels. If it becomes reality, it would likely turn the heat up on Big Oil, which is already facing pressure to do more to fight climate change and adapt to the energy transition.The fund owned about $37 billion of oil and gas stocks at the end of last year, including more than 2 percent of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Total SA. But it has also assured that any sell-down would likely take years.Read about how the fund boosted its oil and gas holdings last yearRead more: Norway\u2019s oil sell-off plan is \u2018shot heard around the world\u2019Economists are split over the plan and a government-commissioned expert panel last year advised against it, arguing a divestment would be inefficient insurance against a drop in commodity prices. It also said it would threaten the fund\u2019s simple and well-established strategy of investing broadly.In theory, the proposal has the support of a majority of parties in Parliament, which has the final say. However, since the plan was presented, the centrist Liberals and Christian Democrats, who are in favor of dumping oil stocks, have joined the bigger Conservative and Progress parties to form a majority government. While they haven\u2019t voiced a clear view of the oil-stock proposal, the Conservatives and Progress Party have traditionally been reluctant to make dramatic changes to the fund\u2019s investment strategy.The issue is likely to be settled within the coalition before the Finance Ministry makes its announcement on Friday. While that process makes a heated contest in parliament improbable, it also makes the outcome harder to predict.Tore Storehaug, a Christian Democrat lawmaker who sits on Parliament\u2019s Finance Committee, declined to say anything on what might happen in case the government decides not to follow the fund\u2019s advice.Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.\u201cGenerally speaking, there\u2019s broad consensus that the management of the oil fund and the enormous values Norway controls should have the broadest possible political backing,\u201d he said by phone.The opposition Labor Party, Norway\u2019s biggest political group, has long said it\u2019s sympathetic to the proposal, and is now coming out clearly in favor of selling the fund\u2019s oil stocks.\u201cMy expectation is that they\u2019ll follow the advice from Norges Bank,\u201d said lawmaker Svein Roald Hansen. \u201cWe will of course consider the government\u2019s arguments. But in my opinion, they will need to come up with some surprising elements to change our mind.\u201d ","2":" NIO Inc. plunged the most on record after the Chinese electric-vehicle maker lowered its first-quarter delivery outlook and canceled its plan to build a manufacturing plant in Shanghai.The shares fell 21 percent in New York on Wednesday after rising 62 percent through Tuesday since the initial public offering in September. The stock dropped to $8.01, the lowest since Feb. 21.NIO, vying to be China\u2019s answer to Tesla Inc., said deliveries of its ES8 SUV tumbled more than expected in February. It\u2019s more evidence of deteriorating demand in the world\u2019s largest car market, which contracted for the first time in two decades last year as the economy slowed and a trade war weighed on consumer spending.China Car Slump Has Dealers Slashing Prices, Giving Cheap LoansThe guidance cut prompted at least one analyst to downgrade the stock. BofAML analyst Ming Hsun Lee lowered his rating on NIO to underperform from neutral, noting lower-than-expected sales growth for the ES8 and a \u201crich valuation.\"While Tesla has recently lowered prices for its cars, Lee noted that NIO does not have plans to do the same. However, the analyst believes the company would have to eventually offer some discounts. \u201cWe believe NIO would have to offer some incentives or more features on ES6\/ES8, amid peers\u2019 new product launch\/price discount, and the electric vehicle purchase subsidy cut later this year,\u201d Lee said.Tesla has also repeatedly struggled with meeting delivery targets in the past. The company has recently started delivering its Model 3 sedans in China, a market that\u2019s leading the charge in getting buyers to give up gas guzzlers and go electric.             NIO\u2019s lackluster guidance flagged a key issue that has also dogged Tesla in recent months. Bernstein\u2019s Robin Zhu noted that while NIO\u2019s fourth-quarter numbers were on the soft side, its demand concerns may actually prove more damaging for investors\u2019 long-term outlook on the company. NIO\u2019s fourth-quarter release pointed to February deliveries of just 811 units, Zhu said, adding that lower capacity utilization is expected to weigh on gross margins in the first quarter.\u2014 With assistance by Angus Whitley ","3":"Lease-back plans lure new customers with guaranteed returns. But works often turn out to be worth far less than expected In her first foray into the world of art investing, Lucette d\u2019Angelique got an offer that seemed too good to turn down.Buy a work of contemporary Chinese art, which was appreciating at as much as 20 percent a year, then lease it to a corporation for a guaranteed 6 percent annual return.The company making the pitch, Art Futures Group, said a client had already been signed up to lease the painting, but she would need to act quickly as several other potential buyers were also looking at the work.So d\u2019Angelique plunked down HK$198,000 ($25,223) for an oil painting by Hou Qing featuring a young Chinese woman in a red dress, clutching a bottle of Hennessy cognac. \"I was thinking, wow, what a great investment.\"Order acknowledgment of purchase of \"Red Hennessy\" by Hou Qing.A few months later, while attending an open house at the AFG gallery, she was surprised to see her painting was on display to promote the artist and not hanging in someone\u2019s office. Still, the monthly dividend checks kept arriving, so she brushed aside her concerns, eventually spending another HK$1.1 million on four more paintings.After two years, the leasing contract on her painting \u201cRed Hennessy\u201d expired. AFG told her it wouldn\u2019t be renewed. The story was the same for her other purchases once the initial two-year rental period expired. She was told the leasing market had gone quiet and it was too soon to try and sell her paintings.Frustrated by AFG\u2019s failure to respond to her further queries, she tried to place her works with several Hong Kong auction houses.\"Not one of them wanted anything to do with these paintings,\" she said. The best she could get was an offer from Sotheby\u2019s to sell a Shen Jingdong painting online with a reserve price of HK$10,000 ($1,274), about 3.5 percent of the HK$288,000 she had paid for it. Sotheby\u2019s declined to comment on Shen Jindong\u2019s artworks.Appraisal certificate for \"Book Worm,\" by Shen Jingdong.d\u2019Angelique isn\u2019t the only one suffering buyer\u2019s remorse. More than 50 people have signed up to a private chat group on Facebook for AFG clients that she created. Interviews with more than a dozen other AFG clients tell a similar story. The average price they paid per painting was about $25,000.AFG\u2019s website says it has served more than 1,000 clients. In an e-mail exchange, AFG initially said the company\u2019s founder, Jeremy Kasler, would give an interview, but then said he would respond to written questions instead. On receiving the questions, the company said he was too busy to respond. In response to two subsequent emails, the company said there was no one else available to address the questions.AFG isn\u2019t the only company in Hong Kong offering to sell and then lease art. Elliot James & Tyndal also sells Chinese contemporary art with promises of an 8 percent return for two years, said Divine Fung, who bought one of their paintings after getting cold called by a sales representative. The company did not respond to emailed questions.Another firm, Collins & Kent International Fine Art, sold editions of works by Damien Hirst and Salvador Dali, offering 7.5 percent rental income, until its Hong Kong office went bust in 2017.Damien Hirst\u2019s The Souls IV Westminster blue\/cool gold\/topaz No. 8\/15.Mrs. Wong, a compliance lawyer who asked to use her husband\u2019s surname only, bought a Hirst print from Collins & Kent a few months before the company closed. Now she says she\u2019s stuck with a painting she never liked and can\u2019t sell.\"I was the perfect target, someone with enough money, very little time and no knowledge of art,\u201d she said. \u201cI am totally embarrassed by my own stupidity and lack of due diligence.\"A Melbourne-based company using the same name said it helps some clients lease their purchases of \"blue chip\" European works for a one-year period with yields between 3.5 percent and 7 percent as part of a broader business offering art storage and logistics. It allowed the Hong Kong entity use of its name and access to its artworks, the company said in an email.The art-purchase-and-lease offer is particularly appealing for people looking for a high-return alternative investment, but find the world of galleries, art fairs and auction houses intimidating.\"That\u2019s where the model works, it preys on people by speaking to them in a vocabulary they understand and offering to be a trusted guide through this very opaque market, so buyers probably let their guard down,\" says Edie Hu, art advisory specialist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong. \"There is a mystique to the art market and all of a sudden you have someone who brings it down to your level. Nobody from galleries or auction houses talks about return on investment.\"Macey & Sons, which sells mostly European works of art and antiques, was founded by former AFG employee Jonathan Macey, who declined to discuss his former employer. He said his firm does lease some pieces back from buyers it uses for publicity to attract new clients, paying the owner up to 5 percent.\"We have a leasing program, not on all pieces, on certain pieces we can show off around the world,\u201d Macey said. \"You have to reinvent the way you gain markets.\"His firm rents space at art fairs and held a free whisky tasting in November for delegates of the Hong Kong AVCJ Venture Capital Summit. In February Macey displayed a client\u2019s HK$1 million 12 carat tiara at the Longines Masters equestrian event in Hong Kong. His clients can even earn frequent flyer points when they purchase his art.AFG has set up a booth each year at the Asia Contemporary Art Show in Hong Kong alongside other galleries, and has held lucky draws to win a painting, according to d\u2019Angelique, who said she was contacted by phone \u201cin minutes\u201d after filling out an online survey in 2012 to enter the contest.A painting by artist Liu Liguo.Iris, who works in finance and asked that only her first name be used, started getting calls from a salesman soon after filling out an AFG questionnaire in exchange for a free face-painting for her daughter in the upscale Hong Kong enclave of Discovery Bay.\"He was very pushy and good at talking, like a car salesman,\" she said after buying a surrealistic painting of a multicolored zebra by mainland artist Liu Liguo for HK$348,000 in 2016. \"If he had sold me a mutual fund or some other investment I would have been a lot more careful. Without the rental offer I probably would not have bought it.\"She said she doesn\u2019t believe her painting was ever rented out and AFG simply overcharged her and paid the lease premium from the sale proceeds. The leasing contract was drawn up between her and AFG, not a corporate renter. She said AFG wouldn\u2019t tell her who would be leasing her painting.Collectors Reveal Secrets of How to Make a Fortune in ArtWhile the claims of third-party leases may have been unsubstantiated, the company hasn\u2019t done anything legally improper, said Wong, the lawyer.One reason the strategy flourishes is the reluctance of many former clients to speak out. Seven people who were interviewed about their purchases work in banking and finance and requested anonymity to protect their professional reputations. Some of those who bought the artworks didn\u2019t want to talk about the experience.That behavior is typical of people who fear they fell for a scam because they feel ashamed, said a former Blackrock employee who spent HK$625,000 on art from AFG. Their shame is a natural reaction and companies rely on it to prevent information coming out about their operations, the person said.But some who feel victimized don\u2019t stay silent. H.L. Tan decided to speak out after an AFG broker tried to sell him a second painting five years after his first. \"I was really angry,\" said Tay, a former stock broker who wrote off his HK$248,000 purchase years ago. \"This is why I am coming forward, as a warning sign to everyone not to get involved.\" ","4":" The most serious of the corruption charges looming against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu involve allegations that he shaped industry rules to favor the country\u2019s largest telecommunications company, Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corporation Ltd. Attorney General Avihai Mandelblit has served notice that he plans to indict Netanyahu for bribery in the case as the country prepares for general elections in April.Mandelblit says that when Netanyahu approved a merger in 2015 between Bezeq\u2019s television unit Yes and the parent company he did so to help his close friend Shaul Elovitch, who had stakes in both, pocket a windfall. The attorney general says that Netanyahu, who was also serving as communications minister at the time, promised additional regulatory relief for the telecommunications giant. Investigators have alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s handpicked director-general of the Communications Ministry, Shlomo Filber, allowed Bezeq executives secret access to internal ministry documents so they could review them and suggest changes. Filber turned state\u2019s witness last year.Elovitch bought the largest stake in Bezeq in 2010, financing the takeover with 6.5 billion shekels ($1.79 billion) of debt. Soon after, regulatory reforms began hurting profits, threatening his plan to repay the loans with Bezeq\u2019s dividend. To generate new cash, Elovitch pushed to sell his shares in Yes. Investigators allege that executives close to him inflated the selling price, hurting Bezeq shareholders. Local investment houses with stakes in Bezeq voted against the deal because of the high purchase price. Netanyahu overrode objections and approved the sale. Meanwhile, senior editors at Bezeq\u2019s Walla! news portal began changing or removing articles that portrayed the prime minister or his family in a negative light, often at the direct request of Netanyahu\u2019s wife Sara, investigators allege.No. In 2016, Netanyahu pushed to lift a ban preventing Bezeq from merging its units which was put in place to prevent the company from abusing its monopolistic power. However, under pressure from government watchdogs, Netanyahu was forced to resign from the communications ministry because his previously undisclosed friendship with Elovitch presented a conflict of interest. In June 2017, the Israel Securities Authority opened an investigation into Bezeq, in effect freezing any attempts to change industry rules.He has consistently denied wrongdoing. He\u2019s argued that favorable press coverage doesn\u2019t constitute a bribe, and that he\u2019s a victim of a left-wing conspiracy involving Israel\u2019s police, the justice system and the media to remove him from office. Netanyahu will be entitled to a hearing after the April 9 election to present his case and try to persuade the attorney general to drop the plan to charge him.Prosecutors have to decide whether to go ahead with their draft indictment accusing Elovitch of bribery, which can carry a penalty of as much as 10 years in prison. His creditors took his telecom empire to bankruptcy court and are selling the majority stake in Bezeq. The company itself has continued to spiral downwards since the investigation into its dealings was announced. The stock recently hit a 21-year low, and investors and analysts fear the company\u2019s profits will dry up, forcing Bezeq to ditch its dividend in the coming years.Just the prospect of charges could cost Netanyahu re-election. According to polls taken after the draft indictment was published, the Blue & White bloc, led by ex-military chief of staff Benny Gantz and former Finance Minister Yair Lapid, will be in a better position to form a government than the prime minister\u2019s Likud. But if Netanyahu is re-elected and the attorney general goes ahead with an indictment after the vote, the prime minister has vowed he won\u2019t step down unless convicted.

Officials from the two countries are discussing how to address currency policy in a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d that would form the basis of a deal that ultimately will have to be approved by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, according to several people involved in and briefed on the discussions. While the precise wording remains unresolved, a pledge of yuan stability has been discussed in multiple rounds of talks in recent months and both sides have tentatively agreed it will be part of the framework of any final deal. Negotiations resume Tuesday in Washington and are scheduled to continue through Friday as a March 1 deadline for higher U.S. tariffs approaches. Asian shares look set for gains after U.S. stocks rose in thin trading.\u00a0Walmart Inc.\u2019s stellar earnings boosted consumer shares Tuesday, while Treasuries advanced as investors assessed the prospects for a trade deal with China. The S&P 500 gained for the sixth time in seven sessions, pushing to the highest since early December. Walmart\u2019s\u00a0best holiday quarter\u00a0in a decade lifted retailers, and homebuilders got a boost from a positive sentiment report. The 10-year Treasury yield slid below 2.64 percent as concerns remain that the trade truce will end March 1 without a deal, leading to fresh tariffs. The dollar fell against major currencies ahead of speeches from Federal Reserve officials this week and the release of meeting minutes Wednesday that should shed more light on the central bank\u2019s turn to a more dovish tone. China\u2019s yuan traded offshore strengthened against the greenback.Business Secretary Greg Clark said the U.K.  isn\u2019t likely to reach agreements with Japan and South Korea to roll over existing trade deals before Britain\u2019s  scheduled departure from the European Union on March 29. Britain benefits from about 40 free-trade agreements with 70 nations through its EU membership, and it\u2019s been seeking to extend them after Brexit. Combined, they account for 11 percent of U.K. trade.\u00a0\u201cUnfortunately not all of the FTAs -- and I might mention the Japan and Korean ones that are important -- are expected to be concluded in time,\u201d Clark told executives and journalists on Tuesday at the annual conference of the MakeUK manufacturing lobby group. \u201cThat is one of the reasons why I think it is so important that we should not leave without a deal.\u201dPresident Donald Trump said he is in \u201cno rush whatsoever\u201d to conclude a nuclear deal with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump told reporters at the White House Tuesday he is no rush because he has a strong relationship with the North Korean leader and U.S. sanctions against the country remain in place while they work to negotiate a deal to end Kim\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs. Trump said that he spoke earlier in the day with South Korean President Moon Jae-In about his planned  second summit with Kim scheduled for Feb. 27-28 in Hanoi. Trump said he discussed all aspects of the meeting with Moon. He added that he plans to hold a similar conversation Wednesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Financial conditions across Asia are getting easier, helped by a stock market rally, falling bond yields and a dovish policy shift from the\u00a0Federal Reserve.

Intel was lower by 0.7 percent.Apple\u2019s first option, Cowen wrote, is to \u201claunch 18 months after 5G competition with an inferior modem from Intel likely without mmWave capabilities,\u201d referring to the band of spectrum that can be used for 5G\u2019s high-speed wireless communications.Another option would be to \u201csource a 5G modem from chief competitor Samsung,\u201d Cowen wrote, though it added that would likely come only on \u201ctough commercial terms.\u201d Using a 5G modem from Huawei is \u201coff the table as an option,\u201d Cowen told clients, while \u201cMediaTek\u2019s stack is too far behind in terms of timeline.\u201dApple could also settle its disputes with Qualcomm and revert back to its modems, but Cowen asked, \u201cmight it be too late already?\u201d The two firms have been locked in a multi-year legal battle surrounding patent infringements.The company\u2019s fourth option would be to purchase Intel\u2019s modem business and develop the necessary components internally. Cowen wrote that this was \u201ca reasonable but expensivelong-term solution,\u201d and one that \u201cwould be VERY difficult against a 2H20 timeline.\u201dShares of Apple have gained more than 20 percent from a January low that followed a lower sales forecast. on Monday, Apple closed at its highest level since early December, although it remains 24 percent below a record high hit in October. Much of the weakness has been fueled by weak demand for the iPhone, Apple\u2019s flagship product, and analysts have been hoping that a 5G version will reinvigorate sales. ","8":" Want the lowdown on what&apos;s moving European markets in your inbox every morning? Sign up here.Good morning.\u00a0Stocks are down in Asia on the 10th anniversary of the start of the global equity bull market. Today we&apos;ll get notable data from the U.S. and Europe, and we&apos;ll be watching for Brexit updates from Brussels. Here\u2019s what\u2019s moving markets this morning.The market is braced for a slowdown in the robust\u00a0pace of job\u00a0creation\u00a0-- we&apos;re looking at a median estimate of 180,000\u00a0for February -- though  Mohamad El-Erian argues that the indicator we should really be looking at is labor-force participation due to its potential to influence Fed policy. The indicator, which caps a week of mounting global growth woes, comes at 2:30 p.m. CET.U.K. Prime Minister Theresa  May is expected to tell the European Union\u00a0on Friday that the fate of a vote on her Brexit deal next week is in its hands. That comes after the EU made a new offer about how to review the backstop to break the impasse, people familiar with the EU side of the talks said. Meanwhile, the EU  trade czar is warning of a chaotic Brexit in the event of a no-deal exit. To add insult to injury, she&apos;s not confident a deal can be reached in the coming weeks.To the U.S. bull market, which has been running since March 9, 2009. Does that mean condolences, then, to those European-only investors who have gotten returns, including dividends, of just 198\u00a0percent in dollar terms, compared to the S&P 500&apos;s 401 percent? At least Royal Unibrew investors have something to skaal to this weekend: their stock has wildly outperformed in the past 10\u00a0years.Stocks are down in Asia amid renewed concerns about global growth, with U.S. futures declining after weak Chinese trade data. That, of course, follows downgraded ECB forecasts for Europe yesterday, that  some officials are said to\u00a0view as still too optimistic, and\u00a0that have left the euro near a two-year low. Also not helping: a sell rating from China&apos;s largest brokerage on People&apos;s Insurance Company Group of China. The recommendation may have been sanctioned by the government, the market mused, causing people to worry that China wants to slow the market rally.Before the jobs report, we&apos;ll have a slew of indicators, starting with Italian industrial production and, most important,\u00a0German factory orders -- their unexpected drop last month added to signs that Europe&apos;s largest economy was facing a protracted loss in momentum. The market&apos;s looking for 0.5 percent\u00a0growth this time around.

Maryland\u2019s Van Hollen, speaking to reporters, said he wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to make it harder for corporate insiders to unload stock right after buyback announcements inevitably lead to pops in stock prices. If the SEC doesn\u2019t take action, Van Hollen said, he will introduce legislation that directs the regulator to examine its rules around the issue. Van Hollen cited \u201cstartling\u201d research by SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson that showed executives sell more stock than normal after buybacks are announced, and that the insiders\u2019 selling can hurt long-term investors.\"It raises concern that buybacks are a way to maximize executive pay,\" Van Hollen told reporters during a press briefing. Such a bill would face long odds of passing the Republican-controlled Senate, though Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio has said he wants to crack down on tax benefits companies get from buying back shares. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has said that buybacks are distorting the market.The SEC\u2019s Jackson has been a frequent critic of corporate executives selling shares after buybacks.

Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said the unit has been selling off aircraft and buying new ones in a manner that is leaving it with lesser quality assets, as it tries to plug the cash flow shortfall of the broader financial business, GECS.The analyst said GE has liquidated a cumulative $15 billion in aircraft over the past 4 years, or 48 percent of the starting aircraft portfolio at that time, \u201cseemingly funding purchase commitments of new aircraft.\u201d Tusa, who now has a neutral rating on GE, had a sell rating on the company for more than two years, and upgraded the shares in December.\u201cWe don\u2019t see a problem with portfolio \u2018churn\u2019 at face value, however underneath the surface of a highly opaque net income number, we see degradation in core returns, masked by substantial gains that are not being well disclosed, even relative to the past,\u201d Tusa wrote.A GE representative did not immediately comment on Tusa\u2019s observations about GECAS, the jet leasing unit.The division had recently been the subject of reports that Apollo Global Management was meeting with lenders about a bid for all or part of it, but GE pushed back on the idea during its fourth-quarter results announcement in January, saying it has \u201cno plans to part with this asset.\u201dGE shares were gained as much as 1.8 percent on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, it emerged on Sunday that European Union officials are\u00a0also working\u00a0on a new plan that could help get the deal over the line at the last minute.Asian equity futures are higher this morning, following Friday&apos;s rally in the U.S. Stocks gained on the positive signs coming from trade negotiations, rising for a fourth-straight week.

While seasonal effects explain some of the gains, analysts say the trend has staying power as authorities shift their focus from containing the nation\u2019s $34 trillion debt pile to shoring up the weakest economic expansion since 2009. The question now is whether China\u2019s attempt to create a healthier mix of financing -- fewer shadow banks, longer debt maturities -- will prove successful. Premier Li Keqiang underscored the challenge last week, warning of risks from sharp increases in short-term debt after China\u2019s credit growth surged to a record in January.Trump emphasized the potential for progress with denuclearizing North Korea as he prepared to depart for Vietnam for a second meeting with Kim, even as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said talks will take time and that a third summit may be necessary.\u00a0 In three tweets on Sunday before leaving for Hanoi to meet the North Korean leader, Trump praised Chinese and Russian support and cited the potential for fast economic development in North Korea if it abandons its nuclear program.\u00a0Trump also lauded sanctions placed on the border by China and Russia.This is what\u2019s caught our eye over the weekend.

Those issues are dominating the National People\u2019s Congress, an annual gathering of the country\u2019s most powerful officials that continued Thursday in Beijing.Here are the latest developments from China\u2019s biggest meeting of the year. (Time-stamps are local time in Beijing.)5G is Chinese tech company Xiaomi Corp.\u2019s development priority, its chairman Lei Jun says on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. The 5G network will become a driver of the country\u2019s economic growth, he adds. The phone will be offered in May or June.His comments come as stock speculators catch on to China\u2019s 5G firms, with the optimism bolstering Xiaomi and ZTE Corp. The thinking is that firms tied to next-generation wireless technology are about to get a windfall as carriers put money into infrastructure upgrades, and as the government plans to expand e-payment usage in rural areas -- a move that will require greater web coverage and smartphones.The cuts will top the country\u2019s fiscal policy priority list in the coming year and may be higher than the proposed amount of 2 trillion yuan ($298 billion) announced this week, Finance Minister Liu Kun says at a press conference. The tax cuts will focus on manufacturers and small businesses as China works to ease the tax burden across all sectors, he says.Liu admits it\u2019s \u201cvery challenging\u201d to keep the balance between revenue and expenditure as economic growth and inflation weaken. The tax and fee cuts announced this week in Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s work report to the NPC are up from 1 trillion in 2018, and include a cut of 3 percentage points to the top bracket of VAT that aims to benefit China\u2019s manufacturing sector.A twitter user who scanned photos of delegates to China\u2019s annual \u201cTwo Sessions\" political meetings and then used facial recognition software to identify them in TV footage has deleted all tweets on their account.I will be deleting all of my tweets and will no longer be tweeting or responding to DMs. All of my tweets were entirely based on my personal analysis using publicly available data, and did not involve other individuals. It is not my intention to subvert state or Party authority.The account had previously tweeted an analysis of what it said was plagiarism by senior Chinese government officials, similar to allegations made in a recent Financial Times story. A previous tweet compared the mentions of President Xi Jinping on the front page of the People\u2019s Daily with former leaders like Jiang Zemin or Hu Jintao.The account was followed by many journalists and other China-watchers, who replied to the final post with messages of concern and gratitude.Delegates pose for photographs in front of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act is a serious interference in China\u2019s internal affairs and disregards the facts, the Communist Party\u2019s Tibet chief Wu Yingjie says on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. \u201cWe have more U.S. visitors coming in recent years,\u201d he says.Chinese government officials responsible for restricting access to Tibet by foreign journalists, diplomats, and others are ineligible for visas to enter the U.S. under the bill. \u201cIf the U.S. adopts a discriminatory visa policy against Chinese officials, that would violate the basic norms of international relations,\u201d Wu says.Wu says Tibet\u2019s travel policies are made \u201cbased on weather and geological conditions and applicable to visitors from all foreign countries,\u201d and aren\u2019t targeting America.The positivity emerging from trade discussions between China and the U.S. is raising market confidence, says Cosco Shipping Holdings chairman Xu Lirong on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. The trade dispute impacted the company in 2018 as container rates and volume moderated amid pessimism over the tensions, he says. He calls the current situation good.But China\u2019s concessions aren\u2019t likely to be very big, as Beijing has done a lot of things the U.S. has said it should be doing, China\u2019s ex-finance minister Lou Jiwei says at the NPC. Lou, the current chairman of the National Council for Social Security Funds, calls the U.S. demands unreasonable and nitpicky and adds that imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods hurts Washington as well.Lou says China has never used currency to create a trade advantage. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said last month that it won\u2019t use foreign exchange as a \u201ctool\u201d in the trade dispute and that it hoped the U.S. could respect market rules.Shenhua Ningxia Coal Industry Group, a unit of China Energy Investment, is going to keep coal production at last year\u2019s level, the company\u2019s chairman Shao Junjie says on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. China\u2019s coal price is expected to remain relatively steady, he said.Coal prices could remain capped by abundant supply and as the country makes a longer-term shift toward cleaner energy, says Bloomberg Intelligence. The country\u2019s coal consumption may rise this year, China Energy Investment General Manager Ling Wen said Tuesday.While the U.S. and China have made substantial progress in their negotiations, work remains to be done, National Development and Reform Commission Vice Chairman Ning Jizhe says on the sidelines of an NPC briefing. Ning, a member of the Chinese delegation to the talks, also says Beijing is willing to meet the U.S. halfway. The two sides are reportedly close to a deal after months of dispute, but China\u2019s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said Tuesday it will make further efforts.Ning JizheNDRC Vice Chairman Ning Jizhe tells reporters that China looks to bolster consumption with measures like income raising and tax cuts. It also plans a further opening of its agriculture and mining sectors, he says. The country\u2019s annual work report, released Tuesday, announced some $298 billion in tax cuts for the coming year.China Development Bank is going to play a new role in resolving hidden and off-balance sheet local government debt -- which has been a focus for top policy makers as the country works to curb financial risks.China\u2019s largest policy bank is working with the Ministry of Finance on specific cases of hidden local government debt, the bank\u2019s president Zheng Zhijie said. CDB hopes the central government will coordinate a national policy, he added.China Investment Corp. will bolster alternative and direct investments amid an increasingly shaky global economic outlook. In recent years, CIC has expanded into direct investments, looking to smooth out returns and create a hedge against volatile public markets.Tu Guangshao in January.The \u201cfocus is to increase the share of non-public market, especially alternative and direct, investments,\u201d Tu Guangshao, president of the $941 billion sovereign wealth fund, says on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. \u201cThat\u2019s our strategic choice to tackle market uncertainties.\u201dCIC\u2019s focus for direct investments is to find projects that can match China\u2019s shift toward more high-tech industries and away from low-end manufacturing, and growth in consumer consumption, Tu says.The country has taken continuous steps forward, says Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission -- for example, allowing overseas insurers to enter the Chinese market.Trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have made progress in six areas, he says, without specifying. \u201cIn the past there have been misunderstandings,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example currency manipulation. This is untrue. We are maintaining stable currency.\u201d His comments come as President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are reportedly close to a deal after months of dispute.Guo ShuqingGuo also addresses financial supply side reform, which has been a buzzword for Chinese markets ahead of the NPC. After Xi\u2019s pivot to growth helped send the country\u2019s stocks to a months-long high, investors are eager for details on how the shift will be implemented.\u201cPart of supply side reform is to\u00a0make sure funds can get to smaller firms,\u201d says Guo, who\u2019s also Communist Party chief for China\u2019s central bank. China \u201cmust create a stronger capital market.\u201dLi Keqiang speaks at the opening session of the NPC.The program will continue in 2019 in order to ease local governments\u2019 interest burdens, Premier Li Keqiang says in lengthy opening speech at the Great Hall of the People. Beijing encourages addressing local government financing vehicles\u2019 debt problems appropriately with market-based ways, the premier adds.Xiao Yaqing in January.\u201cWe haven\u2019t yet discussed any plan\u201d to merge the three auto groups owned by the central government -- FAW, Dongfeng and Changan -- says State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission Chairman Xiao Yaqing on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. A merger will depend on the situation of the overall market, he says.The three vehicle makers are competitors, but the government encourages them to collaborate, Xiao says.\u201cThere will be more to come,\u201d Minister of Industry and Information Technology Miao Wei says when asked whether China will roll out more stimulus policies to boost its auto industry. The measures will \u201cnot necessarily\u201d be fiscal support, he says.Miao WeiMiao also addresses two other auto issues. He says \u201cit should be the case\u201d that local government subsidies for new energy vehicles will be phased out, and that the funds should be directed to charging infrastructure. He also says the 2019 new energy vehicle subsidy policy will be announced \u201cvery soon.\u201dPlans for setting up a system to allows cross-border stock listings between the Chinese financial capital Shanghai and London are still being studied, China Securities Regulator Commission Chairman Yi Huiman tells reporters. When asked if the country\u2019s recent market rally was healthy, he says \u201cwe respect the market.\u201dIt\u2019s \u201cvery\u201d likely that the U.S. and China will reach a deal in the current circumstances, the tech company\u2019s Chairman Lei Jun tells reporters. He also says Xiaomi\u2019s globalization plan is going \u201cvery smoothly\u201d and that it will emphasize the European market this year. It may still take time to enter the American market, Lei adds.Renhe Group Development Co. Chairman Yang Wenlong said a major vat tax cut announced in Li\u2019s annual work report to the NPC would reduce the company\u2019s annual tax burden by at least 200 million yuan ($30 million). He also said Renhe has benefited from policies boosting private firms and that pharma stocks have further potential.Chinese policymakers look to pull off a gradual deceleration as they battle a debt legacy and the U.S. trade standoff. They also lowered China\u2019s official goal for economic growth Tuesday morning, setting the 2019 target released to the NPC at a range of 6 percent to 6.5 percent.\u201cThe Chinese government has been working on scaling back taxation as well as fee charges. If in place the VAT cut would be a great boost to the auto industry,\u201d says SASAC\u2019s Xiao. ","14":" Good thing she\u2019s fearless, with all these ticked-off humans around.\u201cFearless Girl,\u201d the sculpture State Street Corp. installed in downtown Manhattan two years ago to great fanfare and consternation, is now the subject of a court order blocking her creator from selling a replica to buyers in Germany.A federal judge in New York this week issued a preliminary injunction barring the artist, Kristen Visbal, from completing the sale, promoting the replica or using an online form to sell others, according to a court filing made public on Thursday.State Street put the artwork on Bowling Green, across from the financial district\u2019s iconic statue of a charging bull, before dawn on International Women\u2019s Day in March 2017, calling on companies to add more women to their boards. The creator of the bull decried its placement, saying it changed the meaning of his work, and a public debate raged on Twitter. \u201cFearless Girl\u201d was later moved in front of the New York Stock Exchange.State Street Global Advisors sued Visbal in February, saying she was selling replicas of the work without permission. Visbal is \u201cweakening and adulterating the Fearless Girl message,\u201d and her buyers are misusing the image to promote their own companies, the investment manager said in the suit.In his order, which will remain in effect while the suit is pending, U.S. District Judge Gregory H. Woods said State Street had shown it was likely to win its case on the merits and would suffer irreparable harm if an injunction weren\u2019t entered.Visbal\u2019s lawyer, Nancy Wolff, said in a statement that Visbal\u2019s contract with State Street \u201cclearly provides that Kristen, as the creator and copyright owner of the artwork, may sell both full-size and miniature replicas of the artwork.\u201d\u201cOnce the public knows the full story,\u201d she added, \u201cthey will see that it is Kristen who is the Fearless Girl.\u201dState Street spokesman Marc Hazelton had no immediate comment. ","15":" There\u2019s no doubt of the seriousness underscoring the worst military standoff between India and Pakistan in decades, yet investors appear to be looking past the tension for now, at least when it comes to their stock markets.India\u2019s NSE Nifty 50 Index of blue-chip companies erased its gain Wednesday and the Pakistan benchmark plummeted as much as 3.8 percent as headlines emerged of fighter-jet skirmishes, with an Indian MiG 21 jet later reported to be shot down and its pilot captured. The dramatic escalation came just a day after Indian forces bombed a terrorist training camp in Pakistan.Yet by the end of Wednesday, Karachi had recovered most of its losses to settle for a mere 0.3 percent decline, with the Nifty 50 closing down by the same amount.Back to business as usual, apparently. Both the Nifty 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex Index rose on Thursday, and Pakistan\u2019s KSE 100 Index climbed as much as 1.1 percent before paring its gain to 0.4 percent. That\u2019s even as the regional MSCI Asia Pacific Index tanked when U.S. President Donald Trump cut short his summit with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un.While Indian shares are the worst performers among major Asian markets this year, posting a decline against a stellar 8.5 percent rally for the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, foreign investors have been warming up to the country recently.They\u2019ve invested more than $2.2 billion net in the market this month alone, including three days of inflows through Tuesday, the last day for which the data are available. The $1.7 billion added on Friday (some of which could be linked to a stake sale in Kotak Mahindra) was the most since April 2015.Meanwhile, the options market is showing that investors are concentrating their attention further into the future. The cost of hedging against Nifty 50 swings in the next month remains lower than protection prices for three months out, despite a rebound in the past couple of days, implied-volatility data show. Just on Monday, the spread between the two hit its widest level since at least September 2017.Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces a hotly contested general election due by May. At the same time, the mood of markets across the region continues to vacillate with each fresh update on progress -- or lack thereof -- on a trade deal between the U.S. and China, now that the original March 1 deadline has been pushed out indefinitely.When asked in a Bloomberg Radio interview what risks investors were keeping an eye on, Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist with Saxo Capital Markets, said: \u201cIn the very near term we have India-Pakistan, which no one seems to take seriously given the history there.\u201dIndeed the two sides have long been in conflict, fighting three major wars since the 1947 partition and exchanging regular gunfire across the border. Similar to South Koreans learning to live with decades of threats from the North, perhaps investors in the two countries may have a higher tolerance for such volatility -- at least for now.

Oslo exchange board, largest owners have backed Nasdaq bid Euronext NV stepped up a struggle with Nasdaq Inc. for control of Oslo Bors, raising its bid for Norway\u2019s main stock exchange to about $790 million.The Franco-Dutch exchange operator is now willing to pay 158 Norwegian kroner a share, which is about 4 percent more than Nasdaq bid last month. It\u2019s also about 9 percent higher than Euronext\u2019s own previous offer.The development drew assurances from Nasdaq, which said on Monday it remains committed to moving ahead with a deal after already winning the backing of the Oslo Bors board. But the U.S. exchange operator has so far stopped short of signaling it\u2019s ready to raise its price.Bente LandsnesBente Landsnes, the chief executive officer of Oslo Bors, said she and her team will now evaluate Euronext\u2019s new offer, but reiterated her view that Nasdaq remains a better strategic fit.Landsnes said an in-depth assessment has already led to the \u201cunanimous conclusion from our management and board\u201d [...] \u201cthat the Norwegian capital market and our companies will have a better future with an ownership of Nasdaq,\u201d in a phone interview.KLP and DNB, Oslo Bors\u2019s two biggest shareholders, said on Monday they want Nasdaq to succeed, underscoring the backing they already gave the U.S. firm last month.But the question is whether other shareholders in Oslo Bors will be content with a lower bid than the one Euronext just put on the table. As things stand now, Euronext has secured the backing of shareholders representing just over half Oslo Bors\u2019s stock, while Nasdaq has holders with about a third of the shares behind its offer.Oslo Bors directors were caught unawares on Christmas Eve -- a public holiday in Norway -- when Euronext announced it had won an auction held by an investment bank. Oslo Bors shareholders owning 25 percent of the company had hired the bank, Sweden\u2019s Carnegie, to find a bidder willing to take over the whole firm.Sneaky Tactics Can Win an M&A Battle, Not the War: Chris HughesBy the start of the year, Euronext, which operates stock exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam, had secured the support of 50.5 percent of Oslo Bors shareholders through a mixture of irrevocable commitments from shareholders and direct purchases of shares. Publishing its offer document on Feb. 4, Nasdaq revealed that it had control of 35.2 percent of Oslo Bors.Stephane Boujnah, the CEO of Euronext, said the firm is open to the idea of not being the sole owner of Oslo Bors. At a press conference on Monday, he said he was \u201chappy\u201d to discuss a model in which DNB and KLP could stay on as minority owners.Euronext is extending its offer period by four weeks to March 11. It also said it sees Oslo as a platform from which to expand its presence in the Nordic region. For its part, Nasdaq has argued that its dominance in the Nordic markets -- where it already operates exchanges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland -- make it a more natural fit for Oslo Bors.The rival bids will be assessed by Norway\u2019s markets regulator and, ultimately, the country\u2019s finance ministry, a process that could take months.The two bidders are in many ways similar companies. Both have a track record of successively running stock exchanges in multiple countries, yet neither have developed a derivatives market large enough to challenge European heavyweights London Stock Exchange Group Plc or Deutsche Boerse AG. Acquiring Oslo Bors will not change that fact for either company.\u2014 With assistance by Stephen Treloar, and Hanna Hoikkala ","17":"Shares have rebounded after their worst annual loss since 2008. Profit set to decline on cut to airport construction refund People walk through the departure hall at Terminal 2 of the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in Guangzhou, China.Optimism over a travel boom in southern China has fueled a surge in shares of China\u2019s third-biggest airport. But some analysts say the rally in Shanghai-listed Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport Co. will probably run out of steam soon.Baiyun Airport has gained 25 percent this year, outperforming a 20 increase in the broader A-share market. It was mainly fueled by bets that last year\u2019s 32 percent plunge was too steep. They also advanced on optimism a travel boom and China\u2019s plans to develop the Greater Bay area, where the airport is located, will drive traffic.Expectation of further increase in passenger traffic in Guangzhou, capital of the economic powerhouse of Guangdong province, may mean the stock still holds long-term investment value. But that confidence may have been overplayed in the short run because Baiyun is looking overvalued compared to its domestic peers, and its earnings outlook is clouded by a government decision to withdraw a refund for airport construction, analysts say.Despite the surge in Baiyun Airport\u2019s share prices, overseas investors have been selling the stock steadily in recent weeks. Foreign investors have sold 960 million yuan worth of the stock through the China-Hong Kong stock connect scheme as of Feb. 14 this year, the highest among all mainland stocks traded through the system.Morgan Stanley analyst Grace Li believes its current valuation is \"unjustified\" and the recent rally is overdone, given the market\u2019s pessimism about its fundamentals this year. \u201cIt is still early to turn positive on the stock because fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019 results may still surprise on the downside,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Grace Li wrote on Feb 17.This year\u2019s rally has driven Guangzhou airport\u2019s valuation premium above its peers. The stock is now trading at 25 times of its blended forward earnings estimate, the highest in more than 11 years. It\u2019s also higher than the 21 and 22 times for Shenzhen Airport Co. and Shanghai International Airport Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.Guangzhou Baiyun Airport is trading at a higher multiple compared to peersSource: Bloomberg\u201cThe rally came after all the bad news on the refund cut and added costs from the new terminal had been digested,\u201d said Karen Li, a Hong Kong-based analyst for JP Morgan Chase & Co. \u201cIts earnings will continue to feel the impact from the refund cut this year.\u201dGuangzhou Airport\u2019s net income fell 23 percent in 2018 and is set to drop a further 20 percent in 2019, according to 10 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares rose 0.57 percent in Shanghai to 12.40 yuan on Monday morning, against a more than 2 percent gain in the benchmark CSI 300 index.The refund, from fees collected from passengers for the construction of airports and other infrastructure projects, contributed to around 12 percent of the airport\u2019s annual revenue between 2015 and 2017, the company said in June 2018. It may receive up to 850 million yuan ($127 million) for 2018. The lack of such revenue will weigh on its earnings in 2019.While the stock\u2019s attractiveness may be limited in the near term, its allure may improve in the mid-term as earnings growth is expected to recover in 2020, according to JPMorgan\u2019s Li.China\u2019s top aviation hubs will also continue to benefit from the country\u2019s outbound travel boom. The Asian nation has been the world\u2019s biggest source of tourists for six years. Mainland travelers to overseas destinations jumped 14 percent last year despite an economic slowdown, according to China\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Growth is expected to remain at 11 percent for 2019, according to a study by China Tourism Academy.China Plan to Integrate Hong Kong, Macau Skirts Tough QuestionsLast week, the government unveiled a blueprint to develop China\u2019s southern coastline into a high-tech megalopolis rivaling California\u2019s Silicon Valley. The plan may also bolster Guangzhou Airport\u2019s position.JP Morgan\u2019s Li said China\u2019s airport stocks are appealing to investors in the long-run.\u201cThe stock is unlikely to have an absolute gain but if you take a buy-and-hold strategy, we are confident it can outperform the broader market,\u201d she said.\u2014 With assistance by Dong Lyu, Ludi Wang, and Cindy Wang ","18":"Raiffeisen International leads declines after Browder report. Dutch lenders, Deutsche Bank also fall amid more revelations Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.More European banks are being drawn into money-laundering allegations centered on dirty Russian money, adding to the scandal in an industry still recovering from the financial crisis.Initially centered on Danske Bank A\/S in Denmark and Sweden\u2019s Swedbank AB, allegations of suspicious transfers widened this week to include Raiffeisen Bank International AG in Austria and several Dutch institutions. Danske has lost half its market value since admitting its role in a money laundering scandal in 2016.The disclosures describe a network of banking relationships that was used to export funds from criminals in the former Soviet Union to western nations, often via Estonia and Lithuania. Investigations are under way in the Baltic nations, the U.S., the U.K. and the Nordic countries, but almost daily revelations suggest there are more surprises to come on the scale of the misconduct.Raiffeisen Bank International AG led declines in European banking shares on Tuesday -- slumping as much as 15 percent -- after Bill Browder\u2019s Hermitage Fund said the bank ignored warning signs that would have helped stop the laundering of funds from Russian criminal activity. Dutch banks fell after a report that the three largest were used to move cash from Russia.European banks drop amid laundromat allegations, Nordea reboundsSource: Bloomberg\nData shows biggest intraday drop or gain for the shareThe fresh allegations are based on files obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, or OCCRP, and 15min.lt, a Lithuanian website. They were reported by a number of participating media outlets and nicknamed Troika Laundromat because many of the shell companies involved in the transactions allegedly had ties to Troika Dialog, a Russian investment bank that was bought by state-owned Sberbank PJSC in 2012.Troika Dialog \u201cacted in full compliance with the highest international standards of transparency and financial reporting\u201d throughout its history, said the press office of Ruben Vardanyan, who led the firm for about two decades.The Troika Laundromat is the fourth scheme the group has uncovered, the others being the Proxy Platform, the Russian Laundromat, and the Azerbaijani Laundromat. The Guardian reported that the latest documents show an estimated $4.6 billion was sent to Europe and the U.S. from a Russian-operated network of 70 offshore companies with Lithuanian accounts. The paper said there\u2019s no suggestion that the end recipients of funds were aware of the source of the money. It\u2019s not clear what share of the transfers was illegitimate.Still, the new revelations and prior reports paint a picture of Nordic banks that, often via their Baltic units, became hubs for Russian criminals who channeled funds to the West. Nordea Bank Abp allegedly handled about 700 million euros ($793 million) in potentially dirty money, some of it linked to the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, according to Finnish broadcaster YLE on Monday.Julie GalboNordea Chief Risk Officer Julie Galbo said in an interview late on Monday that much of the allegations were already known publicly and the bank was trying to establish whether any were new. Any suspicious behavior would be reported to the authorities, she said.Accounts at the three largest Dutch banks were used by the Troika Laundromat to move cash from Russia, according to Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer. About 43 million euros were paid to the Rabobank account of Dutch yacht builder Heesen for construction of two boats, the newspaper said, while approximately 190 million euros went through bank accounts at an ABN Amro unit that later became part of Royal Bank of Scotland.All assets, data and clients of the unit became the legal responsibility of RBS in February 2008, according to an ABN Amro spokesman.

Mainland-based investors purchased a net $304 million of the shares through trading links with Hong Kong on Monday, according to exchange data. They were also net buyers in the days before China\u2019s regulators announced they had granted licenses to Tencent-made games on two occasions in January.Tencent has now rebounded almost 50 percent since its October low, buoyed by its first licenses to operate new games in China after the industry was hit by a shutout last year. Bullish technical signals, improving market sentiment for Chinese shares and a wave of buying from onshore investors have also helped, as well as optimism over the profitability of one of its titles.The speed of the recovery prompted a rare rating cut from Sinolink Securities Co.\u2019s Pei Pei, who urged caution on the stock as Tencent is still grappling with many of the challenges that contributed to last year\u2019s record-breaking rout.

The Vanguard Long-Term Bond ETF, ticker BLV, saw its largest daily outflow on record as over $470 million drained away, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Short-term and intermediate-term debt funds also lost more than $400 million apiece.Beacon is shifting back to 11 of Vanguard\u2019s sector ETFs after volatility late last year prompted the firm to sell stock funds and hole-up in debt, according to Chris Cook, the firm\u2019s president. The firm adheres to a rules-based strategy, and a 10 percent drop in its benchmark spurred the temporary move into debt ETFs, he said.\u201cWe had taken more of a risk-off position in December, and those trades have reversed,\u201d Cook said.More than $1.3 billion of large block trades in the three funds crossed the tape between 10:38 a.m. and 10:46 a.m. in New York on Tuesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In addition to BLV, millions of shares traded in the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond ETF and the Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF in a matter of minutes.

When it comes to trading shares of Nintendo Co., they\u2019re turning to a tiny research shop in a corner of Tokyo better known for used booksellers and guitar stores.Media Create Co. is the brainchild of Atsushi Hosokawa, a 63-year-old who got his start cold-calling video-game stores for information. His firm now tracks sales in Japan and other Asian countries, estimating shipments ahead of official company releases with enough precision that he\u2019s drawn more than two dozen hedge funds as clients. Last year, the company showed shipments of Nintendo\u2019s portable Switch console weren\u2019t growing as quickly as expected, helping make millions for clients who shorted the stock before the game maker cut its shipment target in January.Atsushi HosokawaHosokawa\u2019s 11-person firm is gaining prominence amid increasing disagreement over prospects for the Switch. Media Create\u2019s latest data show Nintendo should easily hit its revised target when it reports results next month, suggesting shares could get a much-needed boost after a dismal performance last year.\u201cOur data doesn\u2019t fail,\u201d Hosokawa said in his first interview in 10 years. \u201cThe Switch is still headed for growth in its third year.\u201dMedia Create is part of a burgeoning industry of specialist data providers that help investors make more informed bets on everything from stocks to commodities and currencies. The 25-year-old firm distinguishes itself through close relationships with about 2,000 gaming shops and dozens of publishers, which provide Hosokawa\u2019s analysts with weekly point-of-sale and shipment data on hardware and software in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.The data isn\u2019t comprehensive, but his analysts extrapolate with what Hosokawa calls \u201ckeikensoku.\u201d The term is usually translated in English as \u201crule of thumb,\u201d but it literally means \u201cmeasuring by experience.\u201d Clients pay $20,000 or more a year for reports that forecast local and international trends.Hosokawa, who also provides some key statistics for free every week on his website, said it is easier to predict global trends for Nintendo than rivals like Sony Corp. That\u2019s partly because Nintendo publishes a regional breakdown of Switch sales, according to Serkan Toto, founder of Tokyo-based consultancy Kantan Games Inc.Consumer research firms like Media Create focus more on sales than earnings, the purview of most financial analysts. Their findings can be particularly useful in the first few years after new console launches, when hardware adoption provides a strong signal for future profitability. Hosokawa\u2019s major competitor in Japan is Kadokawa Dwango Corp., which is also popular with investors. In the U.S., it is NPD Group.Hosokawa declined to name investors who use his service, but said client interest in Nintendo jumped in May as Media Create\u2019s data showed Switch sales were flat -- at odds with the market consensus for a more than 30 percent jump in the fiscal year ending this month. Around the same time, Nintendo\u2019s stock began sinking as hedge funds including Melvin Capital Management amassed large short positions.Switch sales growth picked up after the release of major titles Let\u2019s Go Pikachu and Eevee in November and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in December, but not nearly enough to reach Nintendo\u2019s annual target. The company ultimately cut the goal in January, sending shares plunging again.Melvin Capital\u2019s short bet would have made at least $67 million, based on Bloomberg calculations that assume the hedge fund still holds the position it disclosed in its last regulatory filing to the Tokyo Stock Exchange in August. The firm\u2019s Chief Operating Officer David Kurd declined to comment on trading in Nintendo.Nintendo shares were little changed in Tokyo on Monday and have gained 1.1 percent this year. Last year, the stock fell 29 percent, its worst annual performance since 2011.Despite the Switch\u2019s lackluster 2018, Hosokawa is upbeat about the hybrid gaming device. He expects hardware shipments to peak in the fiscal year that begins in April, implying Nintendo will sell more than the 17 million units it expects to ship in the current period. Wall Street analysts are divided, with some including UBS Group AG and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. expecting it to sell fewer units next period.Nintendo Switch game console.The Switch is selling strongly across all demographics -- from kids and teenagers to adults -- a feat achieved only by Nintendo\u2019s DS handheld device, its best-selling hardware product in history, Hosokawa said. That bodes well for long-term sales.\u201cWe expect its life-cycle to be seven years,\u201d he said, during an interview at Media Create\u2019s office in Tokyo\u2019s Jinbocho district. The quaint area, full of pre-war Japanese cafes, is popular with students and has been the setting for Japanese novels, including Haruki Murakami\u2019s Norwegian Wood.Hosokawa founded the company in 1994, the year the original PlayStation went on sale in Japan. Predicting that executives in the burgeoning game industry would need sales information to make decisions, he started building relationships with retail chains to ask for point-of-sale data. Over the past decade, investors also began subscribing. Today, he says Nintendo is the most sought-after company from hedge fund clients, which come from as far away as Singapore and New York.Media Create\u2019s free weekly data dumps have also made it a popular source for gamers, retail investors and arm-chair analysts online. Hosokawa said that is his way of giving back to the game industry, though he\u2019s unsure if the practice will continue after a company policy review next month.\u201cWith our data, we\u2019re trying to be the infrastructure for the whole industry,\u201d he said, explaining plans to expand his data collection to China and Southeast Asia. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that\u2019s why overseas investors trust us.\u201d ","22":"Internet users see a lighter regulatory hand in Yi Huiman. Yi agrees job is like being at mouth of volcano amid swings China\u2019s new chief securities regulator is quickly winning over investors, spurring online speculation that his reverence for markets and easy demeanor signal he\u2019ll employ a lighter touch than his predecessor.China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Yi Huiman kicked off his first press conference in Beijing on Wednesday with a call to \"revere the market, and respect and follow market patterns.\" That\u2019s a stark contrast with the stance of his predecessor Liu Shiyu, who stressed \"regulation according to the law, strict regulation and comprehensive regulation.\"Asked if running the CSRC was like \"standing at the mouth of a volcano,\" Yi chuckled and agreed.China stocks are in a rally so sudden that a bull market has materialized about a month after he took office. That\u2019s all the more surprising because they were among the worst performers in the world last year.One of Yi\u2019s major tasks is to professionalize the country\u2019s 148 million retail investors, a challenge highlighted by an inexplicable surge in stocks with the same Chinese character as his surname on the first trading day after his appointment. The Shanghai Composite has gained about 14 percent during his tenure, as he\u2019s lifted trading curbs meant to keep speculators in check and rallied support for a new trading venue in Shanghai for tech companies.Chinese Stocks That Sound Like Regulator\u2019s \u2018Easy\u2019 Name See Gains\"From Yi\u2019s debut, I feel like the regulators want to handle the market with care,\" a person using the alias \"Old Wang\u2019s Stock Stories\" said on Weibo, China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter. \"Only with enthusiasm in the market can the new tech and innovation board be achieved without extra effort.\"Yi\u2019s accommodating tone reflects in part the hand he was dealt after a bearish year for stocks. Liu became head of the CSRC in 2016, when the market was still recovering from the worst crash in decades, with a mandate to crack down on speculation.\"Yi\u2019s prime task is to launch the tech and innovation board, and for that to be successful, the market needs to pivot back to normal and have reinvigorated activity,\" said Daniel Xu, a fund manager at Beijing Eastern Smart Rock Asset Management Co. \"Liu Shiyu\u2019s job was to put an end to financial corruption.\"Jokingly alluding to Liu\u2019s attempts to soothe the market in October last year by saying that \"Spring is not far away,\" another Weibo user remarked, \"Now I\u2019m getting a strong whiff of Spring.\"\u2014 With assistance by April Ma, and Lucille Liu ","23":" From Australia up to Japan and across to India, Asia\u2019s $9 trillion benchmark stock index already trades through plenty of time zones in the region, but here\u2019s an interesting quirk: A sizable chunk of the group doesn\u2019t even start trading until long after most investors have gone home.Internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. headline a group of almost two dozen MSCI Asia Pacific Index members, many of them based in China, that trade in the U.S. The companies have a combined market value of more than $790 billion, accounting for about a 5 percent weighting in the benchmark -- enough to have an impact on the overall direction of the gauge while most traders in the region are in bed.Case in point: Once New York came online, the gauge finished off Tuesday little changed after trading down as much as 0.6 percent during Asian hours. That was thanks to strong quarterly results from Shanghai-based travel booking site Ctrip.com International Ltd.Its American Depositary Receipts surged 20 percent in the U.S., the best one-day performance since October 2015, on trading that was more than eight times its daily average over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rally sparked at least seven analyst upgrades.Another member of the Asia Pacific contingent, live streaming platform YY Inc., also jumped 13 percent for its biggest gain since November 2017 as fourth-quarter revenue beat estimates. Benchmark analyst Fawne Jiang maintained her buy rating, noting opportunities in both game live streaming and e-sports markets.The situation underscores the intense competition for listings between exchanges in Asia and attractive alternate venues overseas, particularly in New York.Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. has been aggressive in its attempts to attract major technology company listings back to the region, including pushing through the biggest change to its initial public offering rules in two decades last year to allow dual-class share structures. The change came several years after the exchange lost out on the Alibaba listing in 2014.Also Read: China\u2019s Tech Giants Seek More From Hong Kong Despite IPO ChangesThere are risks to this strategy, especially for investors concerned the rights of shareholders will be compromised the more exchanges bend to the will of prospective listings.

With the S&P 500 on track for its worst week of 2019, here\u2019s what strategists are saying about the unemployment report.Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco:\u201cThe February jobs report was abysmal in terms of non-farm payroll but we have to put it in the context of incredibly strong January nonfarm payrolls. However, that is not going to be solace to investors, who have been put on alert by dramatic changes in monetary policy stances by first the Fed and then the Bank of Canada and most recently the European Central Bank. This jobs report will only amplify market worries.\u201dSameer Samana, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\u201cIf the weakness continues next month and there\u2019s no revision to this month, it\u2019s a meaningful deceleration in the outlook for the labor market. Given what happened in the fourth quarter, it could be that companies now are at this point at least deciding to really curtail hiring. If there\u2019s going to be all these uncertainties around trade, politics, possibly taxes as we head into the 2020 election cycle, it could be corporations are going look, \u2018I really need to in a more meaningful way start to prepare for the next downturn.\u201d\u2019\u201cIt\u2019ll probably put downward pressure on stocks, it\u2019ll probably put downward pressure on interest rates. For the dollar, we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but Europe is pretty weak too, so it could be overtime the dollar continues to do OK. And then you\u2019re starting to see gold do better and that\u2019s probably a two-part concern. One, it\u2019s probably concern about a slowdown, and then two, it\u2019s at least speculation around when and if central banks may become even easier. We\u2019re at patient right now, but it could be they start to shift from patient to possibly cutting.

You\u2019re seeing this push-pull between dovish monetary policy and deteriorating economic trend. Economic fundamentals will eventually win out, and investors are aware of that.

It\u2019s not like people weren\u2019t expecting job creation to slow down, so I think that it\u2019s not that shocking that maybe it is a little bit, but if you average out the payroll number and the household number, it comes in at a fairly decent gain.\u2019\u2019\u201cIt will become a neutral report here, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting around this market right now. We\u2019re getting a mixed bag of bad reports and good reports...at the end of the day, the most you can say out of all of this data is the economy has slowed, which we know, but it\u2019s probably not falling off a cliff, which is also an important part of this. So I think the stock market reaction is not a lot, it was already down quite a bit before this report came out, it hasn\u2019t moved a lot more. I think as the day wears on, it\u2019s going to have more to do with the failing at 4 times at 2800 on the S&P and technicals than it will about these reports.\u2019\u2019\u2014 With assistance by Elena Popina ","25":"Chinese stocks rose after MSCI boosted weighting in EM index.

Policy makers will release updated quarterly projections for interest rates as well as inflation, growth and employment when they gather March 19-20.\u201cThe February CPI results appear to corroborate the recent dovish sentiment toward the inflation outlook expressed by a number of policy makers. However, Bloomberg Economics is not yet convinced that inflation is set to trend sideways or lower. The latest jobs report showed labor costs, as measured by average hourly earnings, running at a cyclical high.\u201d-- Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, U.S. economistsClick here for the full note.The Fed has a 2 percent target for a separate inflation gauge from the Commerce Department that\u2019s linked to consumer spending. That index tends to run slightly below the Labor Department\u2019s CPI, and January figures are due March 29.The CPI report showed prices of new vehicles fell for the first time in four months while used-car prices dropped 0.7 percent from January, the biggest drop since September.Prescription-drug prices fell 1 percent on a monthly basis, the most on record, bringing the annual decline to 1.2 percent -- the largest drop since 1972. Such figures give President Donald Trump another opportunity to claim credit for lower pharmaceutical prices, an issue that he\u2019s recently tweeted about several times.Shelter costs, which account for about a third of CPI and mainly include housing expenses, continued to hold up, with the fourth straight monthly increase of 0.3 percent. Owners-equivalent rent, one of the categories designed to track rental prices, rose 0.3 percent, as did rent of primary residence.The slowdown in overall inflation is giving Americans more spending power. A separate Labor Department report on Tuesday showed that average hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.9 percent in February from a year earlier. That compares with 1.6 percent in the previous month and is the fastest pace since 2015.\u2014 With assistance by Kristy Scheuble, Sophie Caronello, and Carlyann Edwards Economists had forecast a 0.2 percent gain in the monthly core gauge and a 2.2 percent annual advance.Apparel prices rose 0.3 percent from the prior month as men\u2019s and boys\u2019 apparel had a record increase of 3.4 percent, while women\u2019s apparel fell 1.6 percent, the most in almost a year.Energy prices rose 0.4 percent, the first increase in four months, as gasoline prices advance 1.5 percent. Food costs gained 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since 2014.Expenses for medical care fell 0.2 percent, the biggest decline since 2013; these readings often vary from results for this category within the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation due to different methodologies. ","29":"Software update available for iPhones, iPads and other devices. Flaw let people hear, see other caller before they answered Apple Inc. on Thursday released a software update for iPhones and its other devices to fix a bug that let users of its FaceTime video-chat service listen in on people before they accepted or rejected the call.The renewed software, labeled as iOS 12.1.4, can be installed on Apple mobile devices in the Software Update tab under Settings. Apple also released a macOS Mojave 10.14.3 update that fixes the bug for Mac computer users. The glitch occurred when a user created a FaceTime conference call, put in a phone number, and then added another person\u2019s number. The flaw also happened when the other user clicked their power button or one of the volume controls.Cupertino, California-based Apple mitigated the problem last Monday by remotely disabling Group FaceTime. The company apologized on Friday, and said the software update would be released this week.The bug was a black eye for Apple, which has made privacy and security key selling points for its devices. Last week, the company temporarily pulled important app-development tools from Google and Facebook Inc. after deciding the two companies broke its rules in monitoring users\u2019 web traffic.New York officials seized on the FaceTime flaw and said they will investigate the company\u2019s failure to warn consumers about the bug and its slow response. On Tuesday, the leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its subcommittee on consumer protection called the flaw \u201ca significant privacy violation\" and sent questions to Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook about the issue.Cook regularly criticizes internet companies for tracking people\u2019s digital activities for advertising purposes. And yet, Apple takes billions of ad dollars each year from Google\u2019s search business, which is based on harvesting personal data.For years, Apple let outside app developers access, store, share, and sell users\u2019 contact data, often without the consent of those people. Apple quietly closed that loophole last year.Group FaceTime calling was a key feature in last fall\u2019s iOS 12 software update, which comes with the latest iPhones and iPads. Apple is planning an iOS 13 update for later this year with a redesigned home screen for iPads and a dark mode for better nighttime viewing. Apple shares slipped 1.8 percent in New York trading on Thursday. The stock is up more than 8 percent so far this year.  ","30":" A public-company chief executive officer has two main ways to make money from her job each year:A company could go with all one or the other, and some companies do: A family-owned company\u00a0might hire an outside manager, give her no equity, and pay her purely in cash; a startup founder-CEO might take\u00a0no salary and be motivated solely by her part-ownership of the company. But for most normal public companies, it\u2019s a mix of the two.It is a convention, in discussing public-company executive compensation, to talk exclusively about #1 and ignore #2. The compensation\u00a0package\u2014the amount of stuff the company affirmatively grants her each year for doing her job\u2014counts as \u201cpay\u201d; the amount that her wealth goes up from owning stock in her company usually does not. This is mostly just a convention, a generally accepted way of using words, and it is not universally followed, but\u00a0there are some pretty good reasons for talking this way.\u00a0It roughly tracks how tax law thinks about income\u00a0(getting a check is income; having your stock go up is not). If the CEO\u00a0quit her job, she would still own her stock and would thus still profit from the stock going up (though of course it might not go up as much), so isolating #1 focuses on her income that is purely job-related. And\u00a0if you are interested not in her income but in the company\u2019s expenses\u2014not \u201chow rich is the CEO\u201d but \u201chow much does she cost shareholders\u201d\u2014#1 is a reasonable approximation of that, while #2 is not really an expense at all.But you can\u2019t get carried away and assume that this convention represents the entire truth of the matter, because then you might start thinking things like \u201cwait, Warren Buffett only makes $100,000 a year for running Berkshire Hathaway Inc.? He\u2019s so good at stock-picking; I should offer him $125,000 and have him come work for me.\u201d (Or: \u201cMark Zuckerberg only makes $1 a year for running Facebook Inc.? I should offer him $3 to stop.\u201d) No, come on, these people have vast amounts of wealth tied to the performance of their companies; Warren Buffett gets, in effect, a base salary of $100,000 and a bonus of 17 percent of the value he creates for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. In good years, that comes to\u00a0billions of dollars: Berkshire was up 23 percent in 2016, handily beating the S&P 500, and Buffett\u00a0personally got about $14 billion richer. In mediocre years, it \u2026\u00a0also comes to billions of dollars: Berkshire was up 2.8 percent in 2018 (also handily beating the market, to be fair), and Buffett\u2019s take came to more than $2.3 billion. That is not formally part of his pay package, but it is surely part\u2014virtually all\u2014of the economic reward\u00a0that he receives for doing his job each day.I feel like we don\u2019t quite have a convention for how to talk about hedge-fund-manager pay, but to the extent we do, it\u2019s the opposite of the public-company convention: Every dollar of increased wealth that a hedge fund manager gets from her hedge fund, whether it\u2019s a fee paid by investors or returns on her own investment in the hedge fund, tends to be discussed as \u201cpay.\u201d There is nothing particularly wrong with this convention either! Again, it is just a question of how you use words, and there are good arguments for talking this way too. For instance, if you want to answer questions like \u201chow many world-historically  expensive  homes\u00a0can Ken Griffin buy,\u201d focusing solely on his fee income, rather than his investment income, would be a mistake. It\u2019s all money. More broadly, if the question that you want to answer is \u201cwho is really good at running a hedge fund,\u201d a quite plausible scoring mechanism would be to rank managers based on how much money they have made\u2014both as a manager and as an investor\u2014from their hedge funds. High investment returns mean that you are good at investing; high fee income means that you are good at gathering assets and extracting fees from them; those are the main skills, so why not add them together to get your score?But, again, you can\u2019t get carried away. If you are counting the manager\u2019s own investment returns as part of her income, which is perfectly reasonable and relevant, you can\u2019t also\u00a0pretend that the number you get is all fees. And so every year Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha publishes a list of the world\u2019s \u201cbest-paid\u201d hedge fund managers, and every year Alpha quite prominently explains that it is counting both fee income and investment returns, and every year people publish commentary on the list saying essentially \u201cI can\u2019t believe all of these hedge-fund managers got paid so many millions of dollars of fees despite not beating the market, what a grift,\u201d and every\u00a0year\u00a0I  publish a  post saying, well, wait, actually, the income seems to be mostly investment\u00a0returns on the managers\u2019 own portion of the fund, meaning that it\u2019s not fee income at all, and then we all agree to meet up next year and have the same conversation again.Today Bloomberg  published its first ranking of hedge-fund-manager earnings. It too ranks managers based on total earnings, combining fees and investment returns; again, I think this is perfectly sensible, depending on what you want to measure. Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies tops the list for 2018, making $1.6 billion in \u201ctotal hedge fund income.\u201d\n            \n\n                1\n            \n        \u00a0Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, Ken Griffin of Citadel, and John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma round out the top 5.\u00a0But Bloomberg also disaggregates the numbers:To compile the ranking, Bloomberg broke out \u201ctotal income\u201d figures to show estimates of dividend income and return on personal assets. Dividend income is our calculation of the share of performance fees that the manager takes home as owner of the hedge fund. Return on personal assets is our estimate of how much managers earned on their own cash invested in their funds.(It does not count  management fees, assuming I suppose that those are mostly spent on staff and expenses.) And there\u2019s a little bar chart breaking down the splits. Most of the top 10 made the majority of their 2018 earnings\u00a0from investment returns, though fees were usually a substantial contributor. Not always:\u00a0\u201cMichael Platt of Bluecrest Capital Management returned 25 percent, although hedge fund investors didn\u2019t benefit after he kicked out clients,\u201d and his\u00a0$680 million of earnings is all investment returns.\n            \n\n                2\n            \n        \u00a0But from Bloomberg\u2019s chart, the top five total earners were also the top five fee earners, and in almost\u00a0the same order,\n            \n\n                3\n            \n        \u00a0which is sensible but also a bit boring. Really 2018 was an anomalously straightforward year for hedge funds: The stock market was down, most hedge funds  did poorly, but the hedge funds that did well were disproportionately the big, old,  historically successful ones. If you have run a gigantic hedge fund successfully for a long time, and\u00a0it did well in 2018, then (1) you collected a lot of performance fees on your gigantic pot of assets, and (2) you had a lot of your own money in the fund, and it went up. That\u2019s not how it works every year, but it is kind of how it\u2019s supposed to work.My usual role around here is to tell you about interesting financial things that have happened, or to argue that boring financial things that have happened are actually interesting, or at least to make fun of dumb financial things that have happened. Occasionally though, we indulge in a bit of speculative fiction and talk about how nice it would be if some really interesting financial thing had happened, even though it didn\u2019t. Here is a Vanity Fair story about Jeff Bezos, an extramarital affair, nude selfies, politics, the National Enquirer, etc., but I just\u00a0want to focus on this amazing passage about what might have been:One option even included Bezos buying A.M.I.\u2014not such an outlandish consideration given the seriousness of the breach and the fact that, for Bezos, the price of the tabloid company is essentially a rounding error\u2014to find out the source of the leak. \u201cWe discussed the possibility to buy A.M.I.\u2014not to kill the story, but to find out the source. They said that\u2019s not a bad idea. We discussed numbers and the name of the LLC that we\u2019d use. It would be called BOBO LCC\u201d\u2014short for Lauren\u2019s helicopter filming company, Black Ops, and Bezos\u2019s space company, Blue Origin\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s the level of detail we went into.\u201dQuick explainer: The National Enquirer, a tabloid owned by American Media Inc., acquired some embarrassing photos of Amazon.com Inc. founder and squazillionaire Jeff Bezos, and of\u00a0Lauren Sanchez, with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Sanchez\u2019s brother Michael has been accused of leaking the photos to the Enquirer, though he denied that in the Vanity Fair article. (\u201cI\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t do\u00a0something,\u201d he says, though.) The quote in that paragraph is from Michael Sanchez, and he is describing a discussion that he\u00a0had with Bezos and Lauren Sanchez last month after the National Enquirer started asking about their affair. One possibility they apparently considered\u00a0was for Bezos to buy AMI,\u00a0not kill the story\u00a0(???), and I suppose, once in possession of AMI\u2019s records, find out who leaked the information to the Enquirer.Now:But I think I am justified in saying: Never mind all of that, let\u2019s just imagine if it had happened! Imagine if a tabloid owned by a public company threatened to publish nudes of Jeff Bezos, and Jeff Bezos just lobbed in a hostile bid\u2014funded by his personal fortune, not by Amazon\u2014to buy the publisher at a premium. He would have to put out a tender-offer disclosure document, and in the \u201cPurpose of the Offer\u201d section he would just write\u00a0\u201crevenge,\u201d and in the \u201cPlans for the Target\u201d section he could write \u201cI am going to find out who leaked my nudes and exact ruinous vengeance on them, and that\u2019s it, I haven\u2019t thought about any other plans.\u201d And then management and Bezos would make their respective cases to shareholders: Management and its investment bankers would put together a detailed slide deck explaining their long-term business plans and financial projections, while Bezos would put out two slides, one saying \u201cVengeance Will Be Mine\u201d over\u00a0that picture of him looking buff in a vest, and the other printing the price of his all-cash offer in a really big font. And then management\u2019s investment bankers would issue an opinion saying that Bezos\u2019s offer was inadequate and he\u2019d be like \u201cfine double it then,\u00a0I don\u2019t care, how much could a newspaper publisher possibly cost, do you know how rich I am.\u201d And politicians would rail against short-termism in corporate America, and point to the fact that valuable productive companies could be bought by corporate raiders just to strip them down to a single piece of information, and Bezos would be like \u201cyes that\u2019s true but have you considered how much money I have.\u201dAnd then he\u2019d win, of course, and he\u2019d gain control of the company and install his board, and they\u2019d appoint a new Bezos loyalist CEO, and Bezos would show up at the office and be like \u201cokay who\u2019s my leaker,\u201d and he and the new CEO would call every employee in one by one to grill them\u00a0until someone told him what he wanted to know. And then he\u2019d go, you know, write a withering blog post about the leaker or whatever his plan was.But then there\u2019d still be a whole company there! Like he bought this company just to ask one question and\u00a0exact his\u00a0amazing personal revenge, but meanwhile there are all the reporters and editors and printers and people who work in accounting, and they all show up to work to be grilled about the leaker, but then after that, like, they just \u2026\u00a0go on producing a tabloid \u2026\u00a0for an owner whose \u2026\u00a0only interest in it has passed? Like I guess he could sell it then, for some fraction of what he paid for it, but what\u2019s the fun in that? Or he could shut it down out of spite, fine, but that seems wasteful. Maybe he could keep running the tabloid, but dedicate it\u00a0exclusively to publishing mean stories about the person who leaked his nudes.Anyway corporate finance is amazing, but the point here is that it could so easily be so much more amazing.Oh also Amazon  won\u2019t be building a big new office in New York.The way appraisal lawsuits work is that a company agrees to buy another company, and pays for it, and some shareholders of the target\u00a0vote against the deal and sue the buyer for more money. They go to a Delaware Chancery Court judge and argue that the target was worth more than the buyer paid for it; the buyer argues that it was worth what it paid, or even less. And then the judge decides how much it was worth and orders the buyer to pay that amount. It\u2019s  kind of  weird! A lot of corporate finance is, you know, willing buyers and willing sellers, negotiated transactions, etc., but then at the end of a merger,\u00a0you go to a judge and he gets to decide if the market was right or wrong.The way he decides is mostly that each side has a valuation expert to say how much the company was worth, and then the judge makes a decision about\u00a0which one was more persuasive. These valuation experts tend to be finance professors, hired by the parties\u00a0through economic consulting firms, who do discounted cash flow analyses of the company to come up with their values; the judge will generally take the more compelling DCF as a starting point for his own valuation.You might expect there to be a sorting\u00a0process in which the plaintiffs hire an expert who believes that the company was undervalued and the defendants hire an expert who doesn\u2019t. Or yes fine fine fine you might instead expect there to be an entirely cynical process in which each side hires an expert who doesn\u2019t believe anything, but who says whatever they want for a fee.\u00a0But it could be worse!\u00a0When Verizon Communications Inc. bought AOL Inc. in 2015, some shareholders sued for appraisal. Last year they lost that lawsuit, when Delaware Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III ruled that the fair value of AOL was $48.70 per share, a bit below\u00a0the deal price of $50. The vice chancellor wrote at the time:The Petitioners hired a well-qualified academic, Dr. Bradford Cornell, a visiting professor at the California Institute of Technology, as their expert witness. Cornell performed a financial analysis, and concluded that the fair value of AOL stock was $68.98 per share.\u00a0For reasons not necessary to detail, however, the Respondent questioned Dr. Cornell\u2019s impartiality in this matter, and the Petitioners seem content to use the DCF model presented by the Respondent\u2019s expert as a starting point for my analysis.\u00a0Oh but no, those reasons are necessary to detail, and a few weeks ago\u00a0the shareholders\u00a0detailed them, in a new hilarious lawsuit\u00a0against their own expert:What [Cornell] failed to disclose was that Cornell had only taken on the engagement for Plaintiffs [i.e. the shareholders] to satisfy an admitted \u201cgrudge\u201d he held against Plaintiffs\u2019 litigation opponent [i.e. Verizon], which had spurned hiring Cornell in favor of a competing testifying expert. While trying to solicit Plaintiffs\u2019 litigation opponent, Cornell expressed negative views about the strength of Plaintiffs\u2019 case. Plaintiffs and their counsel knew none of this when they retained him.When Cornell\u2019s undisclosed communications surfaced in the midst of the Appraisal Action\u2014after Plaintiffs had disclosed Cornell as their expert and expert reports were issued\u2014the consequences for Plaintiffs were devastating. The disclosure of these communications effectively destroyed Cornell\u2019s testimony, which forced Plaintiffs to essentially abandon him as their expert \u2026It seems that Cornell (who is a visiting professor of finance at Caltech) pitched Verizon on retaining him as an expert, and allegedly sympathized with Verizon over email about \u201cwhat a nuisance these [appraisal] cases can be.\u201d\u00a0But they went with his colleague\/competitor\/frenemy, Professor Daniel Fischel, who was associated with the same economic consulting firm as Cornell. So Cornell switched consulting firms and pitched his services to the appraisal plaintiffs, but not before\u00a0sending Fischel this email\n            \n\n                4\n            \n        :Dan,Like you I tend to bear grudges. And though I see you as perhaps the best general expert witness in the country, when it comes to appraisal, particularly for tech companies, I think I am uniquely well qualified. So when Verizon\/Wachtell chose you without even talking to me further that leads to a grudge against them.\u00a0Consequently, I have had some conversations with plaintiffs. \u2026Later he allegedly told Fischel that his \u201cmain concern is that plaintiffs have a [expletive] case (that is not based on conversation just what I have read online) so I will have to be careful to avoid letting my grudge lead to a situation where I threaten my reputation.\u201d Well: oops!\u00a0Anyway there are absolutely no broader lessons to be learned here\n            \n\n                5\n            \n        \u00a0and I am telling you all of this out of pure gleeful cynicism. I had a professor in law school whose theory was that any bitter lawsuit over seemingly trivial stakes was really about a love triangle, but it is pleasing to find that a high-stakes litigation over a multi-billion-dollar merger could turn on a valuation expert who was miffed that the other side didn\u2019t hire him.We  talked the other day about how Banco Santander SA did not call its Additional Tier 1 Capital securities when investors expected it to, leaving those investors outraged and stuck holding securities worth, um, 98 cents on the dollar. I was fine with all of this: Santander had an absolute right not to call the securities, and taking the holders\u2019 concerns seriously\u00a0would undermine the usefulness of AT1 securities as bank capital. \u201cI struggle to find any reason to sympathize with the investors here,\u201d I wrote.But I neglected to mention one actually decent reason to sympathize with them, which is that Santander had\u00a0just gone out and raised\u00a0another\u00a0AT1 security days before the expected call date on this one. If you were an investor in Santander\u2019s old bond, you might reasonably have thought that Santander was raising the new AT1 to pay to retire the old AT1, and you might have participated in the new AT1 deal\u00a0expecting that you\u2019d quickly get some money back from your old AT1. Santander didn\u2019t exactly say that that was the plan, but it was a reasonable guess, and if you thought that\u00a0then you got played. So, fine, a little sympathy.One aspect of the new AT1 that particularly made investors expect a call of the old one is that the new AT1 had a  short settlement cycle, meaning that Santander would get the cash from the new offering a bit quicker than it normally would. Investors sensibly thought that this was so that Santander would have the cash in time\u00a0to pay off the old AT1. But in fact that guess was wrong,\u00a0for\u00a0this very strange reason:The bond also had an unusually short settlement date of two days, meaning that Santander would have the money in its hands last Friday \u2014 which investors believed was the bank\u2019s deadline for calling the coco. This is because a notice had to be filed 30 days before March 12, which fell on a Sunday.But the bank then told investors that they actually had until Tuesday February 12 to make a decision. This is because the bank had legal advice that 30 days should be interpreted as a month, disregarding that there are 28 days in February.None of this actually mattered, in the end, since Santander never exercised the call. Still: what? When bonds don\u2019t work out for investors, in ways that are explicitly allowed by the documents, it is tempting to say\u2014and I often succumb to the temptation\u2014\u201chahaha, that\u2019s on you, you should have read the documents.\u201d Here, for instance, Santander\u2019s AT1 explicitly said that Santander\u00a0never\u00a0has to pay it back, though it could at its option decide to pay it back this month; investors who interpreted that to mean \u201cSantander will definitely pay it back this month\u201d were, I insist, only deluding themselves. Read the documents!On the other hand, if you\u00a0did\u00a0read the documents, you would have seen that Santander had to call the AT1 30 days in advance. But Santander\u2019s lawyers said\u2014and for all I know they\u2019re right\u2014that, nah, 30 days actually means 28 days. Reading the very clear words (and numbers) in the document would have gotten you nowhere, would have actively misled you, because the words apparently mean something other than what they say.NYSE goes to court to halt SEC plan.

EC seeks to challenge role of U.S. dollar in energy markets Intercontinental Exchange Inc. says its Dutch natural gas market has the potential to become a world beater in energy trading.When the owner of the New York Stock Exchange bought an energy bourse in Amsterdam seven years ago, the Netherlands was just one of several regional markets dominated by the U.K. But roles reversed as the region increased imports and utilities adopted contracts in euros to peg imports from Russia, Norway and far-flung places via liquefied natural gas tankers.And with Brexit curbing U.K. activity, trade on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility, as the market is known, is surging. Volumes have jumped 13-fold in the past four years on ICE Endex and TTF has cemented its position as Europe\u2019s most important hub for the fuel.But ICE, which took control of the Brent futures contract when it bought the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001, has loftier ambitions than that. The company is seeking to develop the market into a global benchmark akin to the crude marker, said Gordon Bennett, ICE\u2019s managing director of utility markets.And while the value of open positions on its gas market is today only about 5 percent of its Brent contract, volume is far from peaking, he says.\u201cIt will become more important,\u201d said Bert den Ouden, who founded the company that sold its Endex unit in 2012 to ICE and is now managing director for energy at consultant Berenschot Holding BV. \u201cIt was already clear at that point LNG would become very important.\u201dNetherlands TTF contract volumeICE EndexThe fuel has since the 1960s been linked to U.S.-dollar denominated oil in sales contracts, but the emergence of the Dutch market as the regional benchmark enabled utilities to seize more control over how they pay for the many billions of euros of gas imported every year.Utilities from EON SE to Engie SA have reworked contracts through arbitration with Russia\u2019s Gazprom PJSC to insert links to European gas prices. New LNG deals are also increasingly referencing the Dutch market and TTF is now used in Asian trades, too.And while the euro is gaining prominence in energy trading, less than a fifth of the European Union\u2019s 300 billion-euro ($339 billion) annual oil and gas bill is priced in the regional currency. The EU is trying to boost the use of the currency in everything from commodities to foodstuffs and transport to make companies less prone to international disputes and easier to finance, the commission said in December.ICE Endex is also making its market more attractive. The futures curve was in June extended by a year so that traders can buy and sell as long as six years in advance. That\u2019s still short of the 10 years offered in the U.S. Henry Hub market, and Bennett expects to add even more contracts in the future to meet customer demand.To be sure, about three quarters of mainland Europe\u2019s gas trades are still handled bilaterally between brokers, according to data published last month by Trayport Ltd., the main trading platform.But a surge in LNG output from the Americas is providing a big opportunity for TTF. Almost a fifth of European supply has come from the U.S. in the past three months, an unprecedented number.And for U.S. sellers, the two primary basins to supply are Europe and Asia, and the price difference between Asian spot and hub prices in Europe will shape where their volumes are directed, said Macquarie Group Ltd. oil and gas analyst David Hewitt.\u201cThe prevailing TTF price environment this year will be an important focus for the global LNG sector,\u201d he said.Other hubs will remain contenders. U.S. futures trade advanced about 6 percent to a record last year on CME Group Inc.\u2019s Henry Hub, based on aggregate monthly futures. Transactions in ICE\u2019s JKM contact in Asia rose to a record in January, but it\u2019s a lot less liquid than its Dutch market.ICE began offering on March 4 options for its Japan-Korea Marker LNG (Platts) contracts, the exchange group said today in an emailed statement.Having a global price for gas only makes sense if the various regional markets are more integrated, according to Tor Martin Anfinnsen, senior vice president for marketing and supply at Equinor ASA of Norway, Europe\u2019s second-biggest supplier. \u201cI think we are nowhere near that.\u201d No one hub will \u201creign supreme,\u201d he said.And TTF\u2019s position in Europe isn\u2019t completely unassailable, according to both Macquarie and Equinor. Germany\u2019s plans to build out infrastructure with LNG terminals and a second pipe from Russia opening by the end of this year could spur more trade and potentially challenge the Dutch market.Still, ICE\u2019s Bennett isn\u2019t too worried. Germany, while bigger in terms of consumption, remains much smaller than TTF in terms of traded volume. And it\u2019s fragmented over several exchanges.\u201cThe horse has already bolted,\u201d Bennett said.\u2014 With assistance by Anna Shiryaevskaya, and Rob Verdonck ","32":"Advisers said to make case of stock market rally on China deal. President looking for win after abandoning North Korea talks President Donald Trump is pushing for U.S. negotiators to close a trade deal with China soon, concerned that he needs a big win on the international stage -- and the stock market bump that would come with it -- in advance of his re-election campaign.As trade talks with China advance, Trump has noticed the market gains that followed each sign of progress and expressed concern that the lack an agreement could drag down stocks, according to people familiar with the matter. He watched U.S. and Asian equities rise on his decision to delay an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods scheduled for March 1, one of the people said.The world\u2019s two largest economies are moving closer to a final agreement that could end their almost year-long trade war, an outcome that would also provide a boost to his efforts to seek reelection in 2020. A new trade accord that would provide Trump with a much-needed win after the collapse of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Donald Trump on March 4.Trump, who met with his trade team Monday, has expressed interest in hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping for a signing ceremony on a deal as soon as this month. His enthusiasm for a pact could shape crucial decisions such as balancing Chinese pressure to lift tariffs immediately against trade hawks\u2019 arguments to initially maintain duties as leverage to assure good behavior by Beijing.Trump\u2019s fixation on stock-market performance has shaped his assessments of his economic policies. Top White House staff know to be aware of how markets are performing when summoned to the Oval Office to speak with Trump because the president often asks: \u2018\u2018What\u2019s happening with the markets?\u2019\u2019Advocates of concluding a deal within the administration have seized on that fixation to bolster their case, one person said.Trump\u2019s economic team has told him an agreement will unleash a market rally, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Advocates of a compromise with China have also told Trump it is crucial to cut a deal soon to reap the full boost ahead of the election because benefits such as more Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans and other products will have a delayed impact and take time to reverberate through the economy, they said.The White House communications staff declined to comment.The trade war between the two nations has weighed on the stock market, with Renaissance Macro Research concluding that the S&P 500 would be 11 percent higher without the impact of the feud. Still, U.S. stocks have regained most of their losses from the autumn when investors were more pessimistic about trade prospects.Some investors say a deal isn\u2019t likely to have a major impact because it\u2019s already mostly priced into the market as a result of the recent positive signals from the administration. On the other hand, failure risks roiling stocks.\u201cThe risk could be more to the downside, but on the other hand this would take away some uncertainty and that is good for companies looking to invest,\u201d said Sebastien Page, head of global multi-asset strategy at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. \u201cIf we get a meaningful trade deal, there is some upside scenarios for emerging market stocks.\u201dU.S. equity futures slipped, European shares firmed and Asian benchmarks were mixed Wednesday, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all declining as reports showed the U.S. trade deficit widened in 2018.China is also tempering expectations.\u201cChina\u2019s concessions probably won\u2019t be very big because a lot of their demands are what we already plan to reform,\u201d former finance minister Lou Jiwei said in Beijing on Wednesday, calling some U.S. demands for change \"unreasonable.\"Chuck Schumer on March 5.Inside the White House, key economic advisers including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow are eager for a quick resolution to the trade conflict, while trade hawks such as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has taken a tougher line with China.Trump is facing pressure from both parties in Congress, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in a floor speech on Tuesday cautioning the president not to settle for a weak deal with China.\u201cBut now, when you\u2019re getting close to a victory, to relent at the eleventh hour, without achieving meaningful, enforceable, and verifiable structural reform to China\u2019s trade policies would be an abject failure of the president\u2019s China policies and people will shrug their shoulders and say what the heck did he begin this for if he won\u2019t complete it,\u201d Schumer said.\u2014 With assistance by Jenny Leonard ","33":"SunTrust doesn\u2019t like the combination; sees risk for FIS. Global Payments, Adyen may gain as M&A; will distract rivals Fidelity National Information Services Inc. and Worldpay Inc. pared earlier gains in Monday trading, as analysts question FIS\u2019s\u00a0pact to acquire\u00a0Worldpay Inc.\u00a0for about $34 billion in cash and stock, worth about $112.12 per share as of Friday\u2019s close.Analysts wondered why Worldpay agreed to be bought at that price, instead of trying to get more out of its 2017 merger with Vantiv Inc., and doubted FIS\u2019s move was much more than a response to Fiserv Inc. and First Data Corp. combining.Worldpay rose about 10 percent and FIS fell around 0.1 percent after executives touted accelerated revenue growth and cost savings.The deal seems like a direct reaction to the Fiserv and First Data deal, Jeffrey wrote in a note. \u201cWe do not initially like this combination,\u201d as the \u201cstrategic merits elude us.\u201d That\u2019s partly because FIS is adding \u201cU.S. big box retail exposure and long-term ISV channel risk,\u201d even as it buys \u201ca faster growing company in a secular growth industry, which is a positive.\u201dJeffrey adds that Worldpay shares have been trading \u201cstrongly,\u201d begging the question of why management would sell at just a 13 percent premium, \u201cparticularly considering apparent momentum in its technology segment.\u201dHe sees Global Payments as potentially the biggest beneficiary of the proposed combination, as it would have \u201ctwo large global rivals which will likely be distracted and pursuing relatively larger customers.\u201d He doesn\u2019t see an impact on Fiserv\/First Data, \u201cas we simply do not see Fidelity bringing a lot of incremental competitive value to the table.\u201dRead more: Fiserv-First Data Deal Could Trigger Payments M&A, Analysts SayKBW was surprised Worldpay was \u201cchoosing to sell now ahead of realizing the full cost (about half left) and revenue synergies ($100 million run-rate exiting 2020) from the Vantiv\/Worldpay combination.\u201d\u201cWe would have expected other players in the space like Total System Services Inc. to have been more strategically compelling for FIS given their card issuer processing business.\u201d The deal may be positive for Global Payments, Total System Services, and Adyen NV, as others are \u201cpotentially distracted with their fairly complex mergers.\u201d\u201cThe deal reinforces the transformational and disruptive impact that e-commerce is having on payments,\u201d Ellis said via email. \u201cIn-store payments are very local and difficult to scale, whereas e-commerce has significant benefits to scale, and is very global.\u201dShe noted the transaction would create \u201c a strong competitor to Fiserv plus First Data \u2014 presumably that deal triggered this one.\u201d She sees potential speculation about Global Payments and Total System Services merging. Chase Paymentech, the only major global acquirer that\u2019s a bank captive, may to look at Total System Services too.Adds that there\u2019s \u201cinteresting read-through to Visa and Mastercard.\u201d The move probably wouldn\u2019t affect them much, \u201cbut any deals that create larger, stronger players is on the margin not good for them.\u201dFaucette sees Worldpay shares trading in line with FIS\u2019s until the deal closes, probably in the second half of this year. That may mean upside for Worldpay holders if FIS shares rally in the meantime, he said, noting that First Data was trading about 13 percent above where the Fiserv deal was originally announced.

One of those is matchmakers suggesting Apple Inc. buy Netflix Inc. or (insert hot internet\/media company of the moment).\u00a0I have tended to dismiss these ideas, including the Netflix (and other) acquisition suggestions this week from a JPMorgan Chase & Co. stock analyst. Apple typically builds everything on its own, although it occasionally buys small companies to plug in technologies it\u00a0thinks are important.\u00a0Apple bought Siri, for example, and struck deals with several computer chip and\u00a0component\u00a0companies.\u00a0Apple\u2019s largest\u00a0purchase \u2014\u00a0Beats,\u00a0for about $3 billion \u2014 was\u00a0the exception that proved the rule. The 2014 deal\u00a0was the foundation for what became Apple Music. Apple had resisted streaming music that people didn\u2019t own, and it may have needed outside expertise and technology to nudge itself\u00a0in a different direction.\u00a0Now, Apple is undergoing\u00a0a drastic corporate remodeling, and its\u00a0approach to build versus buy may need to\u00a0change again.Apple has mostly made small acquisitions through its history, with the exception of its 2014 purchase of BeatsSource: BloombergApple wants to  rely less on selling devices and more on persuading its built-in audience to spend more on apps and subscriptions to digital music, online video and news. Future Apple digital\u00a0offerings must work well on multiple computing devices, not just\u00a0the ones that Apple makes. That is not a skill Apple has honed in-house.\u00a0The company has been hiring Hollywood experts for its expected Netflix-like web video service, but some observers think they could use more help. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities suggested\u00a0recently that Apple buy Sony Corp.\u2019s U.S. television-and-film production division or another entertainment machine to push along its efforts.Netflix itself may be out of reach, even for Apple. But Netflix has shown that a savvy company doesn\u2019t need to buy an entertainment company to become an\u00a0entertainment empire. Again, though, different times for Apple may call for different and unusual measures.\u00a0I should say that it\u2019s fun but also foolish to predict the next big acquisition by Apple or any other company. Dealmaking is\u00a0unpredictable. And dear reader, I\u2019ve fallen victim to this problem. I wrote a piece two years ago saying big tech companies weren\u2019t going to ride in and buy companies in stagnant industries. Within months, Amazon  agreed to buy a supermarket chain for $14 billion. I\u2019m now out of the tech M&A prediction game.And while we\u2019re talking about rethinking Apple\u2019s approach to mergers and acquisitions, there\u2019s also an opportunity for Apple to think different with its retail stores. Apple started to open its own shops in 2001, just before the debut of\u00a0the iPod that became Apple\u2019s first truly large-volume product.It\u00a0was helpful for people to see, try and get help with the unfamiliar Apple music player \u2014 and\u00a0later, the iPhone \u2014 in stores that the company controlled.

Should Apple focus on more but smaller stores to maximize opportunities to interact in-person with more of its customers? Could the stores be even more aggressive about coaching people on the merits of Apple\u2019s growing lineup of apps and services?\u00a0Apple may be more than happy to stick with its strategy on stores and with its corporate takeovers.

Failed mergers over past two years leave uncertain future Pedestrians cross a street in front of a Rite Aid Corp. store in Oakland, California.Rite Aid Corp. said it will part ways with its top managers and shed about 400 jobs, cutting about $55 million in costs as the drugstore chain tries to turn itself around.Chief Executive Officer John Standley, Chief Operating Officer Kermit Crawford and Chief Financial Officer Darren Karst will all step down, Rite Aid said in a statement Tuesday.\u201cIt is imperative we take action to reduce the cost of current operations and become a more efficient and profitable company,\u201d Bruce Bodaken, chairman of the company\u2019s board of directors, said in a statement. \u201cThe board believes that now is the right time to undertake a leadership transition.\u201dRite Aid has gone from a bastion of the American drugstore landscape to a shell of its former self after selling a large chunk of its stores to rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. It has reported a loss for three quarters in a row, while analysts have cut their ratings. The stock now trades for less than a dollar -- down from nearly $50 in 1998.In the past two years, Rite Aid has seen multiple mergers fall through, leaving an uncertain future for the company with no clear end game. In 2017, a proposed tie-up with Walgreens fell apart amid antitrust scrutiny by U.S. regulators. In August 2018, another proposed merger, with supermarket chain Albertsons Cos., was called off after two prominent proxy advisers recommended that shareholders vote against it.\u201cThese are dark times for Rite Aid shareholders,\u201d said Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI. \u201cGiven the elevated leverage levels and likely declining profit line, we think the outlook here is pretty dire.\u201dRead more: Rite Aid drops after failed merger narrows options for drugstoreIn a statement after the announcement, Rite Aid spokesman Chris Savarese said that the changes aim at \u201cmore closely aligning the structure and leadership of the company with the scale of its operations.\u201d The departures \u201care not at all a result of any wrongdoing,\u201d he said.The job cuts will eliminate about 20 percent of the corporate positions at the company\u2019s Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, headquarters and elsewhere.

In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.Norway will on Friday decide whether to let its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund dump all its oil and gas stocks. Here\u2019s what you need to know.The fund contends that it makes little sense for Norway to be doubly exposed to the oil markets. As western Europe\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer, its fortunes are already heavily linked to petroleum, deriving almost half its exports and more than 20 percent of the state\u2019s revenue from the commodities.The central bank, which oversees the fund, insists that the plan is based solely on financial considerations and that it doesn\u2019t reflect a particular view of the oil industry\u2019s prospects.The proposal shocked markets when it was revealed in 2017, sending oil stocks broadly lower. The plan was hailed by activists around the world as a monumental step in getting investors to back away from fossil fuels. If it becomes reality, it would likely turn the heat up on Big Oil, which is already facing pressure to do more to fight climate change and adapt to the energy transition.The fund owned about $37 billion of oil and gas stocks at the end of last year, including more than 2 percent of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Total SA. But it has also assured that any sell-down would likely take years.Read about how the fund boosted its oil and gas holdings last yearRead more: Norway\u2019s oil sell-off plan is \u2018shot heard around the world\u2019Economists are split over the plan and a government-commissioned expert panel last year advised against it, arguing a divestment would be inefficient insurance against a drop in commodity prices. It also said it would threaten the fund\u2019s simple and well-established strategy of investing broadly.In theory, the proposal has the support of a majority of parties in Parliament, which has the final say. However, since the plan was presented, the centrist Liberals and Christian Democrats, who are in favor of dumping oil stocks, have joined the bigger Conservative and Progress parties to form a majority government. While they haven\u2019t voiced a clear view of the oil-stock proposal, the Conservatives and Progress Party have traditionally been reluctant to make dramatic changes to the fund\u2019s investment strategy.The issue is likely to be settled within the coalition before the Finance Ministry makes its announcement on Friday. While that process makes a heated contest in parliament improbable, it also makes the outcome harder to predict.Tore Storehaug, a Christian Democrat lawmaker who sits on Parliament\u2019s Finance Committee,  declined to say anything on what might happen in case the government decides not to follow the fund\u2019s advice.\u201cGenerally speaking, there\u2019s broad consensus that the management of the oil fund and the enormous values Norway controls should have the broadest possible political backing,\u201d he said by phone.The opposition Labor Party, Norway\u2019s biggest political group, has long said it\u2019s sympathetic to the proposal, and is now coming out clearly in favor of selling the fund\u2019s oil stocks.\u201cMy expectation is that they\u2019ll follow the advice from Norges Bank,\u201d said lawmaker Svein Roald Hansen. \u201cWe will of course consider the government\u2019s arguments. But in my opinion, they will need to come up with some surprising elements to change our mind.\u201d ","37":" The popularity of K-Pop is taking a dive -- at least in the stock market -- after South Korean police confirmed a member of the Big Bang boy band is being investigated as part of a probe into prostitution at Seoul nightclubs.Initial media reports surfaced last week and have divided the band\u2019s young fan base on social media. Stocks of talent agencies took a plunge Monday after Yonhap News named Seungri, nicknamed \"Korea\u2019s Great Gatsby\" for his opulent lifestyle, as a suspect in the probe involving prostitutes at clubs in the Gangnam area in Seoul. Prostitution is illegal in South Korea.A police officer at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency today confirmed the Yonhap News report. The officer declined to provide their name due to an internal policy. Representatives of YG Entertainment Inc., which manages Big Bang, weren\u2019t immediately available for comment.YG Entertainment slid as much as 14 percent.

The resulting \u201cChina Pipelines Corp.\u201d would aim to attract private investors to help expand the $74 billion network and ease supply crunches in some parts of the country. Such an overhaul, announced at the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing in March, would radically reshape China\u2019s energy sector although it leaves central planning power in a single, albeit different, pair of hands.Xi JinpingAlmost all developed markets separate oil and gas production from transport to promote a level playing field and encourage new entrants into the market. An independent company also would be more likely, in theory, to decide on new routes based on national need rather than what serves an individual producer. More broadly, it\u2019s part of Xi\u2019s strategy to enhance national energy security by encouraging domestic exploration and reducing imports.China has moved millions of homes and businesses from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas as part of Xi\u2019s pledge to protect the environment. But the transition has been hampered at times by a lack of infrastructure. Gas supplies still run short, especially in winter when demand peaks. CNPC, which operates about three-fourths of the gas network, caps supplies, so some cities turn to trucked-in LNG. Sometimes factories are forced to close to keep people from shivering at home.China imports about 70 percent of its crude and half its natural gas. Xi wants to produce more at home to enhance national energy security. He also wants more private capital to get involved in exploration, since the Big Three producers -- China National Petroleum Corp. and its listed subsidiary PetroChina Co.; Sinopec, the listed unit of China Petrochemical Corp.; and China National Offshore Oil Corp. and its Cnooc Ltd. unit -- haven\u2019t moved fast enough to meet growing demand. Currently, pipeline access can be blocked or is prohibitively expensive for smaller private or foreign firms. Liberalizing the so-called mid-stream transportation -- out of the hands of the Big Three -- is seen as necessary to attract outside investors.As of 2015, China had 64,000 kilometers (about 40,000 miles) of pipelines carrying natural gas, 27,000 carrying crude and 21,000 carrying oil products, according to China\u2019s main economic planning agency. By 2025 its goal is to expand that to 163,000 kilometers for gas, 37,000 for crude and 40,000 for oil products. By comparison, the similarly sized U.S. had 1,984,321 kilometers of natural gas pipeline and 240,000 for petroleum products in 2013, according to the CIA World Factbook.The talk has been about a three-step process: The major companies transfer assets and employees to a new company, provisionally named China Pipelines Corp., and are allotted shares based on the value of those assets, estimated last year to be around 500 billion yuan ($74 billion). Analysts have since been modeling other figures. State and private investment funds inject enough capital into China Pipelines for a combined stake of about 50 percent. That money would be used to fund pipeline expansion.China Pipelines could then do an initial public offering.For PetroChina, the biggest operator, it depends on the price. Bernstein analysts last year valued its pipeline assets at 619 billion yuan for a price-to-book ratio of 1.4. If it made that much in the transfer, that\u2019d be a big boost for PetroChina\u2019s stock. However, the 500 billion yuan figure mentioned for all assets would amount to a ratio of only around 0.8, according to some analysts.

Appointment follows February shakeup of top FedEx executives A bicyclist rides past a FedEx Corp. vehicle parked in the Midtown neighborhood of New York.FedEx Corp. named company veteran Don Colleran president and chief executive officer of FedEx Express, the latest change linked to a shakeup of the shipping company\u2019s top executives last month.Colleran will take over FedEx\u2019s largest unit on March 16, the Memphis, Tennessee-based company said Monday. He will replace Raj Subramaniam, who became president and chief operating officer of the parent company on March 1, after then-President David Bronczek  retired.The sudden departure of Bronczek, 64, stunned Wall Street because he was widely viewed as Smith\u2019s eventual successor and had just been named to the board on Jan. 28. The shift vaulted Subramaniam to the front of the line as heir apparent to Smith, 74, as FedEx contends with a slowdown in international markets and a lagging stock price.Colleran has been with FedEx for almost 30 years, joining as an international sales manager and moving through executive positions in several operating companies before being named executive vice president and chief sales officer of FedEx in 2017.Another FedEx veteran, David Cunningham, exited in December. Shortly after he resigned, the company startled analysts by cutting its outlook and announcing an employee buyout program.

For a professional money manager looking back on the bull market at its 10th anniversary, it\u2019s a hard question to answer.Here\u2019s a thought. Imagine you knew exactly which stocks to pick a decade ago, the ones that would do best during the rally -- like, literally. You knew Jazz Pharmaceuticals would soar 23,000 percent, that Abiomed and Netflix would rise more than 60 fold and Exact Sciences would go from 78 cents to $85. You were granted that knowledge, and you went out and bought those stocks. What would life have been like on the way to world-beating gains?Worse than you think. From time to time, big losses are inescapable even in a portfolio chosen with 20-20 hindsight, with underperformance often dragging on long enough to put a money manager\u2019s job in jeopardy.The idea is a variation on an experiment tested three years ago by the research firm Alpha Architect, in a study designed to demonstrate how futile it is for professional investors to try always to outperform. The paper, \u201cEven God Would Get Fired as an Active Manager,\u201d showed that perfect stock-picking clairvoyance over long stretches wouldn\u2019t spare a money manager from rough patches that would threaten his career.Researchers looked at the period all the way back to 1927 but Alpha Architects\u2019s founder, Wesley Gray, and quantitative researcher Tao Wang agreed to run the numbers on the bull market to see how the perfect portfolio fared in honor of its latest anniversary. And while the pain of owning only winners was a little less over the last decade, the results still cast a brutal light on life on Wall Street.First the (somewhat obvious) good news. An equal-weight portfolio comprising the best 100 stocks in the Russell 1000 since the bottom of the financial crisis would have returned nearly 20 times the benchmark, according to data compiled by Alpha Architect. But while arriving at that destination felt great, the travel it took to get there was rough.Take 2011, for example. Stocks that ended up trouncing the S&P 500 over the decade fell behind the benchmark by as much as 10 percent for part of that year, a dose of weakness that would\u2019ve tested a client\u2019s patience. The perfect portfolio plummeted more than 22 percent at one point -- six percentage points more than largest drawdown for the S&P 500. Just half a year later, the god group suffered a three-month stretch of trailing its benchmark again. (The firm calculated returns at monthly intervals, not daily.)God portfolio sees more dramatic drawdowns than the S&P 500Source: Tao Wang, Alpha ArchitectThe goal of the original Alpha Architect experiment was to answer the question: \u201cIf God is omnipotent, could he create a long-term active investment strategy fund that was so good that he could never get fired?\u201d The conclusion was no. While long-term returns were obviously astounding, shorter stretches -- the ones by which fund managers are often judged -- were \u201cabysmal.\u201d\u201cInvestment managers typically have a set philosophy, and philosophies don\u2019t always work,\u201d said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark, which has around $45 billion on its platform. \u201cEven determining what the right thing to do in terms of performance, 10 years is pretty long. Five years is longer than most portfolio managers would keep their job if they didn\u2019t perform well.\u201dJust look at the hair-raising routes of the 10-year winners to see how gut-wrenching volatility can get even in sure-thing picks. On March 9, 2009, Jazz Pharmaceuticals traded for 58 cents a share. Ten years and 23,327 percent later, it\u2019s worth $136. From 2015 to 2016, the company lost half its value. In 2014 and last year, it suffered two separate drops of about 30 percent or more.The next five companies -- Exact Sciences, Ulta Beauty, Lululemon Athletica, Netflix, and Abiomed -- have all endured stretches over the last 10 years when their stock fell almost 40 percent or more.Scott Davis, who is 62 years old and a portfolio manager for the Columbia Dividend Income Fund, started his career back in 1980. What\u2019s helped him deal with the ups and downs and constant benchmark comparisons is something that only comes with time -- age.\u201cYou worry about it a lot when you\u2019re younger and you\u2019re thinking about your career,\u201d he said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s New York headquarters. \u201cThere\u2019s a temptation to say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s not working, I\u2019ve got to change what I do.\u201d\u2019This weekend officially marks the 10th birthday of the bull market -- the longest ever. It\u2019s come close to extinction twice, with intraday declines in the S&P 500 topping 20 percent in 2011 and again more recently in December. Each time, it was saved at the last minute.\u201cOne of the most important attributes of any portfolio manager is having the fortitude to go through those periods,\u201d said Eric Marshall, president and director of research for Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.Back in March 2009 he bought shares of Texas Pacific Land Trust for $25 each, and his portfolio has held the stock in some capacity ever since. It\u2019s now up more than 4,500 percent, although last year its value was cut in half. Marshall\u2019s thought process when purchasing the stock back at the bottom hinged on a simple equation.\u201cFor this investment to work, we need one thing to happen -- the world not come to an end,\u201d he said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s New York headquarters. \u201cIn March of \u201909, it was like the world was coming to an end.\u201d ","43":"Retailer will fully eliminate hunting items from 125 stores. Move follows a 10-store trial that produced positive results Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc., which began scaling back gun sales in the wake of last year\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is removing even more weapons from its shelves.The retailer will drop hunting gear starting around August from about 125 stores where it is underperforming, Dick\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Ed Stack announced Tuesday. The change, which affects about 17 percent of the Dick\u2019s chain, follows a trial run last year when Dick\u2019s removed hunting products from 10 of its stores.The announcement, coupled with continuing declines in same-store sales, jarred investors. Dick\u2019s shares fell as much as 11 percent, the most since August 2017, to $34.45 in New York trading. The stock was up 25 percent this year through Monday.Stack said fourth-quarter sales rose at the 10 stores that pulled hunting, and the locations delivered better margins and foot traffic than when they had guns. For the 125 additional stores, hunting floor space \u201cwill be replaced by merchandise categories that can drive growth, each based on the needs of that particular market,\u201d Stack said on the company\u2019s earnings call.The new approach follows a tightening of gun policies that Stack self-imposed in February 2018. After the deadly shooting in Parkland, Stack said that he\u2019d stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines. He also raised the minimum age for purchasing a gun to 21.The decision drew anger from many who felt the it contradicted the Second Amendment. The National Rifle Association criticized Stack\u2019s \u201cstrange business model,\u201d and the National Shooting Sports Foundation expelled Dick\u2019s from its membership. Dick\u2019s was once a major vendor of firearms in the U.S., and though the industry was struggling before the decision, Stack has made it clear that the blowback hurt sales.Still, Stack said that if this 125-store move goes well, the company could decide to remove hunting gear from more stores next year.The company\u2019s 2018 revenue was down almost 2 percent to $8.4 billion, a dip that Stack has attributed to slower firearm sales, a change in Under Armour Inc.\u2019s distribution strategy and a weak performance in electronics sales. Stack has expressed optimism about Under Armour going forward, and Dick\u2019s has now fully exited the electronics business.Last month, Stack was one of four CEOs to sign a letter supporting a universal gun control bill that recently passed in the U.S. House of Representatives, and he recently joined the business council of Everytown, a nonprofit that advocates for gun control. (Everytown was founded by Michael Bloomberg, owner of Bloomberg News\u2019 parent company.) ","44":"New breed takes over to accelerate electronic-trading efforts. BofA, Morgan Stanley, UBS are among firms enlisting their help Ashok Krishnan\u2019s colleagues at Bank of America initially brushed off his pitch to automate trading. He recalls how some barely acknowledged him in the halls. But before long their aversion gave way to requests for help.As head of electronic trading in the bank\u2019s global markets division, Krishnan is among a group of Wall Street equities veterans -- including Phil Allison at Morgan Stanley and Mark Goodman at UBS Group AG -- promoted in recent years to take on a delicate assignment: Build machines to handle trading in other markets such as bonds and currencies. They\u2019re convinced it\u2019s possible after watching computers take over stocks.Ashok KrishnanIn an interview at Bank of America Corp.\u2019s headquarters in New York, Krishnan, 48, ticked off technologies such as algorithmic and mobile trading that are giving machines a greater role in making complex markets.Persuading humans is something else.The long-predicted automation of bond and currency trading has been slow to arrive, after traders voiced skepticism that happened to protect their business and jobs. They argued clients want to talk through complex transactions and that automation weakens relationships. Even shifting simple bets to electronic platforms would reduce interactions with customers, missing opportunities to arrange other deals and \u201ccannibalizing\u201d the business. Yet investors are demanding more advanced platforms to cut costs, as well as new tools providing a clearer view into markets.\u201cIf you don\u2019t do this, your P&L goes down because the client just does business somewhere else,\u201d Krishnan said, invoking a Wall Street acronym for earnings.Stock trading is far ahead of major bond markets in going electronicSource: Greenwich AssociatesThe stakes are huge for Wall Street banks competing in the $22 trillion market for U.S. Treasuries and corporate debt and the $5.1 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market. Handling fixed-income products remains one of industry\u2019s biggest revenue generators. Now firms must disrupt the old model by building out their electronic platforms, or they risk getting sidelined in the future.Equities migrated to computers first because they\u2019re standardized and trade frequently, making it relatively simple to match buyers and sellers. The same goes for parts of bond and FX trading, such as Treasury futures and spot currency transactions. That\u2019s left stock veterans with the technical experience to tackle more-complex products -- as well as the confidence needed to overcome years of resistance.\u201cIt started with the equity guys saying, \u2018Let\u2019s make these markets look like our markets,\u201d\u2019 said Kevin McPartland, head of research for market structure and technology at consultant Greenwich Associates. \u201cFrom the bond side it was: \u2018No, no, no. I\u2019ve been doing this for 20 years. I know my clients. There\u2019s no way you can get a machine to replicate the knowledge I have.\u2019\u201dSee the graphic: Robots of Wall Street are coming for these trading jobsKrishnan trained as an electronics and telecoms engineer before becoming a banker. He was running Bank of America\u2019s electronic trading of equities two years ago when his bosses expanded his responsibilities to include fixed income, currencies and commodities. His peers at rival shops are leading similar efforts. Clients, too, are moving in the same direction.Take Vanguard Group Inc.\u2019s Andy Maack. Formerly an equities portfolio manager, he was elevated in 2013 to build and run a centralized currency-trading desk for the asset manager, which oversees more than $5 trillion. Maack\u2019s expectations are based on his work with stocks: He says banks should offer advanced algorithms that fill orders quickly, cheaply and with extensive trade reporting and analytical tools.Already, more than 90 percent of Vanguard\u2019s spot-currency deals are handled electronically. Of those, over half rely on sophisticated algorithms, which calculate optimal times, order sizes and venues to trade.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed a pretty significant change of behavior over the last five years,\u201d Maack said, noting that even old-school Wall Street traders -- known for their prowess with phones and message systems -- have come to accept computerized processes. \u201cWhen somebody from equities got involved, the FX desk transitioned faster to electronic.\u201dIt helps that bank leaders have gotten behind the push.Last year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s chief financial officer, Marty Chavez, told analysts that the old arguments against automation no longer made sense and that the firm was analyzing how traders and salespeople work to automate more processes. Advances in computing power mean machines \u201ccan handle that extra complexity,\u201d he said. He was later named co-head of the firm\u2019s trading division.Phil Allison at Morgan StanleyElectronic platforms can drive out traders two ways: They require fewer humans to facilitate transactions. And they require new skills from those who remain.Concerns about jobs appear warranted: The world\u2019s 12 largest banks have reduced front-office staff -- those who produce revenue -- by 11 percent from 2013, according to Coalition Development Ltd.Yet banks have little choice but to adapt. Buy-side investors are embracing new technologies and pressing their market-makers to do it, too, to cut costs and offer more transparency, said Morgan Stanley\u2019s Allison. He oversees fixed-income automated trading from London and previously worked in equities at KCG Holdings Inc. and UBS.It made sense for the division to enlist a stocks specialist, said Allison, who studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge. \u201cI probably bring a different perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve managed large groups of people, all the way from high-touch sales traders through to heavy C++ developers.\u201dHe was hired by Sam Kellie-Smith, who previously ran equities trading at Morgan Stanley and now leads the bank\u2019s fixed-income division.Mark Goodman at UBS GroupAt UBS, Goodman has seen the stock market move from the speed of a fax machine to millionths of a second. Instead of working phones, traders now create algorithms to slice, time and route orders. He\u2019s working on a similar push for FX, rates and credit desks. For Goodman, who practices kung fu in his free time, embracing technology has been a good career strategy.\u201cI took a risk,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cYou get an opportunity to do something new. And if that eventually replaces the old, then you have an opportunity to really expand your career, rather than following what is a well-trodden path.\u201dIn the most liquid equity markets, more than 90 percent of trades are executed electronically, according to estimates from Greenwich Associates. That compares with 79 percent in global foreign exchange, 44 percent in U.S. Treasuries and 26 percent in U.S. corporate bonds, with the most room for growth in the latter two markets, according to McPartland at Greenwich.\u201cPeople say, \u2018This market can\u2019t be electronified, it\u2019s different,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t hold water anymore.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Sonali Basak, Alex Harris, and Molly Smith ","45":"First devices arriving in May to kick off next-gen service. LG, Samsung, HTC, Google and Rovio among partners in rollout Michel Combes during an event at the MWC Barcelona.Sprint Corp. has put a 5G date on the calendar.The wireless carrier set a May launch of its 5G mobile-phone service in four of the nine cities it\u2019s targeting in the first half of this year. That might make it the first carrier out of the gate in a race with rivals to snap up early adopters of the next-generation wireless platform.The launch date was part of a series of 5G-related announcements Monday in connection with the start of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Sprint also said its service would be integrated with Rovio Entertainment Oyj\u2019s Hatch mobile-gaming offering, that it would work with real-time maps from Mapbox Inc. and that Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Fi virtual wireless network has signed on for 5G service.Sprint joins AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and its proposed merger partner T-Mobile US Inc. as the fourth U.S. wireless carrier to plan on starting mobile 5G service in the next four months. While the domestic battle focuses on capturing new revenue from advanced services, President Donald Trump has viewed 5G expansion as a key technology arms race with China.Sprint said its 5G service will be available initially in four metropolitan areas -- Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Kansas City -- followed by Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix and Washington. In an interview Monday, Sprint Chief Executive Officer Michel Combes said he was eager to show the benefits that 5G will bring. He declined to say how much Sprint would charge consumers for the new service.The launch of mobile 5G depends on the availability of devices. Sprint said the service would start with the arrival of LG Corp.\u2019s V50 ThinQ phone, an HTC Corp. hotspot device and Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s Galaxy S10.AT&T has 5G service available to hotspot devices in parts of 12 cities today with seven more markets coming by midyear. Verizon started a 5G home broadband and TV service in parts of four cities last year and said last week that it will have mobile 5G service in 30 cities this year. T-Mobile has also promised mobile 5G service to start in 30 cities this year with more comprehensive coverage coming next year.Sprint\u2019s 5G plans are taking shape as it fights for U.S. approval of its $26.5 billion acquisition by T-Mobile. The companies argue that together they can provide a more formidable challenge to their larger rivals. Lawmakers and competitors have raised concerns that the combination of the country\u2019s No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers will harm customers.The race to claim a lead in 5G has been particularly pointed, as Sprint illustrated when it squared off against AT&T in federal court earlier this month. Claiming false advertising, Sprint sued the larger carrier over its use of a \u201c5G E\u201d symbol on phones connected to its enhanced 4G network. The two companies are expected to lead carriers in 5G rollout spending, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst John Butler.Sprint and T-Mobile each have gained about 20 percent on the stock market in the past year, compared with 16 percent for Verizon and a fall of 17 percent for AT&T. ","46":"Equity benchmark tries and fails to rise above key level. Mounting 3,000 would be real start of bull market, trader says The stunning surge in Chinese equities has traders talking about the Shanghai Composite at 3,000 points again, with two whipsaw sessions underscoring the importance of that key level.For the second day in a row the equity benchmark got within a few points of 3,000 before rapidly giving up gains. The line was previously a longstanding support and is just below two key Fibonacci retracement levels -- from its 2015 and 2018 highs -- that are closely watched by short-term traders.The 3,000 level is the \"strongest resistance standing in our way,\" said Kang Chongli, an analyst at Lianxun Securities in Beijing. \"A substantial breakout from this line would be an important sign of a bear to bull reversal.\"The gauge closed up 0.4 percent at 2,953.82 on Wednesday, after rising as much as 1.9 percent to 2,997.49. On Tuesday it climbed as much as 1.2 percent to 2,995.68 before ending 0.7 percent lower.Rising above that level could trigger new inflows into a stock market that\u2019s already added more than $1.4 trillion since Jan. 3, a staggering turnaround after last year\u2019s heavy losses. Sentiment has swung from outright pessimism to growing euphoria as traders bet on a trade deal with the U.S. and President Xi Jinping signaled that the government will focus on stimulating growth instead of trying to cut leverage in the financial system.\"3,000 is not the end of the road, but the start,\" said Kaiyuan Securities Co. analyst Yang Hai.The Shanghai Composite Index has traded below the 3,000 level for the past eight months amid concern about trade tensions with the U.S. and an economic slowdown -- the longest stretch since 2014. The line was previously breached during market crashes in 2015 and 2016 and had been seen as a level defended by state-backed funds.Not everyone believes 3,000 remains a relevant level. Yu Aibin, fund manager at Shenzhen Jointfull Capital Management Co. says the more important figures to watch are credit data.New yuan loans jumped by a record 3.23 trillion yuan ($481 billion) in January, exceeding estimates, while shadow financing rose for the first time in 11 months. Margin debt in the stock market surged over the past two weeks at the fastest pace since 2015.\"This rally was caused by increased liquidity,\" said Yu. \"Now that more credit is available, we should not let ourselves be constrained by numbers.\"Chen Jihao, partner at Beijing Gaoxi Asset Management Co., is more cautious. He\u2019s been reducing his long position in equities as the gauge approached the key level. He attributes the recent surge to steps taken by the new securities regulator Yi Huiman, who\u2019s been removing curbs designed to keep out speculators.\"We are up 20 percent in a few weeks chiefly because of Yi,\" Chen said. \"The day we surpass 3,000 would be the real start of the bull market.\"\u2014 With assistance by April Ma, and Mengchen Lu ","47":"Deutsche Bank-led group met Irish Finance Minister Donohoe.

At the meeting, investors told Donohoe that restrictions on executive pay at AIB Group Plc and other partly state-owned lenders are \u201cnow a huge concern\u201d even as they recognized the political sensitivity around easing restrictions, according to an internal summary of feedback prepared for the minister.The documents were released to Bloomberg News through a Freedom of Information Act request.The group of six investors, led by Deutsche Bank\u2019s David Lock and Rolf Zartner, highlighted the decline in AIB\u2019s stock after Chief Executive Officer Bernard Byrne resigned in October, the summary noted. Among the group planning to attend the meeting were representatives from Artemis Investment Management LLP, Citadel LLC and M&G Investments.AIB shares fell as much as 1.5 percent to 3.97 euros, and traded at 4.02 euros at 11:21 a.m. in Dublin.The Irish government caps salaries at 500,000 euros ($545,500) and banned bonuses at AIB, Bank of Ireland Group Plc and Permanent TSB Group Holdings Plc as part of state bailouts during the financial crisis. Even if bonuses are reinstated, payments over 20,000 euros would face an 89 percent super tax. Donohoe rejected an AIB plan to reinstate bonuses last year.The government has hired Korn\/Ferry International to review the caps. While that review may recommend easing the constraints, Donohoe told Bloomberg News in January he had no plans to ease the restrictions.Before the meeting, a briefing note prepared for Donohoe highlighted that while the restrictions \u201care having an impact on recruitment and retention\u201d for the banks, \u201cthe politics of this are very difficult\u201d which left him unable to make \u201cpromises\u201d in relation to the pay caps.On the timing of future bank share sales, investors \u201ctook comfort\u201d that Donohoe remained committed to selling down the government\u2019s stakes according to the notes.

A further error totaling $700,000 came from recognition of revenue from subscriptions through Costco Wholesale Corp. that had been terminated through refunds.There was a noncash error, too, related to accounting for derivatives. The changes to third-quarter results led to an $8.9 million widening of the company\u2019s net loss for the period, to $138.5 million.The company said it continued to have a material weakness in its internal financial controls for subscription management through Dec. 31, but implemented new accounting software on New Year\u2019s Day.MoviePass gained popularity with filmgoers by offering a $9.95-a-month subscription that let fans go to the movies every day. The company retooled that model several times as its losses ballooned.Customers grew frustrated and cinema chains began offering their own subscription plans, sending Helios & Matheson shares into a decline that resulted in their delisting from the Nasdaq.

In his speech to the troops, Aneel Bhusri, the co-founder and chief executive officer, said the 14-year-old upstart was targeting that annual sales milestone in as many as six years, up from $2 billion last year. \u00a0\u201cWe can get there,\u201d he said as the crowd cheered. \u201cIt\u2019s achievable under almost any scenario.\u201dWorkday makes applications that help companies with mundane tasks like keeping payroll, plotting expenses, tracking employee absences and managing job candidates. It sounds unglamorous, but as in many of Silicon Valley\u2019s business-focused software fields, there\u2019s fierce drama behind the scenes. Workday co-founders Bhusri and David Duffield once had a human resources software company, PeopleSoft, that was taken over by Oracle Corp. in a famously hostile acquisition. Now they&apos;re back with a familiar rival: Oracle.Most large companies still run older financial tools made by Oracle, the world\u2019s second-largest software maker, or the German giant SAP SE. Workday has persuaded big corporate clients like Bank of America and Amazon.com Inc.\u00a0to use its software, but the key to reaching that magical $10 billion number is getting more companies to switch their cloud-based accounting tools as well.\u201cThe biggest challenge for Workday is inertia,\u201d Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said. Accounting systems are \u201cthe heart and lungs of your operation and people are reluctant to change that. It is very difficult to get rid of your SAP and Oracle systems and move to the cloud.\u201d Workday\u2019s customer service record may be its most valuable tool in growing its client list, he added.Bhusri has tried to take on Oracle and SAP in part by cultivating a kinder, gentler image. Both of Workday\u2019s larger rivals have accused customers of violating complex contracts, and asked for large financial penalties. Lawsuits have sometimes resulted, such as SAP\u2019s suit with beverage maker Diageo, which was settled out of court in 2017. Oracle and SAP have also both been accused of pressuring clients to upgrade their software. An SAP spokeswoman declined to comment. Oracle didn\u2019t respond to a request to comment.In a business known for its egotistical characters \u2013 including Oracle\u00a0Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison, who frequently rants against his rivals \u2013 Bhusri said in an interview he\u2019s determined to compete as a \u201cnice guy,\u201d comparing himself with Stephen Curry, the point guard of the Golden State Warriors, who has a reputation for being amiable.But Bhusri is just as likely to lob insults at his competitors, even if he feigns to soften the blow. \u201cThey\u2019re both struggling making a transition. Someone called them dinosaurs,\u201d he said to his employees about Oracle and SAP on stage in December.\u00a0\u201cNot me.\u201dIn 2005, Oracle completed its hostile takeover of PeopleSoft, culminating a grueling 18-month affair that included an antitrust lawsuit with the U.S. government and PeopleSoft\u2019s board rejecting no fewer than five Oracle bids. Duffield and Bhusri were powerless to stop it and left feeling disappointed. Later that year, they met for breakfast at a diner in Truckee,\u00a0California, and plotted their next step, sketching on a napkin the first stages of what would become Workday, which would use newer technology than PeopleSoft \u2013 cloud computing.Workday is Bhusri and Duffield\u2019s do-over, and in their bid to get this one right, they gave Workday a dual-class stock that ensures they could prevent any unwanted takeover. Bhusri and Duffield collectively own more than 96 percent of Workday\u2019s Class B shares, giving them control even though the company\u2019s Class A shares are publicly traded.Workday has built\u00a0itself to be the anti-Oracle \u2013 while they both compete for the same clients with similar products, Workday boasts that it has prioritized its employee experience above all other considerations, arguing that happy employees lead to satisfied customers. Oracle, meanwhile, is currently battling the U.S. Department of Labor, which alleged that the company shortchanged employees by $400 million because of discriminatory practices.Workday is often cited on lists of\u00a0best places to work, and it has an attrition rate of less than 10 percent \u2013 low in Silicon Valley, where workers have a reputation for swapping employers with the seasons. It also sends a weekly satisfaction survey to workers; organizes frequent parties; and allows unusual team-building projects, like the time one group of employees decided to foster a dog who lived at the office during business hours.Workday devotes two-thirds of its expenses to its employees, Co-President Robynne Sisco said. That goes toward compensation and\u00a0benefits. \u201cWhen we look at companies like Oracle, we think they don\u2019t treat their employees as strategic priorities, and it will be to their long-term detriment,\u201d said Sisco, who used to work under Safra Catz at Oracle, before Catz became Oracle\u2019s CEO.Oracle is paying attention. In September, Mark Hurd, who shares the CEO title with Catz, said on a conference call with analysts that Oracle had notched key wins against Workday. Airbnb Inc. had replaced Workday Financials with Oracle software, he said, as did asset management company Legg Mason Inc. (Workday said that Airbnb remains a customer.) \u201cWe\u2019re killing Workday in\u201d accounting software, Ellison said during an earnings conference call in December.To make it to\u00a0$10 billion, Workday will have to do a better job of convincing conservative chief financial officers to do their bookkeeping in the cloud. Most large companies only upgrade these systems, which track revenue and expenses, once a generation. Oracle and SAP have made it a priority to hold onto these customers.Workday executives say the timing hasn\u2019t been quite right. \u201cIt\u2019s actually been a viable product for quite some time,\u201d Sisco said, \u201cBut the market just wasn&apos;t ready for it yet.\u201dWorkday\u2019s difficulties in the accounting software market have forced it to try to cut some corners. The company purchased Adaptive Insights Inc. last year for $1.55 billion, in its largest acquisition to date. Adaptive makes financial planning software that Workday sees as a conduit for persuading customers to buy more internet-based financial software. Workday had a competing product on the market, but said buying Adaptive sped up their momentum in this market by more than two years.But in some ways, Bhusri has already gotten revenge. His company\u2019s sales grew 36 percent in fiscal 2018 and its stock jumped by an enviable 54 percent during the last year. Bhusri thinks all of Workday\u2019s quirks, big and small, are responsible for its momentum.\u201cWe tell people, if you don\u2019t want to have fun, go work for SAP or Oracle,\u201d Bhusri said in an interview. \u201cCulture overwhelms strategy. In 10 years, as long as we have our culture, it won\u2019t matter what our strategy is.\u201d ","50":"Deals by Bayer, German Merck range well beyond rivals\u2019 scope. Shareholders ask \u2018What am I investing in here?\u2019: analyst Most of the world\u2019s biggest drugmakers are focusing ever more closely on innovative new drugs and health technologies, shedding businesses ranging from toothpaste to animal vaccines as they snap up promising biotechnology companies.German pharma companies, on the other hand, seem to be looking off in different directions, and investors are getting uneasy.Merck KGaA, struggling to compete in the red-hot world of immune cancer therapy, on Tuesday stuck to its guns on a $5.9 billion hostile bid for Versum Materials Inc. to bolster its smallest business, performance materials. Bayer AG, facing patent loss for its best-selling pill, spent $63 billion to become the top seller of seeds to farmers, a deal that diversified its business while opening the gate to lawsuits and activist investor Elliott Management Corp.These diversified pharma players generally trade at a discount, according to Michael Leuchten, a London-based analyst at UBS, in part because investors may not have the desire to wrap their heads around multiple sectors.\u201cPeople are looking at this and saying, \u2018What am I investing in here? Am I investing in a health-care company?\u201d\u2019 Leuchten said. \u201c\u2018Or am I investing in a chemicals company?\u201d\u2019Bayer and Merck shares were little changed in early trading Wednesday in Frankfurt.Analysts at Citi call Bayer a conglomerate and apply a 10 percent discount to its shares on that basis. Recent moves in Big Pharma reflect wariness over that label. Many -- such as Sanofi, Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline Plc -- are trimming their portfolios and divesting ancillary businesses as they shunt investment into deals and research on future therapies where they expect to get the biggest payoff.\u201cIt\u2019s easier as a health-care investor for me to evaluate whether a biotech transaction is a good one or a bad one,\u201d said Dan Mahony, a London-based portfolio manager at Polar Capital LLP, which doesn\u2019t own Bayer or Merck shares. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to look at the chemical sector, because I don\u2019t look at it everyday.\u201dSince Bayer closed the Monsanto takeover in June, its shares have fallen 26 percent, while the Bloomberg Europe 500 Pharmaceuticals Index of pharma and biotechnology companies climbed 13 percent through Tuesday. And when Merck announced its bid for Versum last week, its stock promptly dropped 4.2 percent.One reason Merck, which isn\u2019t linked to U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co., pursues diverse interests is family ownership, which relieves any concerns about activism. Family owners control some 70 percent of Merck, allowing it to adopt a take-it-or-leave-it approach to a business model that seeks to balance divisions that make drugs, lab equipment and display panels.\u201cThe capital markets sometimes have questions about this conglomerate thing,\u201d Merck Chief Executive Officer Stefan Oschmann said Feb. 1 in an interview. \u201cBut more and more people understand it, and especially during times of downturn, such companies have more resilience, and they tend to perform better.\u201dBayer, Germany\u2019s biggest listed drugmaker, has been thrown into a legal maelstrom as the company faces some 11,200 U.S. plaintiffs claiming that best-selling weedkiller Roundup brought on cancer. Meanwhile, its pharma pipeline has lagged behind peers \u2013 despite some recent bright spots tied to licensing and acquisitions in prostate cancer and lymphoma -- and the company faces potential waning sales for some top-selling medicines that will face competition in a handful of years.Bayer\u2019s Monsanto woes may make it a target for activism. Elliott Management has built a stake and wants the German drugs-and-chemicals company to consider splitting in two, according to people familiar with the matter. Baumann declined to comment on that situation at the company\u2019s earnings last week, and Elliott representatives declined to comment.Baumann has said that Bayer is making good on its strategy to be a leader in the life sciences sector, leveraging its role as the world\u2019s top agriculture player and investing in advanced cell and gene therapies that could prove useful in both sectors.The company may want to take heed of Siemens AG CEO Joe Kaeser, who\u2019s fretted that if he doesn\u2019t trim his disparate business units, an activist investor might do it for him. The Munich-based industrial giant floated its health-care business in March of 2018, after merging its wind-power unit with a Spanish rival\u2019s. Fellow industrial giant Thyssenkrupp AG already capitulated last year: the company said it would split itself in two after pressure from Elliott and other activist shareholders.Still, the diversified approach must have at least a few positive features, as some companies have branched out into different businesses without much criticism from investors, Oschmann said, invoking technology giant Apple Inc.\u201cIs Apple a hardware company?\u201d he said an interview in February. \u201cIs Apple a software company? Is Apple a music company? I don\u2019t know what, but nobody is asking these questions.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Scott Deveau, and Oliver Sachgau ","51":" Want\u00a0to receive this post in your inbox every morning?\u00a0Sign up hereBoeing under intense scrutiny following air disasters, mergers a go-go in the world of finance, and we\u2019re running out of Brexit metaphors.\u00a0Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Shares of Boeing Co. are once again trading lower in the pre-market following  a slew of headlines\u00a0over the weekend.\u00a0Ethiopia\u2019s transport minister\u00a0said\u00a0flight-data recorders show \u201cclear similarities\u201d between the crashes of\u00a0Ethiopian Airlines\u00a0Flight 302 on March 10 and Lion Air Flight 610 last October.

Theresa May is playing hardball in another attempt to get her deal through Parliament in the coming days, essentially threatening a very lengthy extension to the Brexit process if it isn\u2019t backed.

The 15-person startup is registered in the U.K., where it got investment, and there are more of its high-tech benches scattered across London than the Balkans.Thirty years after communism ended in eastern Europe, the struggles of such fledgling technology companies show how far countries and economies still have to come to meet their potential.Success is stymied by a  brain drain of highly trained workers, a lack of private domestic funding and a late start in government support to nurture science out of the laboratory and into the marketplace. The fear is that the region, which blossomed after communism largely as a factory floor for western manufacturers, is\u00a0storing up an economic decline as  wages catch up and workers become more expensive.Research and development as a percentage of gross domestic product is below the European Union average in every former eastern bloc country except Slovenia. The 2019  Bloomberg Innovation Index, which ranks countries by categories including research, patent activity, higher education and productivity, puts the former communist region at the lowest in Europe along with Portugal, Greece Malta and Cyprus.Without sufficient support, the region\u2019s countries won\u2019t be able to adapt fast enough to new technologies, including software development, artificial intelligence and robotics, as they revolutionize manufacturing, according to an assessment of innovation in eastern Europe published by the Economist Intelligence Unit and sponsored by Saab AB.\u201cThey have been behind in promoting the culture of innovation to the new generation, so it\u2019s coming later than it was in Western Europe,\u201d said Margareta Drzeniek-Hanouz, a managing partner at the Horizon Group, a Swiss-based provider of analysis for governments and companies, and the author of the report. \u201cMany of the companies that have ideas, that have the best potential, go where the money and skills are to help them grow the idea.\u201dGross domestic expenditure on R&DSource: Eurostat, 2017 dataThat might not come as a surprise given the region\u2019s relative lack of wealth. Based on GDP per capita, most parts of\u00a0eastern Europe remain\u00a0below the European Union\u00a0average.Governments have been more occupied with dealing with selling state assets or championing their biggest companies while the EU\u00a0has primarily focused on massive upgrades to infrastructure from sewage to road networks.For regional startups to blossom, they need good trustworthy business environment, access to technology and good markets, said Helena Schweiger, an economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Local stock markets, for instance, are not sufficiently developed to allow sufficient and sustained financing.It leaves many high-tech hopefuls like Strawberry looking abroad for cash to nurture ideas such as neurosurgical robots, interactive facial recognition devices and farm management software, along with the Smart Park Bench.\u201cThere\u2019s a problem in Serbia where you have a very small number of investors because you don\u2019t have as much high-quality products in the region that would attract high-quality foreign investment,\u201d said Milos Milisavljevic, Strawberry\u2019s founder and chief executive officer.It\u2019s not like there haven&apos;t been some successes. Estonia is the birthplace of online video chat and phone service Skype, while Czech and Slovak engineers developed the Eset anti-virus system that catapulted\u00a0the owners into billionaire status. The conundrum for governments and investors interested in the region is now to foster more of them.State entities such as the Czech Research, Development and Innovation Council, Croatia\u2019s Hamag-Bicro and Serbia\u2019s Innovation Fund have been established in the past decade to help bring ideas together with financiers and to provide support and funding from national governments, the EU and private investors.\u201cRight now, we\u2019re riding the first-class train in Europe while promoting ourselves as the land of historical landmarks or cheap beer,\u201d Karel Havlicek, the head of the Czech innovation council. \u201cBavaria had Oktoberfest, but today Munich is the hub of the artificial intelligence. It\u2019s the key homework for the Czech government to change that.\u201dCroatia\u2019s development agency, tucked into a communist-era office park, has already helped such local alumni as Rimac Automobili, which produces\u00a0and sells 1 million-euro ($1.13 million) electric race cars from a factory in the hilly Croatian countryside.Director Mislav Jurisic acknowledges that Croatia\u2019s efforts have been stop-start over the past years, with different ministries and departments working at different speeds and varied strategies on support.Joining the EU helped. Beginning in 2013, a reorganization has been underway meant to streamline the process. Hamag\u2019s 2019 budget is $95 million, while the fund in Serbia, which isn\u2019t an EU member, has around 13 million euros available for needy startups.\u201cIn Croatia it has always been difficult for politicians to say, \u2018We support innovation\u2019,\u201d said Jurisic. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the importance for economic growth. We now have this awareness.\u201dAn alumnus of the agency\u2019s support is Citus Ltd., a software developer that occupies rooms at a Zagreb \u201cincubator,\u201d a warren of offices occupied by high-tech startups. Though CEO Tomislav Bronzin is a self-professed IT geek, much of his work these days involves drumming up capital, mostly from abroad.A similar melding of mind and machine is taking place across town at a state hospital, where a mechanical engineer and a neurosurgeon developed RONNA, two robots that operate as a dual-arm system that has taken the guesswork out of drilling into patients\u2019 heads.\u201cWith neurosurgical robotics you avoid a human possibility of making an error,\u201d said Darko Chudy, a doctor.\u00a0\u201cA robot, with its automatic recognition of bone thickness, can drill the human skull with infinitely more precision.\u201dStill the potential is there, even for EU outsiders like Serbia and Ukraine.

He tours there six or seven times a year, and in 2018 scored his first major Chinese endorsement deal with\u00a0Budweiser.In the old days, a musician would welcome the support of a record label as he took on such a big opportunity. But\u00a0China\u2019s gold rush of a music scene isn\u2019t following the usual rules.\u00a0Diablo is relying instead on\u00a0NetEase Inc., one of the country\u2019s two largest audio streaming companies. In recent negotiations with record labels, he has asked them to carve China out of deals for his songs, which include hits like \u201cYou\u2019re Not Alone\u201d and \u201cHeaven to Me.\u201dDiablo is one of a growing number of artists striking direct deals with Chinese streaming services, upending decades of record-industry orthodoxy. Musicians are supposed to sign with a record label because the company has offices and connections all over the world. But acts like Diablo and Far East Movement, a Los Angeles hip-hop group best known for the song \u201cLike a G6,\u201d have decided they are better off on their own in China.\u201cThe folks at NetEase have done a fantastic job super-serving the dance market,\u201d Diablo\u2019s manager, Andrew Goldstone, said in an interview. That includes marketing and promotions, he said. The DJ also works with\u00a0 Tencent Music Entertainment Group, which owns the other top streaming services in China.Not everyone is happy about this new world order. Western record labels are in an awkward position because Tencent Music and NetEase are supposed to be their partners. Instead, the companies are competing with them for artists, a move that could jeopardize their share\u00a0of one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing music markets.Streaming has transformed a haven for song piracy into one of the 10 biggest markets. Sales in China nearly tripled in three years, climbing to $292 million in 2017 from $105.2 million in 2014.Record labels have rushed to cash in, granting Tencent exclusive rights to represent their music in the country, and pursuing deals with local acts. Sony Music created an electronic-dance music label with DJ Alan Walker, while Warner Music Group acquired Gold Typhoon Group\u2019s catalog of recordings from Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong. Vivendi SA\u2019s Universal Music has touted signings with the pianist Lang Lang and Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu.\u201cThis market could be a global phenomenon,\u201d said Alex Taggart, who runs the international division of Outdustry, a music-industry services company that specializes in China. \u201cIt could be bigger than Korea, bigger than the whole K-pop phenomenon.\u201dThat&apos;s if the industry plays its cards right.\u00a0But the market in China bears little resemblance to the U.S., Europe and Japan, or even Korea. Many established pop stars already run their own businesses, and the major Western labels wield less influence.Local Chinese music accounts for about 80 percent of listening on Tencent\u2019s three services, QQ Music, KuGou and Kuwo. Though international music grabs a larger share of listening on NetEase, which appeals to a younger, more urban\u00a0audience, Chinese acts still claim the biggest share.\u201cArtists, especially at the beginning of their careers, may be tempted by big money.\u201dIn the absence of major record labels, the services have proven they have the power to make or break a song by promoting\u00a0it within their apps. Over the past year, they have expanded their efforts to build direct ties with artists. They have funds to sign a wider range of acts, including acts already on labels\u2019 rosters.Tencent Music and NetEase have offered acts anywhere from a few thousand dollars to millions of dollars if the musicians work directly with them instead of through a record label.Tencent Music declined to comment. NetEase said it is \u201cdevoted to helping independent musicians in China publish their works and gain more attention by providing support in every way possible,\u201d but declined to comment on its payments.The money on offer has shocked label executives, who say they don\u2019t have the same resources. Tencent Music just listed shares on the New York Stock Exchange and is supported by Tencent Holdings Ltd., a Chinese Internet giant worth more than $400 billion. NetEase, though not as large as Tencent, is still worth more than any of the major record labels.Labels say they can offer artists better services and more attention, especially for those looking to appeal to audiences around the world \u2014\u00a0and not just China.\u201cArtists, especially at the beginning of their careers, may be tempted by big money,\u201d Andy Ma, the head of Warner Music Group\u2019s China business, said in an interview.All the streaming services \u2014\u00a0including Spotify Technology SA and NetEase \u2014\u00a0claim they aren\u2019t creating labels. They are supporting thousands of artists who wouldn\u2019t have gotten a deal otherwise, or providing services to artists who have the resources to operate their own labels.Direct deals between streaming services and artists in China set\u00a0a dangerous precedent for labels elsewhere. Spotify and Apple Music, the two biggest services everywhere else, have been dabbling in direct deals with artists, much to the labels\u2019 chagrin.Diablo operates his own record label\u00a0and hired Dutch dance-music consultant Sarah Hildering to run it. The business\u00a0used to be aligned with Spinnin\u2019 Records, owned by Warner Music.

They were net sellers of both the contracts and stocks last year.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a bit of an extreme scenario at play, with foreigners only buying up futures,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, the chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo.Foreign investors turn net buyers of Japanese equity-index futuresSource: Japan Exchange Group Note: February data is as of Feb. 22Those buyers are short-term traders, namely hedge funds, while long-term players including pension and mutual funds keep selling, he said. This means the purchasing force is \u201cfragile,\u201d he added.Which is understandable: Economic data haven\u2019t been good lately -- the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector contracted in February for the first time in two and a half years, while exports in January fell more than forecast. On top of that, companies including Sony Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. have reported disappointing results, keeping appetite for Japan\u2019s stocks at bay.\u201cTo long-term investors, Japanese equities aren\u2019t attractive, with fundamentals looking downwards and finances not looking good,\u201d Fujito said. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking it\u2019s better to invest in the U.S. or emerging markets.\u201dThe Topix index slipped 0.5 percent at the close in Tokyo, while the Nikkei 225 dropped 0.4 percent.Tomochika Kitaoka, the chief equity strategist at Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc., also views Japanese equities as \u201cunpopular\u201d among foreign investors these days. Instead, they are increasingly interested in other areas, adding money to China and emerging markets, he said.\u201cThe strength of near-term reversals is coming to be seen as part of the \u2018rules of the game,\u2019 with some hedge funds actively harnessing this trend,\u201d he wrote in a March 3 report.Kitaoka doesn\u2019t expect foreign selling in cash equities to be as bad it\u2019s been, estimating it will reach roughly a third of last year\u2019s 5.7 trillion yen. Huge buybacks from Japanese companies could support the market, while valuations are cheap, he noted. But for long-term investors, he said uncertainty will persist until Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s term ends in 2021.Some are more optimistic, citing the latest developments in U.S.-China trade negotiations.A resolution to their discord would be positive for equities around the world, and \u201cparticularly for high-surplus exporting nations such as Japan, which also has a high beta to China,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market strategist at Oanda Corp. in Singapore. \u201cWith confidence returning in the short and medium term if an acceptable deal gets over the line, we should see foreign buyers returning to Japan\u2019s equities in force.\u201dWhile Fujito acknowledges positive trade developments could help equities, a convincing return of foreign appetite is yet to be seen. The buying in futures \u201cis something that takes place in a very speedy fashion, but something that can\u2019t be sustained,\u201d Fujito said. ","55":"Shanghai Composite sinks 4.4%, ends eight-week winning streak. World-beating rally had fueled concerns about overheating It started with a single sell rating on one stock. By the time China\u2019s exchanges shut on Friday, equity investors were sitting on $345 billion of losses and the realization that Beijing is in no mood for another bubble.The bearish call on shares of a state-owned insurer, delivered by analysts at China\u2019s biggest state-owned brokerage, was widely interpreted as a sign that the government wants this year\u2019s world-beating surge in Chinese stocks to slow down. The Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 4.4 percent, snapping an eight-week winning streak and closing at its low for the day after disappointing export figures gave investors another reason to sell.Though indirect, it was the first time this year that China appeared to take steps to cool a buying frenzy that added almost $2 trillion to equity values and lifted market turnover to a more than three-year high. The government has until now been a big supporter of the rally, seeing it as a potential salve for overstretched corporate balance sheets and shaky consumer sentiment. But memories of the country\u2019s disastrous 2015 boom and bust are still fresh.\u201cIt\u2019s about time that stocks took a pause, as regulators are increasingly concerned by a market that\u2019s growing fanatic,\u201d said Zhu Junchun, a Shanghai-based analyst at Lianxun Securities Co. \u201cWhile authorities want an active market, they don\u2019t want one that\u2019s overactive.\u201dInvestors will be watching Monday\u2019s open for an indication of where momentum is heading. A positive start would signal that stocks can resume their climb at a pace that\u2019s more acceptable to authorities, while another lurch lower might fuel concerns over disorderly selling by margin traders.The rout in stocks was good news for China\u2019s government bonds, which resumed their rally after being neglected for three weeks. Futures on 10-year sovereign notes headed for their biggest weekly increase in 11 months on Friday, with investors taking encouragement from Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s suggestion that interest rates could be used to increase credit supply and bring down borrowing costs.

U.S. president moves to end trade preference for two nations The Indian and Turkish currencies barely skipped a beat after Donald Trump announced that he would end the countries\u2019 trade-preference status with the U.S., with the rupee posting the biggest gain of any emerging-market currency so far this week.The rupee appreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar to 70.29, after strengthening 0.6 percent on Tuesday, and the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex stock index rallied for a third day to a one-month high. Turkish stocks also proved resilient, trading down slightly amid a mixed day for developing-world assets.Investors have piled into emerging markets this year as the Federal Reserve\u2019s more cautious approach to rate hikes boosts their appetite for risk and as the U.S. and China near a trade deal. While those negotiations helped drag implied volatility for emerging-market currencies to the lowest since April, strategists at Rabobank including Richard McGuire and Lyn Graham-Taylor say they may also have triggered the latest comments from Trump.It could be \u201ca tough stance ahead of a trade agreement with China that is at risk of being seen as too generous or that your author is prone to over-analyzing,\u201d the Rabobank strategists said in their daily note. \u201cThe broadly unchanged USD-TRY cross and the modestly firmer rupee argues that the latter scenario is the most likely.\u201dTrump told Congress on Monday of his \u201cintent to terminate\u201d trade benefits for both countries under the generalized system of preferences.

Like many developers, they found working with voice software brought its own set of challenges\u00a0and didn\u2019t yield an immediate payoff.\u201cIt might be the brightest thing I\u2019ve ever done, it might be the dumbest,\u201d Deakin says of the decision to embrace Alexa. \u201cTime will tell.\u201dEcho-branded smart speakers have attracted millions of fans with their ability to play music and respond to queries spoken from across the room. But almost four years after inviting outside developers to write apps for Alexa,\u00a0Amazon\u2019s voice system has yet to offer a transformative new experience. Surveys show most people use their smart speakers to listen to tunes or make relatively simple requests\u2014\u201cAlexa, set a timer for 30 minutes\u201d\u2014while more complicated tasks prompt them to give up and reach for their\u00a0smartphone.Developers had less trouble creating hits for previous generations of technology. Think Angry Birds or Pok\u00e9mon Go on the iPhone, or, decades ago, spreadsheets on the first Windows computers.\u00a0Amazon counts some 80,000 \u201cskills\u201d\u2014its name for apps\u2014in\u00a0its marketplace. It seems impressive, but at this point\u00a0in their development, Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store each boasted more than 550,000 applications and minted fortunes for many successful developers.\u00a0\u201cThis platform is almost four years old, and you can\u2019t point me to one single killer app,\u201d says Mark Einhorn,\u00a0who created a well-reviewed Alexa game that lets users operate a simulated lemonade stand\u00a0and is one of 10 developers interviewed for this story.Amazon, which declined to comment, created a novel new technology with Alexa. But it poses problems for developers, who encounter a steep learning curve in building voice apps. Swapping visual cues for verbal ones forces them to unlearn old habits from building software for smartphones and the web. Even after creating an app, there\u2019s no guarantee people will find it. While smartphone users can quickly eyeball a list of available apps on a screen, multiple options get lost easily on a voice-based service.Amazon has gotten creative to get people to try new things, emailing recommendations to Echo owners, programming a range of prompts users can say aloud to try new things, and referring users to the companion Alexa smartphone app. One image on Amazon\u2019s screen-bearing Echo Show model seems to playfully acknowledge that challenge, showing a cartoon image of a person fishing overlaid with text suggesting people ask Alexa what skills are available.Amazon boasted last year that it has some 10,000 employees working on Alexa software and related devices. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, who has delegated most day-to-day operations\u00a0to lieutenants, remains personally involved with Alexa, according to one former employee who stays in touch with colleagues on the project. Bezos has even reviewed some skills prior to their publication on the marketplace.But that hasn\u2019t helped Amazon build a more dynamic app marketplace. Google and Apple, which trail Amazon in smart speaker sales, also lack a unique, voice-centric hit. Many people have given up even looking for one: Fully half of smart speaker users says they don\u2019t seek out applications, according to a survey by voice software news site Voicebot and Voicify, which makes developer tools.\u201cThere are kind of a cluster of features people are coming to expect for voice: a daily news summary, weather, timers\u00a0and a random fact,\u201d said James Moar, an analyst at Juniper Research who tracks voice software. Beyond that? \u201cPeople aren\u2019t really experimenting that much.\u201dFor now, Amazon is doing plenty of investing, building out guides and tools for developers, and offering stipends to the people behind the most successful apps.One\u00a0is Nick Schwab, a developer at Ford Motor Co. who started tinkering with Alexa after purchasing a cylindrical Echo speaker. His first software program, which gathered and read the offerings from daily deals websites, didn\u2019t take off.Later experiments were more successful. He built an app called Opening Bell, the first of its kind on Alexa, that let people ask for stock prices by company name. A couple of months later, eager to drown out a noisy neighbor, he built an Alexa skill that turned his hockey puck-shaped Echo Dot into a white noise machine. That was a hit, and he quickly expanded the range of sounds he offered customers.Last year, Amazon gave developers their first tools to make their own money selling Alexa skills. Schwab took advantage, charging a $1.99 monthly subscription for access to different sounds. Amazon takes a 30 percent cut on such sales, the same rate Google and Apple charge on their smartphone app stores.Since Schwab\u2019s work isn\u2019t self-sustaining yet,\u00a0Amazon also sends him monthly checks. Schwab declined to say how much those direct payments are\u00a0but said that they amount to a tidy bonus. The cash helped him pay for his dream car: a Tesla Model 3.It\u2019s unclear how many people receive such payments, which, developers say, top out at $5,000 per month for each Skill, or how much the company has paid out in total. The payments, part of a program called Alexa Developer Rewards, are \u201cmeant to be a launchpad, to help boost the ecosystem until developers have the ability to start businesses that are really sustainable,\u201d\u00a0Schwab says.Amazon says four out of five Alexa users have tried a Skill developed by outsiders. Dave Limp, the senior vice president who oversees the Alexa and devices group, said last year that music, for many, was the killer app. So-called smart home skills that let people use Alexa voice commands to control home appliances have also emerged as a popular use for the software.\u00a0Many of those functions were built by Amazon itself, or are modified versions of software other large companies, like Spotify or streaming video providers, had already created.Many of the developers who have been successful with Alexa so far are like Schwab, working on their own or in small shops.Popular apps tend to be organized around a single, relatively simple theme, like Schwab&apos;s Sleep Sounds, trivia (Question of the Day), or productivity (a skill called Chompers tells jokes and facts to keep kids from losing focus while brushing their teeth).Marketers and technology companies are keeping a close eye on Alexa, but many haven\u2019t built anything on the platform. Holding them back, people who advise those companies say, is a lack of expertise with voice recognition technology and the uncertain prospect of making money on the platform amid a prohibition on most advertising on Alexa. There&apos;s also the essential question of what tasks people would rather complete with their voice than another device using their eyes and fingers.\u201cLook at the internet in 1995, the first websites were not moneymakers,\u201d says\u00a0Brandon Kaplan, chief executive of Skilled Creative, a marketing startup that has worked on voice software projects with PepsiCo Inc. and CBS Corp.\u2019s Simon & Schuster. \u201cPeople are still playing around, figuring out what they can build.\u201dMusicplode\u2019s game, Beat the Intro, hasn\u2019t had a problem finding a large base of users, in part because of a close relationship with Amazon, which has promoted Musicplode\u2019s work at the launch of new products and in best-of lists.The game challenges users to identify a song title and artist as quickly as possible after it starts playing. Last August, Beat the Intro started asking users who wanted more than 30 minutes of gameplay to opt into a paid subscription service. While early returns are promising, Deakin says, they aren\u2019t yet sufficient to cover the cost of licensing its music catalog and streaming the songs to users.\u201cIf developers can&apos;t find a way to monetize their skills,\u201d Deakin says,\u00a0\u201cthey won&apos;t work with it.\u201d ","58":" A 3,000 percent jump in shares of Bio-Path Holdings Inc. over the past six trading sessions has left traders guessing what may be behind the rally.Thursday\u2019s nine-fold spike in volume triggered nine volatility halts as Bio-Path shares rose as much as 512 percent to their highest levels since November 2017.

Decision is independent of upgrade to Emerging Market Status Hold everything!Argentine stock investors were riled up late Tuesday after a statement by index provider MSCI Inc said it was keeping the country in its Frontier Emerging Markets index.The index provider said it will temporarily keep Argentina in the Frontier Emerging Markets index (FEM), and will revisit that decision in August. That\u2019s a different index from both the Frontier index (where Argentina has been stuck for years) and the Emerging Markets index, where it will be upgraded effective this May.MSCI\u2019s latest statement didn\u2019t refer to the upgrade from frontier to EM status, ringing alarm bells for stock investors who were immediately concerned it might jeopardize Argentina\u2019s long-awaited upgrade.\"We think the market\u2019s initial read through was that Argentina[\u2019s] formal reclassification to EM was going to be postponed till August, but this is not the right interpretation,\" Santiago Wesenack, head of equity research at local broker AR Partners, wrote in a note. The S&P Merval Index fell the most in a month Tuesday, which may have been a \"response to related speculations during the trading session,\" he added.Argentine stock investors, who were burned last year by a 50 percent collapse in stocks when measured in U.S. dollars, are holding out hope that stocks will rally once the index upgrade is effective come May. Investors are also bracing for greater volatility ahead of President Mauricio Macri seeking a second term in elections set for October.The announcement itself is actually good news, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which expects Argentina\u2019s stocks could receive $1.4 billion in passive inflows from the upgrade.\"We view this announcement as positive as Argentina will now be part of both EM (starting May-2019) and remain in the FEM index, limiting potential outflows from its removal,\" Bank of America analysts led by Nicole Inui wrote in a note.In its statement, MSCI said its reasoning for keeping Argentina in the FEM index was the \"significant currency devaluation\" last year, even though its usual threshold for the decision is gross national income.MSCI representatives weren\u2019t immediately available for further comment. ","60":"PC market weakness holds back revenue growth, CFO Hood Says. Concerns about overall cloud demand hang over tech industry Microsoft Corp. reported second-quarter sales that met projections, though weakness in the personal-computer market and broader concern about slowing cloud-services growth sent the shares lower in late trading.Adjusted profit in the period ended Dec. 31 rose to $8.58 billion, or $1.10 a share, compared with the $1.09 average estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 12 percent to $32.5 billion, Microsoft said Wednesday in a statement, matching predictions.Microsoft\u2019s market value soared above its peers during the quarter as investors bet the company\u2019s cloud and enterprise-software business was more stable than other parts of the technology market. While Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud-services revenue grew 76 percent, the closely watched segment\u2019s growth rates have slowed from the near-doubling that business posted each quarter in 2017 and early 2018. At the same time, the PC market, which had been showing signs of stability, resumed a steeper decline in the December period.\"Microsoft went through a period of hyper-growth -- they are still seeing growth, but the comparable numbers have gotten harder,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \"The company went from massive beats to an in-line quarter and that\u2019s been a dose of reality as it wasn\u2019t the blowout some people hoped.\"Microsoft shares slipped about 4 percent in extended trading after the report. They had closed up 3.3 percent at $106.38 in regular New York trading. The stock recovered some of the losses after a conference call with analysts, when the company forecast a \"solid\" March quarter in the commercial business and continued improvements in cloud margins.The company\u2019s stock fell 11 percent in the three months ended in December, hitting a low point late in the year, as concerns emerged that tech spending was slowing, particularly in areas like PCs. Still, the stock\u2019s decline was smaller than the 14 percent drop in the S&P 500 Index, as investors bet Microsoft\u2019s revenue was more insulated from any potential deceleration in spending on technology devices and internet ads.Commercial cloud sales rose 48 percent to $9 billion in the fiscal second quarter, while margins in that business widened by 5 percentage points to 62 percent, Microsoft said in slides on its website. Margins provide a measure of profitability.Investors are scouring results from cloud-computing companies for any signs of weakness after years of robust expansion. On Monday, graphics-chip maker Nvidia Corp. slashed its revenue outlook, saying that deteriorating economic conditions caused customers to hold off purchases of high-end gaming chips, while data-center clients avoided signing deals at the close of December. Intel Corp., the world\u2019s second-biggest semiconductor maker, slid last week after a disappointing 2019 forecast that also cited a slowdown in spending by the biggest cloud-computing companies. Network-equipment seller Juniper Networks Inc. also cited weakness from cloud customers for a negative revenue outlook. More broadly, business leaders and the International Monetary Fund are warning the global economy is slowing faster than expected.The flurry of downbeat news heightened concerns that cloud-infrastructure services leader Amazon.com Inc., which reports earnings Thursday, and No. 2 Microsoft might be slowing spending on data centers and equipment. Investors are speculating that cloud providers may have built enough capacity, especially if demand for internet-based services is also softening.Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said cloud demand held up in the recent quarter, and the company continues to spend to build out its cloud offerings. \"We\u2019re not seeing those signals,\" she said of the gloomy reports from chipmakers. The company will boost capital expenditures in the current period to invest in cloud-data centers after some of that spending came in a bit below her forecast in the second quarter, she said.Hood cited the PC market as the source of the company\u2019s failure to beat analysts\u2019 second-quarter sales estimates, noting that revenue from copies of Windows software sold pre-installed on PCs fell 5 percent, impacted by a shortage of microprocessors. That will continue into the current quarter, she said.While most Microsoft investors focus intently on the cloud numbers, the Redmond, Washington-based company still gets a large portion of revenue and profit from personal-computer software. Global PC shipments fell 4.3 percent during the holiday quarter, held back by political and economic uncertainties that crimped demand, according to market research firm Gartner Inc. That ended two quarters of relative stability in a market that has been contracting for years.\"Desktop software is their old legacy business and we know the PC market is stinky,\" said Daniel Morgan, a fund manager at Synovus Trust Company. \"That\u2019s a risk for Microsoft.\"Microsoft\u2019s Productivity division, mostly sales of Office programs, saw second-quarter sales rise 13 percent to $10.1 billion, in line with the average estimate of four analysts polled by Bloomberg. Intelligent Cloud sales rose 20 percent to $9.38 billion. That compares with a $9.27 billion estimate. Revenue in the More Personal Computing division, which includes Windows and Xbox, rose 6.8 percent to $12.99 billion. Analysts had expected $13.08 billion on average.In the current quarter, the Intelligent Cloud unit will see revenue rise about 17 percent, including a 2 percent decline related to the impact of a strong U.S. dollar, Hood said on the call. ","61":"Kurian to grow enterprise sales force for specific industries. Alphabet costs are already rising on Google Cloud headcount Google\u2019s cloud boss wants to fix a problem that\u2019s hampered the business for its entire existence. The internet giant has great technology but doesn\u2019t sell it well to large companies.Thomas Kurian, an Oracle Corp. veteran who took over Google Cloud in November, said he will hire more salespeople, train them to specialize on specific industries, and aggressively pursue larger, more traditional companies. He\u2019s also striking new deals with systems integrators -- firms that help organizations execute big IT projects.\u201cA lot of Google\u2019s historical focus was on digital natives,\u201d Kurian said Tuesday, referring to younger firms born on the internet that comfortably embrace cloud services. Kurian will take on the tougher task of persuading bigger, older telecom, retail, health-care, and financial-services companies to rent Google\u2019s offerings over the internet.\u201cYou\u2019ll see us specializing a lot more in these verticals,\" he added at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. tech conference, in one of his first public comments since replacing Diane Greene.Google\u2019s cloud business, which offers computing power, data storage and productivity software like Docs, Sheets and Gmail, trails Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in the massive and growing market. The division is one of Google\u2019s largest besides advertising. It\u2019s a key part of the company\u2019s effort to diversify from a business model that sucks up mountains of user data and is increasingly coming under fire from regulators and privacy advocates.Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has tried to sell cloud services to larger companies for years, and Greene was brought in because of her experience with these customers. In the past three years, Google\u2019s cloud sales force has roughly quadrupled. There have been some big customer wins, but the internet giant still ranks third in the market.Kurian\u2019s strategy for improving this echoed some of Greene\u2019s previous efforts, but his comments suggest Google will focus on a narrower set of industries and create more tailored offerings -- with help from an even larger enterprise sales force. A telecom company will need help monitoring its network and making its call centers more efficient, while a finance firm wants different things, he said.All those news salespeople won\u2019t come cheap though. Headcount and new data centers for the cloud business have already pushed up Google\u2019s costs, making investors nervous.Kurian is also planning to use one of Google\u2019s advantages over Amazon. The online search giant doesn\u2019t compete directly with retailers and the new cloud CEO touted this neutrality as a key selling point. \u201cGoogle is very clear that we\u2019re here to enable partners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to compete with partners.\u201dKurian said he chose to join Google after speaking with the company\u2019s customers. \u201cUniformly, the feedback I got is it\u2019s by far the best technology in the market,\u201d he added.Now he has to persuade big companies to actually use and pay for this technology. If they do, Kurian plans to have their executives speak at conferences and other events to encourage more firms to get on board, creating faster growth down the road.Alphabet shares gained 2.1 percent in New York as the broader stock market climbed on optimism over trade talks and a tentative deal to avert a U.S. government shutdown. ","62":"Software maker\u2019s transition moving in fits and starts. Ellison says key autonomous database product gaining traction Oracle Corp.\u2019s shares fell after the company gave a disappointing fourth-quarter revenue and profit forecast, another setback in the software maker\u2019s push to become a significant player in cloud computing.Sales in the current period will be little changed or decline as much as 2 percent from a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said on a conference call, meaning it could become the fourth consecutive quarter with falling sales. Profit, excluding some expenses, will be $1.05 to $1.09 a share, compared with an average analyst prediction of $1.09, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Safra CatzOracle shares fell about 4 percent in extended trading following the report, after closing at $53.05. The stock has gained 17 percent so far this year.Oracle has built up a wide array of internet-based programs in a bid to steal market share from cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. Yet the company has struggled to persuade corporate customers to replace existing software run from their own computer servers -- especially when it comes to its most lucrative products, such as databases. To compensate for the slow progress, Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd, who shares the role with Catz, has set a goal of reaching 50 percent market share in internet-based applications. The result has been a teetering journey to the cloud that may stall in the current period.Revenue in the period ended Feb. 28 was $9.61 billion, the Redwood City, California-based company said earlier on Thursday in a statement. Analysts had predicted $9.59 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some expenses, was 87 cents a share, compared with estimates of 84 cents.Revenue from cloud services and license support gained 1 percent to $6.66 billion in the third quarter, Oracle said. While that metric includes revenue from hosting customers\u2019 data on the cloud, a large portion of the total is likely to be from maintenance fees for traditional software housed on clients\u2019 servers. The unit accounted for more than 69 percent of total revenue.Cloud license and on-premise license sales decreased 4 percent to $1.25 billion, but were flat without the impact of currency fluctuations.

Instead, clients are taking advantage of Oracle\u2019s Bring Your Own License program, in which a company can move existing software to Oracle\u2019s cloud without signing a new deal.Oracle Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison said that the company\u2019s autonomous database, a version of the software that was designed for the cloud, is gaining traction with clients.

","63":"Homes sit on market, prices cut in Seattle and the Bay Area. Spring selling season approaches with increases in inventory The real estate frenzies in West Coast cities have become the stuff of lore: buyers jostling at open houses, homes getting offers sight unseen, bids coming in hundreds of thousands of dollars over asking.That\u2019s all over now.Just ask Kelly Randall, an Amazon employee who listed her renovated Seattle condo for $539,000 -- a bargain compared with the $615,000 her friend got last year for a smaller place in the same building. Almost four months and four price cuts later, Randall\u2019s still waiting for an offer.\u201cMy timing sucks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201dA townhouse for sale in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle.For the first time in years, the U.S. is entering its key spring house-hunting season with buyers holding the upper hand. Nowhere is the shift more pronounced than in once-hot areas such as Seattle, San Francisco and Denver, where bidding wars are vanishing, time-on-market is climbing and prices are flattening, or even falling. These western cities, the center of the recent housing boom, are now leading the slowdown.The reasons are varied, from last year\u2019s spike in mortgage rates to volatility in technology stocks. But the simplest explanation is that years of soaring values have put housing in many areas out of reach to all but the most affluent buyers. In many parts of the West, home prices have more than doubled from the recession while incomes have climbed far less.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge disparity,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. \u201cPeople can\u2019t catch up.\u201d Homebuyers have more options across major Western marketsSource: RedfinNote: Data represent total homes for sale as of February in each metro areaWith prices slipping and more inventory coming up for the busiest time for home selling, buyers who have the means will have a new opportunity to enter the market. Sellers, meanwhile, face a \u201creality check,\u201d Yun said.\u201cThis is what it looks like when the pendulum starts to go the other way,\u201d said Felipe Chacon, a housing economist at Trulia.Seattle is a prime example of the reversal. The area\u2019s median single-family home price doubled since 2012 to $560,000, fueled by an Amazon-led tech boom that brought in a flood of highly paid workers. Houses regularly sold within a week, sometimes garnering 10 or more offers, with buyers waiving home inspections and financing contingencies.Now, the tables are turning. The median single-family home prices in King County, which includes Seattle, fell 3 percent on a price-per-square foot basis in January, the first annual decline since 2012, according to brokerage Redfin. Roughly a sixth of the metro area\u2019s listings had price cuts in the 12 months through January, twice the previous year\u2019s rate, Trulia data show.It may just be a brief respite after years of mania. Seattle\u2019s economy and hiring remain strong, and housing is still tight compared with other parts of the country. Home sales have started to pick up from a tepid fall and winter, real estate agents say.But there\u2019s no question the house hunt has become easier for people such as Hector Perez, who moved to Seattle last year for an Amazon job and had heard horror stories about the crazy market. The Texas transplant and his wife, Kate, were pleasantly surprised when they zeroed in on a new home in the Queen Anne neighborhood that had been on the market for more than half a year.Hector and Kate Perez in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle.Already, about $160,000 had been knocked off of the initial list price of almost $1.4 million. When the seller asked if they could do an inspection in five days, the couple said they were traveling and threatened to walk if they couldn\u2019t get 10.\u201cIt was a bit of a risk, but they came back and said, \u2018OK,\u201d\u2019 Perez said. \u201cWe had a little bit of leverage that we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have.\u201dThe invisible hand of Amazon may once again be playing a role in the market. There are concerns that the company, which occupies about a fifth of Seattle\u2019s prime office space, may be slowing its growth in the city. Last month, the tech giant said it doesn\u2019t plan to move into the space it leased in a new 37-story tower being built downtown. Amazon, which still has thousands of positions open in the city, declined to comment.The broad cooling indicates that there are greater forces at play than a single company or industry. Home sales in January were at 11-year lows in both Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area, CoreLogic Inc. reported. Prices in both the Portland, Oregon, and Denver areas fell this year for the first time since 2012, according to local multiple listings services.In the Bay Area, San Francisco\u2019s market may get a boost as the pending initial public offerings of Lyft Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and Pinterest Inc. mint millionaires, according to Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst in the region for the brokerage Compass. But in Silicon Valley, there\u2019s been a dramatic slowdown, he said. Santa Clara County -- home of Google and Apple Inc. -- saw its median house price fall 1 percent in the fourth quarter to $1.25 million, after a 27 percent surge a year earlier.\u201cSanta Clara was unbelievably hot,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut there has been a reaction to the high prices. When you add in last year\u2019s rise in interest rates and the fact that their stock portfolio dropped, suddenly it made people a lot more cautious.\u201dCaution was apparent on a recent sunny Saturday morning in Northwest Seattle\u2019s Whittier Heights neighborhood as Ruslan Polyak propped up an open house sign by the front door of a yellow townhouse. Recognizing the market\u2019s slowdown, he had listed it last month for $810,000, even though an identical unit sold last spring for $835,000, almost $100,000 above asking, he said.Negotiations are welcome, he told a buyer attending the open house: \u201cMy client\u2019s super reasonable.\u201dLater that day, Polyak cut the price to $787,000.Randall, the Amazon employee, is waiting for her condo to sell so she can buy a new town home she signed a contract to purchase in November. In a sign of the market\u2019s softness, the builder is working with her, reducing the agreed-upon price as she\u2019s had to lower her own asking price. It\u2019s now $480,000, a $59,000 reduction from the original listing.Her agent, Bill Jones with Every Door Real Estate, said the changing market isn\u2019t all bad: \u201cI don\u2019t mind not having to compete with 12 other people to win a client a house.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Spencer Soper ","64":"JPMorgan warns its Street-low price target now looks generous.

","65":" He\u2019s not dead, he\u2019s resting.Last year, the wave of mainland money piling\u00a0into Chinese technology companies pushed\u00a0valuations into bubble territory. That made life difficult for foreign private equity firms that have\u00a0to make new investments to survive \u2014\u00a0but there\u2019s a glimmer of light at the end of this investing tunnel. Fundraising from rich Chinese entrepreneurs and shadow banks is drying up, so there could be less cash competing for\u00a0returns\u00a0in future.More than a third of private equity money newly invested in the Asia-Pacific region last year was in China tech and internet plays, according\u00a0to Bain & Co. With so much money chasing a limited number of targets, valuations inevitably climbed: The median enterprise value\u00a0for Chinese internet and tech takeovers was 31 times Ebitda, twice as high as for other industries in greater China\u00a0and 2.4 times greater than the median multiple for Asia-Pacific deals in 2016-2018, said Bain.Even private equity firms that invested earlier in a Chinese tech firm\u2019s fundraising process haven\u2019t been doing as well as they once were. In 2014-2015, investors in greater China internet and technology firms\u00a0exited with about 4.7 times the amount they put\u00a0in, according to Johanne Dessard, a director at Bain. By 2016-2018, that had fallen to less than two times.\u00a0As we\u2019ve seen in the share price\u00a0performance of tech businesses such as smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp.\u00a0and food delivery app Meituan Dianping, getting an initial public offering away doesn\u2019t necessarily stop the rot:\u00a0Of the 10 biggest Chinese new economy firms to list  in the last 12 months, five are trading under waterSource: BloombergNote: The data look at listings in Hong Kong and the U.S. A hefty 62 percent of private equity-owned Chinese internet and software companies\u00a0that went public in 2017 and 2018 lost more than 30 percent of their\u00a0market value in the first 12 months after listing. That compares to an average\u00a0increase of 105 percent for companies that listed in\u00a02015 and 2016.\u00a0The\u00a0honeymoon was bound to end, because the mountain of Chinese cash seeking returns has been\u00a0shrinking.\u00a0Yuan-denominated fundraising fell for the first time in eight years in 2018.\u00a0Money from peer-to-peer lenders dried up amid Beijing\u2019s crackdown on the sector, while\u00a0China\u2019s decision to put brakes on domestic IPOs to support\u00a0the stock market blocked\u00a0the exit door for potential investors.For the first time in eight years, dollar fundraising by private equity firms investing in China outweighed yuan fundsSource: Centre for Asia Private Equity Research Ltd. Note: The U.S. dollar funds invest in Chinese companies and also firms with a mainland angle. (For instance, those whose aim is to expand in China. ) It\u2019s been a striking reversal. After foreign and onshore firms were allowed to\u00a0raise yuan-denominated private equity funds in late 2006, the segment raced to overtake the dollar market in Asia. With rich Chinese entrepreneurs and peer-to-peer lenders piling in, by 2009 yuan funds raised\u00a0$9.1 billion, compared to $3 billion for dollar funds, according to the Centre for Asia Private Equity Research.That trend persisted\u00a0until last year, when the government\u2019s  crackdown on the asset management sector plus a tanking stock market caused mainland investors to retreat. In 2018, $34.5 billion was raised for dollar funds while $10.9 billion was raised in yuan, with fundraising dominated by Hong Kong-based megafunds Hillhouse Capital Management Ltd. and PAG. Hillhouse raised\u00a0$10.6 billion\u00a0and PAG\u00a0$6 billion\u00a0in their most recent rounds.The other major source of onshore money is also drying up. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are still cash-rich, but they\u2019re getting pickier about investing after high-profile failures like  bike-sharing firm Ofo, posing a further challenge for  startups already struggling with funding.The slowdown in mainland fundraising doesn\u2019t mean the end for Chinese tech firms. There\u2019s still a lot of dry powder: Committed but unspent capital hit a record\u00a0$317 billion in the Asia-Pacific at the end of last year, enough to fund three years of investing at the current pace. And the Shanghai stock exchange is looking to set up a Nasdaq-style tech board, which may\u00a0buoy valuations.That could be enough to allow\u00a0foreign private equity firms to\u00a0get a reprieve this year and pick some targets.\u00a0After years competing with Chinese money for mainland targets, and losing, offshore investors may finally have the upper hand again.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Retail investors lapped up Hyundai Rotem shares in past year US President Donald Trump poses with North Korea&apos;s leader Kim Jong Un before a meeting at the Sofitel Legend Metropole hotel in Hanoi on February 27.For Jung Jae-hoon, a 37-year-old day trader in South Korea, the botched Trump-Kim summit was a success: The volatility that rattled the market helped him earn a nice profit.Minutes before the market closed on Feb. 28, so-called peace stocks -- a group of companies that stand to benefit from increased economic ties with North Korea -- started to plunge on bets that U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un would fail to reach an agreement at their Hanoi summit.Jung seized the opportunity and bought shares in the group, adding some more the next trading day and selling them as they rebounded. In total, he invested about $300,000 and made as much as 10 percent from his bets.\u201cIt\u2019s just like the cryptocurrency market,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Ulsan, a southern portal city in South Korea. \u201cThere are at least 100 stocks known as peace stocks. They are mostly tiny, penny stocks. Many individual investors just trade peace stocks with little information on the issue, hoping for once-in-a-lifetime return.\u201dThe shares typically move on speculation for business with North Korea. Whenever there is increased newsflow about the relationship with the reclusive regime -- such as the Trump-Kim gathering last month -- volatility and volume tend to surge.That\u2019s just what happened with some of the biggest peace stocks. Trading in Hyundai Elevator Co., which holds a stake in a company that has the right to develop a tourism business in North Korea, surged to levels not seen since May of last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Train maker Hyundai Rotem Co. was the second-most bought stock among retail investors over the past year. Hyundai Elevator and Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. were also among the top 10, according to the data.In addition to Hyundai Elevator, Jung traded shares including Ananti Inc., a resort operator that counts U.S. investor Jim Rogers as an external director, and Good People Co., which until 2016 ran a factory in North Korea\u2019s Gaeseong Industrial Complex. After selling peace stocks, he then went with the opposite bet, adding weapons makers such as Hanwha Aerospace Co., he said.Shares of some peace stocks fluctuated on Monday after a report that North Korea could be preparing to launch a missile or rocket in the near future. Hyundai Elevator slipped 0.9 percent after rising as much as 1 percent, while Hyundai Rotem fell as much after climbing 0.9 percent. The benchmark Kospi index was little changed. For owners of peace stocks, it\u2019s been a roller-coaster ride. When the United Nations imposed additional sanctions against North Korea back in August 2017, the regime responded by threatening to attack a U.S. base in Guam and launched of a missile.

The positive events that followed -- the historic summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim in April, the demolition of North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site in May, and the first summit between Trump and Kim in June -- boosted hopes for peace.

","71":" The Oracle of Omaha should go ahead and feel chatty.Warren Buffett\u2019s annual letters to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders have felt a bit dry in recent years. Perhaps it was the noticeable  reduction in dirty-grandpa humor, or the fact that the world\u2019s most renowned dealmaker  hasn\u2019t had a\u00a0transaction to crow about since 2016.\u00a0But for this year\u2019s missive, expected to arrive on Saturday morning, Buffett has provided himself with plenty of fodder \u2014 if only he\u2019ll use it to answer two nagging questions for investors:Buffett just hasn\u2019t  seemed like himself lately. Not only has the sharp rise in takeover valuations kept him on the M&A sidelines, but in the meantime Berkshire\u00a0has become a top investor in some of the biggest software companies despite Buffett\u2019s long aversion to tech-related bets. The company\u2019s peculiar stock-picking moves in the fourth quarter, disclosed in a filing last week, added more intrigue: It bought shares of Red Hat Inc., dumped its short-lived Oracle Corp. stake and cut back on Apple Inc.Berkshire Hathaway has stepped up tech investments in recent quartersSource: BloombergBerkshire\u2019s jumping in and out of software investments is\u00a0something a Buffett follower would have never predicted just a couple of years ago. It had a large position in International Business Machines Corp. that it exited in early 2018. Now, it has a stake in Red Hat, which IBM is acquiring. That $34 billion all-cash deal was announced on Oct. 28, so we\u2019re left to assume that either Buffett is quite literally the Oracle of Omaha, or he\u2019s playing merger arbitrageur (Red Hat shares were trading at a significant discount to IBM\u2019s offer). And for an investor who has always preached about taking a long-term view, Berkshire also took a $2.1 billion stake in Oracle in the third quarter, then sold it the next.Some of Berkshire\u2019s recent stock-market activity is explained by the increased responsibility Buffett has awarded to Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, his investing deputies. One of them turned him on to Apple initially, another purchase that came as a surprise to Buffett\u2019s followers.\n            \n\n                1\n            \n        \u00a0Even though Berkshire sold nearly 3 million Apple shares in the latest quarter, it\u2019s still 21 percent of the portfolio.Four companies account for more than half of Berkshire Hathaway&apos;s equity holdingsSource: BloombergBut with Buffett turning 89 this summer, one has to wonder whether these are early signs of how Berkshire will look when he\u2019s no longer around and if its culture will always have that Buffett feel. His annual letters aren\u2019t known for their element of surprise and have become almost formulaic, usually repeating affirmations about the health of the U.S. economy and conducting autopsies of past business decisions. Buffett should stray from that approach this year and use the letter to  provide more transparency\u00a0about the future of his company \u2014 especially when it comes to all its cash.Berkshire had about $104 billion in cash as of September, which marked one year since it reached\u00a012 figures. For Buffett, the ideal use would be another giant acquisition to add to his empire, and when stocks sold off broadly at the end of 2018, it seemed as if\u00a0he finally had his opening. I\u00a0suspected another Valentine\u2019s Day deal. Berkshire\u2019s 2013 buyout of HJ Heinz with 3G Capital was announced on the romantic holiday, which is also the day Berkshire reports its market holdings. Speaking of Heinz, Buffett would also be well served by explaining his plans for Berkshire\u2019s big stake in Kraft Heinz Co., a deal that he helped orchestrate that has turned sour.\u00a0\u00a0The longer Buffett waits to spend his cash pile, the more likely it is that this asset turns into an immense burden for his successor. No\u00a0matter how skilled the next in line \u2014\u00a0Greg Abel? Ajit Jain? \u2014 is, they will be missing one crucial advantage that Buffett\u00a0has long enjoyed in M&A negotiations: his name. The idea of selling to and working for him \u2014 instead of to another suitor that might have gut the business to save on costs \u2014 probably persuaded a lot of targets in the end, perhaps even to accept a lower offer than others would have made  amid the U.S. takeover frenzy of the last few years.\u00a0Buffett hasn\u2019t done enough\u00a0yet to ensure a smooth transition. The next generation of leaders is clearly already leaving its mark\u00a0on the company. His shifting stock investments are proof of that, and Combs even  facilitated the  Precision Castparts acquisition, Berkshire\u2019s last significant deal.\u00a0Warren Buffett&apos;s annual letter to shareholders was briefer than usual last yearSource: BloombergLast year\u2019s Buffett letter was the shortest one in more than two decades. He can afford to go a little long-winded this time to shed some light on the changes afoot.\u00a0That said, Buffett has always been drawn to companies with strong, durable brands like Apple&apos;s, and -- cover your ears, Apple shareholders -- the iPhone maker is more of a consumer-products company than a tech one anyway. Red Hat and Oracle are far more unusual for Berkshire.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. Should anything be gleaned about the future of Berkshire from its relatively new, and recently erratic, interest in technology investments?If Buffett didn\u2019t find a significant acquisition in\u00a0December\u2019s market swoon, then when will he?\u00a0\n\nThat said, Buffett has always been drawn to companies with strong, durable brands like Apple&apos;s, and -- cover your ears, Apple shareholders -- the iPhone maker is more of a consumer-products company than a tech one anyway.

You need to \u201claunder\u201d the dough \u2014 make the dirty money appear to be the proceeds of legitimate enterprise. Then it can be spent anywhere in the world \u2014 say, on real estate or luxury yachts \u2014 no questions asked. Most countries and all the world\u2019s major banks have controls in place to flag suspicious funds coming into the financial system. But as shown by the so-called Troika Laundromat scandal and the probes roiling European banks, bad actors come up with innovative ways to skirt the rules.Deliberately opaque \u201cshell\u201d companies, which exist only on paper and have no active business operations, are easy and cheap to set up and effective at obscuring ownership. They\u2019re key to what experts call the \u201clayering phase\u201d of money laundering, in which funds are shoveled around multiple times to make them harder to track. Shell companies are commonly found in traditional tax havens such as Switzerland and the Cayman Islands, but the U.S. states of Delaware and Nevada also permit corporations to be set up in anonymity. The international consortium of journalists that uncovered the Troika Laundromat scheme says it involved at least 75 shell companies that generated a total of $8.8 billion in transactions through made-up deals. There\u2019s been a global push for more transparency, even in the U.K., whose crown dependencies include Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.After the chaotic collapse of Soviet Union, launderers searched out weak spots in Europe, where watchdogs were ill-equipped. They looked for banks that might be poorly supervised or even open to being complicit. Torrents of cash were channeled into banks in Cyprus and Malta. Baltic nations Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, which have central roles in the emerging tale of dirty Russian money, became big players as passageways to the West. The former Soviet states had an added draw because Russian is widely spoken, and Scandinavian lenders rushed to get into the high-growth markets. By way of western correspondent banks, funds could be further cleansed and moved around with less scrutiny. Denmark\u2019s Danske Bank A\/S has acknowledged that much of about $230 billion that flowed through its tiny Estonian outpost may have been dirty.Criminals can move funds across borders by engaging in seemingly legitimate international trading of goods and falsifying invoices to disguise their true value. Such trade-based laundering was key to the Troika Laundromat scheme, where bogus invoices were allegedly used to trade \u201cfood goods,\u201d \u201cmetal goods\u201d and \u201cauto parts.\u201d The method is widely used to enable outflows from developing economies. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based research organization, estimates that \u201ctrade misinvoicing\u201d accounts for 18 percent of developing nations\u2019 trade with developed economies.A \u201cmirror trade\u201d is two stock transactions, in two separate locations, that effectively cancel each other out but succeed in moving money from one place to another. Mirror trades have legitimate uses, and are employed by mutual funds and other investors that have limits on where they can hold securities. But such trades can also be used to bring money across borders. In one infamous example, Deutsche Bank AG helped clients move about $10 billion out of Russia from 2011 to 2015 by executing mirror transactions in its offices in Moscow and London. The bank was fined $629 million by U.K. and U.S. authorities for those compliance failures. A criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department has yet to conclude. Another technique, sometimes known as a back-to-back deal, is to take a loan in one country that\u2019s secured by a deposit in another country. The launderer defaults on the loan, the bank seizes the deposit and the money looks clean. The fact that both types of transactions have legitimate applications makes them harder to stop.It\u2019s difficult to tell the difference between legitimate business and illicit flows from criminal activity. Launderers sometimes work with real companies that generate lots of cash, merging their funds before they head to the bank. Casinos and other cash-based operations such as restaurants are attractive targets. A common scheme involving casinos is to buy large amounts of chips in cash, gamble just a tiny share, then call the rest winnings and redeem the funds. Even more effective is owning the whole casino. Macau, the world\u2019s biggest gambling hub, has long been beset by money laundering despite repeated attempts by China\u2019s government to rein it in. Canada found last year that casinos in British Columbia for years served unwittingly as laundromats for domestic and international crime. The expansion of online gaming and sports betting, where identities are easy to conceal, provide new opportunities, as do cryptocurrencies.To avoid raising red flags, money launderers will break down a large amount of money into smaller chunks and have associates known as \u201csmurfs\u201d deposit the funds in different accounts in different places. U.S. banks are required to report to regulatory authorities any transaction of more than $10,000, so launderers often avoid hitting that limit. Banks must continuously track customer transactions to look for red flags, and if they have good reason to suspect something devious, they must alert authorities. Failure to do so can bring stiff fines. Banks often complain that the rules are onerous and the controls needed to \"know your customer\" are costly. Danske Bank increased the number of employees in compliance after its money-laundering scandal exploded, and now has more than 1,000 people assigned to monitor and prevent financial crime.\u2014 With assistance by Greg Farrell, Heather Smith, Laurence Arnold, Leonid Bershidsky, and Gregory White Bloomberg\u2019s interactive map of notable enforcement efforts around the world.A report from Bloomberg Intelligence on the cost of compliance.

First post-bailout report forecasts higher 2019 growth rate Greek banks need more capital and the economy faces many risks that could derail its budget, according to the International Monetary Fund.\u201cDownside risks, not least from legal challenges to past fiscal measures, recent labor market policy decisions, and election uncertainty, have increased,\u201d IMF staff said in the fund\u2019s first post-bailout monitoring report on Greece. The report highlighted the ailing banking sector as a threat to growth.Greece marked an end to eight years in bailout programs last year, and is now testing its ability to function without creditors dictating the policies it can pursue. The IMF hasn\u2019t disbursed any loans to the country since 2014, but it still exerts influence since its usually critical reports help European creditor governments keep pressure on Greece to continue reforms.Greece&apos;s cash buffer means it doesn&apos;t have to tap markets in next few yearsSource: IMFEuro-area finance ministers on Monday withheld disbursement of some 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of debt relief after determining that the country had not fulfilled all of the necessary reform conditions.

Chipmakers had forecast weaker spending on data-center parts Cloud-computing companies have a message for skittish investors: demand is still booming.Earnings reports from the biggest providers of internet-based computing services \u2013 Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google \u2013 showed that these companies are grabbing a larger share of business technology spending, defying warnings from some of their suppliers that a hot corner of the industry might be cooling off.The cloud giants entered the year facing questions about whether they could sustain their robust growth rates in an environment of uncertain global economic growth and investment. And at the start of fourth-quarter earnings season last month, investors got some worrying news from companies that sell the networking equipment and computer chips that go into the data centers that underpin the cloud. Intel Corp., Micron Technology Inc. and Juniper Networks Inc. were among those blaming lackluster results on slower spending by data-center customers.Now, investors have some reason to be relieved. On Monday, Google reported sales in its \"other revenue\" segment, a bucket that includes the Google Cloud Platform, of $6.49 billion in the fourth quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier. Capital expenditures at Google soared 80 percent, to $6.8 billion. While the stock declined in extended trading on concerns about how the investments will impact profitability, much of the higher spending is tied to new data centers and related hardware -- a signal that demand for cloud services is holding up.Cloud-computing division growth continues to hold upSource: BloombergNote: 0Q is the most recent fiscal quarter for each companyLast week, Amazon reported that its web services division, the leader in providing rented computing infrastructure from its data centers, saw revenue grow 45 percent in the fourth quarter, holding the same pace as the prior period. So did the gains at Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud group, where sales expanded by 76 percent. Finance chief Amy Hood said the software maker wasn\u2019t seeing any signs of a slowdown in demand for internet-based programs and services. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. posted 84 percent growth in its own cloud unit.\"The move to the cloud continues and all the cloud providers are gaining,\u201d said Kim Forrest, a senior portfolio manager with Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC. \u201cNobody is losing, it\u2019s just some people are faster than others.\"Many analysts say businesses are still in the early years of a major shift in how they buy technology, reducing their reliance on stocking and maintaining their own data centers and backroom servers. Instead, many are opting to power their operations using software rented from cloud-computing giants, turning previously consumer-focused companies like Amazon and Google into bellwethers of business technology use.Market researcher Canalys estimated that cloud-infrastructure spending climbed 46 percent in the December quarter to almost $23 billion, bringing investment for 2018 to more than $80 billion. And Synergy Research Group, which closely tracks information technology spending, last month increased its long-term forecasts for cloud-computing demand. Growth by companies\u2019 cloud units has slowed as their businesses matured, but have so far defied expectations for a major pullback.\"We had some pretty aggressive growth forecasts in place already,\" said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research. \"The actual growth metrics are beyond the norms of what we\u2019d normally expect in a large, high-growth market.\"Amazon, which in recent years has spent billions of dollars on equipment to build data centers, did tap the brakes a bit on spending through the middle of last year. The company reversed course in the fourth quarter, ramping up its purchases of property and capital leases, two line items that include some spending on data centers for Amazon Web Services. An executive indicated that outlays may grow further this year.Amazon\u2019s fourth-quarter increase in capital expenditures, 17 percent, \u201cis a low number for us when you talk about supporting the AWS business that\u2019s still growing at a high clip,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a conference call last week.On Jan. 24, Intel, which supplies about 99 percent of the processors that run servers, raised alarms when it blamed a weak revenue forecast in part on a slowdown in spending from large cloud-computing customers. The company\u2019s revenue from cloud providers rose by 24 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 50 percent increase in the prior three months. Overall its server-chip unit posted a 9 percent revenue expansion, held back by a decline in spending by corporations and government agencies. Memory-chip maker Micron in December cited a buildup of unused stockpiles among customers, sparking concern that spending on key components of servers will weaken.Part of the disconnect between cloud providers\u2019 upbeat outlook and the caution from Intel and Micron could boil down to differing expectations for what happens when a wave of data centers under construction come online.Analysts with Jefferies said in a research note that data-center related revenue at Intel and its main competitors grew much faster than historical trends in the last year. After previous similar spikes, growth cooled off for as long as a year as companies worked to fill their new server racks with customer workloads, the analysts wrote.Cloud-computing spending has proved difficult to forecast, said Simon Leopold, an analyst at Raymond James who covers technology infrastructure companies like Cisco Systems Inc. and Juniper.Historically, it was much easier to predict investment patterns from telecommunications companies like Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. because they would be very clear about what their capital spending plans were. That\u2019s not the case with cloud-computing providers, Leopold said, which tend to buy components for data centers unpredictably, and without a lot of lead time, favoring bulk purchases as they build new facilities or change the system design.Dinsdale, of Synergy Research, says short-term sales by chipmakers \"have almost zero bearing on the short-term sales of the big cloud providers.\" Builders of processors and networking components also have to deal with shifting demand from corporate data-center builders, as well as operators of search engines, and e-commerce and social media sites, among other customers.\"Bottom line, I wouldn\u2019t be losing too much sleep over the growth prospects of the hyperscale cloud providers,\" he said.\u2014 With assistance by Ian King, and Brandon Kochkodin ","75":"Gottlieb led drug agency since start of Trump administration. Drug stocks fall, tobacco stocks briefly rise after news U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is resigning, ending a tenure where he approved a flood of drugs and pushed for sharp curbs on e-cigarettes to halt what he called an epidemic of youth use.Gottlieb earned a reputation as an attentive and media-savvy regulator in a Trump administration that\u2019s taken a more hands-off approach in many other areas of oversight. A medical doctor, Gottlieb won over the agency\u2019s staff and became a celebrated figure among pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms and medical-device makers for moving swiftly to bring more innovative treatments to the marketplace.As FDA chief he also became a trusted adviser on prescription-drug prices and other health issues to President Donald Trump, who said on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon that Gottlieb \u201cwill be greatly missed.\u201dA senior FDA official said Gottlieb\u2019s resignation had been planned for some time, and that he was leaving the administration on amicable terms. Gottlieb, 46, had grown tired from a long commute each week back and forth to Connecticut, according to the person, and he felt like he\u2019d set in motion many of his goals on drug costs and e-cigarettes.Another person familiar with his thinking said that Gottlieb had also been frustrated by the government shutdown that in December shuttered many of the agency\u2019s activities for about a month.Trump said in a tweet that Gottlieb would leave \u201csometime next month.\u201d He took over as FDA commissioner in May 2017.....Scott has helped us to lower drug prices, get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market, and so many other things. He and his talents will be greatly missed!Speeding up the drug-approval process had been one of Gottlieb\u2019s top priorities from the start of his time heading the agency. The FDA approved 59 new novel medications in 2018, including highly anticipated drugs to treat migraines. That was a jump from the 22 such medications cleared in 2016, and 45 in 2015, the last two years of the Obama administration.Gottlieb was also a key player in the Trump administration\u2019s push to lower pharmaceutical costs. Those efforts focused on approving hundreds of new generic medications, as well as targeting industry tactics that he and others blamed for keeping prices high.The departure of Gottlieb, an adroit user of social media who like the president likes to communicate directly with the public, reverberated in the stock market. Shares of smaller, innovative drug companies, who have benefited from Gottlieb\u2019s efforts to modernize the approval process for novel therapies, slipped, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ending the day down 0.5 percent.Gottlieb also targeted the growing youth use of e-cigarettes after it became apparent that an earlier move to ease restrictions on the industry backfired. Teen vaping skyrocketed last year, pushing the commissioner to propose limits on where flavored products could be sold. He has recently said he would finalize that proposal in the next few weeks. He\u2019s also called out retailers including gas stations and pharmacies found to have sold tobacco to minors.In 2017, Gottlieb announced plans to potentially set nicotine levels in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels, but details haven\u2019t been released and the effort appears to have been overtaken by e-cigarettes.\u201cIf fully implemented, those key measures would significantly improve the health of our nation and reduce cancer death,\u201d Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said in a statement. \u201cThese proposals must move forward despite the commissioner\u2019s departure.\u201dTobacco-company stocks briefly jumped after Gottlieb\u2019s departure was reported, a sign that some investors see Gottlieb\u2019s departure as a possible opening for a more relaxed regulatory regime. Altria Group Inc., which has a large stake in vaping company Juul Labs Inc., gained as much as 2.7 percent in afternoon trading in New York.\u201cDespite the e-cigarette panic, he still could have undertaken his stated goal of educating Americans on the truth about nicotine,\u201d said Greg Conley, president of American Vaping Association, a group that advocates for e-cigarettes. \u201cHe failed in that mission.\u201dIn his resignation letter, Gottlieb trumpeted the FDA\u2019s recent success in rolling out policies to address youth tobacco use and opioid addiction, and touted the brisk pace of new drug approvals by the agency. He said that the FDA had expanded access to lifesaving drugs for patients with terminal illness on his watch.His efforts to help lower drug costs focused on easing generic drug approvals, particularly for copycats of treatments that didn\u2019t have much competition previously. The FDA approved a record 971 generic drugs in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. That number totaled 937 in fiscal 2017 and 835 in fiscal 2016.At the same time, the FDA conducted fewer surveillance inspections of drug manufacturers, dropping 11 percent in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017, a Bloomberg investigation found earlier this year. The inspections are meant to confirm medications are being made to meet U.S. standards and many generic-drug manufacturers in recent years have been found not to include in official records quality checks that show drugs failed to meet U.S. standards.He\u2019s also overseen a massive recall of blood-pressure medications made in India and China that have been found to contain potentially cancer-causing chemicals. Just last week, seven months after the first so-called angiotensin II receptor blockers were recalled, the FDA announced a third potential carcinogen had shown up in additional ARBs.The House Energy and Commerce Committee has asked the FDA for a briefing on the inspection numbers and the drug recall.Read more: Biotech stocks lost $9 billion in value after Gottlieb\u2019s resignationHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar praised Gottlieb as \u201can exemplary public health leader, aggressive advocate for American patients, and passionate promoter of innovation\u201d in an emailed statement. Azar lauded Gottlieb\u2019s record on drug approvals, opioids and tobacco.\u2014 With assistance by Ellen Huet ","76":" Trump\u2019s forgetting his history.\u00a0Trade talks between the U.S. and China seem to be hurtling toward a predictable conclusion -- the signing of a shallow deal that doesn\u2019t solve the real issues dividing the world\u2019s two largest economies. The coup de grace will likely come later this month in another high-profile summit between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.It\u2019s time to admit the \u201ccomprehensive\u201d pact Trump promised never really had a chance to come to fruition, precisely because of the way he chose to pursue it. What\u2019s worse, in his eagerness to tout any deal as a bigger and more transformative triumph than it\u2019s likely to be, he may well ensure it fails.From the beginning, Trump\u2019s tariff strategy not only displayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the Chinese economy and its problems, it was designed to entrench resistance in China. It\u2019s all too easy for outsiders to assume the People\u2019s Republic has no politics, especially after watching China\u2019s rubberstamp National People\u2019s Congress go through its annual motions in Beijing this week. Nevertheless, the Chinese Communist Party has its internal factional struggles and ideological agenda, as well as an image to uphold with the public, just like any other political party.The fact that Xi now thoroughly dominates the government also puts pressure on him to score successes and maintain a strong economic performance, since there\u2019s no longer anyone else to blame. That suggests he might be eager to end the trade war, especially as the Chinese economy slows down. While he does seem willing to give Trump enough to get a deal done, however, surrendering too much would be more dangerous for Xi politically than doing no deal at all.The reason is rooted in history, or at least the CCP version of it. A core element of the messaging the party uses to justify its rule is that it will right the perceived wrongs of the past. Beginning in the mid-1800s, Great Britain, France, the U.S. and others used force or the threat of force against a temporarily weakened China to extract pieces of territory, economic concessions and other demeaning violations of Chinese sovereignty through a series of \u201cunequal\u201d treaties. That\u2019s how the British got Hong Kong and\u00a0the Japanese Taiwan.Much of the purpose was to pry open a Chinese market that had been tightly restricted by the ruling Qing Dynasty. The CCP now argues that -- thanks to its skillful rule since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic in 1949 -- China is strong again and will avenge these past humiliations, reassuming its proper place at the center of the world economy.The state propaganda machine keeps the humiliation of China\u2019s surrender to \u201cgunboat diplomacy\u201d fresh in the public mind. In response to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s speech late last year on China policy, for instance, a commentary in the party-owned Global Times was quick to remind readers that \u201cthe U.S. had been one of the perpetrators of the indignities and exploitation that China suffered during the \u2018Century of Humiliation.\u2019\u201dThis narrative severely constrains Xi\u2019s flexibility. Whether the issue is China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea, its disputed border with India, or the legal case against Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.\u2019s chief financial officer, the government simply cannot be seen at home as kowtowing to bullying by foreigners.Trump\u2019s strategy -- aiming tariffs, if not cannon, at the Middle Kingdom -- willfully ignored this history and its role in current Chinese politics. And several of Washington\u2019s demands and threats verge on gunboat-style arrogance -- for instance, the U.S. proposal that it be allowed to reimpose tariffs if it decides China is reneging on its commitments, while Beijing would be forbidden to retaliate. The chances of Xi accepting such \u201cunequal\u201d conditions are virtually nil.The problem is that Trump\u2019s tariffs have hurt the U.S. economy enough, and have been such a source of uncertainty for investors, that he can\u2019t simply hold out for a better deal. Already in 2020 campaign mode and worried about declines in the stock market, Trump is reportedly pushing to wrap up negotiations quickly in hopes of sparking a rally.Those same pressures -- and criticism from Democrats of any weak deal -- will undoubtedly encourage Trump to trumpet his accomplishment as loudly as possible. That\u2019s precisely the wrong approach to take with China. Xi will need to sell the agreement at home by emphasizing how little he\u2019s given up, or at least as the sort of \u201cwin-win\u201d solution he so often touts. Having Trump contradict him publicly and persistently will only feed the narrative that China\u2019s been humiliated again. That will encourage China to assert its newly earned clout in future, on trade as well as other issues, in ways that are sure to inflame tensions.The result of all this is likely to be a deal that will perpetuate conflict between the U.S. and China rather than resolve it. Sadly, the same political forces that are pressing the two sides towards a pact of dubious value will also fuel continued confrontation.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story:Michael Schuman at contactschuman@gmail.com ","77":" Optimism among small companies in the U.S. improved in February, snapping a five-month losing streak that was the longest in two decades on brighter views of future conditions.The National Federation of Independent Business optimism\u00a0index rose to 101.7 from a two-year low of 101.2, according to a report Tuesday. Five of 10 index components improved, including views about the current environment for expansion and capital spending plans. The measure is showing signs of stabilization following the government shutdown, and remains at a historically elevated level despite cooling from a record 108.8 in August.\u201cNow that the government is funded, owners should be getting back to business with the rebound in consumer sentiment,\u201d survey authors William Dunkelberg and Holly Wade said in the report. \u201cEarnings trends took a hit as a million laid off workers and others affected by the shutdown cut back on spending.\u201dWhile some indicators point to a softer start to this year, including Friday\u2019s jobs report showing February payrolls growth was the weakest in more than a year, consumers remain upbeat amid a resurgent stock market and steady job gains. Americans are the most confident about current conditions in 18 years, Conference Board surveys show, and the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort gauge is at the highest level since late 2000.Components tracking plans to hire and earnings trends posted the only declines among the index components. Plans to increase inventories, sales expectations and expectations for credit conditions were unchanged in the survey last month of more than 500 respondents.","78":" Investors are starting to doubt that Jerome Powell\u2019s magic dust can keep working miracles in equities.The U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s remarkably dovish stance got a polite but restrained nod from markets on Wednesday after trade tensions and profit woes returned to center stage. The S&P 500 Index fell 0.8 percent over the five days while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index posted the worst week this year as focus shifted to slowing economic data and President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to keep China tariffs.Yes, investors are surely grateful to Powell for this year\u2019s $10 trillion global stock rally. But it\u2019s not in the Fed\u2019s power to reduce geopolitical risks, and for the rally to continue, earnings upgrades are needed ASAP, according to Karen Ward, chief market strategist for Europe, Middle East and Africa at JPMorgan Asset Management. Analyst downgrades of global profit growth have outpaced upgrades since August, showing no signs of stopping.Valuations aren\u2019t helping, either. On a forward price-to-earnings basis, both the S&P 500 and MSCI World Index now trade near the levels they were at during the height of last year\u2019s market rally. Back in December, they bottomed out near the lowest multiples since 2013.\u201cThe valuation story in stocks that we saw at the start of the year is no longer compelling,\u201d Ward said. \u201cIt\u2019s very helpful if Powell pauses interest rates from here but there\u2019s nothing he can do to determine whether the trade hostility eases or continues, and really it\u2019s that that\u2019s depressing global growth.\u201dTraders are starting to vote with their feet. After a short-term inflow into equities earlier this month, stock funds across all the major regions saw $21 billion exit in the week through March 20. Many investors have remained on the sidelines of this year\u2019s rally after being burned at the end of 2018 and have turned to bonds in search of yield and defensive positions.Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists including Michael Hartnett went so far this week as to say that the gains in stocks have been driven \u201csolely\u201d by corporate buybacks, call options, short-covering and purchases of single stocks by retail investors -- and not by general investor appetite for equity risk.And major asset managers are starting to reduce their equity exposure. Joh Berenberg Gossler & Company KG scaled back its stock positions closer to neutral in recent weeks and UBS Global Wealth Management in March took profit on the global equity overweight amid concerns about economic growth.To be sure, as we approach the end of a quarter that\u2019s set to be the S&P 500\u2019s best since 2009, sentiment is becoming more cautious but is nowhere close to the gloomy mood seen at the end of last year.At Wells Fargo Asset Management, Brian Jacobsen, a senior investment strategist, said that although his multi-asset team has recently reduced its equity position from overweight to neutral, in the longer run the dovish monetary environment remains supportive of stocks.\u201cThe run-up to first-quarter earnings season could likely be a little rough going, but the weakness will likely be temporary,\u201d Jacobsen said. \u201cWe\u2019re still off the previous highs, but investors can ignore the Fed\u2019s downward revisions to growth because the Fed has finally stopped ignoring the slowdown.\u201dHSBC Private Bank and State Street Global Advisors remain bullish on global equities but that doesn\u2019t mean they recommend indiscriminate buying. State Street\u2019s head of investment strategy and research for EMEA, Altaf Kassam, said that he\u2019s hopeful the rally has legs as U.S. unemployment is near historic lows and there is optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal. Still, the company has been selling U.S. small-cap shares on the deterioration of the global growth outlook and acquiring emerging-market stocks.Ultimately the gains could end if the tariff war fails to be resolved. The trade deal with China is \u201cgetting very close\u201d but this \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean we get there,\u201d Trump said on Friday.Setbacks on the political front \u201ccannot be ruled out and valuations of risky assets are no longer cheap,\u201d said Sylvie Golay Markovich, head of financial markets strategy at Credit Suisse Group AG. \u201cWe thus consider it prudent to remain neutral for now.\u201d ","79":" And now, a proxy fight.The more MNG Enterprises Inc. tries to prove it\u2019s serious about buying Gannett Co., the less credible it looks.Gannett, the publisher of USA Today, earlier this week  rejected\u00a0the\u00a0local newspaper owner\u2019s\u00a0$12-per-share takeover bid, saying it\u00a0was too low and lacked key commitments on financing and antitrust. In response to that rebuff, MNG \u2014\u00a0which is controlled by hedge fund Alden Global Capital and better known as Digital First Media \u2014 announced\u00a0late Thursday that it would nominate six directors to the Gannett board.It\u2019s highly unusual and needlessly aggressive to escalate an unsolicited takeover offer to a proxy fight after only one public bid. It feels like a distraction, considering MNG still hasn\u2019t publicly addressed Gannett\u2019s concerns about financing or regulatory hurdles with any degree of specificity. The two sides met on Feb. 7, and MNG said it addressed all of Gannett\u2019s questions by reviewing\u00a0a \u201cpath\u201d to financing and \u201canalysis\u201d on antitrust matters. Those are nice words, but they don\u2019t mean much in the absence of bank commitments and an appropriate breakup fee.MNG accused Gannett of stonewalling\u00a0on deal discussions by refusing to\u00a0extend a Thursday deadline for board nominations that has been in place for nearly a year. I\u2019m sorry, but if that tactic\u00a0didn\u2019t work for\u00a0Bill Ackman at  Automatic Data Processing Inc., it\u2019s not going to work here. The deadline is what it is, and if MNG wanted more time to negotiate, it shouldn\u2019t have made its first public bid only about a month beforehand. Of course, if it had bid earlier, it wouldn\u2019t have been able to take advantage of Gannett\u2019s slumping share price in December. MNG attempted to reserve the right to submit placeholder names for its nominees to give it more time to develop a slate, according to the Wall Street Journal. Gannett\u2019s bylaws don\u2019t allow this, but even if they did, it\u2019s a sloppy way to go about a proxy fight.A look at the\u00a0slate MNG did put forward shows why it wanted more time; the candidates are a mix of current or former MNG executives, Alden Global employees and\u00a0directors currently serving\u00a0on the board of drugstore chain Fred\u2019s Inc. Alden Global is the biggest shareholder of Fred\u2019s and its president is the company\u2019s chairman. Most activist investors worth their salt will at most nominate one or two people from their own firm to proxy-fight slates, and they go to great lengths to emphasize that the other would-be directors are independent. The extent to which people believe these protestations of independence is a different question, but it\u2019s important to at least try to maintain the idea that\u00a0whatever agenda the hedge fund is pushing is for the greater good of all shareholders and not just for its own benefit.Perhaps more important is the need to put up a slate that\u2019s seemingly better-equipped to manage the company than the current board. Alden Global has boosted the profit margins of its newspaper holdings to meaningfully higher levels than the rest of the industry, albeit  at a significant cost to the  quality of the product\u00a0and journalism jobs, as my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Joe Nocera has documented. That makes it a less ideal partner for Gannett than its erstwhile takeover target Tribune Publishing Co., with which it has reportedly rekindled deal talks. In the absence of a higher bid and more concrete information about MNG\u2019s financing capabilities, it\u2019s fair to take a look at what\u2019s happened to Fred\u2019s stock price since Alden Global built a stake in the company and question the merits of the nominees\u2019 operating chops:Fred&apos;s agreed in 2016 to buy assets from Rite Aid as part of that company&apos;s sale to Walgreens. Rite Aid and Walgreens had to significantly revise their deal amid regulatory pushback and the Fred&apos;s transaction was terminated. Source: BloombergThe situation offers an interesting contrast to Broadcom Inc.\u2019s hostile pursuit of Qualcomm Inc. Broadcom initially nominated 11 directors to Qualcomm\u2019s board, all of whom were independent on the face of it; the semiconductor company\u00a0had financing commitments from Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch arm, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Silver Lake Partners for the $100 billion-plus deal; and eventually, it offered to pay an $8 billion  reverse breakup fee if regulators rebuffed the deal. It did all of this before\u00a0Qualcomm offered to enter into\u00a0a non-disclosure agreement for bilateral due diligence. Broadcom didn\u2019t win the proxy fight because the U.S. government forced the then-Singapore-based company  to withdraw its slate\u00a0over national security concerns. But Broadcom knew what it was doing. It\u2019s hard to say the same about MNG.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. ","80":" 15 Hudson Yards\u2019\u00a0Hudson River View.Source: Related-OxfordSource: Related-OxfordTwo years ago, Ann Cutbill Lenane visited the salesroom for 15 Hudson Yards, a then-unbuilt condominium in the heart of Related Cos. and Oxford Properties Group\u2019s massive, $25\u00a0billion redevelopment on the far west side of Manhattan. \u201cI had heard about Hudson Yards,\u201d says Lenane, a broker with Douglas Elliman.\u00a0\u201cI envisioned this wasteland where trains used to be.\u201dBut one of her clients wanted to visit,\u00a0so Lenane dutifully accompanied him. When she walked in, \u201cI was blown away,\u201d she says. There was the glassy, 88 story tower designed by Diller Scofidio +\u00a0Renfro, but even more than that, she was impressed with Hudson Yards itself.\u00a0\u201cThere was going to be art and  retail and  incredible amounts of food,\u201d she says. Lenane\u2019s client ended up buying an apartment in the building, and soon after, so did Lenane, who\u2019ll move into her two-bedroom apartment sometime in June. \u201cI am taking a leap of faith,\u201d she says. \u201cI still have not seen my apartment, but I felt so comfortable, because it was [built by] Related.\u201dAs the development\u2019s retail hub prepares for its grand opening next week, Related\u00a0is hoping Lenane\u2019s experience will be replicated many times over, not just for 15 Hudson Yards, whose available apartments start at about $4.3 million for a two-bedroom and go up to $32 million for a duplex penthouse, but also for 35 Hudson Yards, an even higher-end, 92-story condominium whose homes start at about $5 million and go to $28.5 million, not including the penthouses.\u00a0 The average 2018 sales price for a luxury co-op\u00a0or condo in Manhattan\u00a0was about $8.5 million, according to a Douglas Elliman Miller Samuel report. These are pricey properties.\u201cPeople are really really excited to be here,\u201d says Sherry Tobak, a senior vice president at Related, who\u2019s in charge of sales for both 15 and 35 Hudson Yards. \u201cWhen the shops open and restaurants open and all the opportunities that exist here\u2014that whole lifestyle is really drawing buyers in.\u201dNot everyone is sold. \u201cThis is not what we call prime [real estate],\u201d says\u00a0 Donna Olshan, president of the luxury brokerage Olshan Realty Inc. \u201cThey may consider it prime because they\u2019re building it, but it\u2019s what I would consider an emerging location, which means it\u2019s basically untested.\u201dThe absence of an existing market for Hudson Yards\u2019 housing stock\u00a0makes the development what Olshan calls\u00a0\u201ca gamble,\u201d particularly within New York\u2019s\u00a0slumping housing market. The end of 2018 was the fifth consecutive quarter in which co-op and condo sales declined\u00a0year over year in the city, according to a report by Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.With New York\u00a0sales struggling, the billion-dollar question is whether\u00a0Hudson Yards\u2019 city-within-a-city will prove enough of a draw to beat the rest of the market. \u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging market for anybody, and it\u2019s a very price-sensitive market, and it\u2019s a competitive market,\u201d Olshan says.The bright side, she says, is\u00a0that Hudson Yards\u2019 combination of  millions of square feet of office space\u00a0and\u00a0department stores, as well as\u00a0the cultural and residential amenities\u00a0Related is promoting, amount to a genuine first for New York.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen something like this,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t remember New York ever having a dramatic transformation of an area like this, other than maybe Battery Park, years ago.\u201d\u00a0As a result,\u00a0it\u2019s hard to gauge the \u201cvalue\u201d of the new apartment towers, let alone judge their potential success. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it pencils out for the developer and the people who buy,\u201d Olshan says.Even Tobak acknowledges that the buildings, which are part of a development that will eventually include a public school, a park, a hotel, and dozens of restaurants, represent a genuine first in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to compare this to anything,\u201d she says. \u201cYou take a typical $8 million apartment\u2014you might find something similar without a view or amenities,\u201d she continues. Some towers might have a pool or an excellent concierge service, but not a view; others might have all of those things, but be miles away from residents\u2019 offices.\u00a0\u201cI wish I could compare this to something,\u201d Tobak says,\u00a0\u201cbut I can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0For Tobak, the development\u2019s totality is obviously a benefit\u2014Related can argue that, as an anomaly, the price structure for 15 Hudson Yards should be independent from other circumstances.\u00a0\u201cLook, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re blind as to the way the market is right now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t touched pricing.\u201d Related\u2019s strategy, she says, \u201cis to stick to our guns. People want to be here, and they want to put their money where their mouths are.\u201dUltimately, an apartment building is an apartment building. \u201cWhat people are responding to is the quality of the construction and the dream of what the lifestyle is going to be like when it\u2019s complete,\u201d says Vickey Barron, a broker at Compass. The promise of that lifestyle, Barron says,\u00a0is \u201cthe only thing that would make sense for this pricing.\u201dThe pricing Barron is referring to at 15 Hudson Yards starts at roughly $3,000 per square foot and extends to about $6,000 a square foot, well above 2018\u2019s fourth-quarter new luxury condo average\u00a0for Manhattan of about $3,100.\u00a0For her part, Barron says she\u2019s fan of the project, though it took her a little while. \u201cFive years ago, I thought they\u2019d lost their minds,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the whole vision, but I took a client there Saturday and she was blown away and very inspired. [Related] should get some recognition for what they\u2019ve created there.\u201dRelated says it\u2019s sold\u00a0about\u00a060 percent of the apartments at 15 Hudson Yards, though the\u00a0numbers are impossible to verify until the deals actually close, a process\u00a0Tobak says is just beginning. \u201cWe\u2019re starting closings at 15 Hudson Yards,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have about 30 scheduled for March.\u201dSeventy percent of existing buyers, Tobak says, are drawn from the Tristate area. \u201cOur biggest demo is up and down the West Side,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling from Riverside South, the Meatpacking District, and West Chelsea\u2014those are the people who are most attuned to what we\u2019re doing.\u201dTwo-bedrooms are what she calls \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d for their sales efforts. \u201cOne of the fortunate things is that in Hudson Yards we have corporations moving in\u201d to the development\u2019s office towers, she says. \u201cYou have a lot of buyers who live in Connecticut or Long Island or New Jersey, and they need a place to call home for the week, and it\u2019s so much easier for them to roll out of bed and get to work when they already work these incredibly long hours.\u201dEven for Lenane, whose office is on the Upper West Side, the proximity of those office towers was an added draw. \u201cKnowing that there are these incredible anchors of retail space and office space\u2014that was always going to feed into my investment,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u201cThere was always going to be a market,\u00a0because there was a built-in community already.\u201d\u00a0As for the price of her apartment, Lenane isn\u2019t concerned. \u201cListen, people will ask for comps, and certainly there are comps that are all over the place,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u00a0felt very comfortable with what I\u00a0was spending and what I\u00a0am getting.\u201d ","81":" Want\u00a0to receive this post in your inbox every morning?\u00a0Sign up hereECB decision day, Trump\u2019s trade-deal rally may never come, and Brexit pessimism rises.\u00a0Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.At 7:45 a.m. Eastern Time, the European Central Bank will announce its  latest monetary policy decision. While there is no expectation for a change in rates, officials may be poised to cut their economic forecasts enough to allow room for additional stimulus. The most likely form, should it come today, is an  extension of the TLTRO program\u00a0that\u00a0attempts to incentivize banks to increase lending to the real economy. The announcement will be followed by a press conference with ECB President Mario Draghi at 8:30 a.m.\u00a0Evidence is growing that the trade war between the U.S. and China is doing  real harm to the global economy. Some analysts warn\u00a0that some of the\u00a0damage could be permanent --\u00a0effectively meaning any rebound from a deal would not lead to a full recovery. This suggests\u00a0that having\u00a0raised expectations on the likelihood of a breakthrough, President Trump may not get the  stock market rally he wants from an official end to the standoff.Brexit negotiators in the European Union are becoming  increasingly pessimistic that sufficient progress can be secured this week to allow British Prime Minister Theresa May to win a crucial vote in Parliament next week. The EU\u00a0believes that unrealistic expectations have built up in London, and that U.K. negotiators are  asking for the impossible.

It\u2019s \u2018not uncommon\u2019 for professors to invest in their students The chances that your startup will become a billion-dollar company are almost zero. But if you do somehow manage to create a unicorn, the odds are better than 1-in-10 that you or your co-founder attended one school: Stanford.It\u2019s a remarkable statistic even considering its student population is overrun with go-getters -- people ambitious enough to apply and smart enough to get in. More unicorn founders and top venture capitalists attended Stanford than any other U.S. university, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on CB Insights\u2019 lists of top venture capitalists and unicorn companies. And while Harvard has spawned more alumni with self-made fortunes of at least $500 million, Stanford\u2019s are 11 years younger on average.How do they do it? One obvious answer is location. Rather than create a bubble of academia within the heart of the world\u2019s tech mecca, Stanford has embraced its proximity to Silicon Valley to give students a powerful advantage.Stanford and Silicon Valley are \u201cinextricable,\u201d said alumna Heidi Roizen, a venture capitalist and co-leader of Stanford\u2019s DFJ Entrepreneurial Leaders Fellowship, where she\u2019s on the teaching team. \u201cYou have to look at them together.\u201dHeidi RoizenWhile that bond provides students with unparalleled access to mentors, role models and funding, it also comes with problems: startups are prioritized over schoolwork and conflicts of interest arise when professors are also seed investors.Bloomberg conducted dozens of interviews about Stanford\u2019s startup scene and its perks and perils. Here are some of the people who capture different aspects of the school\u2019s culture.If you walked into Ryan Breslow\u2019s Stanford dorm room in the spring of 2014, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking no one lived there -- no pictures on the walls, no clothes in the closet, no comforter on the bed. That\u2019s because no one was supposed to be living there.Breslow was a sophomore computer science student when he dropped out earlier that year to work on Bolt, his payment startup.\u201cI just became much more passionate about that than my classes,\u201d said Breslow, 24. He spent the rest of the school year squatting on campus, secretly living in the spare dorm room and getting meals with the help of a dining hall cook he had befriended. Today, Bolt is worth about $250 million, according to Adam Augusiak-Boro, a senior associate at EquityZen, a marketplace for trading employee shares of closely held companies.At least three members of the computer science faculty are Bolt investors.Ryan BreslowBreslow isn\u2019t the only successful Stanford dropout. Take Snap Inc.\u2019s Evan Spiegel, who dropped out of undergrad, or Tesla Inc.\u2019s Elon Musk, who lasted less than a week in his Ph.D. program before withdrawing. One notable alumnus, billionaire Peter Thiel, encourages it so much that he set up a fellowship offering young entrepreneurs $100,000 to put college on hold.Dropping out is still the exception rather than the rule at Stanford, but taking a year off to work on a startup is so prevalent that there\u2019s a term for it: \u201cstopping out.\u201d It\u2019s also common for students to take a light course load -- only two classes or so -- to spend more time on their startups, Breslow said.Some companies are born in the classroom. Terry Winograd looks like an academic, with bushy white hair and a mustache to rival Einstein\u2019s. When the former computer science professor first went to work at Stanford in 1973, his intentions were academic, too. Getting crazy rich wasn\u2019t part of the plan, but as fate would have it, he was an adviser on Larry Page\u2019s graduate research project involving web search.Terry WinogradWinograd never invested in his student\u2019s startup, but he was invited to work at Google during a 2002 sabbatical and was largely paid in pre-IPO stock. The company, now called Alphabet Inc., went public in 2004 and is valued at $797 billion.\u201cI\u2019m not a billionaire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m comfortable.\u201dWinograd recognizes that there\u2019s a downside to the cozy relationship between academia and industry.\u201cThe negative side effects are cultural,\" he said. \u201cIf a student sees their fellow student getting really rich it\u2019s hard to say to them, \u2018Yes, but philosophy is important, too.\u201d\u2019Other computer science professors have taken a more direct approach to profiting from their students\u2019 ideas. David Cheriton, for example, was an early Google investor. The proceeds Cheriton has received from selling his Alphabet stock make up the bulk of his $4.3 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people.Mehran SahamiAlso in the department is Mehran Sahami, who still teaches at Stanford and famously had Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook Inc. co-founder, visit one of his computer science classes for Q&A sessions. Sahami has invested in several of his students\u2019 companies, including a mobile payments startup called Clinkle Corp. In early 2013, more than a dozen students in the computer science department dropped out to work with Clinkle founder Lucas Duplan. The company folded about two years later.\u201cMy expectation for the students and Lucas Duplan, who was the CEO, was that they would graduate,\u201d Sahami said.Sahami said he has invested in fewer than five of his former students\u2019 ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s a relationship that\u2019s been built up over years so when they\u2019re ready to do this venture or get funding, this discussion will happen.\u201dShortly after the Clinkle exodus, the university added a section to its conflict-of-interest policy, which requires any faculty member involved in a student\u2019s academic program to get permission from administrators before investing with that student.That doesn\u2019t apply to everyone. \u201cSince they do not have faculty appointments and are not paid by Stanford, our conflict of interest policies do not apply to adjunct faculty, visiting faculty, visiting scholars or visiting lecturers -- unless they have another type of appointment through which they are paid by Stanford,\u201d university spokesman E.J. Miranda said in an emailed statement.In 2009, just after his junior year, Cameron Teitelman decided to do something about a problem he noticed on campus: a school with so many entrepreneurs had no structured setting for them to connect and work through common problems. His solution was StartX, an accelerator for Stanford-affiliated founders. In 2018, StartX was ranked in the top three accelerators in the country along with Silicon Valley powerhouses Y Combinator and AngelPad, according to the Seed Accelerator Rankings Project. StartX does not call itself an accelerator.Cameron\u00a0TeitelmanTeitelman, 30, also founded StartX to create a safe space for students who are first-time founders working in Silicon Valley\u2019s shark-infested waters. After hearing stories of students who had been offered unfair deals by their lecturers, many of whom were full-time venture capitalists, Teitelman wanted to help students avoid those situations, he said.\u201cSometimes lecturers, I feel like, take advantage of students and it really pisses me off,\u201d Teitelman said. \u201cVenture capitalists who play on information asymmetry to get more out of a startup that doesn\u2019t know anything, that\u2019s just wrong.\u201dPeter Levine, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, introduces himself as an investor first and Stanford teacher second.Around the same time that Levine started at the venture capital firm in 2010, the business school invited him to teach part time, and he eagerly accepted. More than a dozen venture capitalists are lecturers at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.Peter Levine\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to teach there,\u201d Levine said. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving back and providing the expertise that I have.\u201dBeing a venture capitalist surrounded by smart and ambitious student entrepreneurs looking for funding is an added benefit, and he said they sometimes approach him to pitch startups while he\u2019s eating in the cafeteria.\u201cThey know who I am and they know what we do,\u201d Levine said. \u201cEveryone is involved together and they have very close access to investors.\u201dBusiness school student Tadia James welcomes professors who want to invest in students.\u201cThey are so generous and really believe in us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all uncommon for a professor to invest in one of their students, especially after a student has taken their class.\u201dTeitelman, who studied management science and engineering, stressed the distinction between investments from part-time lecturers and full-time tenured professors.\u201cFor the most part, tenured professors at Stanford are very careful,\u201d Teitelman said. \u201cThey first and foremost care about research and a student\u2019s education.\u201dEven Stanford itself is taking a stake. In 2013, the school founded the Stanford-StartX Fund, which allows the school to invest in StartX companies.\u201cWe train and house these creative minds, and it is only fitting that we invest in their future success,\u201d then-Stanford President John Hennessy said in a statement at the time.StartX decided to participate in the fund to reach financial self-sustainability and it recently achieved that goal. For that reason the Stanford-StartX Fund will stop making new investments after June 30, according to a statement from StartX.Stanford finance chief Randy Livingston said the school will continue to put money in the President\u2019s Venture Fund, which for the past decade has invested in new ventures that have licensed technology from Stanford. The school\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing collects royalties when inventions created on campus are successful.The university has invested more than $150 million in the Stanford-StartX Fund through the end of 2018, Livingston\u00a0said in an email, 50 percent more than he predicted in a 2013 interview with the New Yorker. That may seem like a relative pittance now for a $26.5 billion endowment, but the odds are good that Stanford is getting in early on the next Google. ","85":"Bulls see reasonable valuations as growth forecasts cut. Profits for 2019 clustering in back-end of year raises alarm Stock investors who managed to ignore sagging earnings estimates were rewarded with the biggest January rally since 1987. Will they be as sanguine should the profit pain persist?It\u2019s a question they may soon need an answer for.After lurching into Christmas, U.S. stocks had staged an almost uninterrupted rebound in 2019 before hitting a wall this week and ending virtually flat. It happened against a worrisome backdrop in which skeptical analysts have cut estimates for first-quarter profit growth below zero for the first time in three years.S&P 500 profits expected to fall in the first quarter of 2019Source: Bloomberg IntelligenceNote: Colors other than black indicate estimatesNo problem, say the bulls. Valuations are reasonable. Earnings for the full year are still predicted to climb 5.4 percent. But a concern lurks for anyone who has followed markets for very long: Wall Street\u2019s near-perfect record of over-estimating growth. Short declines in profits have a habit of becoming long ones, and most of this year\u2019s expected gains are clustered precariously at its end.\u201cThat\u2019s unnerving,\u2019\u2019 Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a back-end loaded year, which people don\u2019t like to see because everyone knows that analysts revise the numbers down as the year goes on.\u201dIt\u2019s particularly unnerving if you assume stocks follow the path of profits. And while single-quarter drops don\u2019t mean much, earnings recessions that last longer have the potential to stoke volatility and bring out the bears. Right now, according to analysts, S&P 500 income will fall in the first quarter, then inch higher in the second and third.Bulls better hope it does. Profit declines that extend past two quarters have virtually never stopped there since the Great Depression. Among 18 that got to nine months, exactly one didn\u2019t keep going, in 1967. And contractions of three quarters or more have triggered bear markets 78 percent of the time over the past eight decades.Analysts have been furiously guiding down forecasts since the start of the year. Earnings-per-share targets for the period starting in January have fallen 4.2 percent, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data, signaling the potential for a profit recession.Still, the S&P 500 rallied 7.9 percent in January. Credit a December sell-off gone too far or a Federal Reserve turned dovish for the outsize rally. Some analysts, including Ned Davis Research, aren\u2019t sold the worst is over. Topping the worry list is an earnings recession that shakes the market from its course.Full-year earnings estimates normally drop by about half a percentage point each month, according to Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA, and this year has already seen more rapid declines. Coming into 2019, forecasts called for 8.3 percent earnings growth for the S&P 500 in 2019. Now it\u2019s less than 6 percent, with cuts coming quadruple the usual rate.\u201cAlthough 6 percent doesn\u2019t sound bad, most of the time when you\u2019re expecting 6 percent at this time of year, you get a negative number,\u201d said Keon, who\u2019s been studying the relationship between earnings and forecasts for a quarter century. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a danger zone when they start the year where they are.\u2019\u2019If negative earnings growth extends beyond the first quarter, ending in a yearly profit recession, volatility could come back. The most recent earnings recession of 2015 and 2016, which saw five straight quarters of declines, coincided with three of the largest jumps in equity volatility on record and two 10 percent corrections.To garner clues on the possibility of a repeat, focus is already turning to the next reporting season that will cover the first three months of 2019.\u201cThe first quarter will probably give us a better indication because if the deceleration on earnings becomes worse than expected, then there will be a potential for higher levels of volatility for the market, potentially dragging it down,\u201d said Omar Aguilar, the chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management. \u201cRight now I feel that the estimate was down and out that we\u2019d see positive surprises, but I certainly think as we continue to go, people will probably have to adjust even further down their estimates.\u201d ","86":"Business, trade pacts being signed on sidelines of Trump-Kim.

It&apos;s a bold move nonetheless.Apollo Global Management\u2019s reputation for M&A savvy is suddenly under threat. The U.S. buyout firm this week encountered a potential challenge to its agreed $4.4 billion deal for U.K. packaging company RPC Group Plc. Tactics that avoided an auction have now left it unable to fight back against an interloper.The financial politics here are juicy. The gatecrasher is RPC\u2019s U.S. rival Berry Global Group Inc., a previous Apollo buyout that went public in 2012. Berry\u2019s advisers are Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. They have taken on a brave mandate going against Apollo. Doing so risks jeopardizing relations with one of the world\u2019s biggest buyout firms and investment banking fee-payers \u2014 all to support a plastic products company worth just $6.4 billion on a deal they may not even secure.Goldman was previously advising RPC suitor Bain Capital, which decided against a bid. There was nothing controversial about working for one big private equity firm against another in the early stages of the sale process. Attempting to break up an already agreed deal is another matter.Berry&apos;s shares reacted badly to news it was considering a bid for U.K. plastics rival RPCSource: BloombergIntraday times are displayed in ET.Apollo\u2019s handling of the situation had thus far looked impressive. Stock-market investors had lost confidence in RPC and vice versa. Worries about RPC\u2019s cash conversion necessitated extensive due diligence on the target. When Bain walked away, Apollo was the only option for a company that had given up defending its strategy for remaining independent.After months in the data room, Apollo agreed a deal that was just 16 percent above the pre-bid share price \u2014 and even that measly premium included the forthcoming dividend. It immediately declared the offer \u201cfinal.\u201d In\u00a0British bid situations\u00a0you have to mean what you say. So Apollo cannot raise its offer except\u00a0in highly exceptional circumstances.This \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d approach was a smart move to a degree. It deterred hedge fund arbitrageurs\u00a0from swarming onto the register and demanding that Apollo raise its bid. There would be no point; Apollo can\u2019t. But there\u2019s a wrinkle. The buyout firm could have added in a qualifying clause reserving the right to lift its price in the event of a counter-bid. It chose not to. That was practically an invitation to other suitors.\u00a0Enter Berry, Goldman and Wells Fargo. They have\u00a0just had a request for due diligence granted. An all-cash offer worth just a few pence a share more would probably kill Apollo\u2019s deal unless the higher bid was on a much longer timetable.There are still big questions over Berry\u2019s ability to follow through with a firm offer. Either leverage would have to rise substantially, or it will have to raise equity. Berry\u2019s ability to find synergies is also open to doubt given that RPC is already big, so it may be hard for a new owner to improve its buying power. There\u2019s also\u00a0limited geographical overlap between the two companies.\u00a0If Apollo\u2019s offer of 782 pence a share is its genuine ceiling, it shouldn\u2019t regret missing out if Berry pays 800 pence a share or more. The decision to declare its offer unequivocally final protects its reputation for being a disciplined buyer that pays low multiples. That will keep\u00a0Apollo\u2019s other M&A targets on their toes, please its clients and help it in future deal negotiations. But it may mean sacrificing this one deal if Berry feels it can justify paying more.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. ","90":" The U.K. hasn&apos;t cared much about who owns its companies. Brexit drives a truck through this approach.If Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU was to have a silver lining, it was the hope that sterling\u2019s slump would spark a long overdue re-balancing of the economy. A vast finance and services sector has brought many advantages over the years (bankers are big spenders and pay plenty of tax), but the cost\u00a0of neglecting manufacturing is becoming increasingly apparent.\u00a0Poor productivity growth, regional inequality, stagnant wages and a yawning current account deficit are just some of the problems made worse by de-industrialization. But while the weaker pound has provided a bit of support\u00a0for U.K. exports since the 2016 referendum, a manufacturing renaissance \u2013\u00a0or  \u201cMarch of the Makers\u201d in the words of former finance minister George Osborne \u2013 looks like a pipe-dream. Lately, the reverse has been happening.The country\u2019s\u00a0foreign-owned carmakers have  withheld spending\u00a0and cut jobs and models;\u00a0Honda Motor Co Ltd. is  closing its Swindon plant. Even home-grown successes like Dyson Group Plc are  shifting investment\u00a0elsewhere. The CBI, Britain\u2019s biggest business lobby, warned last week that industry is\u00a0\u201cin despair\u201d about Brexit and trade union Unite says the U.K. is \u201cin the grip of a manufacturing emergency.\u201d\u00a0They have a point.Britain\u2019s political leaders\u00a0have played\u00a0fast and loose with the future EU trading relationship and\u00a0some have shown a\u00a0willful disregard for companies\u2019 concerns. Boris Johnson\u2019s infamous \u201cF*ck business\u201d\u00a0comment spoke volumes. As with so much about Brexit, this lack of seriousness is potentially disastrous given that most of the country\u2019s industrial base is in the hands of overseas owners. Britain has happily carried on selling off its companies (from\u00a0Arm Holdings Plc\u00a0to Sky Plc) since the referendum. In a post-Brexit world, this isn\u2019t sustainable. But there isn\u2019t a huge amount left to dispose of anyway.Manufacturing employment declines\u00a0as economies become more advanced, but the U.K. is extreme. The sector now accounts for just\u00a08 percent of the workforce, compared with more than one-fifth when I was born in 1982.\u00a0\n            \n\n                1\n            \nThe birthplace of the industrial revolution has a lower manufacturing\u00a0share of output than in many\u00a0other developed economies.The U.K. has slipped down the rankings of the world&apos;s biggest manufacturersSource: : UN Conference on Trade and Development,  U.K. parliamentData are from 2015As with the election of Donald Trump, the\u00a0campaign\u00a0for Britain to quit the EU appealed to blue collar workers left behind\u00a0by de-industrialization. That\u00a0Brexit will probably make things worse is one of the referendum\u2019s cruelest ironies, and hardly the best way of defusing the populist impulse.In terms of output, Britain is of\u00a0course\u00a0still an important manufacturing nation.\u00a0But its list of domestic world-class contenders is pretty thin.\u00a0There\u2019s Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, BAE\u00a0Systems Plc, GKN Plc and Cobham Plc\u00a0in aerospace, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and AstraZeneca in drugs, and Ineos in chemicals.\u00a0Then you have several big food, drink and personal care companies.\u00a0\n            \n\n                2\n            \nFor a long time, the British establishment (including Labour governments)\u00a0seemed pretty ambivalent about this situation. It wasn&apos;t the government\u2019s job to pick winners. Politicians saw a bright future in services (financial, business and professional) and the so-called\u00a0\u201cknowledge economy.\u201d\u00a0So what if big local manufacturers like Airbus, Tata Steel, Siemens, ABB, Bombardier, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota, Nissan and BMW\/Mini were all foreign-owned? Britain\u2019s attractions as an investment destination \u2013\u00a0its universities, flexible labor markets and access to Europe \u2013\u00a0were plain.\u00a0All would be well;\u00a0and in fairness sectors such as the car industry thrived in a way they hadn\u2019t under British owners and bosses.But some local industrialists have long argued that when the going gets tough, a foreign owner won\u2019t feel a particular obligation to the country when faced with hard investment decisions. That theory is getting a good testing now that the U.K. is \u2013 voluntarily \u2013 trying to leave the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc. The early signs are grim.Even today, manufacturing accounts for more than two-thirds of British companies\u2019 R&D spending and\u00a0almost half the country\u2019s exports.\u00a0Productivity growth also tends to be higher among industrials because of automation. Pay is higher too, particularly in carmaking. Having a thriving finance sector and industrial base needn\u2019t be mutually exclusive either. Switzerland manages, but the U.K. has struggled to balance the two.Britain\u2019s engineers have suffered as many of the brightest graduates sought their fortunes in the City of London. Speculative capital inflows contributed to an\u00a0overvalued pound\u00a0and\u00a0made exports less competitive.\n            \n\n                3\n            \n         And, rather than help small- and medium-sized businesses expand, finance firms have directed most of their money toward\u00a0real estate, as the chart below from think-tank Civitas\u00a0shows.

Particular interest will be paid to commentary around gross margin, regional sales results, inventory positions, new product innovation and the company\u2019s promotional cadence.Options activity is pointing to a volatile reaction into the earnings release, which isn\u2019t uncommon as shares have moved 14.9 percent on average over the last eight reports.

","94":" A master bedroom in an apartment in the Innovationen\u00a0skyscraper in StockholmResidential skyscrapers are rare in Stockholm, a city permeated by five-story, classic stone buildings built at the turn of the last century.That\u2019s now changing. The most spectacular addition to the skyline is nearing completion: A 125-meter, brutalist structure that could be mistaken for a tower of Lego blocks.Innovationen offers panorama windows and balconies overlooking the red, yellow and orange facades of the Vasastan neighborhood. The apartments cost a hefty 100,000 kronor ($11,000) a square meter and residents get access to a private cinema and a gym with a sauna and yoga room, raising eyebrows in egalitarian Sweden.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time anyone has dared to do anything like this in Sweden,\u201d said Herman Persson, head of design at Oscar Properties, the tower\u2019s developer.And that\u2019s just half of it. Across the street, Oscar Properties is erecting a twin skyscraper named Helix.But that\u2019s where the trouble starts. Oscar Properties still has one-third of the apartments left unsold with only a year left until Helix is completed. The housing market has been struggling since a major slump at the end of 2017 and prices for new homes have continued falling.\u201cEarlier, when it was another market, people would buy apartments just off a floor plan,\u201d Persson said. \u201cNow people want to see what they are going to get.\u201dWith many property developers struggling, buyers are even questioning if they are going to get anything at all. Bankruptcies are up 24 percent so far this year in Stockholm, of which a fifth are in companies linked to the housing market.New developments hardest hit in Sweden&apos;s housing-market correctionSource: Property listings provider HemnetOscar Properties issued a profit warning last month, shaving off a quarter of the company\u2019s market value.Joacim Olsson, head of the Swedish Shareholders\u2019 Association, says that the company will likely need a capital injection as a bond repayment of 450 million kronor awaits in September. \u201cThey\u2019ll need to add equity in order to refinance their loans,\u201d he said.The company has dropped some residential projects, turned others into office buildings and also intends to diversify its portfolio with rental projects and more affordable\u00a0housing in fast growing cities around Sweden.The business model of selling apartments under construction and booking profits along the way before a project is finished is now grinding to halt. Both the stock exchange and the financial watchdog are now scrutinizing developers over their calculations.But the plunge in prices has killed the speculative end of the market, which has opened up for some buyers.Andra Farhad, a stock market adviser and CEO of Borshajen AB, in 2018\u00a0bought a flat on the 12th floor in Innovationen, but only after waiting for a year to see if the project would actually be completed. Farhad bought her apartment from someone who was selling at a loss before it was completed.\u201cI knew I wanted to live in this building, I love it, but I was a bit cautious,\u201d she said. \u201cThe housing market has become tougher and things are looking a bit shaky for Oscar Properties.\u201dThe go-go days when the company was handing out snacks to people lining up for apartment showings are now over. Still, it has no doubt that it will complete Helix, according to spokeswoman Monica Nygren. \u201cBut considering what the housing market looks like now, the sale of apartments takes longer,\u201d she said.Sandra Miller Kinge, chief executive officer of Eklund Stockholm New York, a high-end broker, agrees, but is also cautious.\u201cWe have no major problems selling new production compared to other apartments, but are also very careful to work closely with the builders to ensure that they have a safe and good offer,\u201d she said.The troubles are also raising warning flags for the broader economy. The booming housing market has been a key component of the fast growth in recent years, but is now emerging as one of its greatest risk. Some economists see construction dropping 30 percent from 2017\u00a0to the end of this year, taking a significant bite out of economic growth.Swedish home construction declined last year for the first time in six yearsSource: Statistics SwedenOne way to salvage projects that are foundering could be to offer more rental housing. Fast population growth and record immigration over the past years mean that there are housing shortages in many areas. A recent political deal is also freeing up rent-setting for new housing.Skanska AB, the international construction giant, last month cut its outlook for the Swedish housing market and is refocusing more on rental housing and lower-priced apartments.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in a dramatic downturn, but I don\u2019t believe in a recovery either,\u201d Anders Danielsson, its chief executive officer, said by phone. \u201cToo much has been built in the most expensive price segments, especially in Stockholm and the big cities.\u201dMichael Grahn, chief economist in Stockholm at Danske Bank A\/S, predicts home prices have further to fall, which will kill more projects and may possible mean the end of some of the smaller developers.\u201cProducers have been building too expensive homes during a number of years when people were willing to pay no matter what,\u201d he said. \u201cThat time is over, they will struggle to sell those expensive homes.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Niklas Magnusson ","95":"Benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index posts a second weekly drop. Chinese stocks led declines on rare sell rating for an A share Stock markets across Asia sank as concerns surrounding global growth mounted, with the region\u2019s benchmark index set for its biggest plunge of the year. Chinese shares plunged the most as traders took a sell rating from the nation\u2019s largest brokerage as a sign that the government wants to slow down the rally.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.4 percent as of 5:39 p.m. in Hong Kong as China\u2019s trade slumped amid continued uncertainty from the trade war, with exports falling and imports weakening in February.

Negligence nor mismanagement nor woeful acts of God were not the reasons \u2013 much of this was the result of injustice!\" CEO Nick Caporella said in a statement.Moving past the unusual statement, analyst Laurent Grandet wrote that the company\u2019s sparkling water brand LaCroix is unlikely to see a sales rebound given the \u201cprolonged softness in U.S. retail and the increasing competitiveness of the category.\u201d Grandet added that social media trends are \u201cdecisively negative\u201d and slashed the firm\u2019s price target on the stock to $45 a share from $72.The brand\u2019s growth has been hurt by negative media attention that called into doubt the company\u2019s claims that LaCroix sparkling water was made with \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients. Facing a class action suit, the company has continued to defend itself, saying results of testing performed by an independent laboratory confirm that the vendor-supplied ingredients \u201cwere derived from natural sources, such as fruit, instead of being artificially created in a lab.\u201dGrandet points out that since the negative media attention last October, growth has \u201crapidly\" decelerated, adding that gross margin in the latest quarter was about 390 basis points short of his estimate. This is the second straight quarter that sales have missed analyst estimates and the stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 1.To make matters worse, the competitive environment continues to get tougher, as brands like Coca-Cola\u2019s Topo Chico gains traction.

Those factors will likely remain for the rest of 2019, he says U.S. markets are dancing to the beat of a rap song that topped the charts more than a decade ago.It\u2019s a \u201cFlo Rida market structure\u2019\u2019 in the eyes of Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos, who channels the hit to describe the primary features of the current financial and macroeconomic backdrop. He said the eight lows investors should pay attention to right now are: inflation, unemployment, rates, curve, volatility, issuance, spreads and volumes. That\u2019s an homage to the track\u2019s chorus, which is punctuated by accompanying artist T-Pain saying \"low\" eight consecutive times.\u201cGrinding all these lows even lower over the next few months seems like the most probable path,\u2019\u2019 Zervos wrote.The labor market has been getting ever tighter, wage growth is picking up, and a sustained, broad acceleration in general price pressures has not yet manifested. Options trading shows that the cost of protecting against inflation averaging above 2 percent over the next two or five years remains relatively low by historical standards.The knock-on effects of a perceived low inflation environment are positive for financial asset valuations. One potential danger for markets is if this particular brand of low inflation also leads to downward pressure on margins should companies not pass on rising labor costs to end-buyers.The unemployment rate -- which currently sits at 3.8 percent -- has been below levels the Federal Reserve presently thinks is sustainable over the long term for the past 18 months. The main upshot for investors: over the past quarter-century, it\u2019s rare to see big stock retreats without a corresponding increase in initial jobless claims -- the highest-frequency read on the U.S. labor market.\u201cMaterial changes to our low-inflation\/low-unemployment economic landscape look highly unlikely,\u2019\u2019 Zervos wrote.Expectations that inflation will stay low and the Fed will hold off from further tightening have sent U.S. government borrowing costs sinking. The 10-year Treasury yield has tumbled more than 60 basis points since early November, and the Eurodollar futures curve implies nearly one full cut from the U.S. central bank between now and the end of 2020.The drop in real rates is providing a meaningful boost to equity valuations: the negative correlation between 5-year inflation-protected bond yields and the S&P 500 is at one of its most extreme levels in history.The gap between short and longer-term Treasury yields continues to winnow \u2013- a sign of perceived economic fragility over the medium term, even amid little conviction that a recession is imminent. At less than 15 basis points, the difference between 10-year Treasury yields and three-month bills closed at its smallest levels of this cycle on Friday.\u201cThe yield curve is below 20 basis points for the fourth straight day,\u2019\u2019 analysts at Bespoke Investment Group wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s a streak that hasn\u2019t been seen at all in this cycle.\u2019\u2019Some lesser-tracked portions of the Treasury curve, such as 2s5s, are already in negative territory.The downward pressure on interest rates of all maturities facilitates a reach for yield that pushes investors into riskier asset classes.Corporates, particularly those clinging to an investment-grade rating, may be incented to go on a \u201cdebt diet\u201d to bolster their creditworthiness, according to Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities.New supply in investment grade is down modestly so far in 2019. Issuance of high-yield debt last year was the lowest since 2009 amid tax changes to interest deductibility and demand for leveraged loans. Even as junk bond sales have picked up in January, the market remains firm thanks to strong appetite from retail flows.The nightmare of December has been quickly forgotten, with cross-asset volatility disappearing. Measures of one-month implied volatility in U.S. stocks plummeting to levels not seen since September\u2019s record highs for the S&P 500 and hovering near an all-time low in the Treasury market.The sum of all fears pertaining to the U.S. credit market is approaching a five-year low, according to a recent Bank of America survey.\u201cU.S. credit investors never bought into market concerns about elevated recession risks priced into financial markets at the turn of the year,\u2019\u2019 wrote Hans Mikkelsen, the head of high-grade credit strategy at the firm. He recently upgraded his year-end forecast to indicate that investment-grade spreads could tighten even more from current levels thanks to the \u201crelatively benign environment\u2019\u2019 ushered in by the Fed.Relatively moribund activity \u2013- especially in U.S. equity index futures \u2013- is partly a function of the above factors: a symptom of those causes. Volumes tend to be lighter in tranquil times, and pick up dramatically in stressed conditions. However, the dearth of trading activity also hints at the potential fragility in market structure, as 2018\u2019s two tumultuous drawdowns were exacerbated by poor liquidity.\u201cIn the near term, there are not really any potential catalysts for a change,\u201d Zervos concluded. \u201cIn any case, all of these lows will not simultaneously disappear, and in fact there is a decent chance they\u2019ll all remain with us for the rest of the year.\u201d ","98":"S&P; 500 rose most in six weeks as U.S. retail sales stabilized.

","99":" Sweden\u2019s economy expanded twice as fast as estimated in the fourth quarter, recovering from a contraction in the prior three months and providing relief to the central bank as it seeks to bring interest rates back above zero.Gross domestic product grew 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter and 2.4 percent from the year-earlier period, Statistics Sweden said Thursday. That beat the 0.6 percent quarterly rate predicted by both the Riksbank and economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Fourth quarter growth was boosted by rising exports and consumer spending, while investments declined.Challenges have been mounting for the Swedish economy after its longest uninterrupted expansion in at least four decades ended last year. Falling home prices are weighing on the housing market, a key driver of economic growth, and concerns over a global trade dispute have cooled exports. The central bank raised interest rates for the first time in seven years in December and this month stuck to a plan to tighten again in the second half of this year, while acknowledging risks to global and domestic growth. Sentiment has also deteriorated amid falling home prices and volatile stock markets and a protracted government crisis. Economic tendency surveys recovered some in February though, with consumer confidence rising from a six-year low. Sweden\u2019s currency is this year\u2019s worst performer among major peers in response to the series of disappointing economic figures and growing speculation that the central bank won\u2019t be able to raise interest rates again later this year. There was more good news for Sweden from retail sales data, which rose a monthly 0.8 percent in January, recovering from December\u2019s drop.Michael Grahn at Danske Bank highlighted the rise in private and public consumption and net exports, arguing that the GDP data \u201cgives some more ammo to the Riksbank.\u201dKiran Sakaria at Handelsbanken said Thursday\u2019s data from Statistics Sweden as \u201cpositive signals for the Riksbank.\u201dAndreas Wallstrom, head of forecasting at Swedbank, said \u201ctoday\u2019s figures support our view\u201d of a Riksbank \u201crate hike in September.\u201dThe krona rallied as much as 0.52 percent on the news and was trading at 10.488 kronor per euro at 9:42 amFor more details, see this table","100":"Farmers, business owners, executives descend on Capitol Hill. Campaign features charity saying Trump\u2019s tariffs hurt infants Corporate America is taking the gloves off in its campaign to end President Trump\u2019s trade war.A coalition of more than 200 trade associations spanning agriculture, manufacturing, retail, technology, oil and even liquor will begin a new two-pronged attack next week to try to end the policies they see as damaging. The campaign, called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, will involve blanketing Capitol Hill with farmers and other business owners, plus debuting an ad aimed at parents that essentially says the trade war might be endangering babies.The escalation comes at a crucial time: The president and Chinese officials are meeting this week with just a month to go before U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports are slated to more than double to 25 percent. It also marks a shift in strategy. After a year of struggling to directly sway Trump and his inner circle, including running ads on Fox News -- his favorite cable channel -- corporate lobbyists are ratcheting up pressure outside the White House.\u201cPeople have to think through different strategies because the normal operating procedure doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Matt Priest, chief executive officer of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, which is part of the wider coalition. \u201cSome of that strategy is paying off, but the response isn\u2019t the response we would\u2019ve liked.\u201dNext week, about 100 executives and business owners from companies big and small will visit Washington to lobby Congress, especially the large freshmen class -- mostly Democrats -- that may still be formulating their stances on trade. Support is also needed for a bipartisan bill intended to rein in the president\u2019s trade authority.The group descending on Washington includes people like Brent Bible, who runs a 5,000-acre corn and soybean farm in Romney, Indiana. Soybeans were hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs last year, pushing down prices to a point where farmers no longer make money. His farm also took a hit when U.S. levies on steel and aluminum made equipment pricier.Related: U.S., China Hold First Day of Trade Talks Amid Wide Differences\u201cJust get it fixed,\u201d said Bible, who holds an economics degree. If this dispute goes on much longer, he said he worries about a \u201csnowball effect\u201d that could make soybeans almost worthless. Bible voted for Trump but said his support has waned in recent months. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a deal soon, then we are looking at a major long-term impact.\u201dThis coalition was formed in September, and its activities so far have included hosting anti-tariff events across the country that generated local media attention and publishing stats on the impact of the trade war. The new push takes that further. It will include a press conference on Feb. 6 with a bipartisan group of senators, including Democrat Mark Warner and Republican Pat Toomey, who crafted the bill to reduce presidential trade powers.Cribs for KidsThe coalition also had a new ad that tries to tug at the heartstrings of Americans by getting them to feel the pain it says Trump\u2019s trade war is causing. The spot, which will first run online in Washington and swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, features Cribs for Kids, a Pittsburgh-based charity that sells 100,000 low-cost portable baby beds a year to local governments and hospitals. The partners then give them to low-income families, who might not have one otherwise.Judy BannonIn the ad, the nonprofit\u2019s executive director, Judy Bannon, says Trump\u2019s tariffs are increasing costs for the cribs it imports from China. The charity has already seen a decline in orders after a 10 percent levy on Chinese goods last year, Bannon said in an interview. She paints the impact in life-and-death terms, saying that getting babies to sleep in cribs and on their backs -- a message reinforced on the charity\u2019s cribs -- reduces Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\u201cAs a nonprofit, we never thought tariffs would affect us, but they do,\u201d Bannon says in the 30-second video. The spot also tries to drive home the point that tariffs are essentially taxes on U.S. companies, despite Trump\u2019s Twitter proclamations that China is the one paying the duties. \u201cPresident Trump says that China is paying these tariffs, but I see the cost on my invoices.\u201dBillions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A. because of the Tariffs being charged to China, and there is a long way to go. If companies don\u2019t want to pay Tariffs, build in the U.S.A. Otherwise, lets just make our Country richer than ever before!Despite strong opposition from corporate America and the lobbying infrastructure it bankrolls, thwarting Trump on trade hasn\u2019t been easy. The impact of the tariffs is still small when compared with the overall U.S. economy and hasn\u2019t resulted in widespread price increases for consumers. Several lobbyists noted that the government shutdown ended only when airports were disrupted, and that kind of bellwether event hasn\u2019t materialized yet with tariffs. The administration has done its part by avoiding hitting consumer products directly to blunt public outcry.And because the trade war is promoted by the White House, most of America\u2019s CEOs have remained publicly silent, for fear of getting criticized publicly by Trump or raising the ire of the administration officials overseeing tariff exemptions. That\u2019s a far cry from 2017, when executives complained on TV and in congressional testimony in a successful bid to kill the border-adjustment tax backed by former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.To be sure, there have been victories in corporate America. Lobbyists for farmers, seen as a crucial part of Trump\u2019s base, pushed the administration to authorize $12 billion in relief funds after Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs. Trade groups also got plenty of items taken off the final tariff lists, including car booster seats for kids. They also point to Trump delaying the next tariff hike by two months to March to allow for more negotiations.The timing of this escalated opposition could be helpful. The president just took a hit from the government shutdown. The political calendar has already turned to the 2020 presidential race, and Trump needs a strong economy for his re-election bid. That story is harder to tell with almost daily reports of U.S. companies -- from Apple Inc. to Stanley Black & Decker Inc. -- partly blaming weak results on the trade war.\u201cA lot things are coming to a head,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, another coalition member. With Trump\u2019s re-election bid looming, \u201cdo you think he\u2019s going to risk a stock market fall over a 25 percent tariff -- at this point? But I don\u2019t know anyone who has been right calling Trump\u2019s moves.\u201d ","101":" Rivian Automotive founder R.J. Scaringe\u00a0approached deep-pocketed Saudi investors in late 2011 with an audacious proposal. The\u00a0young entrepreneur confessed he had no experience running a company. He admitted his initial prototype\u2014a battery-powered\u00a0sports car much like Tesla Inc.\u2019s Roadster\u2014was the wrong idea, and planned to build a pickup instead.Of course\u00a0Scaringe, now 36, didn\u2019t have a truck to show then. What he did have was something in common with\u00a0Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel, the chairman of a Saudi auto distributor who, like Scaringe,\u00a0also attended\u00a0Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\u00a0 Scaringe showed up recommended by MIT contacts, and\u00a0playing\u00a0the alumni card worked. After a series of meetings\u00a0pitching clean-running\u00a0pickups and SUVs\u00a0in hotels around Europe, he sealed a deal in early 2012 for\u00a0$5 million in funding to get Rivian Automotive LLC in gear.\u201cIt was a seminal point,\u201d Scaringe said in an interview. \u201cThey recognized the passion I had. A big part of it was building trust in me.\u201dRivian had another seminal moment Friday, when it announced a $700 million funding round led by\u00a0Amazon.com Inc.\u00a0Scaringe also is in talks with\u00a0General Motors Co.\u00a0on some kind of partnership with the largest U.S. automaker, as well, said people familiar with the matter.Scaringe has spent the last\u00a0seven years developing a pickup and\u00a0sport utility vehicle that\u2019ll be built off a\u00a0common\u00a0electric-battery platform that could be used for other models in the future. In exchange for leading the bulk of the $1.15 billion in investment Rivian has drawn to date,\u00a0Amazon will get a minority stake in the company.The EV platform, which Scaringe prefers to\u00a0refer\u00a0to as a \u201cskateboard,\u201d is a big part of\u00a0his vision to deliver fat returns to those who\u2019ve backed him. In addition to selling his own trucks and SUVs, he\u2019s open to selling the technology to others for a myriad of applications, such as stationary batteries.\u201cThere\u2019s another aspect to our business, which is leveraging our skateboard architecture and platform for non-Rivian products, which allows us to play in other spaces outside of our own brand and access other customers,\u201d Scaringe said.In this sense, Scaringe is similar\u00a0to Tesla\u00a0Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who\u2019s opened up\u00a0the company\u2019s patents for use to help develop electric cars. The two differ, though, in their willingness to let veterans of the auto industry\u00a0help get their companies rolling.\u00a0Whereas Musk sought to reinvent carmaking\u00a0with extensive use of automation\u2014an ambition that contributed to repeated delays in getting the lower-priced Model 3 sedan to market\u2014Scaringe has eagerly poached\u00a0from big\u00a0conventional carmakers\u2019\u00a0manufacturing, engineering and design departments.\u201cHe\u2019s taken time to learn from everyone\u2019s mistakes, and he\u2019s going after a market that is still growing,\u201d\u00a0Tony Posawatz, an auto industry consultant who developed the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid for GM, said of Scaringe.Much of Rivian\u2019s workforce of about 750 employees is spread across California and Michigan, with automated driving and software engineers in San Jose, battery geeks in Irvine, and traditional auto\u00a0engineers just outside Detroit. It also has a small office in the U.K. The company acquired its\u00a0Normal, Illinois, assembly plant from Mitsubishi Motors Corp. in 2017 for $16 million and was able to re-purpose some of the equipment the Japanese automaker left behind.Rivian\u2019s vice president of manufacturing, Matt Tall, came from AM General, the maker of Humvees for the military and the Hummer SUVs GM once sold\u00a0to civilians.\u00a0Jeff Hammoud, VP of design, is a veteran of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\u2019s Jeep.In an interview before the Amazon announcement, Scaringe declined to comment on that deal, or on any discussions with GM. He did say Rivian\u2019s backers, which include Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Corp. and Britain\u2019s Standard Chartered Plc, are committed. \u201cWe will bring on additional partners, but less because of capital reasons and more because of a need to have strategic relationships as we scale towards our broader vision,\u201d he said.If Scaringe is able to land\u00a0outside investment from several giants of the auto and technology sectors, he\u2019ll be making more Musk-like moves. Tesla sold stakes to Daimler AG and Toyota Motor Corp. and partnered with them on joint electric-vehicle projects to help weather the recession, though\u00a0both have since parted ways. China\u2019s Tencent Holdings Ltd. ranks among the Model 3 maker\u2019s top shareholders.Buy-in from Amazon and others will hand Scaringe the cash to help bring Rivian\u2019s R1T pickup to market on time next year. The investment also carries\u00a0with it the potential for the\u00a0world\u2019s largest online retailer to eventually become a customer. Amazon has been building out a fleet of vehicles bearing its brand to handle deliveries for its wildly popular Prime service.A car buff since his youth, Scaringe grew up on Florida\u2019s Space Coast in\u00a0Melbourne, near Cape Canaveral. Like his father, he has a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering. He\u00a0rebuilt a 1957 Porsche Speedster in his youth and dreamed of starting a car company.While earning his master\u2019s and doctorate from MIT, where he was a member of the\u00a0Sloan Automotive Laboratory\u2019s research team, Scaringe had an environmental awakening.According to official company lore, he spent\u00a0his free time hiking, carried around his own fork and spoon, dried his laundry on clotheslines strung around his apartment\u00a0and biked to class, even in the winter.\u00a0In class, Scaringe was relatively quiet and well liked by his peers, said\u00a0Wai Cheng, a professor of mechanical engineering who supervised him.\u201cHe\u2019s an extremely nice guy, except when you play basketball with him,\u201d Cheng said of how other students described Scaringe. \u201cHe\u2019s not an aggressive guy, but he\u2019s very competitive.\u201dScaringe went through several names for\u00a0the company after founding it in 2009. It was called\u00a0Mainstream Motors Inc. on an interim basis and received seed capital from Florida-based Mainstream Engineering Corp., a company his father owned. It briefly went by Avera Motors Inc. until South Korea\u2019s\u00a0Hyundai Motor Co. complained this sounded too much like its Azera sedan.\u00a0Scaringe settled on Rivian in 2011.Back when its headquarters was near Cape Canaveral, Rivian\u00a0got an early leg up from $3.5\u00a0million in state funding.\u00a0\u00a0That included financing from Florida\u2019s aerospace\u00a0economic development organization, which\u00a0invested about $1.5 million in return for stock warrants that it has yet to exercise.\u00a0\u201cObviously, we would have liked them to have built a giant car factory on the Space Coast, but ultimately we expect them to develop technology\u201d that will prove useful to the space program, said Dale Ketcham, a spokesman for Space Florida.At a briefing for journalists in November, Scaringe said Rivian was looking to do for autos what Patagonia has done for outdoor clothing, aiming for an upscale but utility-focused consumer. His goal is to make a pickup and SUV that are premium and\u00a0give\u00a0buyers a spirit of adventure, but with clean emissions and great technology, including over-the-air updates. If he delivers, Musk\u2019s success suggests Scaringe has a chance to\u00a0be greeted with broad appeal.\u201cTesla did an outstanding job,\u201d Scaringe said. \u201cThey pulled customers out of luxury cars and even the Toyota Prius. You\u2019ll see us pulling people out of Land Rovers, BMWs, Subarus and Teslas.\u201d ","102":" Cerved Group SpA said Advent International Corporation doesn\u2019t plan to proceed with a possible takeover bid on the Italian credit manager and adviser.Advent decided against proceeding with the offer after Cerved\u2019s share price rose amid speculation on the bid, which Cerved confirmed last week, the Italian company said in a statement Monday.\u201cThe increase in the share price after the press release related to market rumors made the transaction uncertain,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAdvent has at the present time decided to not proceed with the transaction.\u201dCerved failed to set an opening price in Milan trading and was indicated down 13 percent as of 9:26 a.m. The stock was up about 25 percent percent since February 12, the day before the non-binding offer was launched. ","103":" Judging how Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ended 2018 very much depended on one\u2019s preferred metric.The company posted a staggering net loss of $25 billion in the fourth quarter, the biggest loss in its history. That was largely due to a new accounting rule that Buffett disagrees with, which requires companies to report changes in the value of investments as part of earnings. For most corporations, that\u2019s a relatively minor figure, but Berkshire\u2019s $170 billion stock portfolio means big gains and losses each quarter.Warren BuffettThe firm\u2019s operating earnings, meanwhile, soared 71 percent from a year earlier. That\u2019s Buffett\u2019s preferred metric because it excludes stock swings and measures how Berkshire\u2019s underlying businesses are performing. Those units benefited from better insurance results, gains at the company\u2019s railroad and a lower corporate tax rate.Here are more takeaways from the results and the billionaire investor\u2019s annual letter to shareholders:Read more: Buffett\u2019s annual letter to shareholdersWarren Buffett is on the lookout for his next purchase as his cash pile rose to $112 billion. He dismissed immediate prospects for a deal due to \u201csky-high\u201d prices. Berkshire has not had a major acquisition in more than three years, and instead has used its cash to buy back about $1.3 billion of its own shares in 2018 and snap up stocks of other companies.Berkshire&apos;s cash has remained above $100 billion for six straight quartersSource: Company filingsThe cash has been a drag on Berkshire\u2019s ability to return more than the broader market. While the company\u2019s book value has increased at almost twice the rate of the S&P 500 during his career, it has actually trailed the index over the last decade. Buffett said he\u2019d be retiring the metric from his annual letter because it has lost relevance.Read more: Buffett holds out deal hope as cash pile growsAlthough Buffett didn\u2019t disclose hints of his successor in the letter, he did answer some questions about the kind of company that he would ultimately pass on. Berkshire\u2019s chairman wrote the conglomerate should be viewed as a \u201cforest\u201d with five different groves, as part of his case for keeping the businesses together. The combined entity can easily allocate huge amounts of capital, obtain low-cost funding, reap tax efficiencies and minimize some risks and costs, he wrote in the letter.Read more: Buffett has a message for his successorThe period featured $27.6 billion in investment losses for Berkshire as U.S. stocks had their worst quarter in more than seven years. Apple Inc., the conglomerate\u2019s biggest equity bet, dropped 30 percent in the three months.Berkshire\u2019s fourth-quarter net loss was also widened by a $2.7 billion hit to its stake in Kraft Heinz Co., which announced late Thursday a $15.4 billion writedown to its assets, including the value of some of its most prominent brand names.Read more: Berkshire\u2019s consumer bets biteThe lack of big acquisitions led Berkshire to add $24 billion to its stock portfolio last year. And Buffett said that \u201cthe disappointing reality\u201d that prices are expensive for deals means Berkshire will probably be buying more stocks in 2019.\u201cIn recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for our money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety,\u201d Buffett wrote.Despite the big losses on its stock portfolio in the quarter, Berkshire is still ahead on most of its biggest bets, including Apple. Among the largest stakes, the only one where the company is below its purchase cost is JPMorgan Chase & Co., a position Berkshire entered last year.Even after the market&apos;s plunge, Berkshire remains ahead on its biggest betsSource: Company filingBerkshire\u2019s operating companies showed strong performance, driven by higher earnings in its railroad and energy businesses and a lower corporate tax rate. Profit generated from all the units jumped by 71 percent in the year, and the insurance businesses rebounded from a $2.2 billion underwriting loss in 2017.Buffett used his letter to single out Tony Nicely, Geico\u2019s long-time chief executive officer who quietly stepped down last year. \u201cBy my estimate, Tony\u2019s management of Geico has increased Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value by more than $50 billion,\u201d Buffett wrote in Saturday\u2019s letter.Read more: Buffett praises Geico\u2019s $50 billion man ","104":" A look at Russia\u2019s books suggests Vladimir Putin is preparing for war, though not necessarily the kind involving the invincible hypersonic missiles and\u00a0nuclear torpedoes he\u2019s been bragging about for a year.Putin&apos;s quietly built a financial fortress that government officials and Kremlin advisers say will safeguard the economy from the escalating  salvos\u00a0they see coming, all while keeping the U.S. and its allies guessing about Russia\u2019s military capabilities and intentions.It\u2019s a goal Putin\u2019s been pursuing since he rose to power at the turn of the millennium, one that\u2019s gained urgency with each new crisis with the West. During the global credit squeeze a decade ago, Russia\u2019s main stock index lost three-fourths of its value. Five years ago, the ruble halved against the dollar in the wake of collapsing oil prices and the imposition of sanctions over Ukraine, triggering the longest recession of his rule.Now Russia is growing again despite adopting one of the most tightfisted budgets of any major economy. This year\u2019s total spending bill, about $270 billion, is less than half the Pentagon\u2019s\u2014and Russia is collecting more rubles than it\u2019s disbursing. The country was one of only three in the Group of 20 to run a surplus last year and its debt burden is by far the lowest in the club.Russia\u2019s budget surplus is allowing Putin to stockpile cash for future crisesSource: 2018 IMF calculations, estimatesAll About the U.S. Sanctions Aimed at Putin\u2019s Russia: QuickTakeThe turnaround can be traced to a decision Putin made at a closed-door meeting with his economic advisers in the fall of 2016 that surprised even the most fiscally hawkish among them, according to three people familiar with the matter. Russia was about to codify a requirement to sequester all oil revenue above a particular price point and Putin chose the most pessimistic scenario presented to him\u2014$40 a barrel, less than half the average for the previous decade.What made the decision so remarkable, these people said, was the political risks it entailed. Putin was heading toward elections with a shrinking economy while managing a high-stakes military intervention in Syria and bracing for what looked certain to be a White House victory for Hillary Clinton, a virulent critic who\u2019d just compared him to Adolf Hitler.Instead of loosening the purse strings to appease the competing domestic groups that undergird his system of governance, he yanked them tight. Putin cut spending across the board\u2014including defense\u2014to replenish Russia\u2019s rainy day fund. At the same time, the central bank was refueling its reserves after abandoning a costly defense of the ruble to focus on amassing gold and yuan, liquidating most of its U.S. Treasury bills without warning.\u201cPutin is accumulating savings because they give him power,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cHe needs money to fight the West, to deal with intensifying sanctions and to address future economic crises.\u201dDebt-rating services and financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund\u00a0are applauding, albeit with caution in light of repeated threats of more punitive action from Washington and Brussels.  Moody\u2019s\u00a0this month followed S&P in restoring Russia\u2019s credit score to investment grade, saying the country\u2019s balance sheet has become bulletproof enough to absorb the likely impact of the additional sanctions its analysts are expecting.But Putin\u2019s austerity drive is eating away at the considerable cache of political capital he\u2019s amassed during his tenure in the Kremlin, the longest since Josef Stalin: Growth is anemic; real incomes continue to decline; interest rates remain relatively high; inflation is picking up; and the steady hikes in state pensions that were hallmarks of earlier terms have plateaued.Adding to the distrust that has dragged Putin\u2019s approval rating to a decade low is a law he signed after his landslide victory last March that raises the retirement age by five years. The cost-saving measure was widely opposed in a country where most people were born under communism, leading to a rare outbreak of protests. A hike in the value-added tax is further eroding purchasing power, stoking a rise in consumer debt and deepening public discontent.\u201cThe leadership of our country decided on a highly conservative scenario: save up as much as possible and spend as little as possible,\u201d said Yaroslav Kuzminov, the dean of the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. \u201cThe goal now is to preserve what\u2019s been achieved, macroeconomic and budget stability, even at the expense of spurring growth.\u201dA favorite Putin metric\u2014the central bank\u2019s reserves\u2014has risen by about $125 billion in the past four years to $475 billion. The stockpile, the world\u2019s fifth largest, is still well shy of the $598 billion peak reached in 2008, when oil flirted with $150 a barrel.Russia\u2019s sequestration mechanism and wealth fund are\u00a0modeled on Norway\u2019s system for hedging against fluctuations in crude prices and ensuring future pensions. But unlike Norway, which rarely taps its $1 trillion hoard in Oslo, officials in Moscow drain Russia\u2019s pool whenever times get tough, according to Karen Vartapetov, a debt analyst at S&P.\u201cAll previous cancellations of the budget rule were linked to some force majeure,\u201d said Vartapetov. \u201cRussia is now accumulating funds a bit faster that the current oil environment would assume because of the probability of other shocks, including new sanctions.\u201dTo keep the expansion going, Putin is relying more on businesses for investment and less on the multiyear, budget-funded infrastructure projects like those he ordered up for the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2018 World Cup.

Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, racked up tens of billions of dollars of debt to finance the purchase of food and consumer goods from the West that Putin methodically whittled down, eventually paying almost all of it off ahead of schedule.Putin&apos;s driven Russia&apos;s debt level to the lowest in the G-20 relative to GDPSource: Bank of RussiaNow, thanks in no small part to a 23 percent jump in tax collections last year, Russia\u2019s balance sheet has never looked better, according to Putin.\u00a0\u201cFor the first time in our history our reserves cover all foreign debt, both state and commercial,\u201d the Russian president told lawmakers in his annual address to the upper house of parliament on Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cWe have a powerful financial safety cushion.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Andrey Biryukov ","105":"Steps to rein in booming rents take effect ahead of elections. Government\u2019s decree makes rentals a riskier bet for investors A bid to rein in booming home rentals is under way in Spain where the politics of populism is helping to set terms for the real estate market.Just weeks before Spain holds elections, the Socialist government limited rent increases to the inflation rate in new contracts for the country\u2019s six million apartments. The emergency decree threw a curve ball to investors including Blackstone Group, which has spent billions of dollars acquiring property in a bet on the recovery of the real estate market after Spain\u2019s 2012 financial crash.While rents jumped about 60 percent in Madrid and Barcelona in the 2014-2017 period, according to BNP Paribas Real Estate, annual hikes will be held to inflation, currently 1.1 percent. The cap will last five years for individual landlords, or seven years for institutional landlords like Azora or Blackstone.\u201cThis will destroy some supply of apartments for institutional owners like us who want to buy, because the measures aren\u2019t favorable to the product, which now has more risk,\u201d said Javier Rodriguez, a partner at Azora in Madrid, which owns and manages 14,000 units. He said it shouldn\u2019t affect returns for Azora\u2019s long-term investors because apartment demand is still so strong.Facing an election April 28 and pressure from his political ally, the anti-austerity platform Podemos, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez published steps to protect renters on March 5, the day his administration dissolved Parliament. Podemos\u2019s program calls for five-year periods of rent control, as well as a ban on evictions from a primary residence.The decree may limit returns for investors such as Azora and Blackstone, which were benefiting from a robust market. Existing homes appreciated 11 percent in Madrid last year, and 6.6 percent nationwide, the government statistics agency said Friday.Blackstone\u2019s head of real estate for Europe James Seppala said the buyout specialist does not oppose the new law, although its measures could lead some landlords to take homes off the market or \u201cto sell rather than keep units as part of the housing stock available for rent.\u201d About 25 percent of Blackstone\u2019s Spanish assets are in rental housing.\u201cCompanies that were thinking about investing in the real estate sector will rethink now whether Spain is attractive,\u201d said Angel Mejias de Santiago, a Madrid property and insurance lawyer.Just six years ago, Mariano Rajoy, Sanchez\u2019s conservative predecessor, had started deregulating a market that was reviving from a financial crisis-induced meltdown. In the ensuing period, a group of home-grown REITS mushroomed and Blackstone jumped into the market, acquiring a broad 25 billion-euro ($28 billion) Spanish portfolio.Sanchez\u2019s decree responds to mounting political concern that workers are being priced out of rental markets in major cities such as Madrid and Barcelona.It also sets up a price-index framework for use by local governments to help encourage lower rent increases. The benchmarks aim to keep landlords from pricing tenants out of their neighborhoods when rent increases and rising house prices far outstrip inflation, as happened over past decades in many big cities with buoyant job markets from San Francisco to Melbourne.Because the law was decreed, Parliament has the option to overturn it during the first 30 days after its publication. With Congress dissolved, a reduced group of legislators handles such issues, and its agenda-setting board is scheduled to meet Wednesday.Another problem is that the construction industry hasn\u2019t yet fully revved up again to provide new supply. The mass conversion of apartments for use as Airbnb-type tourist rentals has has also contributed to soaring rents.Average rents jumped 15 percent nationwide in the past three years, and about double that in the hottest city markets, the government said when it passed the law.\u201cThe law has laudable goals,\u201d said Enrique Losantos, Spanish chief executive of property consultant JLL, or Jones Lang Lasalle. But the price index, for example, will allow local governments and 8,000 city halls \u201cto constrict the free market and adopt, under their own heterogeneous criteria, rental policies that have attractive electoral effects which call into question the legal stability institutional investors want.\u201dBig institutions only tiptoed into Spain as the real estate meltdown eased around 2014. Most, like Blackstone or Cerberus, focused on commercial properties or, like Savills, bought a local real estate consultant. The entire group has only accumulated about 3 percent of Spain\u2019s apartment market.They benefited from Spain\u2019s 2013 reduction to three years from five the length of mandatory contracts, and its 2015 decision to eliminate inflation indexing.\u201cWhat we, like all other investors, value is clarity and stability,\u201d Blackstone\u2019s Seppala said.

Buyout firms\u2019 record for raised money could fuel issuance There are 1.2 trillion reasons for U.S. junk bond and leveraged loan issuance to stay relatively strong this year.That\u2019s how much money private equity firms globally had available to deploy as of the end of last year, a record level that\u2019s 17 percent above 2017 figures, according to Preqin. The buyouts they\u2019ll need to finance should keep U.S. issuance volume from plunging this year.\u201cIt all depends on what the private equity shops do,\u201d said Randall Parrish, senior high-yield portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management in Atlanta. \u201cThey have raised enough capital that there has to be pressure on them to deploy.\u201dPrivate equity dry powder at recordPreqin\nIt\u2019s easy to lose sight of that fact amid recent market slowness. With the Federal Reserve on hold with rate hikes, investors have lost some of their passion for floating-rate debt offerings. New U.S. leveraged loan sales have fallen nearly 20 percent to $45.7 billion through Feb. 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. High-yield bond sales have also declined, down about 7 percent to $35.5 billion.Figuring out how much issuance will come in 2019 is a critical question for loan and bond investors. The recent lack of supply has helped high-yield bonds gain about 5.5% this year, a record start to the year, and leveraged loans pick up to 3.42%. And light supply could give private equity more negotiating power in deals that do come to market, allowing them to argue for looser terms, for example.The near-term pipeline for issuance still looks relatively weak. There\u2019s a $10 billion financing expected in the coming weeks for the buyout of Johnson Controls International Plc\u2019s car-battery unit. But most of the biggest acquisition-related offerings in the works at the start of the year have already been sold, including CommScope Holding Co.\u2019s $7 billion deal and TransDigm Group Inc.\u2019s $4.55 billion of issuances.Read More in the Credit Brief: Preparing for the Credit Cycle\u2019s EndAcquisition volume, an important source of issuance, was hurt by big fluctuations in stock and bond markets starting in October. That volatility makes it hard to determine exactly how much assets will be worth and how high financing costs will be at any given time.

Wall Street banks, including Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., and Bank of America Corp., forecast only slightly less leveraged loan sales this year compared with 2018.\u201cIn terms of M&A, I do expect more issuance as this cycle still has legs,\" said Bill Housey, senior portfolio manager at First Trust Advisors.Even with expected LBOs, there are other factors likely to cut into leveraged finance issuance volume. Tax cuts have increased cash flow for at least some companies, reducing their financing needs. Trade disputes between China and the U.S. may also be delaying capital investments, acquisitions, and associated borrowing, First Trust\u2019s Housey said.And more borrowers are getting loans in the private markets, instead of syndicated loans.

Then the French sensation took the Brazilian hero on his back, and together the two global megastars relished their goal\u2014joined by the image of a third icon, albeit a long-retired one from a different sport: Michael Jordan.The U.S. basketball legend and his iconic jumpman logo on the jerseys of soccer stars may seem an unlikely pairing, but it\u2019s part of a bigger push by Nike Inc. to test new marketing tactics in its perennial battle with Adidas AG\u2014particularly on the latter\u2019s European home turf. Nike is diversifying its brand to reach a younger audience and establish a stronger following in European hot spots such as Paris, one of the world\u2019s leading fashion hubs, and Berlin, the region\u2019s capital of cool.Data: Ballershoesdb.com, Footballbootsdb.comThe \u201cJordan X PSG\u201d collection, which features hats, jerseys, and other Paris Saint-Germain soccer club paraphernalia, sold out swiftly after its September debut, surprising even Nike leaders. The collection has helped fuel a resurgence in sales for the Jordan brand. In the quarter that ended on Nov. 30, Nike recorded growing sales in Europe, defying a gloomy economic picture for a continent beset by Brexit, Italian political disarray, and yellow vest protests in France. In December, Nike executives said investors should expect further growth in Europe, thanks to new digital marketing tools in London and other cities and hot-selling products like the PSG-Jordan line. On March 21, Nike reported North American  results that fell short of expectations, but its sales grew 6 percent in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for the quarter through the end of February.\u201cNike is expressing a vision of the future and executing on it better than anybody I see in retail,\u201d says John Kernan, a New York-based analyst with Cowen Inc. \u201cThey\u2019re staying close to the consumer. They\u2019re driving local trends in key cities.\u201dNike\u2019s big break comes at the expense of Adidas, which has acknowledged that business at home is tough these days. In its two most recent quarters, the German company recorded  falling sales in Europe, which Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted said isn\u2019t acceptable when he  discussed earnings on March 13. Adidas, he said, has become too reliant on fashion-focused products, losing touch with its historical roots in sports gear. Since 2015 the German giant had enjoyed one of its best runs in seven decades of business, with its stock price quadrupling on demand for retro products that included the 1970s-era  Stan Smith tennis shoes and Superstar basketball kicks.The boom this decade in casual clothing and sporty attire known as \u201cathleisure\u201d helped Adidas narrow the coolness gap with Nike, thanks in part to savvy marketing, such as Gisele B\u00fcndchen posing nude, save for her Stan Smiths, in Vogue Paris, Pharrell Williams overseeing the  resurgent Superstars, and Kanye West developing his high-priced Yeezy line of sneakers for the company. By 2017, Adidas shocked industry analysts by eclipsing Jordan as the second-hottest-selling brand in U.S. sneakers. Nike\u2019s new push into Europe took root in 2017, when the Beaverton, Ore.-based company\u2014reeling from a two-year slump\u2014started rolling out a bevy of best-sellers. The footwear includes the  Air VaporMax, the latest overhaul of the air-cushioned sneakers that date to the 1980s; the soft and springy Epic React shoe; and  self-lacing kicks. In 2018, Nike had 7 of the 10 hottest U.S. sneakers, according to retail market researcher NPD Group, including the minimalist Tanjun, the Air Max 270, and the Jordan XI \u201cConcord.\u201dNike has taken the battle to Berlin. In September it scored a coup at the Berlin Marathon (where Adidas is the anchor sponsor), when Kenya\u2019s Eliud Kipchoge smashed the world record by 78 seconds. He crossed the finish line pumping his fists in jubilation and showcasing the Nike Swoosh on his singlet, half-tights, and Zoom Vaporfly shoes. Three months later, Nike sponsored a documentary, screened online, that celebrated Berlin\u2019s vibrant nightlife by featuring three dance-club veterans reveling in the city\u2019s techno, art, and street culture\u2014and sporting Nike shirts and shoes. In late March the company will release a Berlin-themed Air Max 180 sneaker, with neon colors reminiscent of the lights in techno clubs and a gray upper the company says is a nod to Berlin\u2019s concrete postwar buildings. \u201cJust think how painful it is for the Adidas executives to see that,\u201d says Chen Grazutis, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. \u201cIt\u2019d be like Adidas starting to put videos out saying how Portland is cool. It\u2019s a little odd. But when Nike does it, it doesn\u2019t look that weird.\u201dAdidas, of course, isn\u2019t standing still. The company is promoting a new line of shoes and apparel partly  made with recycled plastic pulled from beaches and oceans to raise awareness of pollution around the world. The material is also threaded into German soccer powerhouse FC Bayern\u2019s jerseys for Champions League games.It\u2019s possible that in coming years a squad of FC Bayern players in Adidas\u2019s ocean-plastic uniforms will square off against a team of PSG stars wearing the image of Michael Jordan. Adidas CEO Rorsted would be rooting for Bayern but not without some envy. Asked if there\u2019s one athlete in the world he\u2019d most like to see wearing Adidas, the CEO had a quick response: \u201cMbappe. He\u2019s a great player. He has speed. He has personality.\u201d And Nike is his sponsor.

And for an investor who has always preached about taking a long-term view, Berkshire also took a $2.1 billion stake in Oracle in the third quarter, then sold it the next.Some of Berkshire\u2019s recent stock-market activity is explained by the increased responsibility Buffett has awarded to Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, his investing deputies. One of them turned him on to Apple initially, another purchase that came as a surprise to Buffett\u2019s followers.\n            \n\n                1\n            \n        \u00a0Even though Berkshire sold nearly 3 million Apple shares in the latest quarter, it\u2019s still 21 percent of the portfolio.Four companies account for more than half of Berkshire Hathaway&apos;s equity holdingsSource: BloombergBut with Buffett turning 89 this summer, one has to wonder whether these are early signs of how Berkshire will look when he\u2019s no longer around and if its culture will always have that Buffett feel. His annual letters aren\u2019t known for their element of surprise and have become almost formulaic, usually repeating affirmations about the health of the U.S. economy and conducting autopsies of past business decisions. Buffett should stray from that approach this year and use the letter to  provide more transparency\u00a0about the future of his company \u2014 especially when it comes to all its cash.Berkshire had about $104 billion in cash as of September, which marked one year since it reached\u00a012 figures. For Buffett, the ideal use would be another giant acquisition to add to his empire, and when stocks sold off broadly at the end of 2018, it seemed as if\u00a0he finally had his opening. I\u00a0suspected another Valentine\u2019s Day deal. Berkshire\u2019s 2013 buyout of HJ Heinz with 3G Capital was announced on the romantic holiday, which is also the day Berkshire reports its market holdings. Speaking of Heinz, Buffett would also be well served by explaining his plans for Berkshire\u2019s big stake in Kraft Heinz Co., a deal that he helped orchestrate that has turned sour.\u00a0\u00a0The longer Buffett waits to spend his cash pile, the more likely it is that this asset turns into an immense burden for his successor. No\u00a0matter how skilled the next in line \u2014\u00a0Greg Abel? Ajit Jain? \u2014 is, they will be missing one crucial advantage that Buffett\u00a0has long enjoyed in M&A negotiations: his name. The idea of selling to and working for him \u2014 instead of to another suitor that might have gut the business to save on costs \u2014 probably persuaded a lot of targets in the end, perhaps even to accept a lower offer than others would have made  amid the U.S. takeover frenzy of the last few years.\u00a0Buffett hasn\u2019t done enough\u00a0yet to ensure a smooth transition. The next generation of leaders is clearly already leaving its mark\u00a0on the company. His shifting stock investments are proof of that, and Combs even  facilitated the  Precision Castparts acquisition, Berkshire\u2019s last significant deal.\u00a0Warren Buffett&apos;s annual letter to shareholders was briefer than usual last yearSource: BloombergLast year\u2019s Buffett letter was the shortest one in more than two decades.

Meanwhile, the weekly comfort measure edged down slightly as views on personal finances dimmed somewhat. The first rise in expectations since October follows the Jan. 25 end of the five-week shutdown and a rally for stocks after they posted the worst December in 86 years.The rebound in the monthly gauge is similar to the recovery after a previous shutdown in October 2013, which was followed by four straight months of sentiment gains. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary survey of consumer sentiment in February showed that a better-than-expected improvement in the index was concentrated in the outlook. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index is forecast to rebound this month after slumping in January to the weakest since July 2017.The weekly survey showed a narrower gap between top and bottom income brackets.

Wild swings in the stock market throughout the fourth quarter likely also contributed to the drop, according to Lucy Dadayan, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute.The steeper-than-expected drop threatens to leave some states facing budget shortfalls in the current fiscal year, which ends in June for most governments.\"Revenue forecasters had factored in the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but the magnitude of decline is really much larger than expected,\" Dadayan said, adding that she expects to see some growth in April but not enough to make up for the losses in December primarily because of the stock market sell-off, government shutdown and uncertainty related to tariffs.States reliant on high-income taxpayers were hit the hardest. New York\u2019s personal income-tax revenue declined 25.2 percent in the fourth quarter from the same quarter of 2017 while its overall tax revenue declined 14.7 percent.

Wage gains signal tighter labor market still benefits workers The U.S. labor market may not be as weak as February\u2019s payrolls number suggested, but the report provides a reality check that a long-forecast slowdown is arriving.Employers added 20,000 jobs during the month, the fewest since September 2017, missing all economist estimates and bucking a recent trend of strong February readings. Analysts said the unexpectedly low figure doesn\u2019t mean conditions rapidly deteriorated -- citing weather effects and payback from outsize gains in prior months -- but they pointed to the likelihood of a moderation in job gains this year as economic growth cools.\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to say that 20,000 is the new trend, but the trend probably is shifting down,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know with precision how much of a downshift there will be.

Some industries hit hard in February are typically closely tied to weather patterns, including construction and retail, while the lingering effects of the partial government shutdown may have created some volatility.Read more: Bloomberg\u2019s TOPLive blog on the jobs report\u201cThere was always going to be noise in this as a result of the shutdown,\u201d Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG LLP, said on Bloomberg Television.Policy makers and economists are likely to wait for several months of weak hiring before concluding there\u2019s cause for concern in the labor market.

The effects of fiscal stimulus, including a boost in government spending, are expected to fade while President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China remains an overhang on businesses.The report also showed signs that companies are paying up for employees in a tight market. Average hourly earnings for private workers rose 0.4 percent from the prior month, topping estimates, following a 0.1 percent gain. That indicates the economy may get a lift from wage increases at companies including Amazon Inc. along with Costco Wholesale Corp., which said Thursday it\u2019s boosting starting wages.Another positive highlight: The U-6, or underemployment rate, plunged to 7.3 percent, the lowest since 2001, from 8.1 percent.

Murdoch family emerges from sale with a smaller Fox empire Walt Disney Co. completed its $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox Inc.\u2019s entertainments assets, and now must get to the task of squeezing out promised cost savings, an effort that will lead to thousands of firings in the film and TV business.With the deal, Disney takes over a portfolio that includes the 104-year-old 20th Century Fox studio, the FX and National Geographic cable networks, and an additional 30 percent of Hulu, the online video service. To make the deal work financially and support the company\u2019s costly efforts to compete with Netflix Inc., Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has promised $2 billion in cost savings, a commitment that all but assures epic job cuts.In a note to employees Wednesday, Iger said management has spent the past year studying how to integrate the companies and that the process would be \u201can evolution,\u201d with some businesses affected more than others.\u201cI wish I could tell you that the hardest part is behind us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to moving as quickly as possible to provide clarity regarding how your role may be impacted.\u201dThe deal is one of the most dramatic in the current wave of entertainment-industry mergers, shrinking the number of major Hollywood studios to five from six and putting the irreverent Homer Simpson and \u201cFamily Guy\u201d in the same stable of cartoon characters as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. The closing follows a nearly two-year effort that included a bidding war and regulatory compromises from Brussels to Brasilia.Underscoring the looming human cost, Disney is taking on 15,400 Fox employees, while the smaller new Fox Corp. will keep about 7,000. Last August, executives at Burbank, California-based Disney said they\u2019ll achieve their targeted savings over two years, with the U.S. operations bearing the brunt early on. The Hollywood Reporter said last month that 4,000 jobs will be lost.\u201cYou can anticipate more domestic at the front end, just because of regulatory issues outside of the U.S.,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on the August call. In other words, it will be easier to cut workers at home first.Already the largest entertainment company in the world, Disney emerges with more clout to negotiate everything from the fees it gets from cable TV operators to the share of ticket revenue at movie theaters. The sale represents the end of an era for Rupert Murdoch, the 88-year-old media mogul who steered the Fox studio for nearly four decades.Under the terms of the deal, Fox shareholders will receive $38 a share in cash or Disney stock. They also get stock in the new Fox, led by Murdoch\u2019s older son Lachlan. That company will continue to operate Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1. It will be focused on news and sports -- live programming that is seen as less vulnerable to viewer losses in a streaming age -- and also plans to ramp up its production of scripted shows designed to appeal to a broad demographic.At its heart, the merger marks a huge bet that Iger can establish a direct connection to consumers, sell them multiple monthly subscriptions to watch Disney programs and upend the traditional model in which network owners collect fees for their content from pay-TV operators.Last April, Disney launched ESPN+, a $5-a-month sports streaming service that has already passed 2 million subscribers. Hulu, in which Disney acquires majority control, will be focused on more adult-oriented fare, such as that produced by Fox\u2019s FX network and its Oscar-winning Fox Searchlight film studio. Later this year, the company will introduce Disney+, a family-focused streaming service that Iger has said will be the home of all of the classic Disney films, as well as original content.Much as Iger built Disney\u2019s film studio into the industry leader by acquiring Pixar\u2019s animation, Marvel Entertainment\u2019s superheroes and Lucasfilm\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d series, the Fox acquisition will bring new characters and franchises. Disney\u2019s CEO said at the March 7 annual meeting, for example, that a sequel to Fox\u2019s \u201cAvatar,\u201d the top-grossing movie in history, will be delivered in late 2020.Iger has said he plans to continue to operate 20th Century Fox, Fox Searchlight and other film labels, many of which release the kind of R-rated films that Disney previously stayed away from.Disney\u2019s new assets also include the powerhouse Fox TV studio, responsible for hits such as \u201cHomeland\u201d on Showtime, \u201cThis Is Us\u201d on NBC and \u201cEmpire\u201d on the Fox network. Personnel decisions over the past few months reflect a virtual Fox takeover of Disney\u2019s TV business, with Fox President Peter Rice overseeing the combined company\u2019s entertainment channels and TV studio chief Dana Walden leading production. FX\u2019s John Landgraf continues in his role.Iger\u2019s gamble is far from a sure thing. In addition to the cost of starting, marketing and running new streaming services, Disney is giving up revenue it could have made by selling its movies and TV shows to rivals. A deal with Netflix expired last year, for example, and Disney has said revenue lost from licensing content will cut operating income by $150 million this year.The Fox deal, which was first officially announced in December 2017, led to a bidding war with Comcast Corp. Disney warded off its rival suitor, but had to pay about 36 percent more for Fox under new terms announced last June. Comcast, meanwhile, won Fox\u2019s stake in the Sky Plc and ultimately took over satellite TV service in Europe.To win the blessing of regulators, Disney agreed to sell 22 Fox regional sports networks in the U.S., its half of the A&E channels in Europe and Fox\u2019s sports network in Brazil.

OpenAI revealed in tax filings that it in 2016 it had paid its chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, more than $1.9 million that year, including a signing bonus.Sutskever, who is also a member of the nonprofit\u2019s board, said in an interview Monday that the change in structure was more about allowing OpenAI to purchase vast computing power than it was about rewarding researchers with big pay packages.\u201cTo do cutting edge AI research, you need huge computer expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe created this structure to raise the amount of money we would need to stay competitive.\u201dMany top machine-learning researchers work for large technology companies such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s two AI divisions, Google Brain and DeepMind, or Facebook Inc. These companies can offer employees stock options, which OpenAI can\u2019t as a nonprofit.Greg Brockman, OpenAI\u2019s chairman and chief technology officer, said that, in the past, many researchers had made financial sacrifices to work for the group. \u201cIt is one thing to do it for some period of time but when you have a family and kids you need to figure out how you can make sure that people are putting their heart and soul into the organization,\u201d he said.For-profit AI companies can also tap financing from venture capital investors or the public markets, while OpenAI has been dependent on donations from wealthy benefactors. Those donations are tax-deductible, but may provide less of an incentive than the possibility of earning a large profit.Brockman said OpenAI has held talks with potential outside investors and there would be \u201cupcoming\u201d announcements about funding. OpenAI describes the charitable foundation of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and venture capital firm Khosla Ventures as \u201cinvestors.\u201dThe group said the nonprofit OpenAI Inc. would continue to be the sole controlling shareholder of the new for-profit OpenAI LP. If any members of the nonprofit\u2019s board are also investors in the for-profit company, they will not be allowed to vote on key decisions affecting the relationship between the two entities.The company said it would legally cap the profits that outside investors and employees could make from shares in OpenAI LP at 100 times their initial investment.\u201cAny returns beyond that amount -- and if we are successful, we expect to generate orders of magnitude more value than we\u2019d owe to people who invest in or work at OpenAI LP -- are owned by the original OpenAI Nonprofit entity,\u201d the company said.OpenAI, which said it currently employs about 100 people, recently debuted language processing software that could take a sentence and from it generate a completely original and coherent passage of text. In move that was controversial within the AI research community, OpenAI decided not to release the key details of its most sophisticated version of this software because of fears it could be used to wage disinformation campaigns.Before that, the nonprofit was best known for creating software bots that could work as a team to compete against top human teams in the computer game Dota2. It has also achieved breakthroughs in training robot hands to manipulate objects.Musk co-founded OpenAI along with a group of other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs including Hoffman and Sam Altman, the co-founder and former president of startup incubator Y Combinator. Musk resigned from OpenAI\u2019s board in 2018 and the group said he is no longer \u201cformally involved\u201d with it.Altman recently stepped down from his role as president of Y Combinator in order to spend more time on other interests, including OpenAI.OpenAI\u2019s founders said they created the nonprofit to ensure that artificial general intelligence -- or AI that has the ability to perform a wide variety of tasks as well or better than humans -- benefits all humanity rather than being the intellectual property of a single, for-profit corporation. ","125":" Kroger Co. tumbled the most in a year after its holiday-period performance and full-year expectations disappointed investors, showing how tough things are for traditional supermarkets.\u2014 With assistance by Cecile Daurat, and Karen Lin The company sees full-year profit in a range of $2.15 to $2.25 a share -- below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.28. Its fourth-quarter revenue also fell short of estimates, sending the shares down as much as 13 percent Thursday. Kroger is lowering prices, remodeling about 1,000 stores and centralizing its e-commerce operations to boost growth, yet those moves have weighed on sales and profitability. Gross margins contracted nearly a full percentage point in the quarter, hurt by price cuts and supply-chain improvements. Shareholders had hoped that the heavy lifting is now done and that the investments will start to bear fruit in 2019, but the company\u2019s forecast calls this into question. The grocer is also looking for new sources of revenue such as digital advertising, which is more profitable than its core business of selling food. Kroger expects the ad business and other new endeavors to help generate $400 million in additional operating profit by the end of 2020.Competition in the grocery space is always fierce, and could get even tougher for Kroger as reports surfaced last week that Amazon.com Inc. is looking to open more supermarkets beyond its existing Whole Foods Market locations. Still, Amazon\u2019s ability to crack the code on groceries remains unproven, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus said.Kroger shares fell as much as 13 percent, the biggest intraday decline in about a year. Before Thursday, the stock had risen 3.4 percent this year, compared with the 11 percent increase for the benchmark S&P 500.For more information, click here.For company statement, click here.","126":"Roofstock to market shares of homes for as little as $5,000. Firms want to sell more-sophisticated tools to small investors Here\u2019s a new proposition from a company that markets single-family rental homes to mom-and-pop investors: Want to buy a tenth of a house?Roofstock is pitching a chance for those interested in the asset class to start small. The company will buy a home and put it in a trust, then sell stakes for as little as $5,000. The aim is to provide investors direct access to rental income -- and the tax benefits of owning commercial real estate -- while lowering the buy-in and eliminating inconveniences like having to carry a loan on their personal balance sheet.\u201cThe whole idea at our founding was to create a platform where real estate could trade much more like a stock,\u201d said Gary Beasley, chief executive officer at Roofstock, a four-year-old startup based in Oakland, California. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can go to a website and after a few clicks, you have real estate exposure.\u201dThe move is the latest attempt to popularize strategies developed by institutional investors in the aftermath of foreclosure crisis, when firms such as Blackstone Group LP and Starwood Property Trust Inc. amassed large portfolios of rental homes. As the deep bargains dried up, the nascent industry consolidated, and companies that sprung up to serve the Wall Street landlords started offering property management, finance and brokerage services to smaller investors.Beasley more or less personifies that trend: He was CEO at Waypoint Homes, one of a handful of landlords that were eventually rolled up into industry behemoth Invitation Homes Inc., then co-founded Roofstock. The company also brokers portfolio sales of rental houses to larger investors, but for the most part, pitches itself as a popularizing force that helps small property owners invest like institutions.Roofstock plans to start with properties in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range, beginning in Atlanta and Indianapolis, using loans to finance no more than half the purchase price. The program is limited to accredited investors, who are theoretically savvy enough to evaluate the risk that home repairs or soft rental markets eat up profits.The company will take property- and asset-management fees out of rental income before distributing returns. Eventually, it plans to launch a secondary market to connect buyers and sellers, but in the near term, it will buy shares back from investors who want liquidity. ","127":" Next time, whatever it takes\u00a0won\u2019t do.The European Central Bank surprised financial markets yesterday with moves to loosen monetary policy. The prospects for growth in the euro zone have dimmed lately, and policy was going to be tweaked at some point unless things picked up. But a change wasn\u2019t expected so soon. ECB President Mario Draghi and his colleagues are apparently worried.They have reason to be. Their main problem, however, isn\u2019t the precise timing of monetary adjustments like the ones announced this week. It\u2019s the lack of good options if things get any worse.The ECB\u2019s new projections show growth in the euro zone slowing this year to just 1.1 percent; in December the central bank had predicted 1.7 percent.\u00a0That\u2019s roughly in line with other recent downgrades from the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The picture varies a lot from country to country within the euro area, and a number of one-off factors have been at work \u2014 but across the bloc, slowing international trade and rising political uncertainty have taken a toll. The OECD expects growth of just 0.7 percent this year in Germany, for instance; it thinks Italy\u2019s output will be lower than last year, and will manage only a feeble recovery in 2020.In response the ECB said its policy rate will stay at zero at least through December, extending its previous guidance by months. And it announced new issues of cheap long-term loans to banks. Yet the actual stimulus provided by these measures will be small at best. In fact, the combination of signaling new concern about the prospects and announcing changes with limited force could turn out to subtract from future demand rather than add to it.Given its own rules, there\u2019s not much else the ECB can do. The policy rate is zero, and the central bank\u2019s deposit rate is slightly negative. Taking rates farther into negative territory might rattle confidence and destabilize the financial system. Meanwhile the ECB\u2019s enormous bond-buying program, which was paused three months ago, is constrained by rules about the composition of its holdings. These were intended to stop the central bank from disproportionately financing the outlays of high-borrowing countries \u2014 such as Italy. They mean the ECB has more or less run out of room.Monetary policy isn\u2019t enough \u2014 and if slow growth in the euro zone should tip into outright recession, Europe will no longer be able to avoid a drastic rethinking of macroeconomic policy. The lack of a sufficiently powerful fiscal instrument is already holding the bloc back. The consequence has been high unemployment, slow growth and less-than-target inflation. If things get any worse, the only effective remedy would be a forceful, coordinated push from tax cuts and\/or higher public spending.Year after year, Europe has dodged this necessary discussion. No further delay should be tolerated. Even after cutting its growth forecasts, the ECB says the risks to Europe\u2019s economies lean to the downside. Trade-policy frictions could get worse, not better. Political turbulence could increase, not subside. And Brexit, a big setback for Europe on any plausible projection, could deliver an especially brutal blow if no deal is reached to minimize the disruption. The ECB says that outright recession is unlikely. If it\u2019s wrong, policy makers will be all but helpless.Europe can no longer risk being so seriously underequipped. It needs an effective fiscal-policy instrument \u2014 at the very least, a bold new approach to fiscal coordination. With the risks mounting, the problem demands immediate attention.\u2014Editors: Clive Crook, Mary Duenwald. ","128":"Credit Suisse says clients outsource investing amid volatility. Managing money boosts margins for firms\u2019 wealth managers Pedestrians walk past an office tower in the central business district in Singapore.For private bankers in Asia, there\u2019s a silver lining to the stock market meltdown that engulfed the world in late 2018.With Asia\u2019s swelling ranks of millionaires chastened by portfolio losses, firms from Julius Baer Group Ltd. to UBS Group AG say they\u2019re finding rich clients more open to giving them discretionary mandates, where they hand over lump sums and let the bank manage the money for a fee. For private banks, that\u2019s a far more lucrative proposition than having customers pay per trade.\u201cWealthy individuals here in Asia, over time, realize that they can\u2019t beat the market in such a fantastic way as their egos might tell them,\u201d said Steven Fong, head of mandate solutions for Singapore at Credit Suisse Group AG\u2019s Asia Pacific private bank. \u201cMore clients tend to give discretionary mandates a chance after every market crisis.\u201dUBS and its rivals are counting on the richest folks in the world\u2019s fastest-growing region to boost profitability. Fortunes in Asia\u2019s $22 trillion wealth market are younger than those in Europe or the U.S., so most individuals retain control over their money, giving professional managers more room to acquire clients.Across the industry, one third of portfolios in Europe are discretionary, said Bhaskar Laxminarayan, Julius Baer\u2019s chief investment officer for Asia. He estimated that the overall figure for Asia is no higher than 8 percent.Julius Baer sees discretionary mandates rising to 20% of Asian wealth by 2027Source: Asian Private Banker data 2012-2017; Julius Baer estimates 2027Assets managed under Credit Suisse\u2019s bespoke mandate business, which customizes investments for clients, have been growing by about 20 percent a year in Asia since 2014, though the firm declined to provide more details. The increase came amid heightened volatility on the S&P 500 Index and in the Eurozone last year, while investors are this year concerned about the impact of Brexit and slowing economic growth amid the U.S.-China trade war.The so-called mandate business, which also includes services where the client takes the final decision on whether to execute the trade, is growing at a similar pace for UBS, according to Stefan Lecher, head of global mandates investment solutions for Asia Pacific. The firm aims to increase the proportion of Asian client assets in mandate accounts to 18 percent by 2021 from 13 percent now, he said. At JPMorgan Chase & Co., roughly 20 percent of regional client assets are managed by the bank.Discretionary accounts provide banks with recurring income, unlike traditional clients who only pay per transaction. Thanks to the regular fees and factors including economies of scale, gross margins from mandate-based offerings can be about 0.4 percent wider, according to a UBS presentation in October. Lecher said the clients benefit, too: 85 percent of discretionary accounts at UBS outperform self-directed accounts on a risk-adjusted basis.\u201cFrom a profitability perspective, the trend towards the discretionary mandate more broadly is very essential for UBS,\u201d said Lecher. \u201cAsia is very much a young market that is growing quickly.\u201dAsian contributions buoyed net new money collections last quarterSource: Credit Suisse, UBS presentationsRead more: Clients are fleeing private banks after a tough quarterDelegating investment responsibility also allows a clearer demarcation between business and wealth, which is often a stumbling block when Asia\u2019s family-owned empires prepare their succession plans.

The trend is especially visible among new economy clients in China, according to Christopher Blum, head of investments at JPMorgan\u2019s Asia private bank.Julius Baer has seen its discretionary portfolio double over the last two years in Asia, aided by market volatility as clients outsource managing their money to professional investors, said Laxminarayan.\u201cOnce you start making mistakes, especially based on your personal judgment, it really weighs on you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun anymore.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Chanyaporn Chanjaroen ","129":"Julianne Ponan doesn\u2019t run a gigantic corporation, but she hasn\u2019t been doing badly. When she bought Creative Nature, based in Surrey, about seven years ago, it was a money-losing maker of candles, among other things. In 2018 the company, which now produces and exports snacks for the booming health-and-wellness market around the world, about doubled its revenue from the year before, to \u00a31.3 million ($1.7 million). The Federation of Small Businesses in the U.K. recognized Ponan with a best retail business award last year for her company\u2019s skill at turning ingredients from as far away as New Zealand into treats, dietary supplements, and cake mixes sold in Britain, Europe, and elsewhere. Ponan found the U.K.\u2014with its banking system and easy access to larger export markets\u2014to be the perfect hub.With Brexit on the horizon, Creative Nature and hundreds of other small and midsize businesses must deal with an impending quagmire of financial and bureaucratic regulations, the kinds of delays that disrupt cash flow. The divorce from the European Union could cause liquidity problems and lead to innumerable loan defaults that some U.K.-based banks are trying to prevent, small business by small business.A much-feared hard Brexit, in which the U.K. leaves the EU without any agreement for the movement of people and goods, could erect trade barriers overnight. Things may be a little better with the softer Brexit that  Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to negotiate with Brussels. That would provide for a two-year transition period. Still, as part of the EU, the U.K. enjoys relatively easy trade with 69 countries, and so far it\u2019s won post-Brexit agreements with only seven of those. \u201cFor small businesses, it\u2019s very difficult, because we can\u2019t just stop sending over goods,\u201d Ponan says. \u201cI still feel we made the right decision of setting up in the U.K., but it\u2019s going to be a difficult time ahead.\u201dIf Parliament doesn\u2019t approve May\u2019s new deal, and if Brexit isn\u2019t delayed, export and import businesses will find themselves trading with Europe on March 29 under World Trade Organization rules. The U.K.\u2019s 5.6 million small and midsize businesses, which employ 16.3 million people and generated $2.6 trillion in revenue in 2018, will most likely incur higher costs, delays, and a raft of new documentation requirements. \u201cSmall and medium enterprises have been relying too much on the assumptions that everything will be OK,\u201d says Mike Slevin, who leads the Brexit program for the commercial bank at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, historically the U.K.\u2019s largest provider for small and medium-size businesses. \u201cThe majority hasn\u2019t started to put contingency plans in action and execute them.\u201d\u201cIf I could move my business somewhere else at zero costs, I would do it tomorrow,\u201d says Giambattista La Torre, general manager of an Italian boutique hotel and restaurant in Covent Garden that imports wine, salami, and other goods from Puglia. \u201cSome have suggested to stockpile goods, but rarely does a restaurant in the heart of London have the space for that. We are living from one day to the next.\u201dAccording to Banco Santander SA\u2019s U.K. unit, about 90 percent of small and midsize enterprises \u201chave only traded with Europe, and therefore they don\u2019t know about issues like rules of origin,\u201d says John Carroll, head of product management and international business. With a hard Brexit, exporters will need rules-of-origin certificates to determine the duties and tariffs that products will incur as they cross borders. It remains unclear which authorities will issue the documents\u2014those in the U.K., the EU, or each specific country on the Continent. \u201cWe are pointing them in the direction of local chambers to see how they can get help,\u201d Carroll says.Banks such as Santander and RBS have been coaching businesses to make sure they have the right papers in place by the end of March. \u201cWe had one seminar that was focused on about 40 businesses at the smaller end, and there was a real lack of knowledge,\u201d Carroll says. Some banks have also asked the government to put aside emergency funds to backstop small businesses in case of chaos, according to a banker involved in the discussions.Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue & Customs, the U.K.\u2019s tax, payments, and customs authority, has already issued complicated import and export guidelines, including a recommendation to hire agents to help in case of a no-deal Brexit. Many companies, already suffering from anemic growth, aren\u2019t willing to take on more costs. \u201cWe will cross that bridge when we get to it,\u201d La Torre says. \u201cWe are not going to get ahead of ourselves and assuming extra costs unless strictly necessary.\u201dPonan is trying her best to bolster her organic-snacks business against all the uncertainty. \u201cWe are holding a lot more stock than what we would normally hold,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had to take more space in terms of external warehousing. But of course, with perishable products, you don\u2019t want to hold too much.\u201d Companies like hers usually set aside some funds. But that cash was meant to be invested to increase exports, not for crises such as Brexit. \u201cWill goods be stopped at the borders?\u201d Ponan asks. \u201cWill there be limbo? We need to know if there will be deals in place that we can make use of.\u201d Many of the U.K.\u2019s 5.6 million small and midsize enterprises aren\u2019t ready for the delays, new documentation, and liquidity problems that may arise when the country leaves the EU.","130":"S&P; 500, Stoxx 600 post worst weekly declines since December. ECB\u2019s latest stimulus underscores weakening economic growth Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.A $10 trillion global stock rally is showing signs of fragility, and you can blame the economy.Both the American and European benchmarks posted their biggest weekly losses since the darkest days of December\u2019s sell-off, with the S&P 500 dropping 2.2 percent. While the week ended with the European Central Bank\u2019s dovish turn and President Donald Trump predicting a \u201cvery big spike\u201d in U.S. markets once a trade deal with China is reached, stock declines were a sign that after a sharp two-month rally, risk appetite has weakened and the bar for positive surprises has been raised.Reality is starting to bite. Riskier stocks are falling back to Earth. Investors are pulling money from equities and pouring it in bonds. And trend-following quantitative funds are cutting their U.S. equity positions.Blame macro. It\u2019s nothing new to bond traders, but as positive catalysts from a pause in U.S. tightening to trade optimism look increasingly priced in, the deteriorating economic picture has become harder to ignore. U.S. jobs data missed consensus estimates by a wide mark on Friday, plunging to the weakest in more than a year.\u201cA kind of trade deal will support the market, but once the deal has been announced with all details, market participants will re-focus on PMIs and corporate earnings again,\u201d said Petra Pflaum, co-head of EMEA equities at DWS Group GmbH, which oversees the equivalent of about $744 billion. \u201cGlobal indicators have been weaker than expected, and that\u2019s raising alarm bells.\u201dAnother ominous signal is flashing in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which fell for an 11th consecutive session Friday to cap its longest streak of losses in 47 years. Because they form the infrastructure on which commerce is conducted and provide clues about the strength of the economy, weakness among trucking companies, shippers and airlines is often viewed as an early-warning sign for the broader market.Adding to the fragility of this year\u2019s stock rally is the fact that it has been led by riskier shares at odds with an economic slowdown. But that\u2019s started to change. In Europe, economically sensitive sectors are underperforming again as yields fall. In the U.S., factors associated with strong risk appetites have also started to drop, with both the volatility and leverage styles headed for their worst week since December.The reaction to the ECB\u2019s decision on Thursday encapsulates a market that\u2019s glass-half-empty. After the monetary authority said it will hold record-low rates at least through 2019 and grant new loans to banks, stocks initially rose, before sharply sliding to a session low as investors\u2019 focus shifted.In a nutshell: \u201cIt means the macro economy is not able to sustain itself without the support of monetary policy, which is extremely accommodative,\u201d said Sylvain Goyon, a strategist at Oddo & Cie in Paris.Of course, a trade deal between the world\u2019s two superpowers could still spur a relief rally, but even that doesn\u2019t have much room for surprise. While an accord may cover agricultural and industrial sectors, it\u2019s still unlikely to encompass thornier issues such as intellectual property and the Made in China 2025 program, Goyon said.Meanwhile, investors have continued pulling money away from equities and putting it in bonds, further reinforcing concerns that the rally will buckle as inflows reverse. Trend-following quantitative funds -- commodity trading advisers -- are also rapidly cutting their long positions on U.S. equity futures, and such selling pressure is likely to grow, according to estimates by Nomura Holdings Inc.\u201cInvestors that have maintained a bullish stance on U.S. and global equity markets based on fundamentals are likely to have a reality check,\u201d Masanari Takada, a quantitative strategist at Nomura, wrote in a note. \u201cThere is a risk that Street expectations will become more pessimistic as a backlash from the risk market rally of the past two months.\u201d ","131":"Activist fund\u2019s CEO Jeffrey Smith becomes Papa John\u2019s chairman. Pizza chain rejected similar proposal from founder Schnatter The activist fund that wanted to add salt to the water at Olive Garden is about to dig into a turnaround at Papa John\u2019s International Inc.The embattled pizza chain, mired in a sales slump and trying to keep its distance from controversial founder John Schnatter, is taking a $200 million investment from Starboard Value LP and adding the fund\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Smith to its board as chairman.Starboard Value Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Smith discusses their investment in Papa John\u2019s.As part of the deal, Steve Ritchie, the CEO of Papa John\u2019s and a former Schnatter protege, is also joining the board. He\u2019s been running the restaurant chain since the start of 2018, when he replaced Schnatter following an uproar over comments the founder made about the NFL\u2019s national anthem protests.Starboard\u2019s cash infusion comes after Papa John\u2019s board, which had been evaluating strategic options, including potentially seeking a buyer, turned down a similar investment deal from Schnatter himself, who owns about 30 percent of the company.Papa John\u2019s removed Schnatter, the longtime face of the brand, from its ads and sought to limit his role since last summer, when he resigned as chairman after admitting to using a racial slur.Starboard has experience in the restaurant space. In 2014, it successfully replaced 12 directors on the board of Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants Inc. That proxy fight included a nearly 300-page Power Point presentation that called for several specific changes at the Italian-dining chain, including adding salt to the water when cooking pasta.Jeffrey SmithSmith took over as chairman of Darden before a new CEO was appointed and the company embarked on an effort to improve its lagging performance that included spinning off its real estate portfolio.Now, Starboard will try to mount a turnaround at Papa John\u2019s. News of the investment comes as the pizza chain also reported preliminary results for the fourth quarter that missed analysts\u2019 estimates. The company had already been suffering from a sales decline before the latest controversy began last summer.Papa John\u2019s plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and invest in the business, it said in a statement. Starboard is making its investment through the purchase of new convertible preferred stock, and the deal includes the option of an additional $50 million investment.Shares of Papa John\u2019s gained as much as 13 percent to $43.60 in New York trading Monday. the biggest intraday gain since July 12.Besides Smith, the board added another independent director -- Anthony Sanfilippo, former chairman and CEO of Pinnacle Entertainment Inc. With the additions, including Ritchie, the board now has nine directors. Schnatter remains on the board. He voted against the decision to take the money from Starboard, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.\u201cOur agreement with Starboard concludes a comprehensive strategic review conducted over the past five months to better position Papa John\u2019s for growth, improve the company\u2019s financial performance and serve the best interests of our stakeholders,\u201d Olivia Kirtley, a member of the special committee that initiated the review, said in a statement.In a filing, Schnatter said he made a similar offer to the board over the weekend, but with reduced costs to the company and with an additional $10 million to be made available to qualified franchisees. He said the board rejected his proposal and he was \u201cevaluating the legal remedies\" available as a result.Ritchie, in an interview, said the company is focused more on helping sales instead of franchisee assistance this year, and that executives will offer more details on Feb. 26.\u201cWhat\u2019s most important is sales, and we feel like we\u2019ve got a plan.\u201dIn the months following Schnatter\u2019s July departure as chairman, speculation has swirled around the struggling pizza chain, with reports that Wendy\u2019s Co. had evaluated a takeover bid. But any kind of transaction wouldn\u2019t be easy without the backing of Schnatter, because of his hefty share stake.After the controversy erupted, the board adopted a poison pill to prevent him from adding to his stake or gaining majority control.Papa John&apos;s is still struggling to turn sales aroundSource: Company filingsBut those attempts failed to help results. Papa John\u2019s systemwide same-store sales in North America, a key performance metric, fell 8.1 percent in the fourth quarter, preliminary company data show. Analysts projected a drop of 6.3 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. Internationally, that measure likely dropped 2.6 percent, the company said in unaudited results, compared with estimates they would grow 0.1 percent.Starboard has also previously mounted activist campaigns at Yahoo Inc., Symantec Corp. and other companies. Starboard has recently taken a stake in pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb, according to people with knowledge of the matter.As for its turnaround at Olive Garden, Starboard ultimately gave up on the salt idea, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Global spending on robotic process automation software was estimated to reach $680 million in 2018, up 57 percent from the previous year, and is on course to total $2.4 billion by 2022, according to research from Gartner Inc. The new technologies are particularly welcome in Japan, where a shrinking workforce is causing the tightest labor market in decades.Takahashi started out in the consulting industry, working for the Japan arm of Andersen Consulting, which is now known as Accenture, for about three years before joining SoftBank in 1996. At SoftBank, which was a much smaller company then, Takahashi was involved in everything from corporate planning to accounting, and helped launch a major satellite broadcasting joint venture. He says Son had a profound influence on him.\u201cI was lucky because I could work directly with Son,\u201d he said. \u201cHe always told us that if anyone was going to ride the digital and IT revolution, shouldn\u2019t it be us?\u201dTaking those words to heart, Takahashi decided to set out on his own. In 2000, he established the predecessor of RPA Holdings. The company, which helped big firms enter the internet business, combined his past experience in consulting with his knowledge of the IT world from his time at SoftBank Group. But that model came unstuck in the financial crisis. With firms having to cut non-essential costs, consulting fees got the ax. Takahashi says about 40 percent of his company\u2019s projects were canceled. He was running out of money.\u201cI thought the business I\u2019d been building for eight years was going to disappear,\u201d he said. \u201cFirms can cut consulting contracts with no problem. I wanted to do something where we\u2019d have a deeper involvement with customers, where we\u2019d be a source of value.\u201dJapanese mortgage lender Aruhi Corp. started using RPA Holdings\u2019 services in January 2017 to automate some application processes. It deploys software bots to input data from scanned loan applications and then check that everything is in order. That\u2019s cut the average time taken per application to about 10 minutes from an hour.\u201cSoftware bots are booming now and software vendors are increasing, but back then RPA Holdings was the only company which had a good track record in Japan,\u201d said Tetsu Nishida, who heads the IT department at Aruhi.RPA Holdings listed on the Tokyo bourse\u2019s Mothers market for startup firms in March, and surged more than fivefold to a high early the next month. While it has since pared some of those gains, it\u2019s still up more than 350 percent, with a market value of more than $790 million. Takahashi, the largest shareholder, held a 45.8 percent stake as of Aug. 31.Valuations have gotten ahead of profits. The stock trades at 98 times estimated earnings for next fiscal year, compared with an average of 49 times for the Mothers Index.Shota Watanabe, a fund manager at Rheos Capital Works Inc., which holds RPA Holdings\u2019 shares, said the company has considerable growth potential as its business can help Japan to solve social and economic problems. But the stock\u2019s valuation is too high, he said.The company\u2019s challenges include getting its products used at smaller firms, and maintaining its advantage as more competitors enter the field, according to Tomoaki Kawasaki, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co. in Tokyo. Kawasaki maintains an outperform rating on the stock and a target price of 4,000 yen, 22 percent higher than Tuesday\u2019s close.Takahashi says the next step is to go beyond robotic process automation to create other services and businesses using artificial intelligence. And while the company forecasts that sales will more than double to 9.1 billion yen in the fiscal year ending February, he\u2019s setting his sights on much higher revenue in the years ahead.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge market for software robots using AI technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like industrial robots in factories, if software bots can take on the tedious routine work in offices, we can create a productivity revolution for white-collar jobs.\u201d ","133":"Outcry has been muted compared to gun and tobacco holdings. Endo\u2019s stock fell sharply after Purdue bankruptcy reports State pension funds have historically taken stands against controversial industries, like firearms and tobacco, sometimes divesting their investments to push companies to act.But in the opioid crisis, which has generated hundreds of lawsuits seeking to hold manufacturers and distributors accountable, the funds have mostly stayed on the sideline so far. Some of the biggest ones, including New York and California pension funds, hold investments in Endo International, the largest maker of branded opioids after privately held Purdue Pharma LP. Even in West Virginia, which has been racked by opioid-related deaths, the state pension fund has a $1.8 million equity stake in Endo.\u201cWest Virginia is literally and metaphorically ground zero for both the opioid epidemic and litigation,\u201d said Charles Webb, an attorney at Webb Law Centre, which represents towns that brought suits. While local West Virginia unions have been outspoken about the epidemic, Webb said he hasn\u2019t heard any outcry from the state pension fund. The fund did not respond to requests for comment.The opioid investments, to be sure, are tiny relative to the funds\u2019 overall assets. And pension fund members may not know they are invested in the opioid industry. Many fund investments are held through indexes, which are passive vehicles, said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. The New York State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, which manages about $122 billion, holds $3.1 million in Endo stock, about 75 percent through passively held indexes, a spokesperson said.Funds including California\u2019s and New York\u2019s say they generally oppose divesting from controversial companies because it doesn\u2019t change corporate behavior. Instead, they say they try to engage with management through activist measures. The California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, CalSTRS, has been active with a group called Investors for Opioid Accountability, which represents 54 institutions. New York\u2019s fund said it has asked opioid manufacturers to address potential financial, legal and reputational risks.Still, the opioid epidemic has made for awkward situations. In Florida, former state attorney general Pam Bondi filed a lawsuit in late 2018 against more than a dozen opioid manufacturers and distributors, including Endo. At the time, Bondi sat on the board of the Florida Retirement System Pension Fund. The fund is invested in both Endo and Insys Therapeutics, Inc., another opioid maker that was part of her lawsuit.The attorney general \"does not get involved in the day-to-day operations of the pension fund,\" said John Kuczwanski, the fund\u2019s manager of external affairs.Unlike the firearms industry, which hasn\u2019t yielded notable returns in years, Endo was a profitable investment for nearly a decade, hitting a peak in 2015. It\u2019s since fallen dramatically, tanking 24 percent after OxyContin maker Purdue was reported to be exploring bankruptcy.Endo has been open to talking to institutional investors and recently held a \"constructive engagement\" with them, according to a spokesperson. The company no longer markets opioid products and withdrew one pain product, Opana ER, from the market altogether. ","134":"Goldman Sachs touts high-growth companies due to their scarity. Morgan Stanley warns valuation risk amid an economic slowdown The economy is showing signs of stress. Do you buy or sell U.S. growth stocks? That depends on which gigantic investment bank you ask.Both citing an anemic economy, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are building opposite cases for companies that have shown the ability to deliver faster growth in either revenue or profits. At stake is a decade-long winning trade that has consistently beat a competing strategy known as value that touts stocks with cheapest valuations.On the bullish side of the argument are Goldman strategists led by David Kostin, who recommend investors buy the 50 companies with the best growth potential, such as Amazon.com, SVB Financial Group and Adobe. Growth is so scarce now that these rare finds will pay off, they say.\u201cWith economic growth slowing and firms struggling to maintain margins, investors should focus on 50 firms that are expected to deliver the fastest 2019 sales growth,\u201d the strategists wrote in a note Friday.To Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, slowing global growth and declining earnings estimates are precisely the reason to steer clear of growth stocks.

Yet that\u2019s not largely because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul.The world\u2019s largest retailer simply took advantage of long-standing, low-profile tax deductions. It paid its employees in stock, built new warehouses and tapped tax breaks from when the company wasn\u2019t profitable.Amazon\u2019s projected $129 million refund highlights how companies can harness the complexities of the U.S. tax code for their own benefit. As a tech company with highly appreciated stock that also relies on brick-and-mortar fulfillment centers and shipping hubs, Amazon is uniquely situated to use the full range of preferences baked into the tax laws.And it wasn\u2019t an unusual bumper year in 2018 that led to Amazon\u2019s $0 tax bill. It didn\u2019t pay any federal tax in 2017, either.Jeff BezosThat sweet situation feeds into the public\u2019s annoyance that a company with more than $232 billion in revenue and led by the world\u2019s richest man -- Jeff Bezos -- doesn\u2019t pay more in taxes.That annoyance boiled over in New York earlier this month when Amazon, which had been offered as much as $3 billion in tax incentives to build a second headquarters in Queens, dropped the plan amid fierce opposition from local politicians and community activists.\u201cI get the frustration out there, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019re doing anything illegal,\u201d Brian Yarbrough, a senior equities analyst at Edward Jones, said. \u201cIt\u2019s how the tax law works.\u201dEarlier: Amazon Scraps Plan to Build a Headquarters in New York CityDespite having hundreds of billions in revenue, the company only booked about $9.4 billion in profit in 2018, creating a significantly smaller base on which taxes and offsetting credits and deductions are applied. The company says it pays all required federal, state and international taxes.\u201cCorporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits remain modest, given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business,\u201d Amazon said in a statement, adding that it\u2019s continuing to invest in its operations.Amazon gets both the benefits usually used by technology companies -- deductions for paying employees in stock -- as well as the write-offs for companies that rely heavily on building physical infrastructure.The research and development credit -- designed to encourage innovation in the U.S. -- also amounts to up to a $419 million tax break for Amazon. Add in hundreds of millions of losses the company still has on its books held over from years before it turned a profit, and its U.S. corporate tax liability can be whittled down to zero.These tax reductions, however, are largely unrelated to the overhaul that Congress passed and Trump signed in 2017. Amazon benefited from the new, lower corporate rate, 21 percent down from 35 percent, and expanded write-offs for capital investments. Yet some of the biggest tax minimizers -- deductions for employee stock options and research and development, are long-standing fixtures to the code that didn\u2019t change under the new tax law.Read More: Trump Era\u2019s Biggest Winner Is Jeff Bezos, Presidential NemesisOne of the biggest factors changing Amazon\u2019s financial filings isn\u2019t a substantive change at all. A deduction for stock-based compensation, totaling nearly $1.1 billion in 2018, is now more prominently displayed in regulatory filings thanks to an accounting rule change.\u201cThe tax law didn\u2019t change one iota,\u201d Robert Willens, a tax consultant based in New York, said. \u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of presentation.\u201dAnd in the end, the U.S. government is better off because Amazon employees end up paying more in tax than the company can write off. Companies take that deduction off their profits taxed at a 21 percent rate. Employees must pay tax on the income they receive from those shares at rates that top out at 37 percent.The fact that Amazon can legally reduce its tax bill to nothing calls into question the effectiveness of the code, said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy. While those breaks have the backing of Congress and were implemented for some social or economic policy goal, they might be encouraging corporate action that would happen anyway, he said.Other profitable companies, including Netflix Inc., General Motors Co. and Prudential Financial Inc., are able to use tax breaks to completely offset their tax bill, Gardner said.Netflix spokesman Richard Siklos said the subscription streaming service\u2019s tax break was reduced by standard tax breaks and that they anticipate their tax rate to be higher in 2019. Prudential said in a statement that it prepaid some of its taxes and follows all tax requirements. GM did not respond to a request to comment.\u201cIf you want to be mad, be mad the people who wrote the tax code,\u201d Yarbrough said.\u2014 With assistance by Spencer Soper ","136":"Duke\u2019s Zion Williamson hurts knee in game against archrival. No. 1 sports brand calls footwear blowout isolated occurrence The high-profile failure of a Nike Inc. basketball shoe on Wednesday night was more than an epic embarrassment for the athletic brand. It could be a product-liability case.Duke University star freshman Zion Williamson -- the consensus No. 1 pick in this year\u2019s National Basketball Association draft -- sprained his knee when his Nike sneaker fell apart. He tumbled to the court less than 35 seconds into the loss to in-state rival North Carolina.The incident suggests that Nike could be liable, said Paul Edelstein, a lawyer at Edelsteins Faegenburg & Brown in New York. He represents athletes in brain injury and other sports-related litigation.\u201cThis would be a classic product-liability case if Mr. Williamson suffered any type of serious injury and was inclined to bring one,\u201d Edelstein said. \u201cThis product was specifically designed to provide support for athletes such as him and clearly failed.\u201dThe injury happened after Williamson planted his foot to change direction. His left shoe, Nike\u2019s PG 2.5 PE, came apart, causing him to fall awkwardly.The fallout for the world\u2019s largest sportswear brand was immediate. Twitter lit up with jabs from fans and rival brands, making \u201cZion\u201d and \u201cNike\u201d trending topics within the social-media network. The company\u2019s stock fell as much as 1.8 percent in New York trading Thursday.\u201cWe are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery,\u201d Nike said by email. \u201cWhile this is an isolated occurrence, we are working to identify the issue.\u201dThe question now is whether the incident will hurt Nike\u2019s prominent standing within the sport. That\u2019s unlikely, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Chen Grazutis. If you combine Nike and its Jordan brand, the company has more than 90 percent of the basketball market. Nike reported $4.35 billion in wholesale equivalent basketball sales in fiscal 2018, about 14 percent of its overall sales.\u201cThey might get a lot bad press over the next couple days, but I don\u2019t think it will have a direct impact on the shoes,\u201d Grazutis said.Legally, though, there still could be fallout. Although Duke officials reported that Williamson suffered only a mild knee sprain, that doesn\u2019t necessarily get Nike off the hook, Edelstein said.Unless there\u2019s proof that the shoe was misused or damaged after it left the factory, Williamson has a good case, he said. The situation isn\u2019t \u201cany different than a laborer climbing a ladder that suddenly collapsed under his weight,\u201d Edelstein said.Companies like Nike and Adidas pay tens of millions of dollars for the exclusive right to outfit high-profile college programs like Duke, meaning their athletes are required to wear uniforms and shoes made by the team\u2019s sponsor. Though Duke\u2019s contract with Nike isn\u2019t public, the Durham school is one of Nike\u2019s most important basketball partners. For comparison, the University of Kentucky, another top basketball school, extended its Nike deal a few years ago for eight years and $30.6 million.The malfunction might also hurt Nike\u2019s ability to sign Williamson once he decides to go pro. College athletes can\u2019t sign endorsement deals, but competition for elite draft prospects is fierce every year. Last year\u2019s No. 1 pick, Deandre Ayton, signed a deal with Puma SE that was reported to be the largest rookie deal since Kevin Durant\u2019s seven-year, $60 million deal with Nike back in 2007.Puma shoes worn by Deandre Ayton.Williamson is one of the most highly regarded college prospects in years. The 6-foot-7, 285-pound forward suffered a mild knee sprain, according to Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. He did not return to the game, and No. 8 UNC upset No. 1 Duke 88-72.The timing could not have been worse for Nike. Not only was the game televised nationally on ESPN, it was one of the most anticipated college basketball games of the year. The cheapest resale tickets leading up to tipoff were over $2,500, approaching Super Bowl levels.Former President Barack Obama, courtside at the high-profile clash, was shown on video appearing to say with an incredulous look: \u201cHis shoe broke!\u201dIt also comes as Nike draws criticism for a different kind of shoe malfunction.

Morgan made a similar announcement, the time-honored banking uniform of suit and tie is beginning take a back seat to business casual.Technically,  according to Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine, the official dress code at Goldman has been business casual since at least the early 2000s. But the secret to these vague and shifting\u00a0rules, writes Levine, is that there is only one:\u00a0\u201cGoldman\u2019s dress code is that you should dress the way you\u2019re supposed to dress at Goldman.\u201dThis demotion-of-suits development may be celebrated by some, and it is seen generally as a PR tactic to lure younger talent that has been raised on a sweats-and-hoodie Silicon Valley-style ethos.

Company makes cloud-based human-resources management software Ultimate Software Group said it agreed to be acquired by an investor group led by Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners in a deal valued at about $11 billion.Shareholders of Ultimate Software, which makes cloud-based human resources management software, will receive $331.50 per share in cash, the company said in a statement Monday. The terms represent a premium of about 32 percent over the company\u2019s average stock price during the 30 days up to Feb. 1. Ultimate shares rose 20 percent in New York trading.Weston, Florida-based Ultimate Software was founded in 1990 by Scott Scherr, who will remain at the company along with the existing senior management team. Ultimate Software manages employee relationships from recruiting to retirement. While starting with a basic package to manage payroll and benefits, Ultimate expands its offerings, sold on a subscription basis per employee, to include analytics tools that track a full range of human resources. Its customers include Subway Restaurants and Red Roof Inns Inc.Payroll and human resources software \u201cis a very attractive space to invest in,\u201d Jefferies analyst Samad Samana said. \u201cIt has very attractive characteristics -- high retention rates. Everybody needs payroll, so it\u2019s a very large market.\u201dSeveral analysts have recently taken note of the company. Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Turrin initiated coverage of the company last week with a buy rating, calling it a top \u201cvalue\u201d pick, based on its early transition to the cloud and a strong workplace culture. Turrin said the company has proven itself capable of delivering consistent 20 percent-plus recurring revenue growth and operating margin.Ultimate Software was ranked No. 1 on Fortune\u2019s Best Workplaces in Technology list for the fourth consecutive year. Goldman Sachs reinstated coverage of the company last week with a neutral rating on the stock.Samana said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see another company potentially make a bid for Ultimate Software. \u201cThe difference for a strategic buyer is there could be potential revenue and cost synergies that would make the deal more valuable for them than for a private equity buyer\u201d Samana said.Deal activity among software companies, including payroll, should continue because of the amount of money that can be put to work, according to Samana. Large enterprise software companies have extra cash due to the new tax law, Samana said, adding that private equity firms have also raised a lot of capital and are increasingly finding value in software.Ultimate Software is the second-fastest growing provider, behind Workday Inc., in the $17 billion human-capital management and payroll-software market.

In each case, Stenzler has avoided\u00a0an adverse verdict with the lawsuits either being dismissed\u00a0or settled out of court, documents show.Now, Stenzler is being sued again, with two men accusing the 50-year-old New York native of ripping off their idea. This time, the stakes couldn&apos;t be higher. Featured in top\u00a0media outlets and hailed as the next hot fitness craze, New York-based Rumble has already lined up more than $34\u00a0million in funding, including from\u00a0Sylvester Stallone\u00a0and luxury mega-gym Equinox. Celebrity customers include Justin Bieber, Kendall Jenner and Selena Gomez and Rumble\u2019s Instagram page is flooded with photos of models. Now Stenzler is seeking to line up an additional  $200\u00a0million in capital so he can more than\u00a0 double the number of locations and expand abroad.\u00a0Rumble fits into the trend of exercise-as-entertainment pioneered by the likes of SoulCycle Inc. and Tough Mudder Inc.\u00a0Indeed, co-founder Noah Neiman is a former Barry\u2019s Bootcamp Master Trainer.\u00a0Its formula combines dark lighting, personally curated, loud hip-hop mixes\u00a0and a specially designed, tear-drop-shaped punching bag filled with water. Sculpted trainers bounce around on stage encouraging members\u00a0to \u201cpunch away your stress.\u201d\u00a0Justin Weil and Elan Danon say Stenzler stole many of those specific features\u00a0from them after having early, confidential conversations about the concept. The pair is seeking $28 million in damages; Stenzler has filed a motion to dismiss the case.\u00a0The celebrity\u00a0 buzz has helped Rumble expand from a windowless office in Chelsea in 2017 to trendy locations on both coasts.\u00a0Some\u00a0600 people pay as much as $36 to rotate through the Flatiron gym in Manhattan on a daily basis, Stenzler said, which he believes makes\u00a0it the busiest group fitness\u00a0 studio in America. According to\u00a0PitchBook data investors recently valued Rumble at $77 million -- an impressive feat for a two-year-old startup\u00a0with just five gyms.While some industry experts note that entrepreneurship is tough and often riddled with false starts, others point out that the types of lawsuits\u00a0filed against Stenzler could raise a red flag.\u00a0Some early investors in Rumble weren\u2019t aware of his current legal battle or his previous lawsuits until now, according to people familiar\u00a0with the investments, who asked not to be identified because they aren\u2019t authorized to talk publicly about the company.In a sweaty post-workout interview on the bleachers at Rumble\u2019s flagship gym in\u00a0Manhattan, Stenzler said the previous lawsuits against him were all based on frivolous accusations \u2013- and he\u2019s expecting the current case to be dismissed this month. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been around 20 years and you\u2019ve done well, you\u2019re going to have some nuisances and I stand by my record,\" Stenzler said, fist-bumping trainers who walked by.A graduate of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, Stenzler was named a 40 Under 40 honoree by Crain\u2019s New York Business\u00a0in 2000 at the age of 31. At the time, he\u00a0was co-chairman and CEO of Cosi Inc. after merging his coffee bar chain with the gourmet sandwich shop. But its $39 million initial public offering in 2003\u00a0 got\u00a0off to a rocky start after many of the initial underwriters pulled out. Things went from bad to worse\u00a0only two months later when Cosi said\u00a0it was laying off staff and didn\u2019t have the capital to open the 59 stores it promised. The shares tumbled 31 percent and Stenzler resigned. A group of shareholders\u00a0filed a class action lawsuit days later, alleging\u00a0Stenzler and others made materially misleading claims in the prospectus. A\u00a0judge later dismissed the case.Undeterred, Stenzler soon bounced back, co-founding\u00a0Kidville\u00a0Inc., with his wife Shari Misher Stenzler, in 2005. The idea for the family-friendly concept -- specializing\u00a0in early childhood development centers, indoor playgrounds and birthday party venues \u2013- \u00a0came about after the couple\u2019s\u00a0daughter was born. After an initial site in Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, the Kidville franchise expanded to the Upper West Side, Brooklyn, Chicago and elsewhere.\u00a0But it wasn\u2019t all fun and games. Stenzler was\u00a0the subject of at least two lawsuits by Kidville franchisees and contractors. One, a small commercial printing company in Massachusetts, claimed Stenzler refused to pay a $50,000 bill for printing brochures and branded T-shirts. Another\u00a0accused Kidville of making \u201cmisleading and fraudulent\u2019\u2019\u00a0claims that downplayed the amount it would cost to open a Kidville franchise by hundreds of thousands of dollars and overstated revenue.Both of those\u00a0cases were settled out of\u00a0court and the plaintiffs signed nondisclosure agreements. One plaintiff, Paul Wilder, speaking after the case was settled, said Stenzler was \u201cpretty good at convincing people they should go along for the ride.\u2019\u2019 While every business has risks and rewards, Wilder said Stenzler\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0\u201ckind of aggression was with no remorse for\u00a0others who get hurt in the process.\u2019\u2019Stenzler left Kidville to launch Rumble in 2016 with Neiman,\u00a0Anthony DiMarco, a former managing director at Google, and Eugene Remm, a co-founder of the Catch Hospitality Group.About 18 months later Stenzler and Rumble were\u00a0sued for misappropriation of trade secrets by Weil and Danon, whom he knew because their children attended the same school. According to court documents filed by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, Weil and Danon allege Stenzler stole their idea for a concept they called Spar, including specifics for the water-filled punching bag, lighting\u00a0 and music, after having discussed the idea over the course of a few months under a confidentiality agreement.Stenzler\u00a0claims\u00a0the idea for Rumble doesn\u2019t constitute a trade secret because it\u2019s just a basic boxing class. The\u00a0water-filled punching bags have been around for years and the hip-hop playlists were all designed by Remm, who ran some of New York\u2019s top nightclubs and worked as a DJ. Stenzler said he never signed a confidentiality agreement and that Weil and Danon\u00a0have only come after him for money because they\u2019ve watched Rumble\u2019s success over the past two years, according to court documents. \"Only after Mr. Stenzler achieved that success, entirely without them, did the plaintiffs suddenly rise from the dead -- claiming it was really all their idea and demanding an eye-popping $28 million,\" according to Stenzler\u2019s motion to dismiss the case. The judge has not yet ruled on the motion.\u201cIt\u2019s not our first time at the rodeo,\" Stenzler said. \u201cThere\u2019s risk in business and we\u2019ve raised a lot of money here and we\u2019re doing well. I think people like people who have long histories and who have navigated any hurdles that come up,\" Stenzler said.\u00a0In the competitive and risky world of startups, it\u2019s fairly typical for companies -- and their founders -- to face litigation. In fact, eight percent of startups fail due to legal hurdles, according to a 2018 study by venture capital database CB Insights.\"If you\u2019ve been in business for a long time and founded a bunch of companies stuff happens and that\u2019s not unusual,\" said Lori Hoberman, founder of Hoberman Law Group, which represents entrepreneurs. But the lawsuits are usually related to patents, employment contracts or stock vesting -- rarely do they roam into the realm of fraud, deception or class actions over unethical business practices, Hoberman said. \u201cThe most valuable thing an entrepreneur can have is their reputation and those kinds of lawsuits raise all kinds of red flags.\"Those warning signs aren\u2019t always easy to spot, however. A simple Google search of Stenzler and his companies doesn\u2019t surface the court cases in a very reader-friendly way since they date back to 2003 and haven\u2019t been covered\u00a0in the mainstream media. And most early investors in a company don\u2019t feel the need to carry out background checks, since often they are investing\u00a0 where they know the people involved,\u00a0according to venture capitalist Arjun Sethi, (who isn\u2019t familiar with Rumble.) What\u2019s more, angel investors also don\u2019t usually have the resources of a big venture capital firm behind them to cover the $1,000 fee for comprehensive background checks, he said.\u00a0The Rumble team is taking it on the chin and drawing\u00a0on the wisdom of rap artist Notorious B.I.G. to explain how success comes with baggage. \"There is always going to be someone who wants to challenge it,\u2019\u2019 co-founder Remm said.\u00a0\u00a0``Once you start being successful, you know, it\u2019s like Biggie said \u2013 \u2018more money, more problems.\u2019\"\u00a0\u2014 With assistance by Julie Verhage ","140":"HSBC says removal of directors came sooner than expected.

The removal of executives took place amid mounting pressure from authorities, after the second deadly disaster in about three years in one of the miner\u2019s tailings dams in Brazil.\u201cInvestors have expressed concern to us over this news given that Mr Schvartsman was well regarded,\u201d Citigroup analyst Alexander Hacking wrote in note. \u201cYet, we are less concerned given that Vale\u2019s near-term priority is to assist victims and navigate the crisis.\u201dAccording to Citigroup, it\u2019s key that the company maintains its independence, with the board free to set strategy without government interference. \u201cAll indications from Brazil\u2019s new government so far is that this will be the case,\u201d Hacking said.A change in the company\u2019s management has come \u201csooner than we expected,\u201d HSBC analysts led by Jonathan Brandt wrote in report earlier. \u201cWhile the directors themselves technically requested the removal, their request is the consequence of the recommendation of government entities and what we would characterize as government pressure for a change in management.\u201dHSBC reiterated its hold rating for Vale\u2019s ADRs, on the back of increased uncertainty and potential liabilities. The bank believes that, while temporary, the recent movement is likely a first step toward permanent removal, given the level of public pressure.

Progressives\u2019 proposals add new volatility after steady climb Health-insurance stocks were battered last week after progressive Democrats in the House introduced plans to replace private medical benefits with a government-run single payer system.The rollout of the legislation signals what could be a new period of uncertainty for a sector that has known nothing but steady, substantial gains for several years.Pramila JayapalThe S&P 500 managed-care index has fallen 5.3 percent through Friday from Feb. 26, when Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Seattle, outlined her Medicare-for-all proposal after the market closed. The decline was the most in a three-day period since September 2015. On Monday, the index extended its losses by 4.4 percent, one of the biggest one-day losses since 2015.Wall Street analysts called the selloff an overreaction to a policy proposal with near-zero chances of becoming law in this Congress. Veda Partners analyst Spencer Perlman dubbed it \u201can impossible dream.\u201dEven so, the decline may reveal investors\u2019 fears that shifting political ground could increase scrutiny of managed-care businesses including UnitedHealth Group Inc., Anthem Inc. and CVS Health Corp.\u2019s Aetna insurance business. That could lead to unfamiliar tumult for a group of stocks that\u2019s enjoyed a long ascent even as other corners of the health industry were roiled by political wrangling.Drugmakers and pharmacy-benefit managers have taken more heat in Washington of late. In 2015, brazen price hikes by now-convicted biotech entrepreneur Martin Shkreli prompted backlash from Hillary Clinton, then running for president. Since then popular anger about costly prescription medications hasn\u2019t waned. Last week, seven drug executives appeared on Capitol Hill for a hearing on rising prices.The eruption of anger at drug companies driven by the Shkreli scandal and the spotlight on the pricing practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, EpiPen maker Mylan NV and others drove biotech stocks to their knees beginning in mid-2015. But even as shares of pharmaceutical makers suffered, the stocks of many health insurers kept right on rising.Since mid-July 2015, when biotech stocks hit a record high and then cratered after Clinton\u2019s criticism, the managed-care index has climbed roughly 79 percent. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, by contrast, is still 13 percent below its peak.The divergence may reflect how political tension has manifested differently for health insurers than for drugmakers. The insurance industry has been roiled by the fight over repealing the Affordable Care Act, which created insurance markets and mandated that all American purchase coverage. But until recently, few mainstream politicians questioned the basic business of health insurance or advanced policies that would essentially eliminate it.With Medicare for All embraced by several Democratic presidential candidates and Jayapal\u2019s bill endorsed by more than 100 members of the House Democratic majority, the risks of a reckoning for health insurers appear to be rising.More than half of adults expressed support Medicare for All in a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in January. That support diminished substantially if they were told it would eliminate private coverage or require higher taxes. Respondents found the idea more attractive if it were framed as a guarantee of health insurance for all that would cut premiums and out-of-pocket costs.That\u2019s the message that progressives like Jayapal and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez push when trying to advance Medicare for All. Presidential candidates including Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have all backed the idea, though they likely have room to moderate their positions after a Democratic primary.Health insurers are emphasizing the risks. \u201cThis bill will hurt patients, consumers, and taxpayers: Americans will pay more, to wait longer, for worse care,\u201d said Kristine Grow, spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, which represents insurance providers.Read more: Goldman says to buy health insurers after an \u2018irrational\u2019 slumpIn the long run, private insurers may benefit from any new effort to expand health coverage.

Emirate\u2019s equities had the world\u2019s worst performance last year In Dubai, the focus is often too much on the economy of tomorrow rather than that of the recent past.Even as it constructs the Museum of the Future ahead of an opening next year, the Middle East\u2019s financial hub still hasn\u2019t reported how its gross domestic product performed since 2017. Also missing are other figures considered basic elsewhere, ranging from retail and auto sales to industrial production.The lack of an accurate read on the $106 billion economy leaves investors and businesses already stung last year by the world\u2019s worst equity performance struggling to decide if it\u2019s time to start buying. The official vacuum often forces them to glean insights from anecdotal conversations with retailers, owners of car dealerships and business conglomerates.\u201cWe don\u2019t really get a current view of what\u2019s going on right now, there\u2019s a very significant lag between the data and the economy,\u201d said Tarek Fadlallah, chief executive officer of the Middle East unit of Nomura Asset Management. \u201cIf companies and investors don\u2019t have conviction that the economy or a sector that they\u2019re investing in has a brighter outlook, then it\u2019s very difficult to make those decisions.\u201dThe reasons for the dearth of data aren\u2019t clear. No one at the emirate\u2019s statistics center and its media office responded to requests for comment.The market is in the dark at a time when trading volumes in local equities have plunged following the collapse of oil prices, putting plans for initial public offerings on hold. Dubai, one of seven of the United Arab Emirates, has suffered faster stock declines last year than its peers in developing nations despite recouping losses in 2019.An obscured view of the economy is also a problem for investors focusing on individual stocks. \u201cIt is almost as if you are flying blind a little\u201d when data go missing or delayed by a year, according to Patricia Ribeiro, a New York-based money manager at American Century Investments, which oversees about $163 billion and doesn\u2019t hold any local shares.\u201cIf I can get that conviction somewhere else in the emerging world, that\u2019s probably where I would go, and where most investors will go.\u201dThe DFM General Index last year had its biggest drop in a decade as a property glut and faltering demand for real estate fueled share losses among developers.

Some of the figures it provides, including foreign direct investment and construction activity, also haven\u2019t been updated for two years.The reliability of GDP data in the U.A.E. is rated below that of major emerging economies including South Africa and India and has a poorer grade than such Middle Eastern countries as Bahrain, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, according to London-based research firm World Economics, which ranked 154 countries in its Data Quality Index published last September.The reliance on anecdotal evidence in Dubai means the market is more susceptible to gossip and distortions as information is passed down through \u201cChinese whispers,\u201d according to Fadlallah.Emirates NBD, Dubai\u2019s biggest lender, uses purchasing managers\u2019 surveys as a snapshot of business conditions, said Khatija Haque, its head of Middle East and North Africa research.

He notes volatile third-quarter results and potential funding tightness after the recent events may be reasons for the lingering skepticism in the sector.Until last summer, non-bank financiers were a major part of investment portfolios. But a series of missed payments by one of the biggest firms, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. -- once categorized as \u201csystemically important\u201d by the central bank -- then roiled India\u2019s stock market. Now, the nation\u2019s shadow-lending industry, which accounted for nearly four out of every 10 consumer loans in the last three years, has grown more cautious about extending new credit amid a funding crunch of its own.From small-ticket loans for smartphones to funding large apartment clusters, the firms have a finger in every pie. At some point, the growth in their loan books even rivaled that of the state-run banking giants facing lending restrictions owing to the large burden of bad debt.\u201cWe believe NBFC growth will disappoint and there is a marked slowdown for most, which is now starting to reflect in their valuations,\u201d said Nilesh Shah, who helps oversee $24 billion as chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. He noted that his firm has reduced its exposure on both debt and equity funds, without saying by how much.In the \u201crace to grabbing opportunity,\u201d the companies ended up creating an asset-liability mismatch, according to Shah, who said the IL&FS default and tight liquidity in the banking system only added to the pain. India\u2019s banking system liquidity is still in a deficit of 1.2 trillion rupees ($16.9 billion), data compiled by Bloomberg show.And the blows keep coming -- India\u2019s property developers are finding it hard to borrow money, raising the prospect of a wave of debt defaults from the sector hitting shadow lenders that are trying to survive their own funding crunch.That said, Kotak\u2019s Shah isn\u2019t calling it a day yet. \u201cWe look to rebuild the portfolio over a period of time, especially in NBFCs which have good governance, good asset quality and reasonable liability franchise -- but again the process will be gradual,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this correction, those stocks are worth adding.\u201dIndian shares, which were the best in Asia in 2018, have lost more than $100 billion in value this year as uncertainty surrounding upcoming elections, an ongoing bad-debt issue and high valuations have kept investors on the sidelines.And when it comes to non-bank lenders, the plunges have been rough.

Last year, he took the helm of Aptigon in a sweeping shake-up of the group that resulted in the departures of at least 45 people, including unit-head Richard Schimel. The restructuring came after Griffin had grown concerned about the direction of the Aptigon business. The firm said at the time it was committed to Aptigon\u2019s success and would continue to recruit for the unit.Felder also ran Citadel\u2019s global credit business, and those managers will temporarily report to Griffin. The Fundamental Strategies business was folded into two other Citadel units earlier this year.Citadel counts on small teams of traders to manage money independently from one another across its businesses: the -- until now -- four equity units plus fixed-income, quantitative, credit and commodities groups. Together they feed into the flagship multi-strategy hedge fund, which gained 4.55 percent in the first two months of the year. It gained 9.1 percent in 2018.Read more here on multi-manager hedge fund gains this year.\u2014 With assistance by Sridhar Natarajan ","147":"Many sales personnel learned of move in blog post, people say. Energy VP who came from Amazon is helping implement strategy Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk caught many employees by surprise with his announcement last week that the electric-car maker would close most stores and shift to online-only sales, according to three people familiar with the matter.Many sales personnel first found out about the decision when Tesla published a public blog post Thursday afternoon, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters. A Barclays analyst added to a chorus of concerns raised by some investors also caught off guard by the move by cutting his price target on the stock Tuesday.A closed Tesla store in Palm Desert, Calif. on March 7.Tesla declined to comment on the sales shift beyond Thursday\u2019s blog post and an email Musk sent employees later that day. The stock has dropped as much as 16 percent since Thursday, shaving up to $8 billion from Tesla\u2019s market capitalization. The shares pared declines after the company downplayed a customs issue that has held up Model 3 sedans at China ports, trading down 1.1 percent to $282.16 as of 2:20 p.m. in New York.The abrupt move by Musk, 47, shocked Alex Chalekian, the founder and CEO of Lake Avenue Financial in Pasadena, California. The firm, which manages more than $150 million in client assets, sold all of the Tesla stock held for advisory clients on Friday.\u201cThis was a total 180-degree turn,\u201d Chalekian, who owns a black Tesla Model S, said in a phone interview Monday. \u201cTesla had been talking about expanding stores, and all of a sudden they are closing them. To me, this signals a huge financial concern and a possible cash-flow issue for Tesla.\u201dIt pains me to say this, since I really love the company, but we have sold our position in #Tesla for our advisory clients. I believe that the decision to close retail stores is a bad one and points to the weakness in sales and financial strength of the company. $TSLAUntil last week, Tesla\u2019s store strategy seemed to be one of expansion. The Palo Alto, California-based company opened 27 new retail and service centers last quarter, boosting its total to 378 locations worldwide, according to its latest letter to shareholders. It was the most openings for a quarter since mid-2017.Tesla also suggested a brick-and-mortar retail strategy was important in its annual report filed Feb. 19, just nine days before Musk announced the pivot to online sales.\u201cOur Tesla stores and galleries are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets, some of which combine retail sales and service,\u201d Tesla said in its 10-K filing. \u201cOpening a service center in a new geographic area can increase demand. As a result, we have complemented our store strategy with sales facilities and personnel in service centers to more rapidly expand our retail footprint.\u201dThe carmaker steadily added stores and service centers the last two yearsSource: Tesla shareholder lettersTesla has already closed several stores, including one at the International Market Place in Honolulu and another at the Gardens on El Paseo near Palm Springs, California. Calls to those stores now ring through to Tesla call centers in Las Vegas and Fremont, California.\u201cMuch of the bull narrative has rested on Tesla being the next Apple, selling high-volume EVs at premium price point and at high gross margins, in part aided by a unique branded retail experience,\u201d Brian Johnson, a Barclays analyst, wrote in a report Tuesday. That\u2019s been undercut by the store closings, he said, cutting his price target to $192, from $210.One of the key people involved in implementing the online sales strategy is Sanjay Shah, who has taken on additional responsibilities since his arrival from Amazon.com Inc. last summer, the people said. He joined Tesla as senior vice president of energy operations and continues to oversee that business.\u201cThe bull narrative has not shifted to Tesla becoming the Amazon of automotive,\u201d Barclays\u2019 Johnson wrote. He disagrees, arguing it\u2019s likelier that the company needs to replenish cash after paying off a $920 million convertible bond last week and contending with a weak start to the year selling cars in the U.S.After the full value of U.S. federal tax credits expired at the end of 2018, Tesla has prioritized beginning deliveries of the Model 3 in China and Europe early this year.The company said Tuesday that it\u2019s working with China customs authorities on resuming clearance procedures that were disrupted due to misprinted labels on some of the sedans. Caixin reported earlier Tuesday the issue affected 1,600 cars, citing a notice from China\u2019s General Administration of Customs.Read more: How Tesla rushed Model 3s to China last monthMusk described the winding down of many stores as a cost-cutting move that enables Tesla to offer a long-promised $35,000 version of the Model 3 sedan, the automaker\u2019s first mass-manufactured car. The company said it\u2019s able to reduce prices of all its vehicles by an average of about 6 percent by shifting sales online and trimming other expenses.In an email to employees sent roughly three hours after Tesla published its blog post Thursday, Musk said that 78 percent of Model 3 orders were placed online last year, rather than in stores. He wrote that some jobs will be transitioned to other areas of the business and that \u201ca small number of stores in high-traffic locations will remain as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers.\u201d\u201cWe are not concerned,\u201d Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, a fund manager who remains bullish about Tesla, said Monday on Bloomberg Television. While the decision to close stores and go all-online was \u201cabrupt,\u201d she wasn\u2019t as surprised as other investors.Cathie\u00a0Wood, Ark Invest chief executive officer and chief investment officer, discusses Tesla.\u201cWe got the sense something was up because he is still competing against other auto manufacturers who have their costs screwed down, but at some point, his pricing is going to drop below theirs,\u201d Wood said.But other investors said their misgivings about the sales strategy were compounded by more surprise tweets from the CEO about the introduction of a brand-new model.Just days after saying the cheaper Model 3 was made available to order, Musk announced in a series of posts to his roughly 25 million followers that Tesla will unveil the Model Y crossover on March 14, followed by a truck later this year.Model Y unveil event on March 14 at LA Design StudioChalekian said those Sunday tweets reaffirmed his decision to sell Tesla stock.\u201cThe Model Y is probably going to eat into Model 3 sales,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all of the stuff going on right now, I don\u2019t know if people are going to race to put down a deposit on the Y in the way they did with the 3. But Tesla is using this to raise capital through customer deposits. I feel like Tesla is just buying time at this point.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Josh Eidelson, Emily Chang, and Joshua Fineman ","148":" There\u2019s more to worry about besides the recent increase\u00a0in the Gini coefficient.From left to right, British politicians have taken one particular issue to heart.\u201cWhen it comes to opportunity we won\u2019t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few, we will do everything we can to help anybody,\u201d said Theresa May in her maiden speech as prime minister in July\u00a02016. Since becoming Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn has lambasted\u00a0\u00a0\u201cgrotesque\u201d\u00a0disparities that\u00a0he believes to be the consequence of nearly a decade of Conservative party rule. \u201cWe cannot go on creating worse levels of inequality,\u201d he said in a 2017\u00a0interview.This week, new data from the Office for National Statistics seems to prove that the politicians have chosen a worthy target. Inequality in disposable income, as measured by the Gini coefficient, rose to 32.5 percent in the fiscal year ended in 2018, the largest increase since 2013. The poorest fifth of the population saw its average income fall by 1.6 percent as benefits shrank, while the richest fifth enjoyed a 4.7 percent gain as they received higher wages.This certainly deserves monitoring, and would be a real concern were the current direction to be sustained.\u00a0The Resolution Foundation, a think tank, forecasts that the Gini coefficient\u00a0will increase slightly in the near future as low- to middle-income households encounter particularly weak income growth.Income inequality worsened in the U.K. last yearSource: U.K. Office for National StatisticsTime periods are fiscal year endedYet, what happened last year is for now an exception rather than the rule. Income inequality in the U.K. is still slightly lower than it was in 2007, before the financial crisis. Overall, Britain\u2019s welfare state has done pretty well in helping the poor weather\u00a0the crisis and\u00a0its immediate aftermath. The ONS has found that in the absence of cash benefits, the Gini coefficient would have been 14.2 percentage points higher in 2014-5.Of course, it is legitimate to argue that Britain has a problem. The top 1 percent\u00a0earns around 7 percent\u00a0of total disposable household income.\u00a0The Gini coefficient stood at 25\u00a0percent in 1978, rose steeply under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and now hovers around 32 percent. This is why Labour is pushing for more radical policy proposals, including restoring sectoral collective bargaining.Still, the evidence shows that the main form of inequality dogging Britain \u2013\u00a0much like the rest of Europe \u2013 is the one between generations. A report from the Intergenerational Commission found last year that disposable incomes are no higher for millennials who have reached age 30 than they were for the previous generation at the same age. This contrasts, for example, with the steep improvements enjoyed by the baby boomers relative to\u00a0their own parents. The report also found that while in 2001 those aged between 25 and 34 were consuming the same as 55-64 year-olds, they are now consuming 15 percent less.Britain&apos;s failure to tackle this issue does more than instill a sense of unfairness among its youth. It also breeds resentment and political apathy, which can\u00a0hamper\u00a0future economic growth and productivity if it prevents young people from investing in their human capital.May has done little to address this issue. Last autumn, chancellor Philip Hammond promised \u201cthe end of austerity\u201d, as he moved to inject money into the National Health Service, increase the funding of universal credit (the government\u2019s new welfare benefit) and raise the threshold for the personal allowance and higher rate taxpayers. But there was little in the budget for the young, except for an increase in the national living wage for the over-25s, and some more money for homebuilding.\u00a0There is hope booming employment levels, which continue to hit record highs, can help the younger generation.\u00a0But with Brexit taking a toll on the economy, there is a risk that even this rare piece of good news goes into reverse.A silver lining could, paradoxically, come from the housing market, which is cooling, particularly in London. But it will take time before the South East\u2019s expensive stock of residential property becomes affordable for first-time buyers.The fight against inequality often puts ideology before evidence. The recent increase in income disparities deserves scrutiny, but pales when compared to the intergenerational gulf which has opened up in Europe over the past few decades. Politicians should have no doubts over where to intervene first.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. ","149":" Pedestrians wearing face masks walk across a street as buildings stand shrouded in haze in Beijing on\u00a0Nov. 14, 2018.Want to receive this post in your inbox every Friday? You can\u00a0sign up here.Add smog to the signs of China&apos;s economic rebound.Air pollution in Beijing has increased noticeably in the past month. That trend stood out even more this week with high-profile legislative meetings starting in the Chinese capital.Premier Li Keqiang opened the annual full-session of the  National People&apos;s Congress on Tuesday with his state-of-the-nation speech at the Great Hall of the People. Outside, the smog was ten-fold worse than what the World Health Organization defines as healthy.The most likely culprits are the country&apos;s factories. China&apos;s manufacturing sector contracted for a third straight month in February, but a closer look at the data reveals what could be a turning point.While surveys of manufacturers showed a contraction in activity, they also showed that inventories are falling, new orders are strengthening and confidence is improving; all signs of a pickup. Tax cuts announced this week should add to that momentum.Pollution is the unfortunate byproduct, at least for now. That will change as heavy industry becomes a smaller part of the economy and those that remain upgrade their technology. In the short term though, the choice is often  looser enforcement that keeps\u00a0factories humming or tighter enforcement that turns the\u00a0skies blue.Beijing is well aware of how precarious that balance is. China needs jobs and growth. Just as obvious is the public&apos;s aversion to breathing dirty air and the power of pollution to spark protests. It will be, as the premier noted in his address, a  challenging year ahead.This week&apos;s top headline from the NPC\u00a0was the slower growth target. Set at a range of 6 to 6.5 percent versus 2018&apos;s \"about 6.5 percent,\" this year&apos;s mark should give policy makers more leeway to tackle some of China&apos;s longer-term problems. That includes pollution, the country&apos;s massive debt pile and an increasingly competitive relationship with America.Speaking of U.S.-China ties, it emerged this week that President Donald Trump is pushing his negotiators to hammer out a trade deal. A big win on the international stage combined with a stock market bump that might come with it would be advantageous ahead of an election campaign. That said, there were also signs this week that a deal may take some time yet, including a former Chinese finance minister saying that Beijing isn&apos;t ready to make big concessions.Military spending was also in focus. China&apos;s budget for 2019 includes a proposed 7.5 percent increase in defense outlays. That&apos;s slower than the 8.1 percent proposed last year but still notably faster than the pace of overall economic expansion. Beijing, which has the world&apos;s second biggest military budget after the U.S., has defended its spending as reasonable, necessary and not meant to threaten other countries.It does seem Huawei is on the offensive. The Chinese technology giant, whose equipment the U.S. claims is a security threat, is  suing America. The key to its case is legislation that bars Huawei gear from being used by the U.S. government and government contractors, which Huawei argues is unconstitutional. That comes just days after Meng Wanzhou, the company&apos;s finance chief and the daughter of its founder, sued Canada on allegations she was wrongfully detained and searched.And finally, China\u2019s diplomats aren\u2019t being very diplomatic. Incidents like accusations of white supremacy, verbal attacks on police and digs at Trump show they&apos;re taking an  increasingly strident approach from Canada to South Africa, and foreign envoys in Beijing say Chinese officials have become far more aggressive in private meetings. While the\u00a0assertive behavior might win them applause at home and prove their loyalty to Xi Jinping, it could\u00a0be damaging the president&apos;s efforts to win friends abroad. ","150":" A Chinese national flag flies as a man uses a smartphone in Shanghai, China.Remember when Japan was going to become the world\u2019s biggest economy?Don\u2019t laugh. Herman Kahn, the Rand Corp. futurist who partly inspired the character of Dr. Strangelove, predicted\u00a0as far back as 1970\u00a0that Japan\u2019s gross domestic product would overtake the U.S. around the year 2000.Decades later, his\u00a0prediction still seemed on track. Thanks in part to the strength of the yen, Japan was\u00a0just months away from matching the U.S. in GDP terms, one 1995 Los Angeles Times article predicted. Halfway through that country\u2019s\u00a0lost decade, it\u2019s hard to believe that this wasn\u2019t a fringe view\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but it was nonetheless the subject of an essay in the august Foreign Policy magazine and a well-received accompanying book.In 1995, it seemed plausible that Japan could overtake the U.S. in nominal GDP terms. That&apos;s not how things turned outSource: IMF, Bloomberg, Bloomberg Opinion calculationsNote: Extrapolated figures are produced by inflating 1995 GDP numbers at the 1990-1995 average growth rate. All figures in nominal U.S. dollars.If you extrapolated early-1990s growth rates on a chart, indeed, the forecast seemed almost irrefutable \u2013\u00a0but that\u2019s ultimately a lesson about\u00a0the hazards of extrapolating lines on charts.As  my colleague Daniel Moss has argued, we should heed that mistake\u00a0every time we predict that China is on the brink of a similar coup.\u00a0China\u2019s official figures for the size of its economy are about 16 percent larger than they should be, and measures of real GDP growth were overstated by about 2 percentage points between 2008 and 2016, according to a study published by\u00a0the Brookings Institution Thursday. Combined with the country\u2019s own downgrade of its GDP growth for this year\u00a0to a range of between 6 percent and 6.5 percent earlier in the week, that represents a sort of profit warning for the economy.It\u2019s worth reflecting that this particular stock has already had its share of analyst downgrades. Back in 2010, Standard Chartered Plc was predicting that China\u2019s economy would overtake the U.S. by 2020, and would be nearly twice the size by 2030. Four years later, IHS Markit Economics forecast the tipping point would come the same 10 years into the future, in 2024.Those forecasts seem fanciful in the light of the way China\u2019s economy has slowed \u2013\u00a0and America\u2019s has accelerated \u2013\u00a0during the\u00a0era of President Xi Jinping. At market exchange rates and current prices, U.S. GDP was $20.54 trillion in 2018, about 60 percent larger than China\u2019s $13.09 trillion.\u00a0Depending on your growth rate, the Chinese economy could overtake the U.S. in four years, or neverSource: Bloomberg, National Bureau of Statistics of China. World Bank, Brookings Institution, Bloomberg Opinion calculationsNote: Assumed growth rates based, in order, on: China&apos;s historic minimum of 8% as of 2012; U.S. 10-year average 1.8% as of 2012; 6% lower end of current China GDP target; 6% lower end of current GDP target adjusted according to Brookings estimates; 2.2% U.S. 20-year average growth rate as of 2018.That just shows how misleading extrapolations can be. If you had inflated China\u2019s 2011 GDP at the 8 percent rate then considered the minimum politically tolerable,\u00a0and grew America\u2019s at its then-10 year average of 1.8 percent, you\u2019d have put the tipping point around 2023. Do the same forecast now with China\u2019s growth at the\u00a06-percent end of the official forecast band, and the U.S. would still be seen falling behind in 2028, roughly in line with\u00a0Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s Jim O\u2019Neill\u2019s\u00a0longtime forecast.What happens, though, if we see the U.S. growing from here at its 20-year average rate of 2.2 percent, and apply Brookings\u2019 adjustments to China\u2019s current GDP and growth-rate forecasts? In that eventuality, China\u2019s GDP continues to trail the U.S. all the way out to 2050.China&apos;s working-age population is five times as big as America&apos;s at present. By 2060, it will be just three times as bigSource: U.N. population divisionNote: Based on population aged 20 to 64.By that time, demographic factors will be weighing heavily against catch-up growth.\u00a0China\u2019s workforce, nearly five times the size of America\u2019s at present, will only be a bit more than three times as large, meaning total factor productivity\u00a0will have to be growing still faster to close the gap \u2013\u00a0and all the evidence is that, to the contrary, it\u2019s\u00a0been contracting.China&apos;s total factor productivity growth rate has been contracting throughout the Xi Jinping eraSource: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Conference BoardThat\u2019s not a reason to count China out. For one thing, as my colleague Noah Smith has written, it\u2019s  already the larger economy\u00a0according to purchasing-power parity (a way of adjusting for the fact that the same income buys a higher standard of living in China).For another, such measures\u00a0are heavily influenced by exchange rates, one reason Japan seemed so mighty when the yen was nearing 80 cents in the mid-1990s. On top of that,  as Bloomberg Intelligence economist Tom Orlik argued Friday, China\u2019s official GDP numbers may be more robust these days than Brookings is giving them credit for.China is still only about 15 percent of the global economySource: World BankNote: Figures in current U.S. dollars.Most importantly, though, it\u2019s a lesson that numbers like these aren\u2019t really a solid-enough foundation\u00a0for building such\u00a0grand strategic narratives, however tempting it is to do so.\u00a0Even at its current scale, China is a scant 15 percent of the global economy, and it\u2019s unlikely to crack more than 20 percent at market exchange rates in the foreseeable future.Fretting over adjustments to long-run economic forecasts is really just a proxy for our deeper anxieties about the fracturing of democracy in Western countries\u00a0and the growing confidence of\u00a0authoritarian governments from Beijing and Brasilia\u00a0to Moscow and Ankara. If we want to ensure the international liberal order survives another century, we\u2019d do much better to focus on those real problems in the present, rather than fixate on the impending doom of an imagined future.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Light first-quarter forecast highlights uncertainty in India Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s sales and earnings in the busy holiday quarter beat analysts\u2019 estimates, showing the world\u2019s biggest web retailer can maintain rapid growth while improving profitability and fending off online competition from rivals like Walmart Inc.Advertising was a key moneymaker, highlighting Amazon\u2019s ability to charge brands and merchants for visibility to its 100 million-plus loyal Prime subscribers, who pay fees in exchange for delivery discounts, movie and music streaming and other perks. Overall revenue rose 20 percent, and the company\u2019s \"other\" revenue category, which is mostly advertising, grew 95 percent to $3.39 billion in the quarter.Shoppers will spend $484 billion globally on Amazon this year, up 26 percent from 2018, and the Seattle-based company will capture more than half of all online spending in the U.S., according to EMarketer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has been pushing beyond the low-margin business of selling goods online into more profitable categories like cloud computing and advertising. Those profits also help fuel Amazon\u2019s growing devices business, which includes smart-home and connected-car gadgets that operate on Amazon\u2019s voice-activated Alexa platform.Strength in online sales over the holiday period showed Amazon still has room to grow in its core business and is benefiting from excitement around its new devices, said Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities.\"This company continues to take wallet share and operate very well,\"  he said.Revenue was $72.4 billion in the fourth quarter, the e-commerce giant said Thursday in a statement. Analysts projected $71.9 billion. Net income was $6.04 per share, compared with an average estimate of $5.56. Sales at Amazon Web Services, the top seller of cloud-computing services, climbed 45 percent to $7.43 billion. Operating expenses grew 18 percent in the recent quarter.Sales will be $56 billion to $60 billion in the current period, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $61 billion. First-quarter operating income will be $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 estimates of $2.99 billion. Shares fluctuated between gains and losses in extended trading after the report and were little changed at 5:19 p.m. in New York. Losses from international operations widened to $642 million, reversing a trend of narrower losses internationally. The potentially weak revenue outlook highlighted concerns about how Amazon will do in India, its biggest international expansion target, where rules on foreign-owned e-commerce companies are changing. On a call with reporters, finance chief Brian Olsavsky also said headwinds from foreign currency exchange rates are curbing revenue in the current period.Investor excitement about Amazon\u2019s growing profits helped push the stock to a record high in September, before the shares dipped during a broader market slump at year\u2019s end. Amazon shares are up about 14 percent this year on investor optimism that the company can maintain growth and profitability, and closed at $1,718.73 before the results were released. Amazon had jumped back above Microsoft Corp., which is No. 2 in cloud computing, as the most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of $840.4 billion.A tight labor market, rising shipping costs and money-losing investments abroad remain threats. Amazon in October pledged to pay all of its warehouse employees at least $15 an hour, while eliminating some bonuses and stock awards. The cost of stowing, packing and delivering goods increased 12 percent in the holiday quarter to $10 billion, in line with online sales growth of 12.5 percent.The fourth quarter offered investors the first glimpse of year-over-year results since Amazon\u2019s $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market in 2017. Sales in physical stores, which are predominantly Whole Foods locations, decreased 2.7 percent to $4.4 billion. In-store pickups of online grocery orders don\u2019t count as physical store sales, further clouding the ability to track the performance of Amazon\u2019s grocery push. The online retailer\u2019s brick-and-mortar strategy also includes bookstores and a cashierless convenience store called AmazonGo, which lets customers check in with a smartphone app and be charged automatically based on what they remove from the store.Amazon has historically delivered relatively little profit as it fulfills Bezos\u2019s strategy of investing to stay ahead. Building warehouses and data centers around the world, inventing new devices and automating tasks usually done by humans are just some of the places Amazon spends its money.Bezos, the world\u2019s wealthiest man and Amazon\u2019s biggest shareholder, announced earlier this month that he was divorcing MacKenzie, his wife of 25 years.

Flawed labels have held up the cars at ports and highlighted \u201cthe risks inherent in U.S. auto\/tech firms conducting business in the PRC,\u201d Jonas wrote, noting the sensitivity of data privacy, cybersecurity, robotics and artificial intelligence.A total of 4,678 Model 3s that have arrived at Chinese ports may have issues, including misprinted or missing local-language labels, China Central Television said Wednesday. The flaws first surfaced earlier this week when Caixin reported that ports had suspended customs clearance of Model 3s due to problems with about 1,600 cars.Tesla is fixing the labels under the supervision of customs officials, who will resume clearances after they pass review, CCTV said. The company said in a statement Tuesday that sales of the Model 3 in China aren\u2019t impacted and that it continues to deliver sedans that have already been processed.Morgan Stanley\u2019s Jonas listed a host of concerns, including Tesla\u2019s reliance on China having \u201cconstructive trade relations\u201d with the U.S. American regulations on exports to the country also should be considered, including the Treasury Department\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., known as Cfius, and the \u201cunquantifiable risks of technology transfer,\u201d the analyst said.Electric- and autonomous-vehicle technology may be regarded as having \u201cdual-purpose,\u201d Jonas wrote, which could limit the role of U.S. companies within China\u2019s transportation industry, and vice versa. He added that Morgan Stanley\u2019s China team is aware of dozens of domestic Chinese electric-vehicle startups.Further ahead, Jonas sees the auto industry \u201cmorphing into a public transport utility operated as a public good.\u201d That might naturally limit the role of foreign entities, as national and economic concerns come into play.Morgan Stanley rates Tesla shares the equivalent of a hold with a $283 price target.

But eventually, this business will be\u00a0led by Disney+, the company\u2019s\u00a0soon-to-come version of Netflix.\u00a0Ahead of the launch of the Disney+ app, Disney began breaking out results for a new direct-to-consumer streaming division:Source: Disney filingWhile Disney+ doesn\u2019t launch until late 2019, there\u2019s already been plenty of\u00a0buildup. The fact that\u00a0a company as powerful as Disney, and as meticulous and reticent with its plans, is entering the streaming wars is enough to put competitors on notice before anyone even sees a prototype of the app. More important, it\u2019s ushered in a welcome shift in sentiment for Disney. Its stock had  fallen behind market\u00a0benchmarks in recent years amid declining viewership for some of its TV networks, a trend that hurts advertising sales, traditionally part of the lifeblood of a media company.\u00a0Disney is launching a streaming app to win back some of the viewers it has lost or will lose from cord-cuttingSource: Nielsen, Bloomberg IntelligenceNote: Ratings are for prime time, live plus 7 days, ages 2 and up.This isn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first crack at streaming. There\u2019s a little-noticed product in the U.K. called DisneyLife, which has served as the testing ground for Disney\u2019s streaming strategy since 2015. CEO Bob Iger has talked in the past about the lessons learned from DisneyLife, such as the technical complexities of running the service on different devices and operating systems, and the importance of getting the subscription price right. Ultimately, that experience\u00a0led to the purchase of Disney\u2019s stake in BAMTech, a streaming-technology company, because Iger recognized that its team\u00a0had the technological know-how Disney lacked.All of\u00a0this helps to instill\u00a0investors\u2019 confidence that the company is taking the right approach with the\u00a0Disney+ app, though it remains to be seen how the direct-to-consumer business will impact Disney as a whole. As I said\u00a0in November, having a streaming service will\u00a0complicate\u00a0decisions, including\u00a0where\u00a0to air certain content and concentrate\u00a0resources. That may create\u00a0tensions across the Disney empire\u00a0at a time when the company will be grappling with the disruptive integration of\u00a0its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox Inc.\u2019s film and TV-entertainment assets, all while\u00a0trying to sort out a succession plan for Iger, who turns 68 this month.\u00a0Disney has scored a public-relations victory by becoming a streaming company overnight\u00a0without the streaming product that\u2019s at the center of its plans. But the hard work comes when Disney+ faces off against Netflix, AT&T Inc.\u2019s suite of streaming services, and the dozens of other TV-viewing products already\u00a0out there or on the way.\u00a0Until then, that new little line on its financial statements - however powerful for re-shaping its identity - doesn&apos;t tell investors much.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. ","154":" The Oscars are purportedly about honoring the best movies of the year, but they also serve as a proxy war between old-guard Hollywood studios and next-generation streaming services. So if you want to root for the home team this year, you can cheer for your favorite studio to block Netflix Inc. from taking the first-ever\u00a0best picture statue for a streaming service.This year, Netflix actually has a pretty good shot at the prize that has so long eluded the tech industry. The company reportedly spent $25 million-plus to win Academy votes for its racehorse\u2014the black-and-white, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n masterpiece, \u201cRoma.\u201d And it hired Oscar strategist Lisa Taback, the woman behind the campaigns for \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d \u201cThe Artist\u201d and \u201cSpotlight,\u201d to help shepherd Roma to victory.According to Hollywood Reporter\u2019s number-crunching, \u201cRoma\u201d is now the favorite to win the nod. Though \u201cBlackKkKlansman,\u201d \u201cGreen Book\u201d and \u201cThe Favourite\u201d\u2014produced by traditional Hollywood studios\u2014also all seem to have a fighting chance.Traditional Hollywood is already up in arms over the possibility of a streaming\u00a0upset. After \u201cRoma\u201d picked up four awards at Britain\u2019s Baftas, including best film, a movie theater chain called Vue International went ballistic, calling \u201cRoma\u201d \"made-for-TV.\" Meanwhile one anonymous Oscar voter described it as an \u201cexpensive home movie.\u201d The chief complaint\u00a0for theaters\u00a0is that Netflix screened \"Roma\" for only a few weeks before also putting it online. Movie theaters push for long exclusive periods before movies appear on streaming services. Some in the movie industry support the exclusivity on artistic grounds, others favor it for more overtly business-related motives. For obvious reasons, Netflix disagrees.But this year, the annual \"will they or won\u2019t they\u201d Oscars game\u00a0takes place against the backdrop of a much fiercer and more consequential struggle between existing entertainment titans and the tech set. Media companies including giants like AT&T Inc. and CBS Corp. increasingly realize that that the threat from Netflix and its ilk isn\u2019t going away, and to compete, they\u2019ll need to become streaming companies themselves, and quickly.Take, Walt Disney Co. The company is in the midst of building out its planned Disney+ streaming service while taking ownership over Hulu (a service that also got its first Oscar nomination this year). In its push toward online content, Disney faces the ultimate business question: to what extent should it eat into its current revenue sources to lure viewers to its new services?Increasingly signs are pointing toward Disney sacrificing short-term licensing revenue. Netflix killed its shows from Disney-owned Marvel, marking an important split between the companies. And on Thursday, The Information reported that Disney might pull content from its global television channels to feed its two streaming services, cutting into its licensing revenue.The company\u2019s bet might be a sage investment in the future. But it\u2019s worth remembering that the entertainment world is famously fickle. This awards season, spare a thought for one disrupter that you\u2019re hearing very little about these days: MoviePass Inc. Its parent company\u2019s shares traded below a dollar for months. This month, its stock was finally de-listed from NASDAQ.This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s\u00a0Fully Charged\u00a0newsletter.\u00a0Sign up here.The IPO drumbeat continues.

The company plans to bring on a Morgan Stanley dealmaker as its chief financial officer, signalling its intention to keep up its voracious appetite for financing deals.\u00a0 ","155":" Cans of Monster Beverage Corp. energy drink.Monster Beverage, which was removed from Citibank\u2019s Focus List two weeks ago, still has plenty of room to run, according to RBC Capital sell-side analyst Nik Modi, who has a multi-year bull-case price target of $100 per share.Monster shares are up 23 percent year to date through Friday\u2019s close, more than double the S&P 500\u2019s 9.4 percent gain.\u201cWe continue to see 25% upside potential to our $75 base case and 67% upside to our multi-year $100 bull case,\u201d Modi wrote in a note. The shares are likely to be volatile given concerns around Bang Energy and due to persistent uncertainty surrounding the arbitration with Coca-Cola.Still, Modi points out three potential catalysts that he\u2019s watching: the launch of Reign this month; further traction in China; Red Bull\u2019s pricing strategy.Modi, who rates Monster Beverage outperform, is no longer the biggest bull on the stock based on sell-side price targets.

His rating is also outperform.Stifel\u2019s Mark Astrachan (buy, price target $67) pondered potential scenarios of Bang being acquired. Ultimately, the analyst thinks \u201cit makes the most sense\u201d for PepsiCo or Anheuser-Buusch InBev to buy Bang. In addition, he added that \u201ca theoretical acquisition could accelerate a decision by Coke regarding acquiring, or not, the remaining shares in Monster it does not currently own (current ~18.3% stake).\u201d ","156":"Rising foreign investment raises stakes for policy competence. Shock to confidence could see overseas money flow back out China\u2019s increasing success at luring global investors to its stock and bond markets may be laying the seeds of future volatility as its financial system becomes subject to overseas sentiment like never before.The country\u2019s years-long campaign to attract steady streams of foreign capital is now paying off, providing support for the yuan in the face of diminishing current-account surpluses. Foreign ownership of Chinese bonds has climbed to a record of more than $260 billion, while holdings of stocks stood at $172 billion in the most recent data.Wider inclusion of Chinese assets in global bond and equity indexes will offer China a fresh source of funding, the need for which was underlined Tuesday when the government widened its budget-deficit target and boosted plans for local-government debt issuance. Capital inflows will also cushion a shrinking current account surplus that the International Monetary Fund tips to fall further over coming years.\u201cChina\u2019s increasing openness to foreign investors will help in the development of its financial markets -- but at the risk of increasing exposure to capital flow volatility, which will also complicate exchange rate management.\u201d said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the IMF\u2019s China section who is now at Cornell University.Foreign investors hold less than 3 percent of China\u2019s domestic bonds and equities, making them marginal players for now, although they\u2019ve had increasing impact on the government debt which forms the bulk of their bond holdings. Their sway is set to rise as the country\u2019s weightings in global portfolios expand. Similarly, China\u2019s impact on those portfolios will rise.\u201cThis will be a double edged sword: more access but also more transmission of volatility to the global market,\u201d said Hui Feng, a senior research fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute and co-author of \u201cThe Rise of the People\u2019s Bank of China.\u201dLast week, MSCI Inc. announced it will boost onshore Chinese stocks in its emerging-market index to 3.3 percent by November, from 0.72 percent now. Next month, Chinese government and policy-bank bonds are set for a phased inclusion in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index that will bring China\u2019s share to an estimated 6 percent. Bloomberg LP owns the Bloomberg Barclays indexes, and is the parent of Bloomberg News.\u201cFor foreign investors, issues such as insufficient information, lack of transparency, pricing distortions created by implicit government guarantee and policy swings in capital flow management are major hurdles for investing in China bonds. Even so, these should not stop long-term allocation into China\u2019s bond market.\u201d--Chang Shu and David Qu, Bloomberg Economics, Hong KongClick here to view the pieceThe decisions marked wins for Chinese officials who have sought a stable source of capital inflows to balance long-standing pressure from Chinese companies and individuals to park money overseas. The efforts became all the more important after the country saw a $1 trillion slide in its foreign-exchange reserves in the wake of a messy yuan devaluation in 2015.To be sure, China\u2019s tightly controlled capital account gives the government ample opportunity to clamp down on cash moving into or out of the country. That offers a vital buffer against the kind of capital flight that typically destabilizes emerging economies.Yet the implicit vulnerability to a sudden outflow of foreign holdings raises the stakes for China to enhance its communication efforts on regulatory changes, to avoid anything like the instability seen in 2015 and 2016. If done right, the increased participation of global investors could actually reduce volatility by increasing the diversity of asset buyers.\u201cThe U.S. stock market attracts a large amount of capital from the world. Did that make it more vulnerable over the last decades? No, it actually helped it become the largest and a very efficient stock market,\u201d said Rujing Meng, who lectures on finance at the University of Hong KongFor now, China needn\u2019t worry, as it\u2019s likely to see sustained net inflows for the foreseeable future given the low starting point, economists say. Most of the purchases of bonds have come from central banks and sovereign wealth funds, with private-sector fund managers only starting to diversify portfolios to include China.China\u2019s sheer economic weight and massive pool of domestic savings also offer buffers that the likes of Argentina and Indonesia don\u2019t have.\u201cForeign investors are in the early stages of a major commitment to Chinese equities,\u201d Morgan Stanley economists and strategists wrote last month in a report on the \u201ctransformation\u201d of China\u2019s capital flows. Similarly, \u201cbond inflows into China have the potential to pick up significantly in the coming years,\u201d they wrote, predicting steady appreciation in the yuan as a result.Winning those long-term inflows will require easing the concerns of some investors that China could lock up their money in cases of extreme moves.\u201cWhen volatility spikes there, it could be tricky for investors if they can\u2019t trade bonds and A-shares freely,\u201d said Jean-Louis Nakamura, Asia-Pacific chief investment officer at Lombard Odier, using the term for domestically listed shares. \u201cIn China, rules can change overnight. We need to have assurance and policy clarity first.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Molly Dai ","157":"Women make up just 7.2% of boards of companies in Mexbol index. Of the index\u2019s 35 companies, only one has a female CEO Mexico City.When Blanca Trevino took her first job, working for a family-run company in Mexico, her new bosses demanded that she sign a blank resignation letter -- just in case she decided to get married.They later waived the marriage clause after she had become too instrumental to lose, but at that point she had decided to move on, jumping ship to start a new business on her own terms.\"I still see social and family limitations on what women can do in Mexico,\" said Trevino, now the CEO of Softtek, an IT services company that operates across the Americas, Europe and Asia. \"Women should not feel guilty for giving their time to their business.\"The Mexbol index companies only have one female board member on averageSource: BloombergIt\u2019s a refrain that\u2019s growing louder in Mexico as women struggle to find a foothold in the male-dominated world of business and finance. The only female CEO on the country\u2019s Mexbol index, Ienova\u2019s Tania Ortiz Mena, says she often hears the phrase \"did you come here by yourself, miss?\" when going into a meeting, and recounted a time recently when she walked into an energy conference in Mexico with about 300 attendees. Only two of them were women.\"Unconscious prejudice is there,\" she said. \"The role of women isn\u2019t visible, and men just take that for granted -- it doesn\u2019t seem strange to them.\"Of course, that doesn\u2019t prevent the industry from congratulating itself. On Friday, the country\u2019s largest stock exchange, the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores will \"ring the bell for gender equality\" in an event at its venerable domed headquarters in the center of Mexico City. Just don\u2019t look for the women there. The stock exchange counts just one woman on it\u2019s 16-member board, and it\u2019s Trevino herself. The BMV did not respond to a request for comment.That\u2019s not just an issue for the Bolsa alone. One female member of the board is roughly the average for the 35 companies in the country\u2019s benchmark Mexbol stock index. On the whole, 22 of the companies have at least one woman on the board, but women only represent 7.2 percent of total board members in the index.Compared to regional peers, Mexico\u2019s biggest companies are more likely to have a woman on the board. Mexbol companies average 0.9 women per board, compared with 0.8 for Brazil\u2019s Ibovespa Index and 0.7 in Chile. Colombia leads the pack with 1.2 percent on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Effort to Add Women to Boards Is Slow to Get Results: QuickTakeGoing by percentages, Walmex stands head and shoulders above the rest with women representing 36 percent of their board. Of the 35 companies in the index, 12 have no women among their board members, including Becle, the manufacturer of popular tequila brand Jose Cuervo, and Mission tortilla maker Gruma. Both Becle and Gruma did not respond to requests for comment.And that\u2019s made it harder for women further down the chain of command. Ortiz Mena -- herself a mother of three -- recalls having to build the company\u2019s first lactation room in perhaps the least welcoming of places for a nursing mother: a gas compression facility packed with valves, pipes and metal in northern Mexico. She also extended maternity leaves and created career paths for top performing female employees.Trevino, meanwhile, has set up a committee within the company to make recommendations on women\u2019s issues and has made hiring more women a priority within the company. While she acknowledged that her experience came in the context of a strong safety net, she also said that she well remembers plenty of teary calls to her two young daughters from airport payphones before jetting off on business trips. But she says it\u2019s time for a change.\"I have absolute conviction that the most successful companies, the most successful economies, and the most successful countries are the ones that bring in the best talent,\" Trevino said. \"Talent doesn\u2019t have a gender.\" ","158":"U.S. has smaller ratio of female executives running units. Canada also outperforms its neighbor with women on bank boards Women in the highest ranks of Canadian banks are more likely to run divisions than their U.S. counterparts.More than a third of the 20 women in high-ranking positions at Canada\u2019s six big lenders oversee revenue-generating operations, according to a Bloomberg survey of North American banks with assets of at least $100 billion. That compares with about a quarter of the 58 female senior executives at the 17 largest U.S. banks.In both countries, high-ranking women tend to be in charge of human resources or marketing, or in positions such as auditor, general counsel, chief risk officer or chief administrative officer. But female executives in Canada are more likely than those in the U.S. to occupy the types of roles that contribute to the bottom line and can someday lead to becoming chief executive officer.\u201cIn Canada, the banks are the bright spots in terms of progress for female representation at the executive and board level,\u201d said Tanya van Biesen, executive director for Canada at Catalyst Inc., a nonprofit that pushes to make workplaces better for women. \u201cThey have been leading the way in terms of progressive policies, and you can see that net out in the numbers.\u201dWomen account for an average 27% of top executives at large U.S. banksSource: Company filingsNote: Percentage of women in high-ranking positions as of March 1Canadian banks are improving -- perhaps at the expense of the U.S. In recent months, Kelly Coffey, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s former head of private wealth, and Kristi Mitchem, who was CEO of asset management at Wells Fargo & Co., both left for Canadian firms.Kristi MitchemIn February, Coffey became CEO of Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s City National Bank in Los Angeles, while Mitchem joins Bank of Montreal this month as head of global asset management. And, this week, RBC said it hired BNY Mellon Markets CEO Michelle Neal to head its U.S. fixed income, currencies and commodities business out of New York.Canada\u2019s gains are due to a mix of legislation, regulation and a private-sector push to do better, van Biesen said. Canadian banks have been subject to employment-equity law since 1995, and about 20 years later securities regulators began requiring Toronto Stock Exchange companies to disclose annually the number of women with board seats and executive roles. The disclosures show that women make up 30 percent to 45 percent of roles at the level of vice president and above at Canada\u2019s six big banks. Competition in the nation\u2019s concentrated banking industry also has helped, van Biesen said.Teri Currie, who heads up Canadian personal banking at Toronto-Dominion Bank, its biggest division, has been close to the issue since 2005. She was then co-head of human resources, when the lender was establishing diversity and inclusion initiatives, including encouraging women to take leadership roles. The percentage of women in the role of vice president or higher was just above 20 percent at the time, compared with 39 percent today.Teri Currie\u201cWe\u2019ve made really good progress in that period of time,\u201d Currie, 54, said in an interview. \u201cBut you are never done.\u201dOccupying roles such as Currie\u2019s is key not only because they produce revenue, but also because future CEOs typically come from such positions. In their 202 years of history, Canada\u2019s major banks have never had a female CEO, though London-based HSBC Holdings Plc\u2019s Canadian operation is led by Sandra Stuart, and Gillian Riley is CEO of Tangerine, Bank of Nova Scotia\u2019s online division. There are women leading U.S. banks, including KeyCorp CEO Beth Mooney.Bank of Montreal formed a task force for women\u2019s advancement in the early 1990s, when women constituted 13 percent of senior management. Now, a third of the bank\u2019s board seats and 40 percent of senior-leadership roles are held by women.\u201cI\u2019ve been at the bank almost nine years now, and I would say that I haven\u2019t faced any barriers because I\u2019m a woman,\u201d said Joanna Rotenberg, 42, who oversees wealth management. Half of her division\u2019s employees and more than 40 percent of its senior management are female, she said. \u201cMy job, as I see it as a leader, is to pay it forward and make sure others do as well. It\u2019s not just talk, it\u2019s action that has led to results.\u201dChristina Kramer said she\u2019s taken advantage of initiatives aimed at helping women throughout her 32 years at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, advancing to group head of Canadian personal and small-business banking, the lender\u2019s largest division.\u201cI\u2019ve had mentors along the way that have really helped me in terms of shaping my career, my knowledge, my experience base,\u201d she said. Kramer, 52, also is trying to pay it forward, holding monthly forums for female leaders at all levels of the bank. \u201cInnovating and adapting to change is really critical for the industry and for a bank, and in order to innovate you need to have diversity of thought, diversity of experience and diversity of background.\u201dCanada tops the U.S. for female representation in bank boardroomsSource: Company filingsNote: Percentage of board positions held by women as of March 1At Canada\u2019s six largest banks, women made up 58 percent of the workforce and held almost 38 percent of senior-management roles as of 2017, according to the Canadian Bankers Association. Thirty years earlier, women accounted for just 2.6 percent of senior management. Women hold at least a third of board seats at each of the six big Canadian lenders.Banks compare well with the rest of corporate Canada: Just 15 percent of board seats at the nation\u2019s companies are held by women, according to a September 2018 report by the Canadian Securities Administrators. About two-thirds of 648 companies had at least one female executive.Canadian banks have better female representation on boards than almost all their large U.S. counterparts, according to the survey of 23 banks. That\u2019s noteworthy, said Royal Bank Chair Kathleen Taylor, because boards can push management to consider diversity when cultivating future executives.\u201cIf you look at who are in the top jobs today, whether they\u2019re men or women, whether they\u2019re visible minorities or not, the seeds around that executive success were planted a very long time ago,\u201d said Taylor, 61, who became Royal Bank\u2019s first chairwoman in 2013. \u201cIt really matters what job a young woman is in today for whether or not she\u2019s going to be able to have a career progression that gets her to the most senior management team level in 10 to 12 years.\u201d ","159":" Wells Fargo & Co. boosted Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan\u2019s compensation by 5.7 percent to $18.4 million for last year as the bank has worked to overcome multiple scandals.Sloan got $2.4 million in salary and $14 million of restricted stock linked to performance goals, the San Francisco-based bank said Wednesday in a regulatory filing.
