Economists from Summers to Krugman have denounced MMT BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he\u2019s not a proponent of modern monetary theory.\u201cThat\u2019s garbage,\u201d Fink said in an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that deficits do matter. I\u2019m a big believer that deficits are going to be driving interest rates much higher and it could drive them to an unsustainable level. \u201dMMT economists argue that because the U.S. borrows in its own currency, it can print dollars to cover its obligations, and can\u2019t go broke. The theory has won converts among freshman Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a way to finance such social policies as the Green New Deal and Medicare For All.The U.S. deficit is on course to top $1 trillion in the coming years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described that school of thought as \u201cwrong,\u201d while economists like Larry Summers and Paul Krugman have also denounced it.But not everyone is so dismissive: Paul McCulley, former chief economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., says that he has a lot of sympathy for the doctrine although he\u2019s \u201cnot a card-carrying MMTer.\u201dRead more about McCulley\u2019s view on MMT here.Fink said, \u201cthe theory is that until we see deficits harm that will tell us deficits are too high. To me, as a parent, that\u2019s like watching your children have bad behavior and you just watch and watch and watch until that behavior becomes monumental. I think that\u2019s not a good approach.\u201dIn Europe, structural issues are rising to the top again, he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t have an organized European response and so the only game in town again is still the central bank,\u201d said Fink. \u201cI believe we need a crisis in Europe to really fix Europe.\u201dLarry FinkPart of the public response should be Germany doing more fiscal spending, said Fink, who runs the world\u2019s largest asset manager. He recommended German policy makers take advantage of the coming electrification of the nation\u2019s car industry to increase fiscal spending on their cities and roads.\u201cThis is an ideal time for fiscal spending in Germany,\u201d he said.Other comments from Fink in the interview include: We\u2019re in a \u201cGoldilocks moment\u201d for global economies. It\u2019s not so bad or so good.If there\u2019s a comprehensive trade agreement with China, that may reduce China\u2019s need to buy Treasuries. \"This is going to be a big issue,\" he said.Rising populism continues to be a concern and there\u2019s a need to create more \"inclusive capitalism.\"","1":"Sandboxes are the hot trend in financial regulation. Or rather, deregulation. China, Singapore, Australia, Canada, and more than 20 other countries have them. U.S. regulatory agencies are starting them. Arizona has one, and other states may follow suit.Sandbox programs are supposed to be a kind of safe space to allow digital entrepreneurs to test products without regulators breathing down their necks. Governments are willing to stay their regulatory hand because the startups that emerge from such experiments might lead to new jobs and expanded access to financial services. They also provide competition to big banks. There\u2019s even a sandbox for sandboxes: Regulators in 12 countries have agreed to experiment with financial technology across borders.But as sandbox initiatives proliferate, critics worry that the concept has become a covert effort to neuter consumer protection laws. \u201cWhy allow companies that aren\u2019t ready to provide financial services to the public to be permitted to do so?\u201d says Maria Vullo, who on Feb. 1 stepped down as superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, the state\u2019s top financial watchdog. Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, says the movement \u201chas taken a wrong turn in this deregulatory era\u201d under President Trump. In the U.S., she says, sandboxes aren\u2019t \u201cframed as a way to help companies comply with the laws, but to get relief from the laws.\u201dA proposed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sandbox is perhaps the most striking such effort. Congress created the CFPB as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act. Its mission is to crack down on deceptive or unfair consumer finance practices. Some of those, such as predatory mortgage lending, helped cause the 2008 financial crisis. The agency was designed to fill what was seen as a gap in existing regulation and enforcement.But companies approved for the CFPB sandbox would come under a powerful protective umbrella. While a December proposal says applicants would have to show how they plan to control for consumer risks and reimburse customers who might be harmed, approved companies would be partially immune from enforcement actions by any federal or state authority and from lawsuits by private parties. The safe harbor would extend to consumer protection laws that ban discrimination in lending, limit consumers\u2019 liability for unauthorized credit card charges, and require plain-English explanations of real estate transactions. The agency says it plans to invite trade associations to apply for sandbox approval for entire industries.Paul Watkins, who runs the CFPB\u2019s Office of Innovation and will run the agency\u2019s sandbox if it\u2019s approved, said in a January podcast that \u201cinnovation is part of consumer protection\u2014these things are not opposed.\u201d The program, he said, will achieve the bureau\u2019s broader purpose, \u201cwhich is to ensure competition within markets and ensure consumer access.\u201dTwenty-two state attorneys general and a coalition of 50 public-interest groups are fighting the idea. People get \u201cstarry-eyed when they hear the word \u2018innovation,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Saunders, \u201cbut dramatically innovative products require more supervision, not less.\u201d She cites the now-banned practice in which banks automatically gave debit card customers overdraft protection, then charged $40 when an account lacked the funds for a $2 cup of coffee.The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is considering a sandbox program for the national banks it regulates, but it\u2019s already paved the way for fintechs that don\u2019t accept deposits to receive special national bank charters. While the OCC wouldn\u2019t override banking rules, it would tailor them to any newly chartered company\u2019s size, riskiness, and complexity. And the OCC would preempt states, normally the overseers of nondepository financial institutions. \u201cTen years ago, we went through a crisis because the loosening of regulations permitted institutions to take on risk at the expense of the consumer,\u201d says Vullo, the former New York regulator. \u201cIt\u2019s like people have amnesia.\u201dBryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, says it\u2019s \u201cmisleading to suggest consumer protections would suffer\u201d if a fintech company were to receive a federal charter. The OCC, he says, would conduct banklike exams of fintech companies to prevent abuses.The sandbox movement took off after the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority coined the phrase to describe its program, begun in 2016, to encourage innovation and competition. The FCA has since allowed 89 companies to market-test their concepts. A report by Deloitte says perhaps the British initiative\u2019s biggest achievement \u201chas been to break the myth of regulation being a barrier to innovation.\u201dThe Trump administration took away a different lesson: In a July report, the Treasury Department encouraged states to establish sandboxes as a \u201cunified solution\u201d for what it considers postcrisis regulatory overkill. If states don\u2019t do it, the report says, Congress should step in and preempt state laws.Even without sandboxes, there\u2019s been no shortage of fintech startups. The Treasury report says that more than 3,300 fintech companies started from 2010 to 2018. Funding from investors for such companies has been growing rapidly, reaching $22 billion globally in 2017, a 13-fold increase since 2010. Fintech lending now makes up more than 36 percent of all U.S. personal loans, up from less than 1 percent in 2010. Some digital financial services reach as many as 80 million people, the report says.Three days after the Treasury report, Arizona\u2019s sandbox opened to fintechs that provide a service to consumers\u2014online loans, mobile payments, cryptocurrency products, robo-advice\u2014not available in the state. Accepted companies can serve as many as 10,000 customers and operate for two years without a license, after which they must obtain approvals or cease operating.Sweetbridge NFP Ltd., a Scottsdale, Ariz., fintech, is one of three companies that have been approved. It plans to convert the value of vehicle titles into digital tokens that customers can trade, borrow, and lend. The Arizona attorney general office\u2019s website describes the trial as a \u201cblockchain-enabled product designed to purchase financing without a credit check and offer affordable, consumer-friendly vehicle title loans.\u201dTitle loans allow car owners to get access to quick cash by putting up the title to their vehicles as collateral. Since 2010, when the state banned payday lending, auto-title lenders have exploded in Arizona. The state in 2015 had more than 630 title-loan outlets\u2014one for every 8,000 residents\u2014according to a Consumer Federation of America report.For the sandbox program, Sweetbridge will rely on insurance data and Kelley Blue Book auto values rather than credit checks and other tools of traditional underwriting. It agreed to cap its loans at an annual interest rate of 20 percent\u2014below what most title lenders charge. Sweetbridge\u2019s test, which it says will begin soon, will also limit loans to 20 percent of a vehicle\u2019s value. Scott Nelson, Sweetbridge\u2019s founder and chief executive officer, said in an email that the Arizona sandbox allows startups to quickly test products \u201cin a controlled environment without the cost and time delay that is typical for licensing new financial products.\u201dIf successful, the company plans to offer the title-loan product more widely. A Feb. 6 CFPB announcement could make that easier. The agency said it plans to rescind the part of Obama-era rules that require payday and auto-title lenders to determine the likelihood that a customer can pay back a loan. Sweetbridge says its loans won\u2019t be available in the U.K. and Europe, where such assessments are required.Jean Ann Fox, the former director for financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, says she\u2019s unsuccessfully tried to find out whether the Arizona sandbox products are actually operating and under what controls, which state laws have been waived, and whether the entities have been asked to post bonds in case they have to reimburse customers. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a sandbox as a black box,\u201d Fox says. Katie Conner, a spokeswoman for the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office, which oversees the program, says it \u201cis the absolute last place where any deceitful players would want to be.\u201d Of the three approved companies, only Grain Technology Inc. has begun offering its product and on a limited basis\u2014personalized savings and credit plans through existing bank accounts. \u201cThese companies have been in the sandbox for less than four months\u2014things are just getting started,\u201d she adds.For now, Arizona\u2019s trials can only be offered to in-state consumers. But the state could extend its reach by seeking admission of its sandbox into the CFPB\u2019s if the agency moves ahead. That may not be difficult: Watkins, who would manage the CFPB\u2019s sandbox, led the effort to design Arizona\u2019s. The Treasury has proposed sandboxes to encourage innovation in financial technology. But even without them, there\u2019ve been more than 3,300 startups since 2010.","2":" Norway is about to decide whether to let its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund dump all its oil and gas stocks. After more than a year of closely held deliberations, the Finance Ministry is set to reveal whether its massive fund will be allowed to divest close to $40 billion in oil and gas stocks. The decision will be made public around 11:45 a.m. in Oslo.   Here\u2019s what you need to know.The fund contends that it makes little sense for Norway to be doubly exposed to the oil markets. As western Europe\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer, its fortunes are already heavily linked to petroleum, deriving almost half its exports and more than 20 percent of the state\u2019s revenue from the commodities.The central bank, which oversees the fund, insists that the plan is based solely on financial considerations and that it doesn\u2019t reflect a particular view of the oil industry\u2019s prospects.The proposal shocked markets when it was revealed in 2017, sending oil stocks broadly lower. The plan was hailed by activists around the world as a monumental step in getting investors to back away from fossil fuels. If it becomes reality, it would likely turn the heat up on Big Oil, which is already facing pressure to do more to fight climate change and adapt to the energy transition.The fund owned about $37 billion of oil and gas stocks at the end of last year, including more than 2 percent of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Total SA. But it has also assured that any sell-down would likely take years.Read about how the fund boosted its oil and gas holdings last yearRead more: Norway\u2019s oil sell-off plan is \u2018shot heard around the world\u2019Economists are split over the plan and a government-commissioned expert panel last year advised against it, arguing a divestment would be inefficient insurance against a drop in commodity prices. It also said it would threaten the fund\u2019s simple and well-established strategy of investing broadly.In theory, the proposal has the support of a majority of parties in Parliament, which has the final say. However, since the plan was presented, the centrist Liberals and Christian Democrats, who are in favor of dumping oil stocks, have joined the bigger Conservative and Progress parties to form a majority government. While they haven\u2019t voiced a clear view of the oil-stock proposal, the Conservatives and Progress Party have traditionally been reluctant to make dramatic changes to the fund\u2019s investment strategy.The issue is likely to be settled within the coalition before the Finance Ministry makes its announcement on Friday. While that process makes a heated contest in parliament improbable, it also makes the outcome harder to predict.Tore Storehaug, a Christian Democrat lawmaker who sits on Parliament\u2019s Finance Committee, declined to say anything on what might happen in case the government decides not to follow the fund\u2019s advice.Want the lowdown on European markets?

","4":"Bank urged to re-define Robor interbank interest rate. Decision on Robor to be taken with central bank, Valcov says Romania\u2019s government asked the central bank to help it effectively eliminate a so-called greed tax on banks after the levy prompted the country\u2019s worst market rout since the global financial crisis. Bank stocks surged in Bucharest.The ruling Social Democrats drew rebuke from central bankers who said the tax, introduced to help keep the budget deficit within European Union limits and curb interest rates on loans, may harm the financial system and undermine monetary policy. The bank has since allowed the leu to weaken to a record low against the euro.While the cabinet ignored the criticism and approved the bill, it sees \u201can easy way\u201d for the central bank to render it harmless, according to Darius Valcov, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Viorica Dancila. All rate-setters have to do is change the formula used to calculate the Robor interbank rate, or scrap it all together. Valcov said the move would also end a situation in which, according to him, lend to one another at \u201cunjustifiably\u201d low costs.\u201cI hope we can get a radical change in the way Robor is calculated or even see its demise,\u201d Valcov said Monday in a phone interview. \u201cA decision will be made with the central bank, which can modify internal rules on market rates without requiring parliamentary approval.\u201dThe proposed solution is an unexpected departure for the government, which has bickered with the central bank over the past month after the greed tax spooked investors. Valcov signaled another shift when, after the government complained about the weak leu, he said the bank is just trying to shield the currency from negative effects.The central bank and the Finance Ministry are debating how to alleviate pressure on banks from the tax, with rate-setters urging the cabinet to drop the link between the levy and Robor. Valcov suggested the central bank can work with lenders and the government to push Robor to less than 2 percent, a level at which the tax would be zero. The two institutions will resume discussions on Feb. 18, including options about the potential assets targeted by the tax, people familiar with the talks said.Banca Transilvania SA, the largest lender in the Black Sea nation, rallied as much as 11 percent, the most since the tax was announced last year, while BRD-Groupe Societe Generale SA gained as much as 8.9 percent.\u201cLocal bank stocks are already reacting positively to the news,\u201d BT Capital Partners analysts said in a note. \u201cHowever, we believe that finance ministry\u2019s standpoint is not in sync with the Prime Minister\u2019s economic adviser\u2019s, which leaves the government course of action still uncertain. \u201dValcov said the government\u2019s aim was to lower borrowing costs for the average Romanian. The cabinet hasn\u2019t projected revenue from the tax in this year\u2019s budget, though January data beat analysts\u2019 expectations, he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t care about the level of the tax or any extra revenue,\u201d Valcov said. \u201cWe want borrowing costs for citizens to be close to those of the other Europeans, to be cut in half from the current levels.\u201dBenchmark borrowing costs in Romania are set to be held at 2.5 percent on Thursday. The European Central Bank\u2019s main refinancing rate remains at zero percent. ","5":"Lease-back plans lure new customers with guaranteed returns. But works often turn out to be worth far less than expected In her first foray into the world of art investing, Lucette d\u2019Angelique got an offer that seemed too good to turn down.Buy a work of contemporary Chinese art, which was appreciating at as much as 20 percent a year, then lease it to a corporation for a guaranteed 6 percent annual return.The company making the pitch, Art Futures Group, said a client had already been signed up to lease the painting, but she would need to act quickly as several other potential buyers were also looking at the work.So d\u2019Angelique plunked down HK$198,000 ($25,223) for an oil painting by Hou Qing featuring a young Chinese woman in a red dress, clutching a bottle of Hennessy cognac. \"I was thinking, wow, what a great investment.\"Order acknowledgment of purchase of \"Red Hennessy\" by Hou Qing.A few months later, while attending an open house at the AFG gallery, she was surprised to see her painting was on display to promote the artist and not hanging in someone\u2019s office. Still, the monthly dividend checks kept arriving, so she brushed aside her concerns, eventually spending another HK$1.1 million on four more paintings.After two years, the leasing contract on her painting \u201cRed Hennessy\u201d expired. AFG told her it wouldn\u2019t be renewed. The story was the same for her other purchases once the initial two-year rental period expired. She was told the leasing market had gone quiet and it was too soon to try and sell her paintings.Frustrated by AFG\u2019s failure to respond to her further queries, she tried to place her works with several Hong Kong auction houses.\"Not one of them wanted anything to do with these paintings,\" she said. The best she could get was an offer from Sotheby\u2019s to sell a Shen Jingdong painting online with a reserve price of HK$10,000 ($1,274), about 3.5 percent of the HK$288,000 she had paid for it. Sotheby\u2019s declined to comment on Shen Jindong\u2019s artworks.Appraisal certificate for \"Book Worm,\" by Shen Jingdong.d\u2019Angelique isn\u2019t the only one suffering buyer\u2019s remorse. More than 50 people have signed up to a private chat group on Facebook for AFG clients that she created. Interviews with more than a dozen other AFG clients tell a similar story. The average price they paid per painting was about $25,000.AFG\u2019s website says it has served more than 1,000 clients. In an e-mail exchange, AFG initially said the company\u2019s founder, Jeremy Kasler, would give an interview, but then said he would respond to written questions instead. On receiving the questions, the company said he was too busy to respond. In response to two subsequent emails, the company said there was no one else available to address the questions.AFG isn\u2019t the only company in Hong Kong offering to sell and then lease art. Elliot James & Tyndal also sells Chinese contemporary art with promises of an 8 percent return for two years, said Divine Fung, who bought one of their paintings after getting cold called by a sales representative. The company did not respond to emailed questions.Another firm, Collins & Kent International Fine Art, sold editions of works by Damien Hirst and Salvador Dali, offering 7.5 percent rental income, until its Hong Kong office went bust in 2017.Damien Hirst\u2019s The Souls IV Westminster blue\/cool gold\/topaz No. 8\/15.Mrs. Wong, a compliance lawyer who asked to use her husband\u2019s surname only, bought a Hirst print from Collins & Kent a few months before the company closed. Now she says she\u2019s stuck with a painting she never liked and can\u2019t sell.\"I was the perfect target, someone with enough money, very little time and no knowledge of art,\u201d she said. \u201cI am totally embarrassed by my own stupidity and lack of due diligence.\"A Melbourne-based company using the same name said it helps some clients lease their purchases of \"blue chip\" European works for a one-year period with yields between 3.5 percent and 7 percent as part of a broader business offering art storage and logistics. It allowed the Hong Kong entity use of its name and access to its artworks, the company said in an email.The art-purchase-and-lease offer is particularly appealing for people looking for a high-return alternative investment, but find the world of galleries, art fairs and auction houses intimidating.\"That\u2019s where the model works, it preys on people by speaking to them in a vocabulary they understand and offering to be a trusted guide through this very opaque market, so buyers probably let their guard down,\" says Edie Hu, art advisory specialist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong. \"There is a mystique to the art market and all of a sudden you have someone who brings it down to your level. Nobody from galleries or auction houses talks about return on investment.\"Macey & Sons, which sells mostly European works of art and antiques, was founded by former AFG employee Jonathan Macey, who declined to discuss his former employer. He said his firm does lease some pieces back from buyers it uses for publicity to attract new clients, paying the owner up to 5 percent.\"We have a leasing program, not on all pieces, on certain pieces we can show off around the world,\u201d Macey said. \"You have to reinvent the way you gain markets.\"His firm rents space at art fairs and held a free whisky tasting in November for delegates of the Hong Kong AVCJ Venture Capital Summit. In February Macey displayed a client\u2019s HK$1 million 12 carat tiara at the Longines Masters equestrian event in Hong Kong. His clients can even earn frequent flyer points when they purchase his art.AFG has set up a booth each year at the Asia Contemporary Art Show in Hong Kong alongside other galleries, and has held lucky draws to win a painting, according to d\u2019Angelique, who said she was contacted by phone \u201cin minutes\u201d after filling out an online survey in 2012 to enter the contest.A painting by artist Liu Liguo.Iris, who works in finance and asked that only her first name be used, started getting calls from a salesman soon after filling out an AFG questionnaire in exchange for a free face-painting for her daughter in the upscale Hong Kong enclave of Discovery Bay.\"He was very pushy and good at talking, like a car salesman,\" she said after buying a surrealistic painting of a multicolored zebra by mainland artist Liu Liguo for HK$348,000 in 2016. \"If he had sold me a mutual fund or some other investment I would have been a lot more careful. Without the rental offer I probably would not have bought it.\"She said she doesn\u2019t believe her painting was ever rented out and AFG simply overcharged her and paid the lease premium from the sale proceeds. The leasing contract was drawn up between her and AFG, not a corporate renter. She said AFG wouldn\u2019t tell her who would be leasing her painting.Collectors Reveal Secrets of How to Make a Fortune in ArtWhile the claims of third-party leases may have been unsubstantiated, the company hasn\u2019t done anything legally improper, said Wong, the lawyer.One reason the strategy flourishes is the reluctance of many former clients to speak out. Seven people who were interviewed about their purchases work in banking and finance and requested anonymity to protect their professional reputations. Some of those who bought the artworks didn\u2019t want to talk about the experience.That behavior is typical of people who fear they fell for a scam because they feel ashamed, said a former Blackrock employee who spent HK$625,000 on art from AFG. Their shame is a natural reaction and companies rely on it to prevent information coming out about their operations, the person said.But some who feel victimized don\u2019t stay silent. H.L. Tan decided to speak out after an AFG broker tried to sell him a second painting five years after his first. \"I was really angry,\" said Tay, a former stock broker who wrote off his HK$248,000 purchase years ago. \"This is why I am coming forward, as a warning sign to everyone not to get involved.\" ","6":" The most serious of the corruption charges looming against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu involve allegations that he shaped industry rules to favor the country\u2019s largest telecommunications company, Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corporation Ltd. Attorney General Avihai Mandelblit has served notice that he plans to indict Netanyahu for bribery in the case as the country prepares for general elections in April.Mandelblit says that when Netanyahu approved a merger in 2015 between Bezeq\u2019s television unit Yes and the parent company he did so to help his close friend Shaul Elovitch, who had stakes in both, pocket a windfall. The attorney general says that Netanyahu, who was also serving as communications minister at the time, promised additional regulatory relief for the telecommunications giant. Investigators have alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s handpicked director-general of the Communications Ministry, Shlomo Filber, allowed Bezeq executives secret access to internal ministry documents so they could review them and suggest changes. Filber turned state\u2019s witness last year.Elovitch bought the largest stake in Bezeq in 2010, financing the takeover with 6.5 billion shekels ($1.79 billion) of debt. Soon after, regulatory reforms began hurting profits, threatening his plan to repay the loans with Bezeq\u2019s dividend. To generate new cash, Elovitch pushed to sell his shares in Yes. Investigators allege that executives close to him inflated the selling price, hurting Bezeq shareholders. Local investment houses with stakes in Bezeq voted against the deal because of the high purchase price. Netanyahu overrode objections and approved the sale. Meanwhile, senior editors at Bezeq\u2019s Walla! news portal began changing or removing articles that portrayed the prime minister or his family in a negative light, often at the direct request of Netanyahu\u2019s wife Sara, investigators allege.No. In 2016, Netanyahu pushed to lift a ban preventing Bezeq from merging its units which was put in place to prevent the company from abusing its monopolistic power. However, under pressure from government watchdogs, Netanyahu was forced to resign from the communications ministry because his previously undisclosed friendship with Elovitch presented a conflict of interest. In June 2017, the Israel Securities Authority opened an investigation into Bezeq, in effect freezing any attempts to change industry rules.He has consistently denied wrongdoing. He\u2019s argued that favorable press coverage doesn\u2019t constitute a bribe, and that he\u2019s a victim of a left-wing conspiracy involving Israel\u2019s police, the justice system and the media to remove him from office. Netanyahu will be entitled to a hearing after the April 9 election to present his case and try to persuade the attorney general to drop the plan to charge him.Prosecutors have to decide whether to go ahead with their draft indictment accusing Elovitch of bribery, which can carry a penalty of as much as 10 years in prison. His creditors took his telecom empire to bankruptcy court and are selling the majority stake in Bezeq. The company itself has continued to spiral downwards since the investigation into its dealings was announced. The stock recently hit a 21-year low, and investors and analysts fear the company\u2019s profits will dry up, forcing Bezeq to ditch its dividend in the coming years.Just the prospect of charges could cost Netanyahu re-election. According to polls taken after the draft indictment was published, the Blue & White bloc, led by ex-military chief of staff Benny Gantz and former Finance Minister Yair Lapid, will be in a better position to form a government than the prime minister\u2019s Likud. But if Netanyahu is re-elected and the attorney general goes ahead with an indictment after the vote, the prime minister has vowed he won\u2019t step down unless convicted.

Some on social media have turned the term into a running joke, holding ironic Twitter polls to see who is the \u201cchief neoliberal shill\u201d (the winner last year was none other than yours truly).\u00a0But at least one economist has articulated a coherent vision of neoliberalism -- Brad DeLong, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley who worked at the Treasury Department during the Bill Clinton administration. In 1999, DeLong wrote that a combination of market liberalization in developing countries and trade opening by rich nations would allow the poor countries of the world to end centuries of poverty.The plan seems to have worked. Market liberalization in countries such as\u00a0India and China seems to have precipitated a shift to faster growth, while trade and investment links with rich countries have helped these and other developing countries tremendously:Constant per-capita gross domestic product relative to the U.S. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisThese changes helped pull a billion people out of desperate poverty, and billions more are on the way to becoming middle class.But there was a big hole in DeLong\u2019s neoliberal plan. While the developing world surged forward, the U.S. began to encounter a host of economic problems. Wage stagnation, reduced mobility and rising inequality eroded the foundations of the New Deal society that had sustained the U.S.&apos;s middle class during the second half of the 20th century. The U.S. resisted nationalizing its health-care system, resulting in a cumbersome public-private hybrid arrangement that allowed costs to mushroom while letting some people go uninsured. And financial deregulation led to a crisis and a huge, long recession throughout much of the developed world.Now, DeLong is ready to throw in the towel. In a recent interview, he declared that left-leaning advocates of neoliberal policies in the U.S. were mistaken in thinking they would find a political partner on the center-right. The plan was always to cushion the blow of international trade and easing of regulations on business using government programs, such as universal health care and a robust social safety net, to make sure the working class wasn\u2019t left behind. But, DeLong argues, Republicans rejected that compromise, insisting that any neoliberalism be of the free-market-fundamentalist variety:Barack Obama rolls into office with Mitt Romney\u2019s health care policy, with John McCain\u2019s climate policy, with Bill Clinton\u2019s tax policy\u2026[but] John Boehner, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell [were] the leaders of the Republican Party, and\u2026decided on scorched earth[.]As a result, DeLong declared that old-line neoliberals need to pass the baton to the political left.Others aren\u2019t ready to let DeLong off so easily. In the Boston Review, a panel of economists writes that neoliberalism got the policy wrong as well as the politics. Their various suggestions for post-neoliberal policies include increasing labor\u2019s power with greater unionization and wage boards, tighter regulation of the finance industry and restriction on trade in order to protect U.S. workers. Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute echoes their assessment.Many of these are good ideas. But in rejecting neoliberalism as a concept, the critics go too far.First, progress in the developing world has been impressive -- something for which neoliberalism probably deserves a lot of credit -- but it is far from complete; most of South Asia is still very poor, and much of Africa is just beginning to industrialize. To curb the flows of trade and investment with these countries would be a grave abdication of the U.S.\u2019s international and humanitarian responsibilities.Second, neoliberal policies might have led to faster productivity growth in the 1990s and early 2000s:Total factor productivity*Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis* Index 2011 = 1Contrary to popular belief, wages also increased during that period. The spurt of growth is commonly attributed to the information-technology boom, but that boom might not have been possible if the U.S. had more strictly regulated emerging industries in order to protect favored incumbents. It\u2019s worth noting that West Europe and Japan, whose policies were somewhat less neoliberal than the U.S.\u2019s, ended up producing relatively few big new tech companies, and have failed to catch up to U.S. levels of per capita income in the years since 1990.Finally, although economic blunders have come from the political right in the U.S. in recent decades, it\u2019s also possible for the left to make big mistakes -- not just in poor countries, but in rich ones too. Germany suffered high unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s, thanks to its rigid labor market regulations; eventually, it eased those restrictions, which substantially lowered the unemployment rate. Sweden had a very progressive tax system, but scaled back redistribution in the 1990s in order to speed growth. France, too, has sometimes been forced to curb its ambitions for redistribution and regulation when these produced economic instability and slow growth. The U.S. needs a neoliberal contingent to help insure against missteps like these.So neoliberals\u2019 ideas are still needed. A move toward social democracy should help correct much of the inequality that has arisen in the U.S., while fixing dysfunctional industries like health care and finance. But left-leaning neoliberals like DeLong will still be needed in order to restrain social democrats\u2019 more ambitious impulses, to protect the U.S. economy\u2019s entrepreneurial private sector, and to make sure that technological progress and international trade don\u2019t get forgotten.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. ","8":" Running on MMT time.A couple of weeks ago, Paul Krugman decided to write about modern monetary theory. He didn\u2019t cite the scholarly literature written by any of the academic MMT economists \u00a0(books, book chapters, published articles or an abundance of other writings).Instead, he declared that MMT was pretty much just the economist Abba Lerner\u2019s \u201cFunctional Finance\u201d approach from the 1940s and offered a critique of Lerner that he maintained was effectively a critique of MMT. I pushed back, situating modern monetary theory in a broader intellectual history.Krugman returned, accusing me of moving the goal posts and asking for straightforward answers to four questions. I responded with what I thought was a well-reasoned, respectful and direct set of answers.So-called \u201cfinance twitter\u201d buzzed as the tension between mainstream Keynesian analysis and MMT was put on display. Krugman then took to Twitter with a series of tweets calling my analysis \u201ca mess\u201d and declaring MMT to be \u201ca losing game.\u201d He also reminded us of his own record when it comes to \u201cdenouncing austerity policies.\u201dI want to address what Krugman claims I got wrong and also compare the record.I argued that deficits put downward pressure on interest rates. Krugman says I got that wrong. The standard line \u2014 Krugman\u2019s line \u2014 is that deficits normally lead to rising interest rates. I argued that deficits actually put downward pressure on the interest rate and that policymakers have to fight against this natural gravitation by doing something to prevent the overnight rate from dropping toward zero. This is really just basic supply and demand.It helps to break the argument into a two-part thought experiment. First, think about what happens if the government is running huge budget deficits. As I explained, these deficits would result in a massive injection of reserves into the banking system. Unless something is done to prevent it, banks will scramble to offload the excess funds in the overnight market. But with massive supply and no demand for these balances, the overnight bid heads toward zero.Krugman stops the story here and claims I\u2019m wrong because we can see, empirically, that the monetary base doesn&apos;t increase with the debt. This is because he\u2019s not recognizing that something is done to prevent the base from permanently increasing.What is done? The government is coordinating its deficit spending with bond sales, thereby doing a reserve drain (selling bonds) along with a reserve add (deficit spending), so that the newly injected reserves are quickly transformed into newly added Treasuries. The bond sales are done to coordinate the impact so that the government\u2019s fiscal operations don\u2019t leave the banking system with a larger monetary base (and lower interest rates).But this is fighting against the gravitational effects on the interest rate. Deficit spending pushes down on the overnight rate, and bond sales pull it back up. When bond sales are perfectly coordinated with deficit spending, the opposing forces cancel out, leaving the monetary base looking stable as Krugman\u2019s graph shows.To finish the thought experiment, consider what would happen if Congress decided to dispense with Treasury auctions and simply allow budget deficits to supply the system with base money instead of Treasuries. Clearly, that would drive the overnight rate to zero. If it wanted to, the Fed could still achieve a positive overnight rate, simply by paying \u201cinterest on reserve,\u201d or IOR, balances. That, too, would be fighting against the natural tendency for rates to go to zero.I understand why this makes no sense to Krugman. The crude, IS-LM interpretation of Keynes demonstrates that, under normal conditions, an increase in deficit spending will push up interest rates and lead to some crowding-out of investment spending. There is no room for a technical analysis of monetary operations in that framework. For Krugman, the model is simple but useful.He used the same model to fight the deficit scolds, who were pushing austerity during the Great Recession. (And he deserves credit for being on the right side of that debate!) But his defense of deficits was always contingent on being in a depressed economy, where he argued that monetary policy had become largely powerless (a flat LM curve) due to the zero lower bound (ZLB) so fiscal policy needed to do more to help the economy recover. Now that the economy has escaped the ZLB, Krugman has returned to warning that \u201cdeficits matter again.\u201d In his words:What changes once we\u2019re close to full employment? Basically, government borrowing once again competes with the private sector for a limited amount of money. This means that deficit spending no longer provides much if any economic boost, because it drives up interest rates and \u2018crowds out\u2019 private investment.He then goes on to say that \u201cby crowding out investment,\u201d deficit spending \u201cwill somewhat reduce long-term economic growth.\u201dThis follows directly from his model, and these are the arguments I disputed in my most recent reply. Our differences derive from our different analytical frameworks: Mainstream Keynesian versus MMT.In the U.S. context, modern monetary theory begins with the observation that the currency itself is a simple public monopoly. From the earliest stages of the project (mid-1990s), MMT held that currency regimes matter. MMTers argued that governments cannot become insolvent when they borrow in their own non-convertible currencies and that the currency issuer never has to accept \u201cmarket-determined\u201d interest rates.We explained that Social Security faces no long-term financial crisis and warned that the budget surpluses in the Bill Clinton administration were unsustainable. We warned of the housing bubble before it burst. We explained that quantitative easing wouldn\u2019t be inflationary. We knew Reinhart and Rogoff were wrong about deficits and growth even before the Excel spreadsheet error was discovered.We warned that the euro was susceptible to a debt crisis. And, once the crisis occurred, we insisted that the U.S. could never end up like Greece.Krugman calls MMT \u201ca losing game,\u201d and he urges us to remember \u201call those articles I wrote\u201d over the previous years.I sampled those articles, and here\u2019s some of what I found.On Social Security, he asks, \u201cWhere is the crisis? Just over the horizon.\u201d And then he warns, \u201cWhile the present generation of retirees is doing very nicely, the [Social Security] promises that are being made to those now working cannot be honored.\u201dHe called our nation\u2019s finances \u201ca fiscal train wreck\u201d and confessed, \u201cI\u2019m terrified about what will happen to interest rates once financial markets wake up to the implications of skyrocketing budget deficits.\u201dHe insisted that the U.S. faces, \u201ca looming fiscal crisis,\u201d adding, \u201cthe only question now is when foreign investors, who have financed our deficits so far, will decide to pull the plug.\u201dHe mused about the potential for accelerating inflation under quantitative easing, writing that the Fed is, \u201cprinting $1 trillion of money, and using those funds to buy bonds. Is this inflationary? We hope so!\u201dHe asked, \u201ccouldn\u2019t America still end up like Greece?\u201d answering, \u201cYes, of course. If investors decide we\u2019re a banana republic whose politicians can\u2019t or won\u2019t come to grips with long-term problems, they will indeed stop buying our debt.\u201dAnd he puzzled over the different interest rate environments in Japan and Italy, asking, \u201cWhy are the interest rates on Italian and Japanese debt so different?\u201d confessing, \u201cI actually don\u2019t have a firm view. But it seems to be an important puzzle to solve.\u201dNo economist is going to get everything right. But the odds of getting things right improve dramatically when you\u2019re working with a macro framework that doesn\u2019t lead you astray. The IS-LM framework is a gadget that will often align with sensible real-world analysis. It may perform better than a stopped clock, but it is no match for MMT.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story:Stephanie Kelton at stephanie.kelton@stonybrook.edu ","9":" Want to receive a daily news briefing, including this weekend edition, in your inbox every day?

But the future may be less cheerful.Globalization and European integration have been kind to English law, which over the decades has bound together financial systems across the EU and drawn talent, money and energy into the City of London.There\u2019s a risk now of the reverse happening, as global banks prepare to move thousands of staff and 800 billion pounds ($1 trillion) of assets to the continent because of Britain\u2019s looming departure from the EU. The next post-Brexit target for rival finance hubs like Paris and Dublin will be Britain\u2019s multi-billion-pound legal industry, and the windfall for jobs and tax revenues that it offers.While there have always been local alternatives to using English law in the financial sector, some markets are almost wholly dominated by London. Take the 660 trillion-euro ($742 trillion)\u00a0European derivatives market, where the City\u2019s primacy as a legal jurisdiction has been unchallenged. The British capital offers the flexibility of English common law, the predictability of using precedent rather than codified statutes and \u2013 as an EU member \u2013 the automatic Europe-wide enforcement of legal rulings. A contract\u00a0dispute over a derivative between a German investment bank and an Italian client will, for example, often end up in an English court.Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will remove\u00a0one of those key advantages for London, and other cities are seizing\u00a0on this. Last year, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association,\u00a0a global standard-setting body, published new French and Irish law versions of its \u201cmaster agreement,\u201d which is used to govern over-the-counter derivatives.If English law becomes \u201cthird-country law\u201d after Brexit, English court decisions would no longer be automatically recognized and enforced across the EU and counter-parties would lose out on certain bankruptcy protections, according to the ISDA. This isn\u2019t quite as urgent as the banks\u2019 imminent loss of their EU financial passports. But it\u2019s still a potential hassle for finance firms and their clients, and a risk.Paris and Dublin have wasted little time in trying to capture ground here. France\u2019s top asset-management association, AFG, lent its official support to the French master agreement in January. Paris has also opened a new appeals court to hear disputes in English and to use\u00a0English practices, a clear nod to those who want to keep doing business the old way. It\u2019s also cheaper to file a case there. The Irish government, meanwhile, is pitching Dublin to firms who prefer common law to French civil law. Cautious U.K. lawyers worried about losing access to business have rushed to join the Irish Roll of Solicitors, according to reports.None of this will matter if clients don\u2019t follow. But they do seem to be voting with their feet. Paris lawyer Laurent Vincent, at Gide Loyrette Nouel, says that the French contract is seen as a useful tool by big corporate clients and banks as part of their contingency planning ahead of Brexit. Judith Lawless, a partner at McCann FitzGerald in Dublin, says she has seen \u201csignificant\u201d client interest at her firm for the Irish version of the contracts. Capital-markets traders say investors are asking for local law over English law.As with all things Brexit, there\u2019s plenty of skepticism from within the City that legal alternatives to London will ever really take off. Allen & Overy, headquartered in London, and New York\u2019s Shearman & Sterling argue that any post-Brexit effects will be technical and easily resolved in most cases. Marc Benzler, a partner at Clifford Chance, says it may take 10-15 years to really see whether EU counter-parties change their habits to shift enforcement to their own backyards.Still, it\u2019s a bet worth making for Paris and Dublin. Chipping away at London\u2019s financial and jurisdictional primacy will be a long game.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Those issues are dominating the National People\u2019s Congress, an annual gathering of the country\u2019s most powerful officials that continued Thursday in Beijing.Here are the latest developments from China\u2019s biggest meeting of the year. (Time-stamps are local time in Beijing.)5G is Chinese tech company Xiaomi Corp.\u2019s development priority, its chairman Lei Jun says on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. The 5G network will become a driver of the country\u2019s economic growth, he adds. The phone will be offered in May or June.His comments come as stock speculators catch on to China\u2019s 5G firms, with the optimism bolstering Xiaomi and ZTE Corp. The thinking is that firms tied to next-generation wireless technology are about to get a windfall as carriers put money into infrastructure upgrades, and as the government plans to expand e-payment usage in rural areas -- a move that will require greater web coverage and smartphones.The cuts will top the country\u2019s fiscal policy priority list in the coming year and may be higher than the proposed amount of 2 trillion yuan ($298 billion) announced this week, Finance Minister Liu Kun says at a press conference. The tax cuts will focus on manufacturers and small businesses as China works to ease the tax burden across all sectors, he says.Liu admits it\u2019s \u201cvery challenging\u201d to keep the balance between revenue and expenditure as economic growth and inflation weaken. The tax and fee cuts announced this week in Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s work report to the NPC are up from 1 trillion in 2018, and include a cut of 3 percentage points to the top bracket of VAT that aims to benefit China\u2019s manufacturing sector.A twitter user who scanned photos of delegates to China\u2019s annual \u201cTwo Sessions\" political meetings and then used facial recognition software to identify them in TV footage has deleted all tweets on their account.I will be deleting all of my tweets and will no longer be tweeting or responding to DMs. All of my tweets were entirely based on my personal analysis using publicly available data, and did not involve other individuals. It is not my intention to subvert state or Party authority.The account had previously tweeted an analysis of what it said was plagiarism by senior Chinese government officials, similar to allegations made in a recent Financial Times story. A previous tweet compared the mentions of President Xi Jinping on the front page of the People\u2019s Daily with former leaders like Jiang Zemin or Hu Jintao.The account was followed by many journalists and other China-watchers, who replied to the final post with messages of concern and gratitude.Delegates pose for photographs in front of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act is a serious interference in China\u2019s internal affairs and disregards the facts, the Communist Party\u2019s Tibet chief Wu Yingjie says on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. \u201cWe have more U.S. visitors coming in recent years,\u201d he says.Chinese government officials responsible for restricting access to Tibet by foreign journalists, diplomats, and others are ineligible for visas to enter the U.S. under the bill. \u201cIf the U.S. adopts a discriminatory visa policy against Chinese officials, that would violate the basic norms of international relations,\u201d Wu says.Wu says Tibet\u2019s travel policies are made \u201cbased on weather and geological conditions and applicable to visitors from all foreign countries,\u201d and aren\u2019t targeting America.The positivity emerging from trade discussions between China and the U.S. is raising market confidence, says Cosco Shipping Holdings chairman Xu Lirong on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. The trade dispute impacted the company in 2018 as container rates and volume moderated amid pessimism over the tensions, he says. He calls the current situation good.But China\u2019s concessions aren\u2019t likely to be very big, as Beijing has done a lot of things the U.S. has said it should be doing, China\u2019s ex-finance minister Lou Jiwei says at the NPC. Lou, the current chairman of the National Council for Social Security Funds, calls the U.S. demands unreasonable and nitpicky and adds that imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods hurts Washington as well.Lou says China has never used currency to create a trade advantage. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said last month that it won\u2019t use foreign exchange as a \u201ctool\u201d in the trade dispute and that it hoped the U.S. could respect market rules.Shenhua Ningxia Coal Industry Group, a unit of China Energy Investment, is going to keep coal production at last year\u2019s level, the company\u2019s chairman Shao Junjie says on the NPC\u2019s sidelines. China\u2019s coal price is expected to remain relatively steady, he said.Coal prices could remain capped by abundant supply and as the country makes a longer-term shift toward cleaner energy, says Bloomberg Intelligence. The country\u2019s coal consumption may rise this year, China Energy Investment General Manager Ling Wen said Tuesday.While the U.S. and China have made substantial progress in their negotiations, work remains to be done, National Development and Reform Commission Vice Chairman Ning Jizhe says on the sidelines of an NPC briefing. Ning, a member of the Chinese delegation to the talks, also says Beijing is willing to meet the U.S. halfway.

As things stand now, Euronext has secured the backing of shareholders representing just over half Oslo Bors\u2019s stock, while Nasdaq has holders with about a third of the shares behind its offer.Oslo Bors directors were caught unawares on Christmas Eve -- a public holiday in Norway -- when Euronext announced it had won an auction held by an investment bank. Oslo Bors shareholders owning 25 percent of the company had hired the bank, Sweden\u2019s Carnegie, to find a bidder willing to take over the whole firm.Sneaky Tactics Can Win an M&A Battle, Not the War: Chris HughesBy the start of the year, Euronext, which operates stock exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam, had secured the support of 50.5 percent of Oslo Bors shareholders through a mixture of irrevocable commitments from shareholders and direct purchases of shares. Publishing its offer document on Feb. 4, Nasdaq revealed that it had control of 35.2 percent of Oslo Bors.Stephane Boujnah, the CEO of Euronext, said the firm is open to the idea of not being the sole owner of Oslo Bors. At a press conference on Monday, he said he was \u201chappy\u201d to discuss a model in which DNB and KLP could stay on as minority owners.Euronext is extending its offer period by four weeks to March 11. It also said it sees Oslo as a platform from which to expand its presence in the Nordic region. For its part, Nasdaq has argued that its dominance in the Nordic markets -- where it already operates exchanges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland -- make it a more natural fit for Oslo Bors.The rival bids will be assessed by Norway\u2019s markets regulator and, ultimately, the country\u2019s finance ministry, a process that could take months.The two bidders are in many ways similar companies. Both have a track record of successively running stock exchanges in multiple countries, yet neither have developed a derivatives market large enough to challenge European heavyweights London Stock Exchange Group Plc or Deutsche Boerse AG. Acquiring Oslo Bors will not change that fact for either company.\u2014 With assistance by Stephen Treloar, and Hanna Hoikkala ","14":" Welcome to the Brussels Edition, Bloomberg\u2019s daily briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union.

Here is a list of actions and proposals made by governments and financial watchdogs across the Nordic countries.Denmark has said it wants to implement some of Europe\u2019s toughest anti-money laundering rules. Since the Danske Bank A\/S scandal erupted last year, the country has raised fines eight-fold and added the prospect of prison sentences to the list of penalties executives may face. The Financial Supervisory Authority has also received additional resources to cope with the burden of handling the Danske case, and the government has signaled more measures will follow.The biggest Nordic economy in 2017 introduced stricter money-laundering legislation, with much higher potential fines, and politicians have said that those rules may be strengthened further in the wake of the latest money-laundering allegations against Swedish banks. On Wednesday, the Financial Supervisory Authority said it will also call for greater cooperation among regulators, and that it will re-allocate resources to step up its capacity.Read More: Swedish FSA to Strengthen International Laundering CooperationMembers of the parliament\u2019s finance committee have called for meetings with the banks and have also met with the FSA to get to the bottom of the scandal. The FSA, meanwhile, has started an investigation into the allegations against Swedbank together with its Estonian counterpart and with the help of the other Baltic FSAs.Finland, where the biggest Nordic lender Nordea Bank Abp is now based, has proposed a law that would allow the police and the tax authority to access citizens\u2019 account information through an electronic database to better investigate dubious transfers. The law, under debate in parliament, includes regulation of virtual currencies. The government\u2019s 2019 budget also allocated additional funds to boosting laundering controls.The Finnish financial regulator said it plans to take a tougher stance on money laundering breaches, implying it may consider fines instead of recommendations in the future. The watchdog also set up an 11-strong task force that allows more FSA inspections and the creation of more detailed risk profiles.Norway last year tightened its money-laundering legislation to include virtual currencies and closer scrutiny of foreign payment providers. The rules were put in place to harmonize with new European Union rules and recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force.\u2014 With assistance by Niklas Magnusson, Jonas O Bergman, and Frances Schwartzkopff ","16":"Top GOP senator\u2019s move hints at preparation for partisan fight. House Democrats say the request could be sent in coming weeks One of the few Republicans with the power to request President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns wants to make sure that if House Democrats are successful in getting them, he wants to see them, too.\u201cIf the House of Representatives gets them, I want the Senate Finance Committee to get them,\u201d the panel\u2019s chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa told reporters Wednesday.Grassley is one of the few members of Congress, as the head of the Senate tax-writing committee, who has the authority to view the returns of any taxpayer, including the president\u2019s. His counterpart in the House, Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is moving toward asking the U.S. Treasury Department to hand over Trump\u2019s tax documents.Neal has declined to give a timetable for when he will submit his request, but Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat, says his \u201cgut feeling\u201d is that the Ways and Means Committee is about two weeks away from sending the formal inquiry to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Grassley\u2019s wish to see any tax documents that Treasury hands over to the Democrats foreshadows preparations on both sides for the partisan battle that would likely ensue if the documents became public.Earlier: Trump Tax-Return\u00a0Battle Begins as Democrats Weigh Political RiskDemocrats say they are demanding Trump\u2019s returns to investigate whether he has complied with tax laws, to examine his business dealings overseas and to figure out who his debtors are. Republicans argue that Democrats are abusing their authority to single out a political foe and invading Trump\u2019s privacy.Presidents are not required to release their tax returns but it has been a voluntary practice of White House candidates for the last 40 years. Trump\u2019s were of particular interest because of questions swirling about the global real estate empire he built before becoming president and the fact that, unlike his predecessors, he did not divest his business holdings when he won the election.Neal has been working on how to craft this request since Democrats regained control of the House in January. Once the request is satisfied -- and it\u2019s not at all certain that Mnuchin will comply -- the Ways and Means Committee could then vote to make Trump\u2019s tax history public.Grassley, who said he\u2019d prefer that no one sought the president\u2019s tax returns, warned that if they do get them, Democrats must keep the documents safe from leaks. They \u201chave to keep them all secure,\u201d he said.Progressive Democrats and outside groups are pressuring Neal to move more quickly.How Trump\u2019s (Private) Tax Returns Could Become Public: QuickTakeIf Mnuchin denies or slow-walks the request, Democrats are likely to sue, which could lead to a protracted legal battle to obtain the documents.House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, on Monday sent demands for information from dozens of people and entities with ties to Trump, including the White House, the Trump Organization and Donald Trump Jr.\u2014 With assistance by Kaustuv Basu, and Allyson Versprille ","17":" Borough Market in London has invoked a\u00a0contingency plan and traders have begun stockpiling produce on concern that the U.K. might leave the European Union without an agreement on March 29. Business in the market has already slowed.\u201cOur traders are really concerned now,\u201d Managing Director Darren Henaghan said in an interview. \u201cThey are good people, but they are scared. We now have everyone from our florist storing flowers through to bakers storing flour and just about everyone in between.\u201dThe market drafted its contingency plan about six months ago and the steering group swung into action last month, Henaghan said. Among other measures, Borough has set aside extra storage space and has identified a site in northern France that could become a logistics hub for small traders to consolidate their orders into a container to smooth entry through U.K. ports.But the market, which can attract\u00a0thousands of\u00a0people on a Saturday, is already feeling the effects of Brexit.\u201cFebruary and March have been tricky,\u201d he said. \u201cTrade in January\u00a0was good, but it\u2019s been lower than expected since then.And we\u2019ve got traders delaying investment decisions. That\u2019s much more universal than we thought it would ever be. It is concerning and if the exit process were to be extended for another two months, that would just mean more delays.\u201dThere has been a market on the site, just south of the Thames river,\u00a0for more than 1,000 years. Henaghan said it now attracts about 15 million visitors a year, and more than 100 languages are spoken across the floor.Ewa Weremij of Emilia Ltd., who sources produce from small farms in northern Italy for her Bianca Mora stall, is worried. She stocks 30 to 40 varieties of cheese, including three different kinds of Parmesan, as well as 20 varieties\u00a0of charcuterie.\u201cWe have been here nine years, and we are a little bit scared because we already lost so much in the change of pound and euro,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t increase the price for now, but we have to look what is going to happen.\u201d\u201cIt is astonishing that so many of the traders have some sort of relationship with Europe,\u201d Henaghan said. \u201cEven somebody who farms beef in the (English) Midlands. They use chemicals, animal-welfare products, that come from Bayer in Germany; they have tractor parts that come from Italy.\u201cOthers get their van and they drive down to southern Italy and they go round all those wonderful places and buy a little bit of this, a little bit of that and bring it back to the market and share it with me and you.\u00a0That is going to be very, very difficult to do.\u201dFrench-born Sophie Bertucat, from St. Malo, who manages the Borough outlet of her brother\u2019s\u00a0Olivier\u2019s Bakery, said\u00a0Brexit may mean the business will have to avoid using French flour and switch entirely to British.\u201cFor me, especially France, we have always been very close together so I don\u2019t want to think about what is going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout the business, most of our products are coming from England, most of the flour, all the fresh ingredients we use are coming from here. There is only the French flour that we use for the pastries, the butter. If it becomes too expensive, we\u2019ll switch to British.\u201dAt the nearby\u00a0Turkish Deli, owner Graham Teale said\u00a0Brexit might be beneficial for him long-term if it allows him to bring in Turkish olive oil without EU tariffs. But short-term, he\u00a0is concerned about the\u00a025 varieties of traditionally cured, unmarinated olives\u00a0and other produce that he imports. It comes on a truck through Bulgaria and reaches the U.K. via the French port of Marseille.\u00a0\u201cThe only preparation is speaking to my trucking company,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll make sure I bring some (produce) in before March 29.\u201dExporters are concerned, too. David Lockwood is managing director of Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy, which specializes in British and Irish cheeses. American-born Lockwood\u00a0said about 35 percent of the business is for export, and about 65 percent of that to the U.S.\u201cAll our goods going to the U.S. run through Rungis, the big market in Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get consolidated onto containers there and it is massive the amount of change that it will entail should we need to abandon that route. That said, we\u2019ve done a lot of work and we can export from the U.K.\u201cWe are setting everything up to ensure that we\u2019ve got as many bases covered as possible but that is just the external stuff. Internally, we have our staffing\u2013we\u2019ve got a lot of EU citizens.\u00a0We\u2019re willing as a business to pay for their registration. But we\u2019re seeing it in our applications, our job apps. We are not getting the same kind of response from people from the Continent that we were.\u201cIn terms of a future threat that concerns us, both from a retail and a wholesale perspective, it\u2019s what is going to happen to the London economy over time. Is the finance sector going to scale back from London and move to Dublin or Frankfurt or wherever? How is that going to affect us? I\u2019m not really sure how we hedge against that but it\u2019s something that we are aware of.\u201dRichard Vines is the chief food critic at Bloomberg.

","18":"Paul Krugman, Jerome Powell weigh in as politicians ponder it. Proposals include zero interest rates, public job guarantee It\u2019s becoming hard to avoid. Everyone from Nobel laureate Paul Krugman to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has been compelled recently to weigh in on Modern Monetary Theory, an alternative approach to economics at odds with the principles that have guided most Western policy makers for decades.Interest in the theory is exploding in tandem with the U.S. budget deficit, after President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts for top earners and businesses. Instead of promising to repair America\u2019s public finances, many 2020 challengers on the Democratic side are running on big programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare For All that could further widen the gap between government spending and revenues.MMT\u2019s ideas about government finance and the space for fiscal spending offer a route to achieve those goals, and politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders are catching on. Economists including Krugman and Lawrence Summers as well as policy makers like Powell are pushing back.(You\u2019re reading Bloomberg\u2019s weekly economic research roundup.)The debate in the U.S. right now centers on the question of whether there\u2019s room for more public spending, with the MMTers arguing that governments -- misled by conventional economic thinking -- have become too fiscally conservative. The work of leading MMT scholars, published in academic journals since the 1990s, shows some of the roots of that argument. It also reveals the school\u2019s vision of a dramatic departure from the way economic policy works now, especially in key areas like managing employment and inflation.Here are some of the most important papers that offer insight into what MMT is all about:Modern Money (Wray, 1998)MMT\u2019s policy prescriptions largely stem from the idea that money\u2019s value is derived from the fact that it\u2019s needed in order to pay taxes. If a government can tax citizens, it creates demand for whatever currency the obligation is paid in. That allows a government to print its own money and purchase goods and services from households and companies -- knowing the sellers will have a reason to accept it. In other words, the government spends money into the economy first and then taxes some of it back later, instead of the other way around.L. Randall Wray\u2019s paper draws on the writings of 20th-century economists Friedrich Knapp and John Maynard Keynes to illustrate the historical roots of the theory. He connects it to the work of Abba Lerner, a Russian-born U.K. economist of the mid-20th century. Lerner\u2019s doctrine of \u201cfunctional finance\u201d argued that governments should pursue their real-economy goals and treat the resulting budget balance as a residual outcome -- instead of subordinating those goals to the quest for a balanced budget. (Many MMTers argue that President Donald Trump is currently doing something very similar.)The Natural Rate of Interest Is Zero (Forstater and Mosler, 2005)Central bankers around the world are obsessed with estimating the so-called natural rate of interest, which in mainstream economic theory serves to bring the desired levels of savings and investment into balance. The rate is now held by mainstream economists to be largely a function of demographics and productivity, and Fed officials believe that for the U.S. it\u2019s currently somewhere between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.Mathew Forstater and Warren Mosler use MMT\u2019s idea about the source of money\u2019s value to argue that the concept of a natural rate hasn\u2019t been relevant in major economies since they moved to a floating exchange-rate system in the 1970s. The \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d rate is now zero, in the sense that central bankers have to take specific actions to prevent it from settling there, and keeping it above zero is \u201cnecessarily a political decision\u201d on their part.Public Service Employment: A Path to Full Employment (Wray, Dantas, Fullwiler, Tcherneva and Kelton, 2018)MMT economists have long supported a jobs guarantee. They draw inspiration from American economist Hyman Minsky, who said the government can serve as the employer of last resort, and from the public works programs of the New Deal.The MMT argument is that the jobs guarantee isn\u2019t just a welfare measure: It\u2019s also a key stabilizer of the economy, which will set a floor on wages and shore up demand during recessions. They argue that it\u2019s better to use employment as a buffer than unemployment -- their description of the current approach, in which the Fed sets interest rates based on the idea that if the jobless rate gets too low then the result will be high inflation.Even if the government paid 15 million people to participate in such a work program, \u201cthe impact on inflation would be macroeconomically insignificant,\u201d the economists estimated in this 2018 study. ","19":"France presents internet tax after EU doesn\u2019t reach unaminity. Le Maire says French measure to raise EU450m in first year The European Union\u2019s inability to agree on taxing Internet giants like Google and Amazon shows the need for majority voting at the soon-to-be 27-member bloc, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.\u201cFinland, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden shouldn\u2019t be allowed to block 23 countries from imposing a tax that they think is needed and just,\u201d Le Maire said at a press conference in Paris as he presented a French tax that would apply to about 30 Internet giants like Facebook Inc. and could raise 450 million euros ($509 million) in its first year.Bruno Le Maire on March 6.France\u2019s tax, which Le Maire called, \u201csimple, targeted, and efficient,\u201d is a temporary measure while the EU and The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development seek agreement on how to better tax Internet companies that play off tax rules by booking revenue in countries that aren\u2019t necessarily where they actually make their money.\u201cThese giants have created much value and they have created many jobs, and I will never denounce their success,\u201d Le Maire said. \u201cBut we must fight against the distortions that these giants have created, especially on tax optimizations and on the dominant positions many have created. We must create taxation for the 21st century.\u201dThe bill including the tax will be approved at today\u2019s cabinet meeting and then presented to parliament in early April.Le Maire said 23 of the EU\u2019s 28 members favor some sort of Internet tax, though the tax that Germany has agreed to support has a narrower base than that being unilaterally rolled out in France.The levy of 3 percent of French sales starts retroactively from Jan. 1 and potentially could raise 650 million euros annually by 2022. The tax applies to any Internet company with global revenue above 750 million euros and French sales above 25 million euros, and covers locally targeted advertising, data sales, and marketplace.The tax excludes direct sales of goods and services, messaging and payment platforms, and financial services. Le Maire gave the example of Amazon.com Inc., which wouldn\u2019t be taxed on its direct sales but would be taxed for linking outside vendors with clients. ","20":"Opposition party calls wealth fund\u2019s partial exit \u2018first step\u2019. Divestment expansion likely after 2021 election: economist The oil majors are safe from divestments from the world\u2019s largest wealth fund -- for now.Plans presented last week by the Norwegian government to get the fund out of smaller oil and gas explorers were broadly welcomed by the country\u2019s politicians, but are also being seized upon as an opening to further pressure oil majors such Royal Dutch Shell Plc.One opposition party called it a mere \u201cfirst step\u201d that will raise the pressure to accelerate spending on renewable energy, or face possible divestment.These are the 10 largest shareholdings affected by Norway&apos;s decisionSource: Norges Bank\u201cWe are showing we\u2019re serious about divesting,\u201d said Kari Elisabeth Kaski, a member of Parliament for the Socialist Left Party who sits on the Finance Committee. \u201cWe need to keep working to tighten and follow up on this.\u201dThe Conservative-led government on Friday decided on much narrower divestments than the fund itself proposed as a way to reduce the petroleum-producing country\u2019s overall exposure to oil prices. The fund will sell about $7.5 billion of stocks in companies involved solely in exploration and production, sparing huge energy groups such as Shell and Total SA.The government argued that these companies are now raising investments in renewable energy and that it would be a shame if the wealth fund missed out on this.Read more about Norway\u2019s partial divestmentThe government holds a majority in parliament, meaning it can push through its proposal.Kaski said her party plans to introduce amendments setting expectations for integrated companies\u2019 investments in renewables, but doesn\u2019t have high hopes of seeing them adopted.But Norway\u2019s political balance could shift after the next general election in 2021. The opposition Labor Party, already the country\u2019s biggest political group and likely to lead any new government, had supported the fund\u2019s full divestment from oil and gas.Labor lawmaker Svein Roald Hansen said on Friday he didn\u2019t wish to \u201canticipate\u201d any future changes, but that he couldn\u2019t \u201cexclude\u201d them. He wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment on Monday.Knut Anton Mork, an economics professor who had backed the fund\u2019s full-divestment proposal, said the government\u2019s initial step was likely to be deepened as soon as the next parliamentary term.\u201cCritics would probably say that Pandora\u2019s box has been opened,\u201d he said by phone on Tuesday. \u201cThe discussions will go on, just like we\u2019ve discussed ethical investment overall for a long time.\u201dThe Christian Democrats, a junior member of the government and early backer of divestment, said setting exact requirements for oil companies\u2019 energy mix would be a breach of the fund\u2019s current management model. Yet legislator Tore Storehaug also said the big integrated companies would be \u201cwise\u201d to take note of how Norway is trying to diversify its wealth.The government\u2019s insistence that divestment is solely a matter of managing financial risk is even being challenged from within: Climate and Environment Minister Ola Elvestuen, a member of the Liberal Party, on Friday hailed the divestment plan as the \u201cmost important climate decision\u201d the four-party coalition had agreed on.For its part, the Conservative Party repeated past warnings that the fund shouldn\u2019t be used as a political tool.\u201cIt\u2019s an investment fund,\u201d said lawmaker Henrik Asheim, who chairs the Finance Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this only out of risk considerations, not to contribute to more renewable energy. We can do that in other ways.\u201d ","21":"Megawati, only female president, remains biggest power center. Suharto\u2019s daughters seeking a comeback into political arena Indonesian voters have yet to directly elect a female president, but more high-profile women than ever are leading parties and running for office as the political ground shifts in the world\u2019s third-largest democracy.Megawati Soekarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia\u2019s founder, chief of the country\u2019s largest political party and former president (she was appointed), remains the most influential politician.

There\u2019s also two of former dictator Suharto\u2019s daughters and the daughter of former president Abdurrahman Wahid wielding considerable political clout in the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation.While incumbent Widodo is pitching for better representation of women in politics -- he has eight females in his cabinet holding important ministries such as a finance and foreign -- his challenger Prabowo Subianto says he believes more in output than tokenism. With women marginally outnumbering men among the country\u2019s total 193 million voters, they have a chance to determine who gets to rule Indonesia for the next five years.While Megawati is the only woman to have contested the Indonesian presidential polls since direct elections were introduced in 2004, there are several women who could make a future bid. Here\u2019s a look at the most influential female politicians in Indonesia.At 72, Megawati, may be too old for taking another shot at the top job. She became Indonesia\u2019s only female president after Wahid, known as Gus Dur, was impeached by the parliament for incompetence. But as the founder of ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, she decides who gets to become the party\u2019s nominees for important posts such as governor, regents and mayors.Puan Maharani, right, and Megawati Soekarnoputri.She contested the elections in 2004 and 2009 and lost to Susilo Bambang Yudhyono on both the occasions. Her daughter Puan Maharani is a senior member of Jokowi cabinet. Megawati remains a champion of women\u2019s causes and wants to see more females step up to important political jobs.\u201cWhy don\u2019t Indonesian women want to be like me? Not to brag about myself, but up until now, I\u2019m the only president of Indonesia who is a female,\u201d she said at her birthday bash in late January, Kompas news portal reported.Nicknamed Titiek, Hariyadi is one of Suharto\u2019s six children and the ex-wife of Prabowo. She quit Golkar, a party founded by her father, ahead of the presidential poll to join the Berkarya Party that was formed by her brother Hutomo Mandala Putra, known as Tommy Suharto.The siblings\u2019 coming together with Berkarya Party is seen by many analysts as the return of the Suharto dynasty into political arena after lying low since their father was toppled from power in 1998. Titiek, 58, is supporting Prabowo.Siti Hediati Hariyadi, left, and brother Tommy Suharto.Natalie, a former popular news anchor, quit her profession and founded a party for the country\u2019s millennials. The 36-year-old s the only commoner among the grand dames of Indonesian politics and is already raising some uncomfortable questions about the nation\u2019s political customs and practice.Natalie, who co-founded the Indonesian Solidarity Party with four of her colleagues, offers an antithesis to conventional politics for more than 80 million millennial voters. Her party is focused on issues important to women and youth, such as education and lowering income tax for millennials, in its bid to become a national political force.The party has turned heads with its demands for an end to polygamy and an amendment to draconian blasphemy laws. It\u2019s also started conferring \u2018lie awards\u2019 to politicians making hollow or misguided statements as a way to ensure more accountability among politicians. Natalie\u2019s party is backing Jokowi.The daughter of Gus Dur, Wahid is former director of Wahid Institute and a political force as the heir of the founding family of Nahdatul Ulama, the world\u2019s largest Muslim organization. A former journalist with a masters from Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, Wahid wields considerable clout among the members of Nahdatul Ulama, which also controls the National Awakening Party.Yenny WahidWhile politicians across parties revere the Gus Dur family, Wahid threw her support behind Jokowi\u2019s bid for a second term, saying a leader must be modest and be able to meet people\u2019s basic needs.Saraswati is the latest entrant to the long line of political inheritors. The daughter of oil and gas tycoon Hashim Djojohadikusumo, she\u2019s the deputy chief of Prabowo\u2019s Gerindra party with and holds responsibility for its women\u2019s wing. She\u2019s Prabowo\u2019s niece.A Chinese-Christian, Saraswati doesn\u2019t believe a greater number of women in top positions would guarantee gender issues will be addressed in conservative Indonesia. The effort must go beyond that. \u201cI will instill gender perspective in as many men as possible,\u201d the 33-year-old said in an interview.Jokowi has women heading some of the most important ministries in his government. While they\u2019re not politicians, they have come to symbolize the rise of women in Indonesia\u2019s public life.Sri Mulyani IndrawatiFinance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati is a former economist and managing director at the World Bank and is one of the most prominent faces of Jokowi\u2019s cabinet. Retno Marsudi, the first female foreign minister, is a career diplomat and Fisheries and Maritime Minister Susi Pudjiastuti is a successful businesswoman credited with turning the fortunes of the marine industry and curbing illegal fishing.

Stephen Kinnock says Labour splintering is now unavoidable Jeremy CorbynA small group of Labour politicians could quit the party as soon as Monday, over deep divisions with the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn on issues including Brexit.Speculation of a break-away intensified on Monday when it emerged that some Labour members of Parliament will be holding a joint event on the future of British politics in London.Chuka UmunnaPoliticians touted in the media as being on the verge of quitting the party include Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, and Luciana Berger. Backbench lawmaker Stephen Kinnock said on BBC Radio late Saturday a Labour split was almost inevitable.\u201cThe talk has been going on so long that I say with great regret that yes, there probably will be some kind of splintering,\u201d said Kinnock, whose father was leader of the Labour Party in the 1980s and 1990s. \u201cIt just seems to have been in the rumor mill so long that it\u2019s unlikely that wouldn\u2019t be the outcome.\u201dWith just over a month to go before Britain leaves the European Union, the U.K.\u2019s two biggest political parties have been struggling to retain unity.Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives are divided, with a pro-Brexit caucus refusing to back her deal with Brussels until it\u2019s overhauled. In the Labour Party, pro-EU lawmakers are dismayed at leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unwillingness to push for a second referendum.Tensions over Europe have triggered a split in Labour before. In 1981, four moderate party members, including two parliamentarians, broke away to form the Social Democratic Party because they felt Labour had been seized by the militant left. The party had just committed to a withdrawal from the EU\u2019s predecessor, the European Economic Community. It scarred the party, and its memory had helped keep Labour together on Brexit.In a further sign of the tensions in Labour, Sky News said deputy leader Tom Watson had pulled out of a scheduled interview this morning.\u201cI don\u2019t see any need for anybody to split from the party,\u201d Labour\u2019s finance spokesman, John McDonnell, told the BBC on Sunday. The party was keeping the option of a second referendum on the table, he said, adding that politicians who left the party now risked handing an inevitable victory to the Conservatives in future elections.\u201cI don\u2019t think any of the people who have even been mentioned around this split would want that,\" he said.

Asset manager says it tightened controls following scandal A waiter serves customers on the outdoor terrace of a traditional pastry shop, also known as a pastelaria suica, in Rossio square\u00a0in Lisbon, Portugal.GAM Holding AG found that employees have breached its gift policy in the wake of a scandal that led to the dismissal of star bond manager Tim Haywood, a sign that misconduct may have been more widespread than previously disclosed.Sales staff have been asked to log all the hospitality they received for the last three years, according to memos seen by Bloomberg News. U.K.-based employees in sales & distribution were told to go through their diaries to identify any coffees, breakfasts, lunches and dinners they received since the beginning of 2016.Tim Haywood\"It has become apparent that people are not following the company\u2019s policies in relation to gifts and entertainment, which means individuals are breaching protocol,\" according to one memo from October.A spokesman for GAM said the company does not comment on internal processes.Among the charges leveled against Haywood last year was that he breached the company\u2019s gifts and entertainment policy and circumvented a rule that requires two signatures to make an investment. The episode raised concerns about oversight and saw assets under management at the firm slump by 26.5 billion francs last year. Haywood was dismissed last month for gross misconduct and has said he plans to appeal.The huge task of retroactively logging meetings held in previous years shows the lengths to which GAM is going to move past a scandal that caused it to liquidate a strategy with around $7 billion in assets. In a separate memo by Tim Rainsford, the company\u2019s head of sales and distribution from November 2018, GAM said it had arranged for two data entry personnel \"to be engaged to sit with the finance team and input all historic expense reimbursements.\"In the aftermath of the liquidation, GAM said it had strengthened its policies and procedures, such as training on conflicts of interest including gifts and entertainment, and boosting its two-signatory policy for investments.Consequences of infringing the company\u2019s gifts policy are forfeiture of the gift to charity, disciplinary action including potential dismissal for gross misconduct, or legal action. ","24":"Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Kushner Cos. have been in loan talks. Debt would fund $1.15 billion Maryland, Virginia apartments Kushner Cos., the real estate firm owned by the family of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, has sought financing from federally-owned lenders for its biggest purchase in a decade.The company has been in talks with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about a loan for a $1.15 billion purchase of apartments in Maryland and Virginia, according to two people familiar with the discussions, who asked not to be named discussing a private transaction.Such a deal would increase Kushner Cos.\u2019 exposure to government-backed mortgages at the same time its former chief executive officer is one of the most powerful people in the White House. Jared Kushner divested ownership in many of the company\u2019s assets to close family members when he joined the government. Kushner Cos. had more than $500 million in loans from Fannie and Freddie at that time. Government-backed financing on this latest deal could more than double that figure.Spokesmen for both Fannie and Freddie said they had no information to share. Peter Mirijanian, a spokesperson for Jared Kushner\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell, said that Kushner has no involvement in the company\u2019s management. \u201cAs part of an ethics agreement he has and has followed, Mr. Kushner has had no role in the Kushner Companies or its activities since joining the government over two years ago,\u201d Mirijanian said. \u201cHe is walled off from any business or investment decisions and has no idea or knowledge of these activities.\"Laurent Morali, Kushner Cos.\u2019 president, Emily Wolf, the company\u2019s general counsel, and Karen Zabarsky, a company spokeswoman, didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment. President Trump appointed Joseph Otting to oversee the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie. Otting previously served as CEO of OneWest Bank, founded by now-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, an ally of Kushner\u2019s in the West Wing.Kushner Cos.\u2019 latest deal is for 6,030 apartments across 16 properties in Maryland and Virginia from private equity firm Lone Star Funds, according to a representative for Michael Campbell of the Carlton Group, a real estate investment bank which is helping to arrange financing for the deal.Both lenders discussed funding the acquisition last year, according to people familiar with the matter. Even lenders that aren\u2019t owned by the government have fretted about exposure to the White House. Executives at Deutsche Bank, the largest of the Trump Organization\u2019s lenders, considered extending the terms of loans issued to the president\u2019s company, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.Deutsche Bank Weighed Extending Trump Loans on Default RiskOfficials at the German bank feared a public-relations nightmare would ensue if ever they found themselves in the position of having to collect on a sitting president. Government ethicists have raised similar concerns about Kushner Cos. and the federal agencies, for fear of the complications that could arise from refinancing or foreclosure scenarios.The purchase from Lone Star is the latest sign that Kushner Cos. is returning to its roots as an owner of suburban properties. It sold almost $2 billion of apartments in 2007 to help finance the purchase of 666 Fifth Ave. The company set a record with the $1.8 billion purchase of the 41-story Manhattan office tower, which was then plagued by outsized debt payments for more than a decade.Kushner Cos. reached a deal to sell a 99-year lease on 666 Fifth to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. last year, and has been pivoting back to the sprawling multifamily complexes that Charlie Kushner, Jared\u2019s father, built his fortune on.In 2017, Kushner Cos. teamed up with Israel-based Psagot Investment House to buy Quail Ridge, a 1,032-unit complex in Plainsboro, New Jersey, that the Kushner family had owned until a 2007 sale. This past April, the firm bought the 360-unit Prospect Place in Hackensack, New Jersey.\u2014 With assistance by Patrick Clark, and Shahien Nasiripour ","25":" The Castoro 10 pipelay vessel lpipe for Nord Stream 2 om the Baltic Sea.Germany is preparing one of its biggest sustained increases in natural gas consumption in almost two decades, regardless of U.S. admonitions that it shouldn\u2019t draw so much of its energy from Russia.Gas will be one of the main\u00a0beneficiaries\u00a0from Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s effort to close coal and nuclear plants, which generate half of the nation\u2019s electricity. While the government is seeking to spur renewables, industry executives, energy forecasters and investors say that more gas will be needed to balance the grid when power flows ebb from wind and solar farms.That outlook helps explain why Merkel is allowing construction of the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia and encouraging new facilities to import liquefied natural gas. In the years ahead, Germany may need much more gas to make up for closing power stations if it falters in its 500 billion-euro ($568 billion) effort to shift toward cleaner fuels.\u201cNatural gas demand has to go up at least in the short term to make up for the loss of coal,\u201d said Trevor Sikorski, head of natural gas, coal and carbon\u00a0at Energy Aspects Ltd., an industry consultant\u00a0in London. \u201cThat is probably why Germany&apos;s government is keen for Nord Stream 2.\u201d\u00a0A number of issues cloud the outlook for how much new gas Germany will need and when. Those include a lack of clarity on which coal plants will close and when, what restraints the government imposes on the spiraling cost renewables and whether Germany can rely on  neighboring nations to make up for temporary shortages on the grid.A further complication is the assessment forecasters are making, including differences in their forecasting horizons. Even so, almost all of them are looking for gas demand in Germany to grow -- some like Energy Aspects see a few percentage points of expansion and others like the import plant promoter German LNG Terminal anticipate demand doubling.\u201cIt is very much moving to the gas-plus-renewables power future that we advocate as opposed to the coal plus renewables situation,\u201d Steve Hill, executive vice president at Shell Energy, said at an event hosted by the unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc in London on Feb. 25.To read a contrary view doubting that Germany\u2019s gas industry will expand, click here.Those forecasts mark a departure from the past two decades, when the solar industry took off and left demand for gas broadly steady. Gas use surged 22 percent in the past three years as atomic sites\u00a0closed in the wake of the 2011 meltdown at the Fukushima plant in Japan. That largely returned flows to the levels prevailing since 2000, making up for a dip earlier in the decade when the economy slowed.Now, Germany is starting to think about additional sources of electricity as it winds down its coal plants to meet its climate commitments under the Paris agreement at the same time as it is shuttering the atomic units. While renewables have been gaining rapidly in recent years and will continue to do so, the grid needs a source of supply that can make up for when wind and solar don\u2019t work.Natural gas is the most obvious choice. It\u00a0burns cleaner than coal and can feed plants that start and stop when grid dispatchers ask.Coal and nuclear plants generate more than half of electricity, though renewables and gas are gaining share.Data for 2018 from Fraunhofer, Destasis, EEX, Tennet, 50Hertz\u201cThere is certainly more room for natural gas,\u201d said Jean-Baptiste Dubreuil, senior natural gas analyst at the International Energy Agency in Paris. \u201cCoal is baseload, and the question now is to what extend that baseload can be replaced by renewables. Where it is not possible, it will be for\u00a0gas to step in.\u201dDrawing more gas risks angering the U.S., which wants Germany along with the rest of Europe to develop alternatives to Russian flows. Russia currently feeds a significant share of Germany\u2019s gas needs and is building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline underneath the Baltic Sea to add to the ways it can bring in supply.The state pipeline champion Gazprom PJSC has been pumping at near record rates into Europe and will bring on that new route as early as the end of this year. Gazprom isn\u2019t the only company gearing up to supply more.Three German towns -- Brunsbuettel, Stade and Wilhelmshaven -- are lobbying hard to win federal support to build  Germany\u2019s first LNG terminal. That would allow countries from Qatar to Algeria and even the U.S. to send ships with the super-chilled fuel to Germany. And tapping LNG to balance the grid raises separate concerns about security.\u201cThe more Europe bets on LNG, the more dangerous its reliance on imports can get,\u201d said Manfred Leitner, executive board member overseeing downstream at the Austrian oil company OMV AG, which is helping finance the Nord Stream 2 link. \u201cLNG is simply the flexibilization of gas in terms of destination, which means more competition among geographical regions. It is more expensive and less reliable than pipeline natural gas.\u201dA number of risks could slow or even halt the gas expansion -- starting with unseasonably warm weather across the northern hemisphere that depressed demand for heating in Asia and Europe this winter. To refine their forecasts, analysts are watching:\u201cThere are quite a few uncertainties with regards to the role of gas in the future energy mix,\u201d said Joanna Fic, analyst at the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s Corp. \u201cGas will have a role to play at least in the medium term. The longer term scenario depends on the evolution of demand, policies regarding the future of gas and technological progress. Some countries are even talking about phasing out gas. There are quite a few unknowns.\u201d\u00a0 Whether more homes shift toward gas and away from electricity for heatingHow quickly electric cars spread, which will have a big impact on power demandGoals that Germany sets for use of renewables, currently envisioning\u00a065 percent of electricity supply by 2030Competition for gas coming from renewables as the cost of wind and solar fallsWhich   coal plants close first, since the most polluting units using lignite also are in economically depressed areas where the government needs voter supportWhether Germany moves to limit gas use either because of pollution or climate concerns","26":" A public-company chief executive officer has two main ways to make money from her job each year:A company could go with all one or the other, and some companies do: A family-owned company\u00a0might hire an outside manager, give her no equity, and pay her purely in cash; a startup founder-CEO might take\u00a0no salary and be motivated solely by her part-ownership of the company. But for most normal public companies, it\u2019s a mix of the two.It is a convention, in discussing public-company executive compensation, to talk exclusively about #1 and ignore #2. The compensation\u00a0package\u2014the amount of stuff the company affirmatively grants her each year for doing her job\u2014counts as \u201cpay\u201d; the amount that her wealth goes up from owning stock in her company usually does not. This is mostly just a convention, a generally accepted way of using words, and it is not universally followed, but\u00a0there are some pretty good reasons for talking this way.\u00a0It roughly tracks how tax law thinks about income\u00a0(getting a check is income; having your stock go up is not). If the CEO\u00a0quit her job, she would still own her stock and would thus still profit from the stock going up (though of course it might not go up as much), so isolating #1 focuses on her income that is purely job-related. And\u00a0if you are interested not in her income but in the company\u2019s expenses\u2014not \u201chow rich is the CEO\u201d but \u201chow much does she cost shareholders\u201d\u2014#1 is a reasonable approximation of that, while #2 is not really an expense at all.But you can\u2019t get carried away and assume that this convention represents the entire truth of the matter, because then you might start thinking things like \u201cwait, Warren Buffett only makes $100,000 a year for running Berkshire Hathaway Inc.? He\u2019s so good at stock-picking; I should offer him $125,000 and have him come work for me.\u201d (Or: \u201cMark Zuckerberg only makes $1 a year for running Facebook Inc.? I should offer him $3 to stop.\u201d) No, come on, these people have vast amounts of wealth tied to the performance of their companies; Warren Buffett gets, in effect, a base salary of $100,000 and a bonus of 17 percent of the value he creates for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. In good years, that comes to\u00a0billions of dollars: Berkshire was up 23 percent in 2016, handily beating the S&P 500, and Buffett\u00a0personally got about $14 billion richer. In mediocre years, it \u2026\u00a0also comes to billions of dollars: Berkshire was up 2.8 percent in 2018 (also handily beating the market, to be fair), and Buffett\u2019s take came to more than $2.3 billion. That is not formally part of his pay package, but it is surely part\u2014virtually all\u2014of the economic reward\u00a0that he receives for doing his job each day.I feel like we don\u2019t quite have a convention for how to talk about hedge-fund-manager pay, but to the extent we do, it\u2019s the opposite of the public-company convention: Every dollar of increased wealth that a hedge fund manager gets from her hedge fund, whether it\u2019s a fee paid by investors or returns on her own investment in the hedge fund, tends to be discussed as \u201cpay.\u201d There is nothing particularly wrong with this convention either! Again, it is just a question of how you use words, and there are good arguments for talking this way too. For instance, if you want to answer questions like \u201chow many world-historically  expensive  homes\u00a0can Ken Griffin buy,\u201d focusing solely on his fee income, rather than his investment income, would be a mistake. It\u2019s all money. More broadly, if the question that you want to answer is \u201cwho is really good at running a hedge fund,\u201d a quite plausible scoring mechanism would be to rank managers based on how much money they have made\u2014both as a manager and as an investor\u2014from their hedge funds. High investment returns mean that you are good at investing; high fee income means that you are good at gathering assets and extracting fees from them; those are the main skills, so why not add them together to get your score?But, again, you can\u2019t get carried away. If you are counting the manager\u2019s own investment returns as part of her income, which is perfectly reasonable and relevant, you can\u2019t also\u00a0pretend that the number you get is all fees. And so every year Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha publishes a list of the world\u2019s \u201cbest-paid\u201d hedge fund managers, and every year Alpha quite prominently explains that it is counting both fee income and investment returns, and every year people publish commentary on the list saying essentially \u201cI can\u2019t believe all of these hedge-fund managers got paid so many millions of dollars of fees despite not beating the market, what a grift,\u201d and every\u00a0year\u00a0I  publish a  post saying, well, wait, actually, the income seems to be mostly investment\u00a0returns on the managers\u2019 own portion of the fund, meaning that it\u2019s not fee income at all, and then we all agree to meet up next year and have the same conversation again.Today Bloomberg  published its first ranking of hedge-fund-manager earnings. It too ranks managers based on total earnings, combining fees and investment returns; again, I think this is perfectly sensible, depending on what you want to measure. Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies tops the list for 2018, making $1.6 billion in \u201ctotal hedge fund income.\u201d\n            \n\n                1\n            \n        \u00a0Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, Ken Griffin of Citadel, and John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma round out the top 5.\u00a0But Bloomberg also disaggregates the numbers:To compile the ranking, Bloomberg broke out \u201ctotal income\u201d figures to show estimates of dividend income and return on personal assets. Dividend income is our calculation of the share of performance fees that the manager takes home as owner of the hedge fund. Return on personal assets is our estimate of how much managers earned on their own cash invested in their funds.(It does not count  management fees, assuming I suppose that those are mostly spent on staff and expenses.) And there\u2019s a little bar chart breaking down the splits. Most of the top 10 made the majority of their 2018 earnings\u00a0from investment returns, though fees were usually a substantial contributor. Not always:\u00a0\u201cMichael Platt of Bluecrest Capital Management returned 25 percent, although hedge fund investors didn\u2019t benefit after he kicked out clients,\u201d and his\u00a0$680 million of earnings is all investment returns.\n            \n\n                2\n            \n        \u00a0But from Bloomberg\u2019s chart, the top five total earners were also the top five fee earners, and in almost\u00a0the same order,\n            \n\n                3\n            \n        \u00a0which is sensible but also a bit boring. Really 2018 was an anomalously straightforward year for hedge funds: The stock market was down, most hedge funds  did poorly, but the hedge funds that did well were disproportionately the big, old,  historically successful ones. If you have run a gigantic hedge fund successfully for a long time, and\u00a0it did well in 2018, then (1) you collected a lot of performance fees on your gigantic pot of assets, and (2) you had a lot of your own money in the fund, and it went up. That\u2019s not how it works every year, but it is kind of how it\u2019s supposed to work.My usual role around here is to tell you about interesting financial things that have happened, or to argue that boring financial things that have happened are actually interesting, or at least to make fun of dumb financial things that have happened. Occasionally though, we indulge in a bit of speculative fiction and talk about how nice it would be if some really interesting financial thing had happened, even though it didn\u2019t. Here is a Vanity Fair story about Jeff Bezos, an extramarital affair, nude selfies, politics, the National Enquirer, etc., but I just\u00a0want to focus on this amazing passage about what might have been:One option even included Bezos buying A.M.I.\u2014not such an outlandish consideration given the seriousness of the breach and the fact that, for Bezos, the price of the tabloid company is essentially a rounding error\u2014to find out the source of the leak. \u201cWe discussed the possibility to buy A.M.I.\u2014not to kill the story, but to find out the source. They said that\u2019s not a bad idea. We discussed numbers and the name of the LLC that we\u2019d use. It would be called BOBO LCC\u201d\u2014short for Lauren\u2019s helicopter filming company, Black Ops, and Bezos\u2019s space company, Blue Origin\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s the level of detail we went into.\u201dQuick explainer: The National Enquirer, a tabloid owned by American Media Inc., acquired some embarrassing photos of Amazon.com Inc. founder and squazillionaire Jeff Bezos, and of\u00a0Lauren Sanchez, with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Sanchez\u2019s brother Michael has been accused of leaking the photos to the Enquirer, though he denied that in the Vanity Fair article. (\u201cI\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t do\u00a0something,\u201d he says, though.) The quote in that paragraph is from Michael Sanchez, and he is describing a discussion that he\u00a0had with Bezos and Lauren Sanchez last month after the National Enquirer started asking about their affair. One possibility they apparently considered\u00a0was for Bezos to buy AMI,\u00a0not kill the story\u00a0(???), and I suppose, once in possession of AMI\u2019s records, find out who leaked the information to the Enquirer.Now:But I think I am justified in saying: Never mind all of that, let\u2019s just imagine if it had happened! Imagine if a tabloid owned by a public company threatened to publish nudes of Jeff Bezos, and Jeff Bezos just lobbed in a hostile bid\u2014funded by his personal fortune, not by Amazon\u2014to buy the publisher at a premium. He would have to put out a tender-offer disclosure document, and in the \u201cPurpose of the Offer\u201d section he would just write\u00a0\u201crevenge,\u201d and in the \u201cPlans for the Target\u201d section he could write \u201cI am going to find out who leaked my nudes and exact ruinous vengeance on them, and that\u2019s it, I haven\u2019t thought about any other plans.\u201d And then management and Bezos would make their respective cases to shareholders: Management and its investment bankers would put together a detailed slide deck explaining their long-term business plans and financial projections, while Bezos would put out two slides, one saying \u201cVengeance Will Be Mine\u201d over\u00a0that picture of him looking buff in a vest, and the other printing the price of his all-cash offer in a really big font. And then management\u2019s investment bankers would issue an opinion saying that Bezos\u2019s offer was inadequate and he\u2019d be like \u201cfine double it then,\u00a0I don\u2019t care, how much could a newspaper publisher possibly cost, do you know how rich I am.\u201d And politicians would rail against short-termism in corporate America, and point to the fact that valuable productive companies could be bought by corporate raiders just to strip them down to a single piece of information, and Bezos would be like \u201cyes that\u2019s true but have you considered how much money I have.\u201dAnd then he\u2019d win, of course, and he\u2019d gain control of the company and install his board, and they\u2019d appoint a new Bezos loyalist CEO, and Bezos would show up at the office and be like \u201cokay who\u2019s my leaker,\u201d and he and the new CEO would call every employee in one by one to grill them\u00a0until someone told him what he wanted to know. And then he\u2019d go, you know, write a withering blog post about the leaker or whatever his plan was.But then there\u2019d still be a whole company there! Like he bought this company just to ask one question and\u00a0exact his\u00a0amazing personal revenge, but meanwhile there are all the reporters and editors and printers and people who work in accounting, and they all show up to work to be grilled about the leaker, but then after that, like, they just \u2026\u00a0go on producing a tabloid \u2026\u00a0for an owner whose \u2026\u00a0only interest in it has passed? Like I guess he could sell it then, for some fraction of what he paid for it, but what\u2019s the fun in that? Or he could shut it down out of spite, fine, but that seems wasteful. Maybe he could keep running the tabloid, but dedicate it\u00a0exclusively to publishing mean stories about the person who leaked his nudes.Anyway corporate finance is amazing, but the point here is that it could so easily be so much more amazing.Oh also Amazon  won\u2019t be building a big new office in New York.The way appraisal lawsuits work is that a company agrees to buy another company, and pays for it, and some shareholders of the target\u00a0vote against the deal and sue the buyer for more money. They go to a Delaware Chancery Court judge and argue that the target was worth more than the buyer paid for it; the buyer argues that it was worth what it paid, or even less. And then the judge decides how much it was worth and orders the buyer to pay that amount. It\u2019s  kind of  weird! A lot of corporate finance is, you know, willing buyers and willing sellers, negotiated transactions, etc., but then at the end of a merger,\u00a0you go to a judge and he gets to decide if the market was right or wrong.The way he decides is mostly that each side has a valuation expert to say how much the company was worth, and then the judge makes a decision about\u00a0which one was more persuasive. These valuation experts tend to be finance professors, hired by the parties\u00a0through economic consulting firms, who do discounted cash flow analyses of the company to come up with their values; the judge will generally take the more compelling DCF as a starting point for his own valuation.You might expect there to be a sorting\u00a0process in which the plaintiffs hire an expert who believes that the company was undervalued and the defendants hire an expert who doesn\u2019t. Or yes fine fine fine you might instead expect there to be an entirely cynical process in which each side hires an expert who doesn\u2019t believe anything, but who says whatever they want for a fee.\u00a0But it could be worse!\u00a0When Verizon Communications Inc. bought AOL Inc. in 2015, some shareholders sued for appraisal. Last year they lost that lawsuit, when Delaware Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III ruled that the fair value of AOL was $48.70 per share, a bit below\u00a0the deal price of $50. The vice chancellor wrote at the time:The Petitioners hired a well-qualified academic, Dr. Bradford Cornell, a visiting professor at the California Institute of Technology, as their expert witness. Cornell performed a financial analysis, and concluded that the fair value of AOL stock was $68.98 per share.\u00a0For reasons not necessary to detail, however, the Respondent questioned Dr. Cornell\u2019s impartiality in this matter, and the Petitioners seem content to use the DCF model presented by the Respondent\u2019s expert as a starting point for my analysis.\u00a0Oh but no, those reasons are necessary to detail, and a few weeks ago\u00a0the shareholders\u00a0detailed them, in a new hilarious lawsuit\u00a0against their own expert:What [Cornell] failed to disclose was that Cornell had only taken on the engagement for Plaintiffs [i.e. the shareholders] to satisfy an admitted \u201cgrudge\u201d he held against Plaintiffs\u2019 litigation opponent [i.e. Verizon], which had spurned hiring Cornell in favor of a competing testifying expert. While trying to solicit Plaintiffs\u2019 litigation opponent, Cornell expressed negative views about the strength of Plaintiffs\u2019 case. Plaintiffs and their counsel knew none of this when they retained him.When Cornell\u2019s undisclosed communications surfaced in the midst of the Appraisal Action\u2014after Plaintiffs had disclosed Cornell as their expert and expert reports were issued\u2014the consequences for Plaintiffs were devastating. The disclosure of these communications effectively destroyed Cornell\u2019s testimony, which forced Plaintiffs to essentially abandon him as their expert \u2026It seems that Cornell (who is a visiting professor of finance at Caltech) pitched Verizon on retaining him as an expert, and allegedly sympathized with Verizon over email about \u201cwhat a nuisance these [appraisal] cases can be.\u201d\u00a0But they went with his colleague\/competitor\/frenemy, Professor Daniel Fischel, who was associated with the same economic consulting firm as Cornell. So Cornell switched consulting firms and pitched his services to the appraisal plaintiffs, but not before\u00a0sending Fischel this email\n            \n\n                4\n            \n        :Dan,Like you I tend to bear grudges. And though I see you as perhaps the best general expert witness in the country, when it comes to appraisal, particularly for tech companies, I think I am uniquely well qualified. So when Verizon\/Wachtell chose you without even talking to me further that leads to a grudge against them.\u00a0Consequently, I have had some conversations with plaintiffs. \u2026Later he allegedly told Fischel that his \u201cmain concern is that plaintiffs have a [expletive] case (that is not based on conversation just what I have read online) so I will have to be careful to avoid letting my grudge lead to a situation where I threaten my reputation.\u201d Well: oops!\u00a0Anyway there are absolutely no broader lessons to be learned here\n            \n\n                5\n            \n        \u00a0and I am telling you all of this out of pure gleeful cynicism. I had a professor in law school whose theory was that any bitter lawsuit over seemingly trivial stakes was really about a love triangle, but it is pleasing to find that a high-stakes litigation over a multi-billion-dollar merger could turn on a valuation expert who was miffed that the other side didn\u2019t hire him.We  talked the other day about how Banco Santander SA did not call its Additional Tier 1 Capital securities when investors expected it to, leaving those investors outraged and stuck holding securities worth, um, 98 cents on the dollar. I was fine with all of this: Santander had an absolute right not to call the securities, and taking the holders\u2019 concerns seriously\u00a0would undermine the usefulness of AT1 securities as bank capital. \u201cI struggle to find any reason to sympathize with the investors here,\u201d I wrote.But I neglected to mention one actually decent reason to sympathize with them, which is that Santander had\u00a0just gone out and raised\u00a0another\u00a0AT1 security days before the expected call date on this one. If you were an investor in Santander\u2019s old bond, you might reasonably have thought that Santander was raising the new AT1 to pay to retire the old AT1, and you might have participated in the new AT1 deal\u00a0expecting that you\u2019d quickly get some money back from your old AT1. Santander didn\u2019t exactly say that that was the plan, but it was a reasonable guess, and if you thought that\u00a0then you got played. So, fine, a little sympathy.One aspect of the new AT1 that particularly made investors expect a call of the old one is that the new AT1 had a  short settlement cycle, meaning that Santander would get the cash from the new offering a bit quicker than it normally would. Investors sensibly thought that this was so that Santander would have the cash in time\u00a0to pay off the old AT1. But in fact that guess was wrong,\u00a0for\u00a0this very strange reason:The bond also had an unusually short settlement date of two days, meaning that Santander would have the money in its hands last Friday \u2014 which investors believed was the bank\u2019s deadline for calling the coco. This is because a notice had to be filed 30 days before March 12, which fell on a Sunday.But the bank then told investors that they actually had until Tuesday February 12 to make a decision. This is because the bank had legal advice that 30 days should be interpreted as a month, disregarding that there are 28 days in February.None of this actually mattered, in the end, since Santander never exercised the call. Still: what? When bonds don\u2019t work out for investors, in ways that are explicitly allowed by the documents, it is tempting to say\u2014and I often succumb to the temptation\u2014\u201chahaha, that\u2019s on you, you should have read the documents.\u201d Here, for instance, Santander\u2019s AT1 explicitly said that Santander\u00a0never\u00a0has to pay it back, though it could at its option decide to pay it back this month; investors who interpreted that to mean \u201cSantander will definitely pay it back this month\u201d were, I insist, only deluding themselves. Read the documents!On the other hand, if you\u00a0did\u00a0read the documents, you would have seen that Santander had to call the AT1 30 days in advance. But Santander\u2019s lawyers said\u2014and for all I know they\u2019re right\u2014that, nah, 30 days actually means 28 days. Reading the very clear words (and numbers) in the document would have gotten you nowhere, would have actively misled you, because the words apparently mean something other than what they say.NYSE goes to court to halt SEC plan.

EC seeks to challenge role of U.S. dollar in energy markets Intercontinental Exchange Inc. says its Dutch natural gas market has the potential to become a world beater in energy trading.When the owner of the New York Stock Exchange bought an energy bourse in Amsterdam seven years ago, the Netherlands was just one of several regional markets dominated by the U.K. But roles reversed as the region increased imports and utilities adopted contracts in euros to peg imports from Russia, Norway and far-flung places via liquefied natural gas tankers.And with Brexit curbing U.K. activity, trade on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility, as the market is known, is surging. Volumes have jumped 13-fold in the past four years on ICE Endex and TTF has cemented its position as Europe\u2019s most important hub for the fuel.But ICE, which took control of the Brent futures contract when it bought the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001, has loftier ambitions than that. The company is seeking to develop the market into a global benchmark akin to the crude marker, said Gordon Bennett, ICE\u2019s managing director of utility markets.And while the value of open positions on its gas market is today only about 5 percent of its Brent contract, volume is far from peaking, he says.\u201cIt will become more important,\u201d said Bert den Ouden, who founded the company that sold its Endex unit in 2012 to ICE and is now managing director for energy at consultant Berenschot Holding BV. \u201cIt was already clear at that point LNG would become very important.\u201dNetherlands TTF contract volumeICE EndexThe fuel has since the 1960s been linked to U.S.-dollar denominated oil in sales contracts, but the emergence of the Dutch market as the regional benchmark enabled utilities to seize more control over how they pay for the many billions of euros of gas imported every year.Utilities from EON SE to Engie SA have reworked contracts through arbitration with Russia\u2019s Gazprom PJSC to insert links to European gas prices. New LNG deals are also increasingly referencing the Dutch market and TTF is now used in Asian trades, too.And while the euro is gaining prominence in energy trading, less than a fifth of the European Union\u2019s 300 billion-euro ($339 billion) annual oil and gas bill is priced in the regional currency. The EU is trying to boost the use of the currency in everything from commodities to foodstuffs and transport to make companies less prone to international disputes and easier to finance, the commission said in December.ICE Endex is also making its market more attractive. The futures curve was in June extended by a year so that traders can buy and sell as long as six years in advance. That\u2019s still short of the 10 years offered in the U.S. Henry Hub market, and Bennett expects to add even more contracts in the future to meet customer demand.To be sure, about three quarters of mainland Europe\u2019s gas trades are still handled bilaterally between brokers, according to data published last month by Trayport Ltd., the main trading platform.But a surge in LNG output from the Americas is providing a big opportunity for TTF. Almost a fifth of European supply has come from the U.S. in the past three months, an unprecedented number.And for U.S. sellers, the two primary basins to supply are Europe and Asia, and the price difference between Asian spot and hub prices in Europe will shape where their volumes are directed, said Macquarie Group Ltd. oil and gas analyst David Hewitt.\u201cThe prevailing TTF price environment this year will be an important focus for the global LNG sector,\u201d he said.Other hubs will remain contenders. U.S. futures trade advanced about 6 percent to a record last year on CME Group Inc.\u2019s Henry Hub, based on aggregate monthly futures. Transactions in ICE\u2019s JKM contact in Asia rose to a record in January, but it\u2019s a lot less liquid than its Dutch market.ICE began offering on March 4 options for its Japan-Korea Marker LNG (Platts) contracts, the exchange group said today in an emailed statement.Having a global price for gas only makes sense if the various regional markets are more integrated, according to Tor Martin Anfinnsen, senior vice president for marketing and supply at Equinor ASA of Norway, Europe\u2019s second-biggest supplier. \u201cI think we are nowhere near that.\u201d No one hub will \u201creign supreme,\u201d he said.And TTF\u2019s position in Europe isn\u2019t completely unassailable, according to both Macquarie and Equinor. Germany\u2019s plans to build out infrastructure with LNG terminals and a second pipe from Russia opening by the end of this year could spur more trade and potentially challenge the Dutch market.Still, ICE\u2019s Bennett isn\u2019t too worried. Germany, while bigger in terms of consumption, remains much smaller than TTF in terms of traded volume. And it\u2019s fragmented over several exchanges.\u201cThe horse has already bolted,\u201d Bennett said.\u2014 With assistance by Anna Shiryaevskaya, and Rob Verdonck ","28":"Advisers said to make case of stock market rally on China deal. President looking for win after abandoning North Korea talks President Donald Trump is pushing for U.S. negotiators to close a trade deal with China soon, concerned that he needs a big win on the international stage -- and the stock market bump that would come with it -- in advance of his re-election campaign.As trade talks with China advance, Trump has noticed the market gains that followed each sign of progress and expressed concern that the lack an agreement could drag down stocks, according to people familiar with the matter. He watched U.S. and Asian equities rise on his decision to delay an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods scheduled for March 1, one of the people said.The world\u2019s two largest economies are moving closer to a final agreement that could end their almost year-long trade war, an outcome that would also provide a boost to his efforts to seek reelection in 2020. A new trade accord that would provide Trump with a much-needed win after the collapse of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Donald Trump on March 4.Trump, who met with his trade team Monday, has expressed interest in hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping for a signing ceremony on a deal as soon as this month. His enthusiasm for a pact could shape crucial decisions such as balancing Chinese pressure to lift tariffs immediately against trade hawks\u2019 arguments to initially maintain duties as leverage to assure good behavior by Beijing.Trump\u2019s fixation on stock-market performance has shaped his assessments of his economic policies. Top White House staff know to be aware of how markets are performing when summoned to the Oval Office to speak with Trump because the president often asks: \u2018\u2018What\u2019s happening with the markets?\u2019\u2019Advocates of concluding a deal within the administration have seized on that fixation to bolster their case, one person said.Trump\u2019s economic team has told him an agreement will unleash a market rally, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Advocates of a compromise with China have also told Trump it is crucial to cut a deal soon to reap the full boost ahead of the election because benefits such as more Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans and other products will have a delayed impact and take time to reverberate through the economy, they said.The White House communications staff declined to comment.The trade war between the two nations has weighed on the stock market, with Renaissance Macro Research concluding that the S&P 500 would be 11 percent higher without the impact of the feud. Still, U.S. stocks have regained most of their losses from the autumn when investors were more pessimistic about trade prospects.Some investors say a deal isn\u2019t likely to have a major impact because it\u2019s already mostly priced into the market as a result of the recent positive signals from the administration. On the other hand, failure risks roiling stocks.\u201cThe risk could be more to the downside, but on the other hand this would take away some uncertainty and that is good for companies looking to invest,\u201d said Sebastien Page, head of global multi-asset strategy at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. \u201cIf we get a meaningful trade deal, there is some upside scenarios for emerging market stocks.\u201dU.S. equity futures slipped, European shares firmed and Asian benchmarks were mixed Wednesday, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all declining as reports showed the U.S. trade deficit widened in 2018.China is also tempering expectations.\u201cChina\u2019s concessions probably won\u2019t be very big because a lot of their demands are what we already plan to reform,\u201d former finance minister Lou Jiwei said in Beijing on Wednesday, calling some U.S. demands for change \"unreasonable.\"Chuck Schumer on March 5.Inside the White House, key economic advisers including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow are eager for a quick resolution to the trade conflict, while trade hawks such as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has taken a tougher line with China.Trump is facing pressure from both parties in Congress, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in a floor speech on Tuesday cautioning the president not to settle for a weak deal with China.\u201cBut now, when you\u2019re getting close to a victory, to relent at the eleventh hour, without achieving meaningful, enforceable, and verifiable structural reform to China\u2019s trade policies would be an abject failure of the president\u2019s China policies and people will shrug their shoulders and say what the heck did he begin this for if he won\u2019t complete it,\u201d Schumer said.\u2014 With assistance by Jenny Leonard ","29":" A Vodafone Group Plc logo.Big companies often leave their suppliers\u00a0hanging for weeks without pay, but Vodafone Group Plc is taking this\u00a0a step further: it\u2019s investing in a fund that makes money off the delay.The British phone operator poured\u00a01\u00a0billion euros ($1.1 billion)\u00a0into the\u00a02.4 billion-euro fund\u00a0run by beleaguered Swiss asset manager GAM Holding\u00a0AG, which generates returns by paying suppliers early if they accept less than they\u2019re owed.The fund is full of invoices from many of Vodafone\u2019s 15,000\u00a0vendors of anything from antenna systems to furniture, according to three people with knowledge of the investment, who declined to be identified because the data are private. Vodafone makes its partners wait 48 days for their money, versus a 36-day global average, according to consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers.\u201cThey are behaving a bit like a hedge fund when they are a telecoms company,\u201d\u00a0said Stephen Baseby, who recently retired as policy and technical director at the Association of Corporate Treasurers in London after more than 40 years in the field. \u201cThis is the kind of complexity that more conservative treasurers like me would warn against.\u201dWhile companies postpone payments all the time to keep cash on their balance sheets and bolster a metric known as working capital, earning investment income from the haircuts their suppliers bear if they can\u2019t afford to wait is unusual, according to Daniel Windaus, a partner for PWC\u2019s consultancy arm.\u00a0Vodafone began building\u00a0a position in the GAM-Greensill Supply Chain Fund,\u00a0jointly run by GAM and London-based Greensill Capital, in 2016 and its holdings have since grown five-fold, the people said. A footnote to\u00a0its full-year 2018 financial statements revealed a big annual increase in short-term investments related to \"supply chain and handset receivables,\" but no details were disclosed on what those investments were.\u00a0\u201cWhy not pay them on earlier terms if they have the money to invest?\u201dA Vodafone spokesman wouldn\u2019t say how much of the 685 million euros of investment income earned in the 2017-2018 fiscal year came from GAM. The company said it invests in a range of low-risk instruments including gold-backed bank deposits and bespoke investment funds. Vodafone noted that in the case of the smallest U.K. suppliers, it pays within 30 days.\u201cIt is totally up to our suppliers if they decide to utilize supply-chain financing and Vodafone has absolutely no say in it,\u201d Vodafone said in a written\u00a0statement. \u201cGAM\u00a0has a fiduciary duty to select the best risk\/return trade receivable assets for the fund. Vodafone has no influence on which assets are selected by the fund manager.\u201dThe GAM fund used to be run by\u00a0Tim Haywood, the money manager who was suspended last July over allegations of misconduct and later fired, a decision he  is appealing.\u00a0A GAM\u00a0spokesman declined to comment.Greensill called supply-chain finance a \u201cwin-win for suppliers and their clients alike\u201d and said it offers\u00a0rates below those available elsewhere, on average less than 100 basis points over Libor. \u201cEarly payment improves a supplier\u2019s cash-flow position without any impact on their client\u2019s\u00a0finances,\u201d said Lex\u00a0Greensill, the firm\u2019s founder and CEO.Vodafone\u2019s payment delays are part of a broader trend in\u00a0\"supply-chain bullying\" that leaves suppliers\u00a0stranded without cash, according to Lorence Nye, a policy advisor at the Federation of Small Businesses, which represents 170,000 U.K. companies.\u201cWhy not pay them on earlier terms if they have the money to invest?,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cLarger businesses are incentivized to delay payment or do this for the sake of looking good to shareholders.\u201dBy putting money\u00a0in a fund which offers early payment to its suppliers rather than doing that directly, Vodafone can classify those payables as short-term investments so they don\u2019t eat away at its cash balance, something that would in turn\u00a0make its\u00a0debt burden look worse.\u00a0The phone operator has found other ways to try to protect its credit rating, which was downgraded by\u00a0Moody\u2019s Investors Service to\u00a0two steps\u00a0above junk last month.\u00a0To finance its $22 billion takeover of Liberty Global Plc\u2019s cable networks in Germany and eastern Europe, for instance, Vodafone this month\u00a0sold\u00a04 billion euros of mandatory convertible bonds that won\u2019t be counted as debt on its balance sheet because they\u2019ll eventually be switched into equity.This is an acceptable accounting practice in the industry.\u00a0Even so, criticism has mounted that the biggest auditing firms are  too lenient\u00a0on their clients.\u00a0The U.K.\u00a0this month even abolished its accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, to replace it with a body that will presumably be tougher.What that will mean for suppliers is unclear. Until a few years ago, banks handled\u00a0most supply-chain financing for\u00a0big corporate clients, paying larger vendors\u00a0at a discount of a few percentage points to face value, called reverse factoring.\u201cThere have been question marks around the spirit of these programs\u201dBut smaller businesses couldn\u2019t access cash that\u00a0way and would often need to resort to expensive borrowing, creating a gap that\u2019s since been filled by funds like the one run by GAM and online platforms including\u00a0Previse Ltd. and PrimeRevenue Inc.\u00a0Investors can get up to 5 percent returns for invoices of investment-grade companies, and even higher if they are junk-rated.Vodafone\u2019s investment, then, could be seen as a natural extension of the trend. That may not\u00a0make it easier for suppliers to swallow,\u00a0according to Dominic Capolongo, the global head of funding at Atlanta-based PrimeRevenue, whose clients include suppliers for firms like Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. and Volvo AB.\u201cIf you\u2019re generating a profit and the supplier finds out about that, the supplier will say \u2018why are you generating a profit off me?\u2019 and it will diminish the relationship,\u201d\u00a0Capolongo said.More companies will probably follow in Vodafone\u2019s footsteps if you ask\u00a0Lionel Taylor, a former supply-chain finance banker at Lloyds Banking Group Plc who now runs a consultancy\u00a0called Trade Advisory Network.\u201cNo doubt it\u2019s on the agenda of major corporates,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally speaking, there have been question marks around the spirit of these programs. They are not built to support suppliers, whatever they say.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Patrick Winters, and Thomas Seal ","30":"Diokno says goal is sustainable growth, stable prices. Currency drops most since 2013 as inflation returns to target Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte surprised central bank watchers by naming his budget secretary on Monday as governor of the monetary authority. The peso slumped the most in more than five years.Benjamin Diokno, 70, will succeed Nestor Espenilla, who died in February after a battle with cancer. The new Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas governor will serve the remainder of his predecessor\u2019s six-year term ending in mid-2023.An advocate of robust state spending to spur growth when he was budget chief, Diokno is seen as favoring lower interest rates and a weaker currency. The peso was the worst performer of major Asian currencies on Tuesday, dropping 1 percent against the dollar, the biggest decline since August 2013.Diokno, who hasn\u2019t officially taken office yet, said he\u2019ll focus on economic growth, inflation and the currency in his new role.\u201cThe ultimate goal is sustainable growth under a regime of price stability,\u201d Diokno said in a mobile-phone response to a question. He declined to comment specifically on monetary policy.Diokno\u2019s appointment and data on Tuesday showing inflation returned to the central bank\u2019s 2 percent to 4 percent target paves the way for rate cuts this year.\u201cHe consistently communicated as budget secretary that his primary aim is to boost growth, keep the Philippines on a higher growth path and that high inflation is tolerable as long as the economy is growing,\u201d said Manny Cruz, head of research at Papa Securities Corp. in Manila. \u201cHe will probably lean towards an interest-rate cut.\u201dUnder Espenilla, the central bank raised interest rates by 175 basis points last year after inflation reached a nine-year high. Consumer price growth has steadily eased since then and reached 3.8 percent in February, lower than the 4 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo has been more cautious on monetary policy despite the slowdown in inflation, saying on Tuesday that it\u2019s premature to talk about cutting interest rates or reducing the reserve ratio for banks.The central bank -- which has kept the key rate unchanged at 4.75 percent at its last three meetings -- is set to hold its next policy decision on March 21. Economic growth slowed to a three-year low in 2018.Diokno\u2019s \u201cinclination will be towards policies that will support or enhance economic growth,\u201d said Alan Atienza, treasurer at the Philippine Bank of Communications in Manila. \u201cWe should see reserve and rate cuts this year that will support and fund government\u2019s ballooning budget deficit.\u201dThe peso fell 1 percent to 52.24 against the dollar at the close on Tuesday while the Philippine stock index erased earlier gains to end the day almost 0.1 percent lower.Diokno\u2019s appointment was a surprise to central bank watchers, who had expected Duterte to name one of the three deputy governors, or possibly someone from the banking sector as governor.An economics professor,\u00a0Diokno\u00a0was also budget secretary during the short term of President Joseph Estrada and undersecretary of that department during the time of then leader, Corazon Aquino. In recent months, Diokno has been mired in a dispute with lawmakers from the House of Representatives over their share in the budget, which has delayed the passage of the 2019 spending plan.Diokno inherits a central bank with more capital, stronger powers and wider functions, including the ability to issue its own debt. His comments on the peso and his ability to uphold Bangko Sentral\u2019s independence will be closely watched.Last year when he was still budget secretary, Diokno consistently brushed aside concerns about a weak peso when the currency was among the worst performers in the region.\u201cWe note that past statements from Governor Diokno indicate his stance that a weak peso is not necessarily bad for the Philippines,\u201d said\u00a0Eugenia Victorino, head for Asia strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB in Singapore. \u201cWhether this inclination will result in a change in tone of the central bank is worth watching.\"\u2014 With assistance by Andreo Calonzo, Ian C Sayson, Cecilia Yap, and Claire Jiao ","31":"Authoritative studies point to net loss for U.S. from tariffs. U.S. consumers and companies bearing cost of import duties President Donald Trump regularly declares that he\u2019s winning his trade wars. Yet evidence is growing that the U.S. economy is a net loser so far.In two separate papers published over the weekend, some of the world\u2019s leading trade economists declared Trump\u2019s tariffs to be the most consequential trade experiment seen since the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariffs blamed for worsening the Great Depression. They also found the initial cost of Trump\u2019s duties to the U.S. economy was in the billions and being borne largely by American consumers.In a study published on Saturday, economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University and Columbia University found that tariffs imposed last year by Trump on products ranging from washing machines and steel to some $250 billion in Chinese imports were costing U.S. companies and consumers $3 billion a month in additional tax costs and companies a further $1.4 billion in deadweight losses. They also were causing the diversion of $165 billion a year in trade leading to significant costs for companies having to reorganize supply chains.President Donald TrumpSignificantly, the analysis of import price data by Mary Amiti, Stephen Redding and David Weinstein also found that almost all of the cost of the tariffs was being paid by U.S. consumers and companies. That contradicts Trump\u2019s claim that China is paying the tariffs.\u201cThis is kind of the worst-case scenario in terms of consumers,\u2019\u2019 Weinstein said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unclear that this trade war is a net win for the economy at this point.\u2019\u2019The trade war was only one factor affecting the U.S. economy, Weinstein said, and with the U.S. less exposed to trade than other major western economies such as Germany, it was not having as much of an impact as it might.But the numbers were still consequential, he insisted. They also did not capture all of the costs to the U.S. economy. The three economists are now working on quantifying the amount of investment that has been put on hold as a result of the heightened uncertainty caused by the trade wars, Weinstein said.In a separate paper published on Sunday four economists including Pinelopi Goldberg, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist and a former editor-in-chief of the prestigious American Economic Review, put the annual losses from the higher cost of imports alone for the U.S. economy at $68.8 billion, or almost 0.4 percent of gross domestic product.A cargo ship at the Port of Savannah in Savannah, Georgia.That was offset by the gains from protectionism derived by U.S. producers benefiting from the tariffs, the economists found. After accounting for the impact of higher tariff revenue and the benefits of higher prices to domestic producers the study found the aggregate annual loss for the U.S. economy fell to $6.4 billion, or 0.03 percent of GDP.The study by Goldberg, Pablo Fajgelbaum of UCLA, Patrick Kennedy of the University of California, Berkeley, and Amit Khandelwal of Columbia also found that consumers and U.S. companies were paying most of the costs of the tariffs.But it also went a step further: After factoring in the retaliation by other countries, the main victims of Trump\u2019s trade wars had been farmers and blue-collar workers in areas that supported Trump in the 2016 election.\u201cWorkers in very Republican counties bore the brunt of the costs of the trade war, in part because retaliations disproportionately targeted agricultural sectors, and in part because U.S. tariffs raised the costs of inputs used by these counties,\u2019\u2019 the authors wrote.Soybeans are loaded into a grain cart during harvest in Wyanet, Illinois.The studies are the most authoritative yet to document the negative effect of Trump\u2019s tariffs on the U.S. economy, though others have shown the negative consequences. Economists at the Institute of International Finance last week calculated Chinese retaliatory tariffs alone were causing roughly $40 billion a year in lost U.S. exports.Official trade data due to be released on Wednesday also are expected to show the U.S. trade deficit in goods with the world hitting a new record in 2018 because of the combination of a surge in imports to get ahead of the new tariffs last year and slowing exports.A spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers declined to comment on the new papers and referred inquiries to the office of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Spokespeople for USTR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a speech Saturday to conservative activists Trump dismissed criticism of his tariffs and boasted that he was simply following what he argued was a glorious history of using import taxes in American history.\u201cI found some very old laws from when our country was rich -- really rich -- the old tariff laws. We had to dust them off. You could hardly see, they were so dusty,\u201d Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference.At a minimum, Trump said, tariffs were \u201cthe greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country,\u201d pointing to talks now underway with China which appear increasingly likely to result in a deal in the coming weeks. ","32":" Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.Norway will on Friday decide whether to let its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund dump all its oil and gas stocks. Here\u2019s what you need to know.The fund contends that it makes little sense for Norway to be doubly exposed to the oil markets. As western Europe\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer, its fortunes are already heavily linked to petroleum, deriving almost half its exports and more than 20 percent of the state\u2019s revenue from the commodities.The central bank, which oversees the fund, insists that the plan is based solely on financial considerations and that it doesn\u2019t reflect a particular view of the oil industry\u2019s prospects.The proposal shocked markets when it was revealed in 2017, sending oil stocks broadly lower. The plan was hailed by activists around the world as a monumental step in getting investors to back away from fossil fuels. If it becomes reality, it would likely turn the heat up on Big Oil, which is already facing pressure to do more to fight climate change and adapt to the energy transition.The fund owned about $37 billion of oil and gas stocks at the end of last year, including more than 2 percent of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Total SA. But it has also assured that any sell-down would likely take years.Read about how the fund boosted its oil and gas holdings last yearRead more: Norway\u2019s oil sell-off plan is \u2018shot heard around the world\u2019Economists are split over the plan and a government-commissioned expert panel last year advised against it, arguing a divestment would be inefficient insurance against a drop in commodity prices. It also said it would threaten the fund\u2019s simple and well-established strategy of investing broadly.In theory, the proposal has the support of a majority of parties in Parliament, which has the final say. However, since the plan was presented, the centrist Liberals and Christian Democrats, who are in favor of dumping oil stocks, have joined the bigger Conservative and Progress parties to form a majority government. While they haven\u2019t voiced a clear view of the oil-stock proposal, the Conservatives and Progress Party have traditionally been reluctant to make dramatic changes to the fund\u2019s investment strategy.The issue is likely to be settled within the coalition before the Finance Ministry makes its announcement on Friday. While that process makes a heated contest in parliament improbable, it also makes the outcome harder to predict.Tore Storehaug, a Christian Democrat lawmaker who sits on Parliament\u2019s Finance Committee,  declined to say anything on what might happen in case the government decides not to follow the fund\u2019s advice.\u201cGenerally speaking, there\u2019s broad consensus that the management of the oil fund and the enormous values Norway controls should have the broadest possible political backing,\u201d he said by phone.The opposition Labor Party, Norway\u2019s biggest political group, has long said it\u2019s sympathetic to the proposal, and is now coming out clearly in favor of selling the fund\u2019s oil stocks.\u201cMy expectation is that they\u2019ll follow the advice from Norges Bank,\u201d said lawmaker Svein Roald Hansen. \u201cWe will of course consider the government\u2019s arguments. But in my opinion, they will need to come up with some surprising elements to change our mind.\u201d ","33":" Not the source of your underperformance.\u00a0In his 2001 book \u201cFooled by Randomness,\u201d author and fund manager Nassim Nicholas Taleb argued that chance plays a largely unacknowledged role in success, particularly in the finance industry. A new study of the returns generated by fund managers suggests that even the minority able to beat their benchmarks are lucky rather than good \u2014 and maybe not even that lucky.Analysts at S&P Global examined the returns of more than 2,400 investors based in the U.S. Unsurprisingly to anyone who has followed the active-versus-passive debate in recent years, less than a third were able to beat their benchmarks in the three years to September 2015 on an annualized basis and once fees are taken into account.More remarkably, even those that were able to initially deliver alpha failed to extend their winning streaks in the years after.Funds that beat their benchmarks in the three years to 2015 failed to repeat that outperformance in the following yearsSource: S&PNote: Data calculated to end of September in each yearEven for U.S. portfolio managers investing in international equities \u2014 the most successful group, with almost half of them delivering market-beating performance during the initial three-year period \u2014 the luster quickly faded. Less than 1 percent of the winners were able to sustain those excess returns in the year to September 2018.That\u2019s even worse than the 12.5 percent of outperforming funds that S&P reckons chance alone would produce as persistent leaders in each of the subsequent three years. It seems in investing, luck runs out sooner rather than later.The S&P analysts were worried that \u201ccyclical market conditions\u201d might have skewed their results, which were based on a single point in time, so they redid the calculations using a rolling quarterly average for the time periods. Guess what?On a rolling quarterly average, outperformance persisted in the first year but declined dramatically thereafterSource: S&PWhile the picture improves for the first year, by 2018 the number of consistently winning investors drops dramatically once again \u2014 suggesting the problem is with the investment managers, not the mathematics.The health warnings that regulators insist are part of the small print in the marketing materials for the investment industry admit that past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The brochures then typically proceed to stress just how wonderfully the fund in question has performed against some carefully chosen benchmark over whatever time period is the most flattering for its returns. As the S&P analysts say with masterly understatement, \u201cMarket participants may want to reconsider chasing \u2018hot hands\u2019 or picking managers based on past performance.\u201dThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. ","34":"Industry group announces new plan for what triggers payouts. Proposal follows controversy over Blackstone\u2019s Hovnanian trade Wall Street banks and hedge funds are closing in on a fix that they hope will clean up an $8 trillion portion of the derivatives market that\u2019s gained a reputation for being one of the shadiest corners in finance.At issue are a number of transactions in recent years in which powerful investment firms have been accused of earning big money from swaps trades by enticing companies to miss bond payments they could otherwise make. The practice has eroded market confidence, triggered legal fights and led to scrutiny from regulators.The industry\u2019s main trade group on Wednesday proposed re-defining \u201cfailure to pay\u201d events that trigger payouts. The plan aims to ensure that such defaults are tied to legitimate financial stress, rather than traders\u2019 derivatives bets. The changes, if completed, would be among the biggest to hit credit default derivatives in years and could help beat back a perception that the market has become a playground for creative traders and lawyers.Specifically, International Swaps and Derivatives Association is proposing that failing to make a bond payment wouldn\u2019t trigger a CDS payout if the reason for default wasn\u2019t tied to some kind of financial stress. The plan earned initial backing from titans including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Apollo Global Management and Ares Management Corp.\u201cThere must be a causal link between the non-payment and the deterioration in the creditworthiness or financial condition of the reference entity,\u201d ISDA said in its document.The revamp would affect credit-default swaps, instruments that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis that insure against a bond issuer\u2019s bankruptcy or failure to pay. But the fix is limited to one type of deal, so-called manufactured defaults.A trade that was widely seen as a tipping point occurred last year when Blackstone Group LP\u2019s GSO Capital Partners encouraged homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. to skip an interest payment in return for a sweetheart loan. Firms that were at risk of losing money protested because they had sold CDS insuring against a missed payment. One hedge fund, Solus Alternative Asset Management, even sued GSO, which ultimately agreed to unwind its trade.\u201cPeople had become gun-shy about using the CDS product to invest in and manage credit risk,\u201d said John Williams, a law partner at Milbank who represents buyside firms active in the CDS market including Apollo and Ares. \u201cThis is a very serious effort to make the rules fair.\u201dIn the wake of the Hovnanian controversy, Bennett Goodman, one of the founders of GSO, said that Blackstone would back revamping the standards that govern CDS trades. Blackstone wasn\u2019t formally part of the group that reached the preliminary agreement, according to a person familiar with the matter, but there is no indication it will oppose the plan.Representatives for Blackstone, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Apollo and Ares didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the proposal.While the proposed changes are voluntary and lack the teeth of regulations, firms that refuse to sign on could have trouble finding trading partners. The new standards would apply to new CDS contracts, and existing agreements could also be amended.ISDA\u2019s decision to clamp down is a recognition that manufactured defaults might be deterring some investors from entering the market. In addition, the industry wants to show global regulators it can address the problem on its own to stave off stiff rules and beefed-up government oversight.In a sign of how serious regulators have been taking the issue since the Hovnanian trade, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission warned last April that \u201cmanufactured credit events may constitute market manipulation and may severely damage the integrity of the CDS markets.\u201dThe CFTC\u2019s chairman, J. Christopher Giancarlo, said at the time that he hoped ISDA would resolve the matter with market participants. Meanwhile, U.K. Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Officer Andrew Bailey said in July that \u201cthis is a practice that\u2019s the wrong side of the line.\u201dOther manufactured defaults that have led to outrage include transactions involving radio broadcaster iHeartMedia Inc., paper maker Norske Skog AS and Spanish gaming company Codere SA. Back in 2013, Jon Stewart even criticized Blackstone on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d for persuading Codere to delay an interest payment and trigger payouts on its CDS.\u201cWhen the rules can be manipulated it\u2019s very painful to be the second-smartest guy on the street,\u201d said Williams, who also represents Blue Mountain Capital Management, CQS and Brigade Capital Management.It also remains to be seen whether ISDA\u2019s proposal will appease all market participants. The plan targets manufactured defaults, indicating it may not cover some transactions that have drawn investors complaints. For instance, hedge fund Marble Ridge Capital this week criticized a deal that allowed Neiman Marcus Group Inc. to delay bond payments while rewarding firms that used CDS to bet against the retailer\u2019s debt.ISDA is asking for comments on the plan by March 27. The overhaul could be completed in the next few months, but full implementation could take much longer.

Zimbabwe mulls interest rate policy and inflation targeting Zimbabwe\u2019s Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube touted the health of his country\u2019s economy even as the southern African nation experiences fuel shortages and the highest inflation rate since 2008.The government has put in place measures to liberalize the currency, curb spending and improve the management of state-owned companies he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Washington. Last month the country scrapped its insistence that local securities known as bond notes and their electronic equivalent trade at par with the dollar and allowed them to be exchanged in an inter-bank market that has seen the rate oscillate at about 2.5 to the dollar.\u201cZimbabwe is certainly on its way to a better place on the fiscal front because we are managing to walk the talk,\u201d he said in an upbeat interview. \u201cZimbabwe is the cheapest buy in Africa and it has just gotten cheaper. I think we are back in the game.\u201dZimbabwe Minister of Finance Mthuli Ncube speaks to Bloomberg Television.While Zimbabwe\u2019s finances have improved, with the government recording an average monthly budget surplus of around $100 million for the last four months, according to Ncube, that isn\u2019t evident on the street. In January the government more than doubled fuel prices, sparking the worst urban riots since 1995, and state teachers and doctors went on strike over pay. In addition to fuel, staples like bread are also in short supply.Inflation, which peaked at an estimated 500 billion percent in 2008, has risen sharply to 56.9 percent in January. In reality the price growth is probably significantly faster, according to Steve H. Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

They provide a path into the middle and upper-middle class for people who don\u2019t have elite connections or a fancy college degree. And they distribute capital income broadly, so that the gains from business ownership aren\u2019t concentrate among a few wealthy shareholders.Retail is a big component of small business. In recent decades, big chains have pushed out mom-and-pop stores. But there has been hope that e-commerce would provide a lifeline for small retailers.There\u2019s just one problem. E-commerce in the U.S. is increasingly dominated by a single platform -- Amazon.com Inc. As of 2018, the e-commerce giant had grabbed about half of the online retail market:Amazon&apos;s already dominant position in e-commerce is only growing. It is expected to capture 49.1 percent of the market this year, up from 43.5 percent in 2017. Source: eMarketerThat wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a problem for small retailers if Amazon simply provided a venue that allowed small businesses to connect with customers.But increasingly, Amazon sells its own products, including private-label goods,\u00a0that compete with the offerings of independent merchants on its platform. A recent paper by economists Feng Zhu and Qihong Liu observed Amazon\u2019s behavior over time, and found that it tends to introduce products in\u00a0niches\u00a0that smaller merchants did the work of discovering by finding out what consumers like. Amazon then piggybacks on their efforts.\u00a0\n            \n\n                1\n            \n        This kind of tactic could be increasingly important as Amazon makes its own private-label products.\u00a0This is similar to\u00a0a classic move\u00a0used by supermarkets -- observe which products sell well, then introduce private-label brands to try to grab some of those markets. But technology has given online platforms superior tools to outcompete their suppliers.One of these tools is search. Customers look for products using Amazon\u2019s internal search function. Independent sellers can try to take sales from rivals by buying placements in the search results for a rival\u2019s brand-name product -- for example, when a customer searches for Purina dog food, she might see a promoted result for Kibbles \u2018n Bits. But Amazon doesn\u2019t allow other sellers to compete with its products this way -- if you search for an Amazon product, you\u2019re invariably going to see an Amazon product first. But if you search for another company\u2019s product, you might see an Amazon product promoted at the top of the list. Amazon now is experimenting with a feature that could, if adopted,\u00a0automatically include\u00a0Amazon products in searches. And search isn\u2019t the only advantage a platform has in the digital age; Amazon also collects potentially crucial sales and marketing data that it can choose not to share with third-party merchants.Of course, any online retailer could do the same. But the world of e-commerce is subject to stronger network effects. When you buy something from a brick-and-mortar retailer, you tend to go to one that\u2019s conveniently located, whether it\u2019s a Wal-Mart, a Target, a Best Buy or a local convenience store. But online, unless you\u2019re searching for a specialized product, there\u2019s often no reason to go anywhere but Amazon. This naturally tends to push the platform market toward winner-take-all. And it\u2019s exacerbated by Amazon\u2019s practice of requiring merchants not to offer their products more cheaply on any other platform -- a type of agreement known as a most-favored nation provision or MFN. This means that merchants who want to sell their products online have no choice but to be on Amazon, the biggest platform, and play by its rules.Some, such as business professor Andre Hagiu, argue that Amazon would be foolish to out-compete its merchants, because this would deter them from offering their products on Amazon in the future. But researchers have long known that this logic doesn\u2019t necessarily apply in the presence of dominant market power; back in 2000, economists Joseph Farrell and Michael Katz showed that a monopoly can have incentives to confiscate the profits from the innovation of companies who produce complementary products, thus stifling innovation. Tech publisher Tim O\u2019Reilly argues that even if eating the third-party ecosystem isn\u2019t a good long-term decision, a platform may be tempted to do it anyway just for the short-term profits.So if Amazon is chewing up the small-business world -- and the e-commerce world in general -- what\u2019s to be done? One approach is to identify and ban Amazon\u2019s specific anticompetitive practices, as European authorities are trying to do in the case of data sharing. Another approach is to try to introduce competition into the e-commerce platform space by banning MFNs and other anticompetitive practices. But these efforts may be inadequate, since the former involves a continuous cat-and-mouse game between regulators and Amazon, and the latter probably won\u2019t be enough to overcome the strong network effect driving the concentration of online retail.Another alternative, of course, is simply to break up Amazon. But before such a drastic step is taken, economist Hal Singer argues, antitrust authorities should consider a gentler alternative -- a nondiscrimination regime. This would basically allow any third-party merchant to lodge a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission or another independent tribunal. Although only larger merchants would have the resources to lodge such complaints, any victories they won would benefit smaller businesses as well, by curbing Amazon\u2019s anticompetitive stratagems.As e-commerce becomes a more important part of the U.S. retail landscape, questions like this will inevitably become more pressing. If small businesses are to survive in the digital age, the online economy can\u2019t be allowed to be winner-take-all.Disclosure: I own a very small stake (less than 1 percent) in a very small company that Amazon so far has ignored.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. \n\nDisclosure: I own a very small stake (less than 1 percent) in a very small company that Amazon so far has ignored. \n","39":"China drops clauses in draft that threatened its tech sector. Foreign companies may need to forge new contracts with locals China is planning to approve new rules for foreign investment in the country this week, a sweeping overhaul of regulations that will affect corporate titans from Ford to Alibaba and Tencent.The regulations are slated for passage Friday by the National People\u2019s Congress during a once-a-year gathering of legislators to seal the country\u2019s most important policies. Key pillars of the new law will remove a major threat to investors in its massive technology sector, while putting thousands of overseas companies on notice they may need to renegotiate joint ventures in China.In the latest draft, Beijing dropped language that would have invalidated the so-called \u201cvariable-interest entity\u201d structures employed by Chinese tech giants from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. But it\u2019s also proposing to scrap special laws governing Sino-foreign tie-ups -- a move that could force them to re-examine longstanding contracts, lawyers say.Those twin strands emerged from China\u2019s Foreign Investment Law, intended to govern every aspect of the world\u2019s No. 2 economy for global investors. This particular edict has gained newfound significance as tensions flare between Beijing and Washington; the revisions to VIEs and JVs were little-noticed amid an array of other moves that span curbs on forced technology transfers to leveling the playing field for foreign firms.In the case of VIEs, the missing language assuages concerns about a corporate structure that circumvented foreign-ownership restrictions. The model has never been formally endorsed by Beijing but has been used by tech titans such as Alibaba to list their shares overseas.Pioneered by Sina Corp. and its investment bankers during its 2000 initial public offering, the VIE framework rests on shaky legal ground and foreign investors were thus nervous their bets would unwind overnight.The original version of the legislation was dubbed by a number of \u201chysterical commentators as \u2018the VIE killer,\u2019\u201d said Mark Schaub, a partner at King & Wood Mallesons.\u201cHowever, as its successor has dropped any reference to VIEs, we believe it should be business as usual. China\u2019s regulatory position on VIEs may still evolve, but we do not believe there will be a U-turn, \u201d Schaub said.How China\u2019s Foreign IPOs Use Legal Twist to Tap Investors: QuickTakeThe elimination of wording around VIEs also suggests it\u2019s not mandatory that internet companies need to be controlled by Chinese nationals, according to Will Cai, head of Asia Capital Markets at Cooley LLP. For the past four years, Chinese tech companies going public have operated under that very assumption, as suggested in previous drafts, he said.However, it may be a matter of time before Beijing revisits the matter of VIEs, argued Adrian Lv and He Huanhao at Han Kun Law Offices, one of the country\u2019s more prolific tech deal advisers. \u201cThe current legislation temporarily sets aside issues that still remain controversial but are relatively less urgent,\u201d they wrote. The latest draft allows for future rules to address such issues, they said.While tech companies and their backers wrestle with that, another key section of the legislation may have far-reaching consequences for the country\u2019s 300,000-plus foreign joint ventures.If Beijing rescinds dedicated legislation as feared, joint venture partners may be forced to draw up new contracts within five years to comply with the more general company law. In principle, it creates a more level playing field. Yet it also raise issues around execution.\u201cThere will be a period of time without necessary implementing rules and regulations to follow,\u201d the European Chamber of Commerce said in a statement in response to a recent draft of the law, which included the scrapping of JV regulations. \u201cIt is therefore necessary for relevant government departments to introduce more detailed supporting regulations as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition.\u201dJoint ventures in China are particularly common in older industries such as automobiles, transport, energy and finance. The model was designed to bring in technical expertise from overseas while giving multinationals greater scope to operate in the world\u2019s most populous nation. China had 331,829 joint ventures between local and foreign companies at the end of 2017, according to the Ministry of Commerce.The potential headache lies not so much in any actual changes required, but the fact that many may need to amend existing contracts to comply -- and that could open everything for negotiation, including fundamental commercial agreements, according to Gordon Milner, a partner with Morrison Foerster LLP.\u201cIt\u2019s like re-opening wedding vows. If you have to repeat the wedding vows, maybe your partner doesn\u2019t want to stick by the same terms anymore,\u201d said Paul McKenzie, managing partner at the law firm. \u201cSome of the world\u2019s largest automobile makers and chemical companies, among other international businesses, will be impacted.\u201dForeign firms that control their ventures may take advantage of the new regime to eradicate \u201cinflexibility,\u201d King & Wood Mallesons\u2019s Schaub said. He cited the need to secure directors\u2019 unanimous consent to amend company articles, adjust capital, or even just to dissolve the venture. \u201cLikely, the Chinese partners may also seek to adopt the new law if they are in a controlling position.\u201dCompanies are still studying the potential effects and aren\u2019t yet sure how it would impact existing ventures, said Xu Heyi, chairman of Daimler AG\u2019s partner Beijing Automotive Group Co. Changan Auto, which is allied with Ford Motor Co., said a half-decade should be more than enough time to avert disruption.\u201cI can\u2019t speculate about what sort of changes will come after five years,\u201d President Zhu Huarong said. \u201cOur partners so far haven\u2019t expressed any interest in increasing their stake.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Lulu Yilun Chen, Ying Tian, and Xiaoqing Pi ","40":"\u2018Let\u2019s get the bull out of the China shop\u2019: investment chief.

That is what it is. Let\u2019s get the bull out of the China shop.\u201dRead more: Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya Crisis, ExplainedThaung Tun hewed to the official line: The situation is centuries old and complicated, Rohingya militants are to blame for attacks on locals and Myanmar can\u2019t accept terrorism. Rather than pointing fingers, he said, the international community should work with Myanmar to help solve the crisis and develop the country.The audience erupted in applause.The scene showed the differing approaches between Asia and the West in dealing with Myanmar, a country that has largely underwhelmed investors since opening up with democratic reforms in 2010. The slow pace of change in sectors from banking to aviation to insurance has kept large parts of the country\u2019s $70 billion economy off limits for many foreign investors.The Rohingya crisis has only made things worse. Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader and a former political prisoner for many years, has seen her international image suffer as she\u2019s defended the military against what the United Nations called a \u201ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing\u201d in the western state of Rakhine.That has contributed to a significant lag in Western money coming into Myanmar. Companies from the European Union and U.S. collectively invested $894 million for the fiscal year through March 2018, according to the latest available data from Myanmar\u2019s government. That compares with $4.7 billion from companies based in Asia.Foreign investment from major Asian countries far exceeds Western investmentSource: Central Statistical Organization, Myanmar Ministry of Planning and FinanceNote: Foreign investment by permitted enterprises by country of origin, April 2017-March 2018.\u201cTo the West, Rakhine equals Myanmar and Myanmar equals Rakhine, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything else,\u201d said Serge Pun, a local tycoon who is chairman of Serge Pun & Associates. \u201cWhereas the East has another lens, and that is Rakhine is a problem. But Rakhine is a small part of Myanmar, and there is still Myanmar left, and we should engage and not isolate. We should help and not punish.\u201dSuu Kyi didn\u2019t mention the crisis in her remarks at the Invest Myanmar summit. While Western investors mostly steered clear of the event, representatives from Chinese and Japanese companies interacted with local businessmen.\u201cWe will be together with the Myanmar people,\u201d Kunio Negishi, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Myanmar, said to applause during a panel discussion at the summit.That sentiment was echoed by Yuan Shaobin, the managing director of Citic Group (Myanmar) Co. \u201cThe politicians of Myanmar can solve this,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cAnd this will happen when Myanmar is developed.\u201dWestern investors have other reasons than Rohingya to stay away from Myanmar. The country\u2019s problems range from a lack of electricity -- less than one-third of households have access to it -- to protectionist laws that shut off vast sectors of the economy. Suu Kyi\u2019s civilian government also must share power with the military, and has scant experience in governing.Yet the troubles in Rakhine state could still impact Myanmar\u2019s investment climate, only a few years after sanctions were lifted following decades of overt military rule. The European Union, for example, has threatened to reinstate tariffs on goods such as garments due to the genocide allegations.Myanmar\u2019s security forces systematically murdered, tortured, gang-raped and enslaved thousands of civilians, while also setting fire to entire communities in violation of international law, according to a UN Human Rights Council-mandated fact-finding mission\u2019s report released last August. It recommended that Myanmar\u2019s top generals be investigated and prosecuted for committing genocide and war crimes. Myanmar has denied the allegations.More recently, Myanmar has been criticized for jailing two Reuters journalists who were reporting on a massacre of Rohingya. The two journalists were sentenced to seven years for possession of state secrets even though a police officer admitted he had been ordered to frame them. Suu Kyi has refused to engineer a pardon.\u201cThe Reuters journalists -- it\u2019s absolutely horrible,\u201d said Thiri Thant Mon, the country representative of Myanmar for CDC Group, a development finance institution owned by the British government. \u201cThey\u2019re shooting themselves in the foot.\u2019\u2019Myanmar\u2019s government had little alternative but to look east if western investors are reluctant to put money down, according to Thura Ko Ko, a private equity investor who returned to Myanmar after being educated in the U.K.\u201cBut as investors, we also need the government to recognize that there are elephants in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cGone are the days when they can ignore it, and they need to address it.\u201d ","41":"Move seen as tactical ahead of April 14 general election. Sipila\u2019s Center Party has been losing support in the polls Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila stepped down just weeks before a general election after failing to push through parliament plans to overhaul health services and social care in the face of an aging population.The former businessman tendered his resignation to President Sauli Niinisto, who asked him to stay on as caretaker until the April 14 vote.Juha Sipila The decision is seen as a tactical move that will allow his Center Party a freer hand during the election campaign in the northernmost euro country.\u201cThe collapse of the government is in a way surprising, but also understandable,\u201d said Pasi Kuoppamaki, chief economist at Danske Bank A\/S in Helsinki. \u201cNow the coalition partners can focus on campaigning for the elections without needing to cooperate closely. There will be no major impact on the economy.\u201dSipila\u2019s decision is also an admission that the government was unable to rally enough support to push its pro-market reforms through parliament.Statistics Finland has estimated that more than a quarter of the population will be aged over 65 by 2030, making a more cost-effective welfare state a top priority. The government\u2019s plan involved a drastic re-organization of the way health care is administered at local level -- with control being transferred from today\u2019s 190 local authorities to 18 newly established counties -- as well as a greater role for the private sector.\u201cThe collapse of the reform is a massive disappointment,\u201d Sipila said at a press conference in Helsinki on Friday. \u201cWe have been under a lot of pressure from the European Union to get this done, but there wasn\u2019t enough time.\u201dThe prime minister came under fire from the nationalist Finns Party, a former ally, which accused him of playing \u201ca shameful trick\u201d on the electorate.\u201cPrime Minister Sipila tendered the government\u2019s resignation today citing the collapse of the health and social care reform, even though the real reason was the decline in the popularity of Sipila and his Center Party,\u201d Finns Party member of parliament Ville Tavio said in an emailed statement.The opposition Social Democrats have been leading in the polls while support for Sipila\u2019s Center Party has fallen to its lowest level since 2011. Sipila has been heading a center-right alliance with Finance Minister Petteri Orpo\u2019s National Coalition and a junior partner, Blue Reform.During its tenure, the government has overseen an economic revival and pushed through an unpopular reform aimed at boosting productivity by making employees work more for the same pay.But the health reform plan has had a rocky road, running several times into constitutional obstacles, and the government has also come under fire over a scandal involving neglect at nursing homes.Valtteri Ahti, head of research for fixed income and currencies Finland at Danske Bank A\/S, said Sipila\u2019s unsurprising resignation was unlikely to affect the country\u2019s bond market.The government has \u201cfaced up with reality and decided to jettison the unpopular reforms,\u201d Ahti said.Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea Bank Abp in Helsinki, said the news \u201cdoesn\u2019t really affect the outlook for Finnish politics or policies,\u201d although \u201cthe headlines might still raise questions among some foreign investors.\u201d ","42":"Deutsche Bank-led group met Irish Finance Minister Donohoe. Ireland capped bank pay, banned bonuses at bailed-out banks Paschal Donohoe, Ireland&apos;s finance ministerIrish bank pay caps and bonus restrictions are now a major worry, a group of investors told Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, as the government weighs whether to ease pay caps at bailed-out lenders.Donohoe met a shareholder group brought together by Deutsche Bank AG in Dublin on Nov. 22. At the meeting, investors told Donohoe that restrictions on executive pay at AIB Group Plc and other partly state-owned lenders are \u201cnow a huge concern\u201d even as they recognized the political sensitivity around easing restrictions, according to an internal summary of feedback prepared for the minister.The documents were released to Bloomberg News through a Freedom of Information Act request.The group of six investors, led by Deutsche Bank\u2019s David Lock and Rolf Zartner, highlighted the decline in AIB\u2019s stock after Chief Executive Officer Bernard Byrne resigned in October, the summary noted. Among the group planning to attend the meeting were representatives from Artemis Investment Management LLP, Citadel LLC and M&G Investments.AIB shares fell as much as 1.5 percent to 3.97 euros, and traded at 4.02 euros at 11:21 a.m. in Dublin.The Irish government caps salaries at 500,000 euros ($545,500) and banned bonuses at AIB, Bank of Ireland Group Plc and Permanent TSB Group Holdings Plc as part of state bailouts during the financial crisis. Even if bonuses are reinstated, payments over 20,000 euros would face an 89 percent super tax. Donohoe rejected an AIB plan to reinstate bonuses last year.The government has hired Korn\/Ferry International to review the caps. While that review may recommend easing the constraints, Donohoe told Bloomberg News in January he had no plans to ease the restrictions.Before the meeting, a briefing note prepared for Donohoe highlighted that while the restrictions \u201care having an impact on recruitment and retention\u201d for the banks, \u201cthe politics of this are very difficult\u201d which left him unable to make \u201cpromises\u201d in relation to the pay caps.On the timing of future bank share sales, investors \u201ctook comfort\u201d that Donohoe remained committed to selling down the government\u2019s stakes according to the notes. He underlined it was important to execute \u201ca series of successful transactions rather than focusing on getting the next one completed,\u201d the summary said. ","43":"First it was chess. Then Jeopardy! Now AI turns to debating. A six-year effort ended in a 25-minute argument over preschool International Business Machines Corp. fell short in its latest attempt to prove machines can triumph over man. But it came close.The tech giant\u2019s six-year-old artificial intelligence debating system, affectionately dubbed \u201cMiss Debater,\u201d went head-to-head with one of the world\u2019s most decorated practitioners Monday. After a 25-minute rapid-fire exchange about pre-school subsidies -- during which the female-voiced AI showed flashes of very homo sapien humor -- the audience handed the victory to 31-year-old Harish Natarajan.The unorthodox contest marked the latest highly marketed man-versus-machine challenge. In 1996, IBM created a computer system that beat a chess grandmaster for the first time. In 2011, its Watson supercomputer defeated two record-winning Jeopardy! contestants. And Alphabet Inc.\u2019s AlphaGo famously proved AI can master the ancient and intricate game of Go. But debating -- which requires creativity and emotive elocution -- has proven more elusive.IBM\u2019s machine -- known formally as Project Debater -- kicked off Monday\u2019s match-up with a cheeky greeting. \u201cI have heard you hold the world record in debate competition wins against humans, but I suspect you have never debated a machine. Welcome to the future.\u201dArtificial Intelligence Is Scary, Boring and Useful: QuickTakeThe event unfolded in front of hundreds of journalists, tech industry insiders, and software engineers at IBM\u2019s Think conference in downtown San Francisco. The topic: We should subsidize preschools. While spectators voted Natarajan the victor they also said IBM\u2019s machine better enriched their knowledge.Both contestants were given the topic at the same time and had 15 minutes to pare down arguments into a four-minute speech, four-minute rebuttal and two-minute summary. Standing at human height, Project Debater\u2019s ominous black box remained silent except for three rotating blue circles as it mulled over 10 billion sentences from news articles and scientific journals. Facing her onstage, Natarajan scrawled notes on scrap paper.While the AI lost, the event was a culmination of sorts for the project\u2019s progenitor Noam Slonim. Sitting in the front row on Monday night, the IBM researcher could be seen laughing and cringing during the proceedings. He knew they were the underdogs: Natarajan holds the world record for most debate competition victories and has attended three world championships, winning the European tournament in 2012.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting there in the audience with your kid on stage competing against a world-class pianist and everybody is watching,\u201d he said. Unlike chess or Jeopardy, debating requires connecting with people and convincing them of a viewpoint. Delivery is key and \u201cthis is human territory.\u201dProject Debater used research and quotes from politicians to support her argument that subsidizing preschools isn\u2019t just a matter of finance, but a moral and political duty to protect some of society\u2019s most vulnerable children. Natarajan countered that, too often, subsidies function as politically motivated giveaways to the middle class.The biggest advantage any human holds over Project Debater is the ability to deliver speech with emotion, wielding tone, inflection, pitch and pauses to sway an audience. A week ago in London, Natarajan predicted he might have the edge. \u201cI imagine at this stage a human would still find it easier to construct logical arguments than a machine would in a way which is reasonably convincing to a human audience,\u201d he said at the time.But the track record of humans vanquished by AI played on Natarajan\u2019s mind in the lead-up to the debate. He\u2019d watched \u201cAlphaGO,\u201d a documentary about the contest between AI and the world\u2019s top Go player, who was overconfident and wound up losing four games to one. Natarajan realized \u201cthe hubris with which humans sometimes take playing against a machine.\u201dRead more: Alphabet Machine Beats World\u2019s Top Go Player in a Victory for AISlonim hatched the idea of Project Debater in 2011 while Watson\u2019s victory in Jeopardy still resonated. The following year, he led a research team in Israel that began studying the way humans learn the art of debate, and built a system to mirror that process. Their machine scans more than 300 million newspaper articles and scientific journals to identify relevant arguments on any given topic. It then has to determine which facts and opinions are for or against, build a speech and deliver it in a clear and cohesive manner. What\u2019s more, the AI then has to comprehend her opponent\u2019s argument and craft a rebuttal.Project Debater gets us closer to realizing the dream of AI pioneer and British mathematician Alan Turing. In 1950, the founder of modern computing raised the question of whether or not machines could think for themselves. He predicted one day we would hold a conversation with a computer and not be able to tell the difference between human and machine.Miss Debater still needs some work. Longer-term, Slonim and his fellow researchers, Ranit Aharonov and Talia Gershon, are exploring whether AI can help expand the human mind. For instance, Project Debater may one day help lawyers pore through thousands of court cases to form closing arguments, or help children develop critical thinking skills.\u201cThink about it for a moment. We don\u2019t often see a machine having an intelligent discussion with a human for 25 minutes,\u201d Slonim said.IBM\u2019s shares are up 20 percent this year.

GIC declined to comment, while an official for Coinbase also declined to comment.With the foray into digital assets, possibly its first, GIC joins a select group of large sophisticated investors including Yale University willing to dip their toes into the crypto industry. Most institutional money managers have shunned digital assets because they\u2019re largely unregulated and have been used to finance illicit trade.GIC has more than $100 billion of assets in over 40 countries and has investments in everything from government bonds to private equity.Coinbase\u2019s October funding round gave it a valuation of $8 billion, placing it among the ranks of the world\u2019s most-valuable startups.

The debt ceiling is currently suspended and is scheduled to come back into effect on March 2.\"With a large inflow of tax revenues in April, those extraordinary measures would enable the Treasury to continue financing the government\u2019s activities for several months,\" CBO said in a report. \"However, if the debt limit remains unchanged, the ability to borrow using those measures will ultimately be exhausted, and the Treasury will probably run out of cash near the end of this fiscal year or early in the next one.\"CBO said that after the extraordinary measures run out, the Treasury would have to delay payments, default on payments or both. The measures could run out earlier or later than the estimated time period, CBO said.The next fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley predicted on Monday that Congress probably wouldn\u2019t need to deal with the debt ceiling until around then. He said lawmakers likely would raise the debt limit as part of a deal on budget caps for fiscal 2020.Earlier Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told reporters he has told Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that he would back a debt ceiling increase without seeking any policy concessions.\u201cI\u2019ve made it very clear that the debt limit is a phony issue,\" Hoyer said, adding that the limit needs to be raised periodically because of spending already enacted by Congress.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said he would like to see budget cuts in any bill to raise the debt ceiling, given the $22 trillion national debt.\u201cNow is a perfect opportunity to have a bipartisan agreement on how to lower the long-term debt of America,\u201d McCarthy said. ","48":" When British housing association\u00a0London & Quadrant needed a 100 million-pound ($132\u00a0million) loan last year, its bank offered something unusually generous: A discount on interest if L&Q met an annual target of helping 600 unemployed residents find work.Eight months later, L&Q, which builds and rents out affordable housing in London, is already more than 75 percent of the way there, putting it on course to unlock\u00a0savings from its lender, BNP Paribas SA.While it\u2019s hard to imagine the world\u2019s profit-driven banks offering incentives for doing good, corporate lending tied to some measurable sustainability metric\u2014like cutting emissions or reducing food waste\u2014surged eight-fold in 2018 to $36.4 billion, according to Bloomberg NEF.These European and U.S. companies are tying loans to sustainability targetsSource: BloombergThere always seems to be a catch in finance, and while this time is no different, it may be more palatable. The fact is that people are now investing more than $23 trillion\u00a0in socially responsible ways, according to the Global Sustainability Investment Alliance, and lenders can\u2019t ignore them if they want to stay relevant.\u201cIf this catches on, it is going to be the next big investment opportunity,\u201d\u00a0said Kajetan Czy\u017c, the program director for sustainable finance at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Institute for Sustainability Leadership. \u201cBanks need to adapt to this new suite of opportunities this shift creates.\u201dIn a few years, banks that fill their loan books with so-called positive-incentive deals could be better placed to not only attract clients, like sustainability conscious millennials, but also lower funding costs.That\u2019s because loans tied to what the industry refers to as ESG\u2014environmental, social and governance\u2014usually go to companies that have track records of profitability and debt repayment. L&Q, for one, has an A3 rating at Moody\u2019s Investors Service and other borrowers like Belgian chemicals giant Solvay SA, French food company Danone SA, hotel operator Accor SA and Thames Water Ltd. are all investment grade.\u201cSustainability topics are increasingly included in conversations with clients,\u201d\u00a0said Cecile Moitry, the Paris-based sustainable finance director at BNP Paribas, which was involved in at least 10 such deals last year according to data compiled by Bloomberg.New sustainable loans are taking off, but green bonds still kingSource: BloombergNEFNote: 2019 global data as of Feb. 25Up until now, banks have dabbled in \"responsible banking\" only symbolically. For more than a decade, they\u2019ve arranged green bonds and green loans, used by companies to raise cash for environmental projects. But even last year\u2019s $182 billion of green debt sales paled in comparison to over $6 trillion in global bond issuance.That said, the new style of ESG lending that took off in 2018 could be a game changer, according to Dan Shurey, who leads Bloomberg NEF\u2019s green and sustainable finance research. In just one year, these loans led the 26 percent increase in sustainable debt fundraising to a record $247 billion.By allowing companies to use the cash raised for anything they want, ESG lending resolves one of the key issues preventing broader adoption of green bonds and greens loans. It\u2019s the pricing of the facility, not the money itself, that\u2019s tied to a socially responsible objective.\u201cAn explicit price advantage was always the missing piece for green bonds,\u201d\u00a0said Shurey, who predicts volumes of ESG loans in 2019 will \u201cvastly surpass\u201d\u00a02018. \u201cIncentives for corporate borrowers are key for scaling the market.\u201dAt the start, the interest rates on ESG loans look\u00a0a lot like standard ones might. Then the rate changes depending on how well the company performs against its annual sustainability target. Meet the goal, interest rates drop. But\u00a0miss the target, and they go up.\u00a0Pricing details of these loans aren\u2019t usually disclosed so it\u2019s hard to gauge how big of an incentive they offer to companies.Still, Xylem Inc., a U.S. maker of water equipment, said March 5 that it got an incentive of as much as 5 basis points on a $800 million revolving facility tied to a sustainability rating from Sustainalytics.\u201cThis is a new world for most financiers and treasury teams\u201dSustainable lending is\u00a0still tiny in the grand scheme of finance, accounting for only 7 percent of the $507 billion of company loans in Europe last year. Its share is even smaller in $1.2 trillion U.S. corporate loan market, although some big deals\u2014like the $3.5 billion ESG financing San Francisco-based warehouse developer Prologis Inc. signed in January\u2014are putting ESG on the map.There are hurdles to more mainstream adoption, such as the lack of agreement on how to objectively gauge a company\u2019s social responsibility. While some loans are tied to a measurable metric, or key performance indicator (like CO2 emissions), others rely on ratings from one of more than a dozen agencies, including MSCI, Sustainalytics, RepRisk and the ISS Environmental & Social QualityScore.Problem is, the scoring methods aren\u2019t consistent. In July, U.S. think tank American Council for Capital Formation released a critical report after finding a correlation of 0.32 between the sustainability ratings of MSCI and Sustainalytics on companies in the S&P Global 1200 Index. By comparison, credit ratings of Moody\u2019s and S&P Global Ratings are 0.90 aligned, it said.\u201cThis is a new world for most financiers and treasury teams,\u201d\u00a0said Peter Elleman, the managing director for loan markets at ABN Amro NV in London, which is now lending in this space. He said having proof of a company\u2019s social responsibility is a \u201ca good indicator of good governance, and hence likely lower credit risk.\u201dWhether ESG lending ends up being a breakthrough in sustainable finance or a temporary fad, companies like the idea of extra cash. London utility Thames Water raised a 1.4 billion pound five-year loan in December tied to its Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark rating. Any interest savings will go to its charitable fund, which donates to causes related to water and the environment.While L&Q wouldn\u2019t say how much it expects to save when its five-year loan is repriced, its director of treasury, Martin Watts, called the discount \u201csignificant.\u201d It\u00a0needs to get at least\u00a0600 unemployed residents back into work in the first financial year, starting\u00a0April, to unlock savings, with the goal rising by 25 in each subsequent year.\u201cIt will make a material difference to our funding costs,\u201d\u00a0Watts said. ","49":"Whistle-blower is Minnesota bond adviser with checkered past. Johan Rosenberg was involved but never charged in past cases In 2015, Johan Rosenberg was granted U.S. Patent No. 8,935,181 on an unusual invention: software that he claimed could ferret out Wall Street chicanery.With the help of MuniPriceTracker, Rosenberg combed through thousands of deals in the vast U.S. municipal-bond market.Now, after working for years under a cloak of anonymity, Rosenberg has finally stepped forward -- and put his name to some startling allegations. He says 16 banks colluded to set the interest rates artificially high on a certain kind of municipal debt, potentially profiting at taxpayers\u2019 expense.The claims are all the more remarkable because they\u2019re coming from Rosenberg, 52, whose former muni advisory firm in Minnesota had its own brush with trouble.Three false-claims lawsuits, in Illinois, Massachusetts, and California, are demanding $3.6 billion in damages. They were filed by an entity called Edelweiss Fund LLC, which was revealed Friday for the first time to be Rosenberg. He stands to get millions of dollars if he wins the suits. The Bond Buyer was first to identify him. Rosenberg confirmed to Bloomberg News that he is behind the litigation.\u201cThese are very serious allegations that are being made, and it creates very significant exposure for the defendants,\u201d said Lane Vines, senior counsel at Berger Montague who specializes in securities fraud and isn\u2019t involved in the lawsuits.The allegations that banks colluded to keep interest rates high could upend a $150 billion corner of the municipal-bond market. They come after findings of manipulation in the global foreign-exchange market and in setting Libor, the London interbank offered rate. Those scandals cost dozens of traders their jobs and banks billions in fines and penalties.Read more: How Cities Say Bank Bond \u2018Robots\u2019 Ripped Them OffThe Illinois complaint, originally filed in 2014 and refiled in 2017, alleges eight banks cost debt issuers in the state $349 million between 2009 and 2013. It asks for the banks named to pay triple that amount.The city of Philadelphia last month sued seven banks over similar allegations that they colluded to fix prices on the debt. The lawsuit says that a whistle-blower in 2015 and 2016 began meeting with the federal authorities such as the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division, which it says opened a preliminary criminal investigation that is \u201congoing.\u201dLast month, a judge refused a request from the banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., to dismiss the case. The banks argued that Edelweiss\u2019 analysis was \u201csubjective and arbitrary\u201d and that it used \u201ccherry-picked\u201d data. The banks declined to comment further.The Massachusetts lawsuit, filed in 2014, alleges four of the banks overcharged more than $100 million and asks for them to pay triple that amount. The California lawsuit, which was filed against 13 banks and unsealed in December, asks for the banks to pay about $2 billion.Edelweiss spent \u201csignificant resources\u201d over multiple years to analyze variable-rate muni debt and expose the banks\u2019 alleged fraud, according to a September filing as part of the Illinois suit.Rosenberg is no stranger to controversy. In 2006, federal investigators executed a search warrant at his firm, the Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Sound Capital Management, as part of a criminal investigation of whether banks and financial firms conspired to rig bids for investment deals with local governments.More than a dozen people from companies including Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan and UBS Group AG pleaded guilty in the investigation by the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division. Rosenberg was never charged.A former JPMorgan banker, James Hertz, admitted to fraud and conspiracy in 2010. In his plea hearing, Hertz said Rosenberg\u2019s Sound Capital Management told him how to change his bids in order to win deals.At the time, Rosenberg disputed Hertz\u2019s characterization.\u201cEvery situation can be interpreted two ways,\u201d he told Bloomberg News. \u201cSound Capital continues to stand by its practices.\u201dA class action complaint brought by states and municipalities in 2009 against a group of banks and brokers that included Sound Capital alleged that Rosenberg advised a Bank of America employee who served as a confidential witness in the case about the bid levels of other banks.Sound Capital was dissolved in 2013, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State\u2019s Office. Blue Rose Capital Advisors was formed at the same address, according to the office.The fraud Rosenberg alleges in the muni market centers on what\u2019s called variable-rate demand obligations, or VRDO.Banks reset the interest rates periodically, walking a fine line between satisfying investors with high rates and keeping government issuers happy with low ones. If investors decide to bail, it\u2019s up to the bank to find a new buyer. That gives them incentive to keep rates high, the Illinois lawsuit says.According to the lawsuit, banks are supposed to consider rates individually for each security, but instead sorted the bonds into buckets and set interest rates by group without considering market conditions. The lawsuits note Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board regulations require dealers and brokers to make an effort to get a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d price for municipal clients that reflects the market.Proving the banks worked together to inflate interest rates on the debt will be tough, said Robert Brooks, a University of Alabama finance professor. He compared the situation to four gas stations located on the same corner all charging the same price.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily prove collusion,\u201d he said.In the case of variable-rate muni debt, interest rates stayed historically low during the time Rosenberg examined them, so it\u2019s unlikely there would be major differences in the resets by the banks, Brooks said. From 2009 through 2015, the main gauge of variable-rate municipal yields averaged about 0.17 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Neither Illinois, Massachusetts nor California has joined Rosenberg\u2019s lawsuit. That doesn\u2019t necessarily cast doubt on his allegations, said Randall Fox, a partner at Kirby McInerney LLP who focuses on whistle-blower claims and isn\u2019t involved in the lawsuits brought by Rosenberg. States don\u2019t intervene in such cases for a variety of reasons that may be unrelated to the strength of the argument, such as the resources or priorities of the state attorneys general offices, Fox said.Though it deals with the complicated world of municipal financing, the underlying premise would be easy to explain to a jury, Fox said.\u201cWhat this case is about is that the banks made a promise, a couple of promises, about how it would conduct itself in handling these bonds for the municipalities and the state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t live up to those promises.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Joe Mysak, and Martin Z Braun ","50":" China\u2019s annual gathering of leaders that started in Beijing this week unleashed a flurry of policy initiatives, key among them a shift that puts fiscal policy decisively at the forefront of measures to shore up growth.Among other important changes was a ramped up focus on reining in hidden debt, an intensification of the drive to get more funding to private companies, and more evidence that President Xi Jinping\u2019s plan to dominate future industries is very much alive. There also were indications that China is unlikely to make big concessions during trade negotiations with the U.S.Xi Jinping\u201cThe government is relying more on fiscal policy to support growth but this is not your old fiscal policy,\u201d said Trey McArver, co-founder of Beijing-based research firm Trivium China. \u201cInstead of big infrastructure outlays, it\u2019s an incredibly pro-business agenda.\u201dHere are summaries of five key policy shifts that unfolded in the first week:By turning to fiscal policy to shore up growth, Premier Li Keqiang underscored his determination to avoid a repeat of past credit blowouts. But while the budget deficit target of 2.8 percent of gross domestic product is just 0.2 percent higher than last year\u2019s target, economist say it\u2019s bigger than it looks.The almost 2 trillion yuan of tax cuts announced is unprecedented and Finance Minister Liu Kun said Thursday the actual amount may be higher.

To that end, the nation\u2019s largest policy bank is being drafted in to help resolve the problem. China Development Bank, one of the nation\u2019s three policy lenders with 16 trillion yuan ($2.4 trillion) in assets at the end of 2017, is working with the Ministry of Finance on some specific cases of hidden local government debt, the bank\u2019s president Zheng Zhijie said in Beijing Tuesday. Zhenjiang, a city in Jiangsu province, has been considered as a test case for debt restructuring with cheap funding from the CDB, Bloomberg reported last month.Zheng ZhijieXi\u2019s plan to dominate future industries wasn\u2019t mentioned by name in two main economic planning reports totaling 103 pages. Yet the spirit of the controversial Made in China 2025 plan, a flash point in relations with the U.S. that featured prominently in the reports last year, is still there between the lines. Both reports had the same underlying message about China\u2019s intention to step up research and development into big data and artificial intelligence, as well as fostering emerging industries such as next-generation information technology, high-end equipment, bio-medicine, new energy automobiles and new materials -- all core elements of the Made in China 2025 plan.Lou JiweiChina has been mostly silent on the state of trade negotiations with the U.S. even as Donald Trump urges his negotiators to close a deal with China soon. So it took former finance minister Lou Jiwei to warn the world that China won\u2019t make big concessions.

Both have lost ground of late as Ukrainians fed up with endemic corruption turn to fresh candidates unsullied by previous stints in government.But while his inexperience counts in his favor, victory would leave 41-year-old Zelenskiy -- who plays a fictional president on the hit show Servant of the People and also runs a TV-production company -- facing some tough issues.

The complaint landed days after finance chief Meng Wanzhou sued Canada\u2019s government for allegedly trampling her constitutional rights during her December arrest -- an effort to discredit the case against her as she awaits potential extradition to the U.S. for bank fraud.The White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.Meng WanzhouIn its U.S. case, Huawei is taking aim at a provision in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. That provision bars any executive agency, government contractor or company that receives a government loan or grant from using Huawei and ZTE equipment, according to the complaint. The Chinese company argues that the provision is a bill of attainder, a legislative punishment without trial that\u2019s prohibited by the U.S. Constitution.\u201cThat\u2019s a very hard argument to win but certainly something that they can try in an effort to slow down the federal government,\u201d Peter Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School, told Bloomberg on a podcast.Legal experts give Huawei\u2019s lawsuit little chance of success based on a recent, similar case filed by Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab Inc.In September 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security directed agencies to stop using Kaspersky\u2019s anti-virus software based on concerns the Russian government could use the programs to spy on federal information systems. President Trump signed the ban Dec. 12, 2017.A Washington DC-based appeals court agreed late last year with a lower court\u2019s rejection of Kaspersky\u2019s argument that the prohibition amounted to an unconstitutional bill of attainder because it addressed a national security vulnerability.Huawei is increasingly in the crosshairs of the U.S. government and its allies, just as it\u2019s pushing for leadership in supplying fifth-generation wireless technology. Countries are preparing to spend billions on the potentially revolutionary equipment aimed at enabling everything from smart highways to self-driving cars. The world\u2019s top provider of networking gear faces the prospect of being shut out of pivotal infrastructure markets. And the clash has complicated negotiations between Washington and Beijing as they try to hammer out a trade deal.Huawei also repeated its argument that a blockade on its gear simply disadvantages Americans.\u201cConsumers in the United States (particularly in rural and poor areas) will be deprived of access to the most advanced technologies, and will face higher prices and a significantly less competitive market,\u201d the company said in the complaint.Washington-based law firm Jones Day is representing Huawei in the lawsuit.Read more: Huawei Goes on Legal Warpath With Twin North American SuitsU.S. officials and industry executives have long harbored questions about Huawei\u2019s ties to China\u2019s government, and concerns about its technology have mounted in lockstep with its growing success. Federal authorities in Seattle are investigating the company for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. partner T-Mobile US Inc., and in December Meng was arrested in Canada on fraud charges linked to Iran trade-sanction violations.\u201cThis is one part of a much broader effort here to confront China over trade secrets theft and how the Chinese government is subsidizing companies and trying to get their products into the United States,\u201d Henning said.The case is Huawei Technologies v.

Revenue would go toward bonds to fund $40 billion transit fix Source: Getty ImagesSource: Getty ImagesPressure to find revenue to finance a $40 billion fix for New York\u2019s subways, buses and regional commuter rail has sparked renewed city and state interest in a tax on wealthy non-residents who own luxury city apartments.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s budget director, Robert Mujica, jump-started the idea Wednesday in a statement that totaled up potential revenue sources for regional transit funding: $15 billion from congestion pricing, $5 billion from Internet sales, and $2 billion from yet-to-be-legalized cannabis. The so-called \u201cpied-\u00e0-terre tax\u201d on non-resident owners could raise as much as $9 billion, Mujica said.\u201cEven that leaves a shortfall to get to the low end of MTA\u2019s capital budget, which is projected at $40 billion,\u201d Mujica said.Mayor Bill de Blasio has preferred a millionaires\u2019 income tax on city residents. Since that proposal hasn\u2019t received support in the legislature, the mayor said Thursday he could back the luxury-apartment tax.\u201cWe need to tax the wealthy more,\u201d the mayor said as he emerged from a subway ride for a news conference to promote congestion pricing fees on motorists entering Manhattan\u2019s central business core. \u201cNow if the governor is saying he thinks there\u2019s a way to additionally get a pied-\u00e0-terre tax, I\u2019m all ears.\u201dUnder a 2014 proposal by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group, such a tax would raise about $665 million annually, requiring part-time New Yorkers to pay surcharges on dwellings valued at more than $5 million. The revenue could then be leveraged into billions of dollars more to pay off bonds for making transit-related capital improvements. Absentee owners pay no city or state income taxes.The proposal has been opposed by the Real Estate Board of New York, the trade group for an industry that accounts for more than 30 percent of the city\u2019s tax revenue. The board has said it would harm the city\u2019s economy by suppressing investment, cutting jobs and lowering demand for high-priced apartment towers.

Morrison last week by pledged A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) for a new climate fund and is funding a hydro-power project.Labor has a more ambitious target to cut emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and has promised A$10 billion in additional funding for the Clean Energy Finance Corp.

","56":"Last-ditch attempt to garner support for EU-wide levy falters. Skeptics fear tax would risk Trump\u2019s ire, hurt competitiveness Europe\u2019s efforts to tax large tech companies were dealt a final blow Tuesday as finance ministers failed to agree on a compromise proposal that would scale back the broad plan initially envisioned by the European Commission and Paris.After nearly two years of discussions over how best to raise money from an industry that they agree provides less than it should to public coffers, European Union finance chiefs couldn\u2019t unanimously support the most recent proposal to tax the EU advertising revenue of digital companies, amid diverging national interests and perceived risks of such a proposal.Instead, focus will now shift to reaching a deal at global level, through work at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\u201cWe did not find an agreement on the digital advertising tax, which is for France a missed opportunity,\" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said after the meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels. \u201cWe have to move on at the OECD level and France will pursue with full determination its willingness of having a new international taxation system which would be fairer and more efficient.\"Despite repeated attempts, the EU has been unable to reach agreement on a proposed 3 percent levy on the European sales of tech companies, amid persistent resistance from countries including Sweden and Ireland. Even the watered-down version of the tax has struggled to garner support, as governments mull how to strike a balance between luring business and addressing popular discontent about companies not paying their fair share.Traditional tax systems have so far failed to capture revenue from companies with global reach but limited physical presence, fueling anger from voters disgruntled after years of austerity and meager wage growth. But tax policies require unanimous agreement from EU countries, making it difficult to agree to new initiatives.Austria and France, two of the leading advocates, have gone ahead with their own domestic proposals, and other proponents of the levy including Italy vowed to do the same.Critics of the levy have argued that the tax risks triggering the ire of President Donald Trump in the midst of a trans-Atlantic trade spat, as most of the affected companies would be U.S-based. Other countries have questioned the wisdom of the EU going it alone with such an initiative and have pushed for work to take place at global level instead.Le Maire said the OECD work could agree to the key features of that digital taxation by the end of this year, with the possibility of entry into force in 2020. His optimism that consensus at OECD level could be adopted was shared by his German counterpart, Olaf Scholz.\u201cIt is very, very likely that we will have a consensus that could be adopted in summer next year in the OECD level,\u201d Scholz said.\u2014 With assistance by Lyubov Pronina ","57":" Any divestiture would need to be tax free to United Technologies shareholders.United Technologies Corp.\u2019s stipulations for  a sale of\u00a0its Carrier climate controls unit point to Johnson Controls International Plc\u00a0as the likeliest potential partner. To justify scrapping a  planned spinoff of Carrier, any divestiture would need to be tax free to United Technologies shareholders, CEO Greg Hayes said Wednesday at a Barclays Plc conference. The most obvious way to do that is through a reverse Morris trust, whereby United Technologies would skirt the high levies typical of sales of legacy assets by instead merging the business with another of roughly equal size. Johnson Controls is the only competitor with sufficient scale to make the math work. The company, which merged with Tyco International in 2016, is  focusing on building controls after agreeing last year to sell its car-battery business. Its building-efficiency unit generated $3.1 billion in operating income in its most recent fiscal year, compared with $3.8 billion for Carrier. Ingersoll-Rand Plc\u2019s climate division and Lennox International Inc. are smaller, with $1.8 billion and just over $500\u00a0million in 2018 operating income, respectively.Johnson Controls has played coy on the topic of consolidation. CEO George Oliver has said the battery sale increases the company\u2019s ability to take advantage of\u00a0strategic options in the HVAC industry, and Johnson Controls\u00a0is keeping up to $8 billion of its proceeds from that deal available for M&A. But separately at the Barclays conference, Oliver said his company had\u00a0already made the investments needed to create a competitive advantage. Hayes has other criteria that could complicate a deal: having just endured a  surprisingly long regulatory review of United Technologies\u2019 $30 billion takeover of avionics maker Rockwell Collins, he wants to be sure of a smooth antitrust process; and he wants full value, which in his mind is a multiple of \u201c12 times or 12.5 times.\u201d Assuming he was using Ebitda multiples, that would imply a valuation for a standalone Carrier business of nearly $50 billion, based on Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s estimate of $3.9 billion in 2020 adjusted Ebitda. For reference, Johnson Controls commands a multiple of 11.4\u00a0times its estimated 2020 Ebitda with a building-products business that\u2019s a profitability laggard. So a multiple that starts with a 12\u00a0seems reasonable for Carrier, but this would obviously be a gargantuan and complicated combination.One caveat\u00a0is that analysts once thought\u00a0United Technologies  would have to spin off or broker a reverse Morris trust for\u00a0its Sikorsky helicopter unit to avoid a hefty tax bill. Instead, it sold Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin Corp. for $9 billion with the buyer paying a premium to compensate United Technologies for the tax burden and finding a way to book a  tax benefit for itself. So alternatives are possible, but more of a long shot. Also of note from Hayes\u2019s presentation was his disclosure that United Technologies had submitted a \u201ccompetitive\u201d bid to supply engines for a middle-market aircraft that Boeing Co. is contemplating. When General Electric Co. CEO Larry Culp was asked about the potential project last month, he said that the company was in\u00a0conversations\u00a0about new platforms but that it would be premature\u00a0to discuss the cash-flow hit such an investment would entail. It\u2019s early days for the middle-market aircraft, and Boeing may yet decide to scrap the idea, but based on the CEOs\u2019 statements, United Technologies seems more prepared. While GE\u2019s aviation unit has been a stronghold, the cash crunch wrought by the issues in its power and finance units risks hamstringing it.STEP BY STEPGE is adding Catherine Lesjak, the former chief financial officer of HP, to its board, effective March 1. This is the second director appointment since Culp became CEO, following the addition of Paula Rosput Reynolds, a former utility and insurance executive, in December. Like Reynolds, Lesjak\u2019s skillset seems well-suited for GE\u2019s challenges. She helped guide HP through a major breakup and, according to the Wall Street Journal, argued against the ill-fated $10.3 billion acquisition of Autonomy Corp. in 2011 because of the damage it would wreak on HP\u2019s balance sheet. She was right \u2014\u00a0\u00a0HP later took an $8.8 billion writedown on the deal and has fought a years-long legal battle accusing Autonomy of inflating its finances \u2014 and her reward was to help clean up the mess. Her experience will be useful as GE deals with its own troubled balance sheet and the ramifications of poor capital allocation choices. But the appointment of Lesjak comes nearly five months after the ouster of former CEO John Flannery reduced the board to 11 members. Reynolds replaced John Brennan, who had previously announced his retirement. There\u2019s a method to this kind of piecemeal change, but the reality is that\u00a0GE needs a deep-rooted cultural overhaul and Culp doesn\u2019t have the luxury of time. Separately, GE may release its 10K filing as soon as Friday evening, if history is a guide, and the company has promised more disclosure on its long-term care insurance headaches.EVERYONE WANTS TO BE AN INDUSTRIAL INVESTOR\u00a0New research from RBC Capital Markets found that machinery and equipment makers have supplanted the so-called FAANG group of technology stocks and drugmakers as the trade of choice among hedge funds. Read the full write-up from Bloomberg News\u2019s Lu Wang  here. To that end, the $11 billion Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund, ticker XLI, experienced an inflow of more than $565 million on Wednesday, its largest since November 2016 when investors wagered President Donald Trump\u2019s election would herald a wave of infrastructure investments (still waiting on that). The surge in interest may have been driven in part by Caterpillar Inc.\u2019s comments that equipment replacement demand in China is at normal levels and that the company isn\u2019t seeing a meaningful impact from trade issues. China\u2019s top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, extended his visit to Washington after hammering out an agreement on currency with the Trump administration, saying through an interpreter that a deal was likely to happen.Apart from trade tensions, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Scott Levine and George Ferguson detect an underlying slowdown in China\u2019s economy and highlight the aerospace, construction and automotive markets as among those that could be hit hardest. At conference presentations this week, executives from 3M Co., Ingersoll-Rand and United Technologies were cautious on China, using phrases such as \u201csofter\u201d, \u201ceyes wide open\u201d and \u201cwarning sign.\u201d And should one trade war end, another may enter a new chapter: Caterpillar trucks are on the list of items the European Union is prepared to slap with retaliatory tariffs should Trump act on a threat to impose duties on cars imported from the region.

The time seems right for an exit, with aerospace suppliers increasingly looking to add scale to counter Boeing\u00a0and Airbus SE\u2019s push for cost cuts.

Rockwell will pay $250 million to Schlumberger for a 53 percent stake in Sensia, while Schlumberger is contributing 100 petrochemical\u00a0engineers and access to its Avocet software platform, among other things. The appeal for Rockwell is that the joint venture\u2019s operations will be less concentrated\u00a0in North America than its existing businesses and will have an Ebitda margin similar to its own 20 percent range. It\u2019s not cheap: Stephens Inc. analyst Rob McCarthy estimates Rockwell\u2019s investment implies an Ebitda multiple of about 15. But one prior criticism of Rockwell was that it wasn\u2019t spending enough for growth\u00a0in the industrial internet of things. The other is that its focus on\u00a0providing assembly-line equipment for the\u00a0automotive and electronic industries made\u00a0its profits subject to volatility. This deal \u2014 and a deeper relationship with Schlumberger in general \u2014 will give Rockwell a helpful leg up into\u00a0process\u00a0automation tools for the petrochemical industries. The irony of this is that the idea of a  one-stop-shopping automation company was  the driver for Emerson Electric Co.\u2019s takeover pursuit of Rockwell in 2017, which the target company vigorously rebuffed.

Alphabet costs are already rising on Google Cloud headcount Google\u2019s cloud boss wants to fix a problem that\u2019s hampered the business for its entire existence. The internet giant has great technology but doesn\u2019t sell it well to large companies.Thomas Kurian, an Oracle Corp. veteran who took over Google Cloud in November, said he will hire more salespeople, train them to specialize on specific industries, and aggressively pursue larger, more traditional companies. He\u2019s also striking new deals with systems integrators -- firms that help organizations execute big IT projects.\u201cA lot of Google\u2019s historical focus was on digital natives,\u201d Kurian said Tuesday, referring to younger firms born on the internet that comfortably embrace cloud services. Kurian will take on the tougher task of persuading bigger, older telecom, retail, health-care, and financial-services companies to rent Google\u2019s offerings over the internet.\u201cYou\u2019ll see us specializing a lot more in these verticals,\" he added at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. tech conference, in one of his first public comments since replacing Diane Greene.Google\u2019s cloud business, which offers computing power, data storage and productivity software like Docs, Sheets and Gmail, trails Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in the massive and growing market. The division is one of Google\u2019s largest besides advertising. It\u2019s a key part of the company\u2019s effort to diversify from a business model that sucks up mountains of user data and is increasingly coming under fire from regulators and privacy advocates.Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has tried to sell cloud services to larger companies for years, and Greene was brought in because of her experience with these customers. In the past three years, Google\u2019s cloud sales force has roughly quadrupled. There have been some big customer wins, but the internet giant still ranks third in the market.Kurian\u2019s strategy for improving this echoed some of Greene\u2019s previous efforts, but his comments suggest Google will focus on a narrower set of industries and create more tailored offerings -- with help from an even larger enterprise sales force. A telecom company will need help monitoring its network and making its call centers more efficient, while a finance firm wants different things, he said.All those news salespeople won\u2019t come cheap though. Headcount and new data centers for the cloud business have already pushed up Google\u2019s costs, making investors nervous.Kurian is also planning to use one of Google\u2019s advantages over Amazon. The online search giant doesn\u2019t compete directly with retailers and the new cloud CEO touted this neutrality as a key selling point. \u201cGoogle is very clear that we\u2019re here to enable partners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to compete with partners.\u201dKurian said he chose to join Google after speaking with the company\u2019s customers. \u201cUniformly, the feedback I got is it\u2019s by far the best technology in the market,\u201d he added.Now he has to persuade big companies to actually use and pay for this technology. If they do, Kurian plans to have their executives speak at conferences and other events to encourage more firms to get on board, creating faster growth down the road.Alphabet shares gained 2.1 percent in New York as the broader stock market climbed on optimism over trade talks and a tentative deal to avert a U.S. government shutdown.

Firm may add more staff after hiring team from Deutsche Bank The Rothschild dynasty is bulking up its German business in a bid to take on larger rivals in the increasingly competitive business of serving wealthy individuals.Rothschild & Co., the Paris-based branch of the family, hired nine people in its German private wealth division last year to bring the total to 40. The company is looking to add to that number, said Reinhard Krafft, who heads the business and sees \u201chigh-growth opportunities\u201d in the country.Reinhard KrafftThe company\u2019s efforts to attract wealthy clients come as competitors including BNP Paribas SA and HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG also expand in Germany\u2019s private-banking market, which is likely to put pressure on profit margins in the industry.Krafft believes his firm\u2019s access to private-equity investments -- with the Rothschild family as co-investor -- can give it an edge when it comes to attracting high-net-worth individuals.The Rothschild family had left Frankfurt more than 100 years ago and didn\u2019t return until 1989 when Rothschild & Co. opened an office in Frankfurt and initially focused on corporate finance. The company ranked among the top advisers of German companies last year in terms of the number of completed transactions, Bloomberg data show.Rothschild & Co. is creating a second pillar to add to its M&A advisory business in the country. The company started with a small private-banking team, Krafft said. \u201cNow we are trying to increase the range in Germany in this area as well.\u201dRothschild & Co. last year added to its German base in Frankfurt by opening a private-wealth office in Dusseldorf, staffed by a team of six people hired from Deutsche Bank AG.The company\u2019s assets under management in Germany have quadrupled in the past five years and, according to Krafft, are now significantly more than 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion). Worldwide, Rothschild\u2019s wealth and asset management business managed nearly 70 billion euros at the end of June.The company traces its roots to the banking dynasty started by Mayer Amschel Rothschild in Frankfurt in the 18th century. He later sent his sons to various capitals across Europe to do business with cash-strapped governments, dealing with railway construction, revolutions and wars. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Frankfurt branch ceased operations.Rothschild & Co. now employs a total of 140 people in Germany.

Sign up here.Big Oil dodged a bullet.Norway took a partial step in divesting oil and gas stocks in its massive $1 trillion wealth fund, approving the sale of smaller exploration companies while sparing the biggest producers such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp.After more than a year of deliberation, the government on Friday approved excluding 150 companies that are held by the fund and classified as exploration and production companies by FTSE Russell. These include Cairn Energy Plc, Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Chesapeake Energy Corp., Cnooc Ltd. and Tullow Oil Plc. The proposal would see the fund sell about $7.5 billion in stocks.Norwegian Finance Minister Siv Jensen discusses the nation\u2019s decision to divesting some oil and gas stocks.\u201cIt reflects to a larger extent the risk we ourselves have -- the bulk of the state\u2019s exposure in Norway is upstream activity,\u201d Finance Minister Siv Jensen said. \u201cWe\u2019re reducing our vulnerability by choosing to withdraw the fund gradually from this segment.\u201dRead more: Norway deals a blow to oil industryThe government goes part of the way in meeting a 2017 proposal from the fund, which rattled global markets by arguing for a full divestment of the sector to limit Norway\u2019s overall exposure to oil. The plan was hailed as a potential huge step by climate activists, some of whom on Friday lamented the limited scope of the decision. It has been a hot-button issue in Norway, which is seeking to project an image as a responsible environmental steward while pumping oil and gas at a fast clip.Sony Kapoor, managing director at think tank Re-Define, said in a message that the limited divestment \u201c\u2018represents a victory of Big Oil lobbying over financial prudence and common sense.\u201dJensen defended her decision to keep the big oil companies in the portfolio, citing their increased investments in renewable energy. Norway\u2019s own oil company, Equinor ASA, is also increasing renewable energy investments, and even recently changed its name from Statoil.\u201cIt would be sad if the pension fund would not be able to invest in those companies in the future,\u201d Jensen said in an interview.The partial move underscores the changing political climate in Norway, where opposition to oil and gas exploration is on the rise. Prime Minister Erna Solberg\u2019s Conservative Party has been a long-time friend to the oil industry. Junior government coalition partner, the Liberals, were supportive even though they had backed a larger divestment.Norway\u2019s Labor Party, the biggest in opposition, also expressed support. \u201cThey are taking a more cautious step than what Norges Bank advised,\u201d said Svein Roald Hansen, a Labor Party legislator. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than no step at all. There seems to have been a tug of war within the government.\u201dThe $1 trillion fund has been built up over the past two decades from oil and gas revenue and Norway also uses large chunks of income from its offshore fields each year to pay for its lavish welfare state. The managers of the fund, which is overseen by the central bank, therefore argued in their proposal that it makes little sense for Norway to be doubly exposed to oil both in its revenue stream and through its investments.\u2014 With assistance by Kelly Gilblom, and Annmarie Hordern ","61":"Wheeler, Nichols signal little progress on auto MPG agreement. State shouldn\u2019t have authority on C02 emissions, Wheeler says U.S. and California officials agreed Monday on one thing about auto emissions standards: they\u2019re still miles from an agreement, with a crucial deadline just two months away.In separate comments, Sacramento and Washington\u2019s top environmental regulators said they\u2019ve yet to overcome a long-running impasse over the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to cap auto emissions and fuel economy standards after 2020 and strip California of its authority to regulate tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions.\u201cWe certainly hope to have a 50-state solution but at the end of the day we have to move forward with regulation,\u201d Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler told Bloomberg Television in an interview Monday, saying the agency and the state remain \u201cpretty far apart\u201d on the issue. \u201cCalifornia is an important player -- an important part of this -- but this is not a two-sided negotiation for a national standard.\u201dAfter briefly meeting with Wheeler in San Francisco on Monday, California Air Resources Board Chairman Mary Nichols said the two sides remain at odds over the proposal and that a fundamental philosophical disagreement exists over the federal proposal to unwind California\u2019s power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from autos.\u201cThat disagreement may turn into a legal disagreement at some point,\u201d Nichols said during remarks at the BloombergNEF Summit San Francisco. \u201cI think it\u2019s also correct to say that we have some reason to hope that we could possibly reach a resolution, not so much because I think we\u2019re going to change their minds through the force of our arguments, as that the auto industry itself has made it very clear that they don\u2019t want this fight. \u201dThe dueling statements highlight the standoff between the Trump administration and California officials over fuel economy and tailpipe carbon emissions standards for automobiles, one of former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature policies to ward off climate change.Wheeler said he would prefer to reach a deal with California, but said the state shouldn\u2019t be able to dictate the requirements. The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have already proposed stripping California of its authority to set its own tailpipe greenhouse gas emission limits for new cars and trucks, a potent bargaining chip to extract concessions from the largest state for U.S. auto sales.In the interview, Wheeler said California should not have that authority.\u201cThat\u2019s why we would love to have a 50-state solution so we wouldn\u2019t have to pull that trigger,\u201d Wheeler said.Why Trump Attacks California\u2019s Anti-Pollution Powers: QuickTakeHe dismissed an earlier counteroffer by California to extend the timeline of the existing requirements, saying it would not lower vehicle prices and improve road safety enough.The dispute began last August, when the EPA and NHTSA proposed capping efficiency standards at a roughly 37-mile-per-gallon fleet average from 2020 through 2026 -- instead of allowing them to rise to almost 50 miles per gallon by 2025 under the existing rules written by the Obama administration.\u201cBut we do have some hard deadlines,\u201d he said, adding \u201cand we are pretty far apart.\u201dWheeler gave no hint of a middle ground before his meeting with Nichols. The administration argues that freezing future fuel economy increases after 2020 would cut car prices and encourage more people to buy newer, safer and cleaner cars.Nichols dismissed the thrust of the EPA and NHTSA\u2019s argument.\u201cThe analysis doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a flat-out a bad argument and they should give it up.\u201dClimate Change Pact That Made History Busted by U.S.: QuickTakeWheeler said the administration must finalize the requirements by early April.California officials, he said, are focusing only on energy efficiency, an indication that the state is prioritizing reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. But Wheeler argued that the impact of California\u2019s rules -- which are followed by at least 12 other states -- on greenhouse gas emissions is \u201cnegligible.\u201dWheeler also distanced himself from President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated suggestions that cold winter weather undermines arguments the planet is warming.Read more: Trump\u2019s Climate Tweets Fail Fact Checking by His Own AgencyAs brutal cold gripped much of the country last week, Trump tweeted that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned global warming right now.\u201d Climate scientists said Trump\u2019s tweet conflated weather -- what\u2019s happening now -- and climate, or weather patterns over longer time periods.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can look at any one weather event and determine whether the planet is warming or cooling,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cI think you have to look at the models overall over a number of years, and you can\u2019t just focus on one particular weather event.\u201dAsked if that meant Trump\u2019s conclusion might be flawed, Wheeler was quick to clarify he wasn\u2019t correcting his boss.\u201cNow, I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more variability in the climate models and the climate data than most people realize, and I think the president is reflecting on that.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Emily Chang ","62":"Budget office says domestic programs in for 5 percent cut. President\u2019s Fiscal 2020 budget set for release next week The U.S. Capitol building is reflected in an ambulance parked outside in Washington, D.C.President Donald Trump will call for sharp cuts in domestic spending that likely will be mostly ignored by Congress even as it sets up a funding fight that risks another government shutdown in the fall.The president in coming days is set to deliver his first budget blueprint since Democrats took control of the House and elected Nancy Pelosi as speaker. The proposal will mark an aggressive opening bid in negotiations over the coming months to lift caps on spending for domestic and defense programs and to increase the $22 trillion federal debt limit. Trump will seek a boost in defense spending by using war contingency funds to get around the budget limits.In each year of his presidency, Trump has proposed deep cuts to domestic agency spending as well as cuts to some entitlement programs, and in each year Congress has ignored them. The unrestrained spending combined with the Republican tax cuts passed last year increased the federal deficit and put it on course to surpass $1 trillion by 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Russ VoughtActing budget director Russ Vought has said the budget will seek a \u201chistoric\u201d five percent decrease in discretionary spending, though the administration has refused to specify whether that is in addition to the nine percent cut that would be forced by the budget caps set to kick in for the 2020 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.Some programs would see even deeper proposed cuts. For example, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy would see its $2.3 billion budget slashed by about 70 percent, to $700 million, according to a Energy Department official familiar with the plan.The White House budget blueprint is sure to hit a wall of opposition from Democrats. During the spending standoff that shut down part of the government for 35 days earlier this year over funding for a border wall, Pelosi and Democratic lawmakers demonstrated they can stand unified against Trump\u2019s demands.Richard ShelbyIt\u2019s liable to hit resistance from Republicans as well. Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama told reporters that even a five percent cut to non-defense spending from current levels would be a \u201cdifficult task.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been here since Jimmy Carter was president and I don\u2019t ever remember a president\u2019s budget being accepted by the Congress,\u201d Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said.Asked if a five percent cut would pass Congress, Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri said, \u201cI\u2019m certain it won\u2019t.\u201dThe budget proposal will be heading to Congress before lawmakers begin what\u2019s sure to be a clash over budget caps, which were set into law as part of legislation that ended a deadlock over the debt ceiling in 2011 . Unless Congress acts to raise them, the $647 billion limit on regular defense spending will fall in 2020 to $576 billion while the non-defense discretionary spending cap will be lowered to $542 billion from $597 billion.The White House has said it would keep the defense cap in place at $576 billion while using a contingency fund for war operations, which isn\u2019t subject to limits, to provide an increase in money for the military.Senate Armed Service Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe told reporters this week he expects the president to budget a whopping $174 billion in contingency funds -- up from $69 billion this year -- to raise total defense spending to $750 billion.Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, said the use of the Overseas Contingency Operations, or OCO, bodes ill for a budget caps deal anytime soon.\u00a0Dick Durbin\u201cRepublicans are living in a wonderland if they think we will accept $100 billion plus through OCO for defense while they devastate domestic programs,\u201d Durbin said.QuickTake: The Debt Ceiling\u201cThey are injecting a greater amount of uncertainty into an already difficult process,\u201d said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.The debate over spending and budget caps also will entangle negotiations on raising the federal debt limit, which snapped back into place March 2. The Treasury Department has been able to shift funds and take other so-called extraordinary measures to prevent a default on the government\u2019s debt.The CBO has projected that Treasury would be able to continue to do that into late summer or early fall if Congress doesn\u2019t act earlier. Yet lawmakers haven\u2019t been in a hurry. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said last month that Congress likely would raise the debt limit as part of a deal on the budget caps.Without a deal on the caps, a stopgap bill would be needed to avoid a shutdown after Sept. 30. Across the board cuts enforcing the caps known as sequestration would occur in December or January.But twice during Trump\u2019s presidency, standoffs over policy issues have blocked agreements on spending, leading to partial government shutdowns that leaders of both parties in Congress said they wanted to avoid.Republicans who are eager to raise defense spending, will be looking to see how Trump proposes to spend the extra dollars. Shelby said he will be looking closely at how the budget handles the new Space Force that Trump is trying to set up and whether it will draw funds away from the Air Force.\u201cI\u2019m wary of creating another agency,\u201d he said.The budget will also offer clues to Trump\u2019s approach to a possible infrastructure deal and the quest for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, with members of Congress eager to learn whether he will try to allocate more federal dollars for roads and bridges than the $200 billion he has backed in the past and whether he would be satisfied for now with the $8 billion he has sought to employ for a wall in part by declaring a national emergency.Last year, the Office of Management and Budget asked for just $1.6 billion for a border wall. Trump in an Oval Office meeting months later was incensed that it had not asked for more, lawmakers later said.A demand for $5.7 billion in wall funding led to the government shutdown and Trump\u2019s decision to declare an emergency to transfer military construction funds to a wall account. Congress is poised to vote against the emergency declaration next week, which would lead to Trump\u2019s first veto.The president, in his budget request, last year abandoned the long-held Republican goal of balancing the budget within 10 years, even as he employed rosy economic assumptions and a much criticized estimate that his $1.5 trillion tax overhaul law would pay for itself.He is not expected to call for the deep cuts to Medicare and Social Security or tax increases that would be necessary to achieve balance in the new budget either.\u2014 With assistance by Justin Sink, and Ari Natter ","63":"Government exploring repaying fund\u2019s loans ahead of schedule.

It should also prepare a fiscal contingency plan to prepare for court decisions that could reverse past public sector wage and pension cuts.IMF&apos;s assessment of Greece&apos;s main challenges and impact if they materialise Low risk likelihood indicates a probability below 10%, medium indicates a probability between 10% and 30%, and high a probability between 30 and 50%. \n\nSource: IMFOne of Greece\u2019s biggest challenges is its banks\u2019 large stock of non-performing exposures.

Aso responds to lawmaker questions about forced labor dispute Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said tariffs were among the measures Japan could take against South Korea if a dispute among the major trading partners worsens over Koreans conscripted as labor during Japan\u2019s colonial rule.Aso said in response to a lawmaker\u2019s questions in parliament that matters had not reached that stage yet, but halting remittances or stopping visa issuance could also be considered if more damage were to be caused. His comments came after the Sankei newspaper of Japan reported Sunday that South Korean lawyers were considering trying to seize the assets of Japanese companies in Europe.Taro AsoFractious ties between the two countries have turned hostile over a series of lawsuits filed against Japanese companies whose roots can be traced back to 1910-1945 period when Japan controlled the Korean Peninsula. Japan says all claims relating to the colonial period were settled under a 1965 treaty that normalized ties, which was accompanied by a payment of $300 million, and that South Korea should be responsible for any compensation.\u201cThere are various possible retaliatory measures, but I think negotiations are going on and we have not reached that point,\u201d Aso said. \u201cIf things progress and there is more damage, we will be at a different stage.\u201dSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has said the 1965 treaty between the two countries doesn\u2019t prevent Koreans from suing Japanese firms and the decisions of the courts should be respected.Why Japan and South Korea Still Spar Over HistoryThe Supreme Court in Seoul ruled in November that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. must pay between 100 million won and 150 million won ($88,500 to $133,000) to each of five plaintiffs who were forced to work in a military factory, a month after finding Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. liable in a similar case.

","65":"Amazon, Microsoft, Google report strong cloud sales growth. Chipmakers had forecast weaker spending on data-center parts Cloud-computing companies have a message for skittish investors: demand is still booming.Earnings reports from the biggest providers of internet-based computing services \u2013 Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google \u2013 showed that these companies are grabbing a larger share of business technology spending, defying warnings from some of their suppliers that a hot corner of the industry might be cooling off.The cloud giants entered the year facing questions about whether they could sustain their robust growth rates in an environment of uncertain global economic growth and investment. And at the start of fourth-quarter earnings season last month, investors got some worrying news from companies that sell the networking equipment and computer chips that go into the data centers that underpin the cloud. Intel Corp., Micron Technology Inc. and Juniper Networks Inc. were among those blaming lackluster results on slower spending by data-center customers.Now, investors have some reason to be relieved. On Monday, Google reported sales in its \"other revenue\" segment, a bucket that includes the Google Cloud Platform, of $6.49 billion in the fourth quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier. Capital expenditures at Google soared 80 percent, to $6.8 billion. While the stock declined in extended trading on concerns about how the investments will impact profitability, much of the higher spending is tied to new data centers and related hardware -- a signal that demand for cloud services is holding up.Cloud-computing division growth continues to hold upSource: BloombergNote: 0Q is the most recent fiscal quarter for each companyLast week, Amazon reported that its web services division, the leader in providing rented computing infrastructure from its data centers, saw revenue grow 45 percent in the fourth quarter, holding the same pace as the prior period. So did the gains at Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud group, where sales expanded by 76 percent. Finance chief Amy Hood said the software maker wasn\u2019t seeing any signs of a slowdown in demand for internet-based programs and services. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. posted 84 percent growth in its own cloud unit.\"The move to the cloud continues and all the cloud providers are gaining,\u201d said Kim Forrest, a senior portfolio manager with Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC. \u201cNobody is losing, it\u2019s just some people are faster than others.\"Many analysts say businesses are still in the early years of a major shift in how they buy technology, reducing their reliance on stocking and maintaining their own data centers and backroom servers. Instead, many are opting to power their operations using software rented from cloud-computing giants, turning previously consumer-focused companies like Amazon and Google into bellwethers of business technology use.Market researcher Canalys estimated that cloud-infrastructure spending climbed 46 percent in the December quarter to almost $23 billion, bringing investment for 2018 to more than $80 billion. And Synergy Research Group, which closely tracks information technology spending, last month increased its long-term forecasts for cloud-computing demand. Growth by companies\u2019 cloud units has slowed as their businesses matured, but have so far defied expectations for a major pullback.\"We had some pretty aggressive growth forecasts in place already,\" said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research. \"The actual growth metrics are beyond the norms of what we\u2019d normally expect in a large, high-growth market.\"Amazon, which in recent years has spent billions of dollars on equipment to build data centers, did tap the brakes a bit on spending through the middle of last year. The company reversed course in the fourth quarter, ramping up its purchases of property and capital leases, two line items that include some spending on data centers for Amazon Web Services. An executive indicated that outlays may grow further this year.Amazon\u2019s fourth-quarter increase in capital expenditures, 17 percent, \u201cis a low number for us when you talk about supporting the AWS business that\u2019s still growing at a high clip,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a conference call last week.On Jan. 24, Intel, which supplies about 99 percent of the processors that run servers, raised alarms when it blamed a weak revenue forecast in part on a slowdown in spending from large cloud-computing customers. The company\u2019s revenue from cloud providers rose by 24 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 50 percent increase in the prior three months. Overall its server-chip unit posted a 9 percent revenue expansion, held back by a decline in spending by corporations and government agencies. Memory-chip maker Micron in December cited a buildup of unused stockpiles among customers, sparking concern that spending on key components of servers will weaken.Part of the disconnect between cloud providers\u2019 upbeat outlook and the caution from Intel and Micron could boil down to differing expectations for what happens when a wave of data centers under construction come online.Analysts with Jefferies said in a research note that data-center related revenue at Intel and its main competitors grew much faster than historical trends in the last year. After previous similar spikes, growth cooled off for as long as a year as companies worked to fill their new server racks with customer workloads, the analysts wrote.Cloud-computing spending has proved difficult to forecast, said Simon Leopold, an analyst at Raymond James who covers technology infrastructure companies like Cisco Systems Inc. and Juniper.Historically, it was much easier to predict investment patterns from telecommunications companies like Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. because they would be very clear about what their capital spending plans were. That\u2019s not the case with cloud-computing providers, Leopold said, which tend to buy components for data centers unpredictably, and without a lot of lead time, favoring bulk purchases as they build new facilities or change the system design.Dinsdale, of Synergy Research, says short-term sales by chipmakers \"have almost zero bearing on the short-term sales of the big cloud providers.\" Builders of processors and networking components also have to deal with shifting demand from corporate data-center builders, as well as operators of search engines, and e-commerce and social media sites, among other customers.\"Bottom line, I wouldn\u2019t be losing too much sleep over the growth prospects of the hyperscale cloud providers,\" he said.\u2014 With assistance by Ian King, and Brandon Kochkodin ","66":"Judge Jackson in Washington could give him 10 more years. Virginia judge cites Manafort\u2019s \u2018otherwise blameless life\u2019 Paul Manafort won leniency Thursday from a federal judge who sent him to prison for less than four years, but next week he\u2019ll be sentenced in a second case by a less forgiving judge who could add another 10 years to his term.Manafort, 69, faced as long as 24 years in prison after jurors in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted him last year of hiding $55 million in offshore accounts, failing to pay $6 million in taxes, and defrauding banks. But U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III said Thursday that a quarter-century behind bars was too extreme and sentenced Manafort to 47 months.Amy Berman JacksonNext, Manafort will be sentenced on March 13 by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, where he pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges and pledged to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.It was Jackson who sent Manafort, President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, to jail on June 15 after prosecutors accused him of tampering with witnesses. She also ruled last month that he breached his plea deal by lying to prosecutors. Jackson could add to the sentence that Ellis imposed. She could also make some or all of it run at the same time.Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor, said Ellis may have assumed that Jackson will impose \u201csignificant additional time.\u201d\u201cThat was in part why he went relatively easy on Paul Manafort,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cBeing sentenced to four years in prison is nothing to sneeze at if he\u2019s going to get additional time in D.C. At the end of the day, he\u2019ll serve about seven years in prison.\u201dJackson will punish Manafort for conspiring to secretly lobby the U.S. on behalf of a pro-Russian Ukrainian regime and for plotting with a Russian associate to tamper with witnesses.In handing down his sentence, Ellis said that Manafort committed serious crimes but that his sentence should be comparable to others involving similar tax offenses.\u201cThe government cannot sweep away the history of all these previous sentences,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mathematical calculation, it is a judgment.\u201dIn Their Words: Manafort\u2019s Statement at His Sentencing, and Judge\u2019s ResponseManafort will get credit for the nine months he\u2019s already served, and he could get his sentence reduced slightly if he behaves in prison. The judge ordered Manafort to pay restitution of $25 million and fined him $50,000.The sentence set off outrage among the president\u2019s critics, who said it was too lenient for a man who failed to pay many millions in taxes. But in court, Ellis said it was sufficiently punitive.\u201cIf anybody in this courtroom doesn\u2019t think so, go and spend a day in the jail or penitentiary of the federal government,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSpend a week there. He has to spend 47 months, but he will receive credit for the time already served.\u201dPaul ManafortManafort, who has been in solitary confinement since June, appeared in court in a wheelchair and wore a green jumpsuit that said \u201cAlexandria Inmate.\u201d He stood to make a statement, but Ellis told him he could remain seated because he was in obvious discomfort.\u201cTo say that I feel humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement,\u201d Manafort told the judge. \u201cI could tell you that I feel the punishment from these proceedings already and know that it was my conduct that brought me here.\u201dManafort said that nine months of solitary confinement after seven months of home arrest had affected his physical and mental health.\u201cMy life professionally and financially is in shambles, and I feel the pain and shame of these factors,\u201d he said.Manafort suffers from gout, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, a potential thyroid problem, anxiety and claustrophobia.The judge chastised Manafort for not expressing remorse about his crimes but credited him for living \u201can otherwise blameless life.\u201dManafort may face more legal trouble even after next week\u2019s sentencing. State prosecutors in New York are said to be preparing a separate set of charges, which could expose Manafort to even more prison time.Manafort\u2019s downfall came at the hands of Mueller, who depicted him as a serial liar bent on defrauding tax authorities and banks while concealing his political consulting for pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine. Mueller is investigating whether Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with Russians who interfered with the 2016 election.As he had during the trial, Ellis made a clear distinction between Manafort\u2019s crimes and the Russia investigation. \u201cHe\u2019s not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government to influence this election,\u201d Ellis said.Manafort\u2019s lawyers said Mueller singled him out because he worked for Trump. And they said Manafort\u2019s work for former President Viktor Yanukovych of Ukraine wasn\u2019t on behalf of a Kremlin-aligned politician, as Mueller contends, but rather an effort to steer Ukraine toward the U.S.-friendly European Union.Yanukovych fled to Moscow after protests in 2014. Low on cash, Manafort tried to leverage properties in New York, Florida and Virginia as he lied to banks to secure loans.After his jury conviction in Alexandria, Manafort avoided a trial in Washington by pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate with Mueller. But prosecutors said he repeatedly lied to them in debriefings while failing to come clean about his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime associate allegedly tied to Russian intelligence.At the hearing on Thursday, prosecutor Greg Andres said Manafort lied during debriefings over 50 hours.\u201cThere were a wide range of issues that he was asked about and he did not provide valuable cooperation,\u201d Andres said. \u201cHe told us 50 hours, a large part of things we already knew or was included in documents. It wasn\u2019t 50 hours of information that we didn\u2019t know and it certainly wasn\u2019t 50 hours of information that was useful.\u201dIn Washington, Jackson ruled previously that Manafort deliberately lied about his contacts with Kilimnik, calling it an \u201cattempt to shield his Russian conspirator from liability\u201d and saying it raised \u201clegitimate questions about where his loyalties lie.\u201dProsecutors said that during the 2016 campaign, Manafort shared Trump polling data with Kilimnik, and they discussed a peace plan to resolve sanctions imposed on Russia after it annexed Ukraine. Mueller also appeared to examine whether Manafort and Kilimnik possibly were a back channel for communications between Russia and Trump, but neither man was accused of that.Mueller also investigated whether Manafort sought a presidential pardon from Trump -- a possibility that still exists.After sentencing on Thursday, Manafort\u2019s lawyers stressed that he never colluded with Russia, a point picked up by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Democrat Adam Schiff, who called it a deliberate appeal for a pardon.The statement by Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyer after an already lenient sentence \u2014 repeating the President\u2019s mantra of no collusion \u2014 was no accident. It was a deliberate appeal for a pardon.One injustice must not follow another.On Friday, Trump took the point one step further, tweeting that \u201cthe Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia.\u201dIn his Virginia trial, prosecutors cast Manafort as a globe-trotting, cash-hungry villain. Jurors heard how Manafort used wire transfers from offshore accounts to pay for houses, cars, clothes and rugs. He also financed improvements to homes in the Hamptons and Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.A skilled political strategist, Manafort advised Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Trump, all Republicans. As an international lobbyist, he reaped millions of dollars by working for strongmen like Jonas Savimbi in Angola, Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, and Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire.He made more than $60 million in Ukraine from 2010 to 2014, and his efforts were largely funded by Ukrainian oligarchs, prosecutors said. He also worked for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.In court filings, Manafort\u2019s lawyers called him a generous and supportive friend and family man, despite his crimes of deception.Ellis recommended that Manafort serve his time at the federal prison camp in Cumberland, Maryland.The Virginia case is U.S. v. Manafort, 18-cr-83, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). The Washington case is U.S. v. Manafort, 17-cr-201, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).

Ethics expert sees appearance of conflict for Trump appointee The family of Woody Johnson IV, the U.S. ambassador to Britain, bought a pair of office buildings in London\u2019s financial district for about 300 million pounds ($393 million), according to people with knowledge of the deals.The Donald Trump appointee, a billionaire heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, wasn\u2019t directly involved in the 2018 acquisitions, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deals were private. The investments were made on behalf of relatives by the Johnson family private office, which bought the buildings through New-York based investment firm Ella Valley Capital. The ambassador will not be a beneficiary of the investments, the people said.Woody Johnson IVSpokesmen for the Johnson family office and the U.S. embassy in London declined to comment. Ella Valley Capital didn\u2019t return messages seeking comment.While U.S. ambassadors are subject to strict rules and established norms, it\u2019s unusual for the families of diplomats to do business where they\u2019re posted. Conflict of interest rules can apply to assets owned or acquired by a spouse or dependent children, but not other family members, said Delaney Marsco, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington non-profit organization that advocates for restricting the influence of money in politics. But she says that the deals don\u2019t look good.\u201cThere\u2019s an appearance issue here,\u201d said Marsco, who specializes in ethics. \u201cWe should expect folks who are representing the United States to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.\u201dMixing commerce and politics, though, has been a feature of the Trump administration, where the commander in chief routinely extols the qualities of the hotels and golf courses he still owns. The administration has faced numerous complaints about its ethical standards, starting with the president\u2019s decision to transfer his assets to a trust rather than divest them. The complex holdings of some of his wealthy appointees, who were required to sell off investments that could pose a conflict, have also come under scrutiny.The federal agency charged with overseeing compliance with ethics rules has rebuked administration officials for violating them. The Office of Government Ethics was also critical of the president\u2019s decision not to divest his holdings.Presidents of both parties regularly award some of their wealthiest campaign contributors with diplomatic appointments in prestigious cities like London. Johnson\u2019s predecessor Matthew Barzun was the finance chairman for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign.Johnson -- with a net worth of about $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index -- has multiple commercial real estate investments in the U.S. but does not hold any property directly in the U.K., according to financial disclosures. He resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of the family office, the Johnson Company Inc., prior to his appointment and also handed control of the New York Jets football team to his younger brother Christopher.The London buildings, 24 King William Street and 55 Gresham Street, were both redeveloped immediately prior to being bought by the Johnson family. The larger Gresham Street building, which the family bought for about 200 million pounds, is rented to Investec Asset Management Ltd., the people said. The smaller building, next door to the new London headquarters of Wells Fargo & Co. on the north side of London Bridge, is leased to multiple tenants and still has several vacant floors, according to its website.U.K. property lures world&apos;s wealthiest Source: Knight FrankJohnson\u2019s diplomatic task will get more complicated if Britain crashes out of the European Union without a deal and is forced to quickly strike new deals with trading partners, like the U.S. American demands for \u201ccomprehensive access\u201d to the U.K. farm market and measures to prevent Britain from \u201cmanipulating\u201d its currency could be hard for London to swallow.Even with Brexit looming, the U.K. is the top destination for cross-border private investment in offices, malls and warehouses, according to broker Knight Frank\u2019s annual Wealth Report this week.\u2014 With assistance by Simone Foxman, and Bill Allison ","68":"Charge sheet also identifies official in ex-president\u2019s office. Indictment stems from scandal involving hidden government debt The U.S. Department of Justice identified a former senior Mozambican intelligence official and an ex-employee in the office of the president in an indictment alleging they used more than $200 million of state funds for bribes and kickbacks.The charges stem from a scandal involving $2 billion of loans the government raised in 2013 and 2014 and the bulk of which it hid from the International Monetary Fund and other donors. That led to a financing freeze when the debt was uncovered two years later. The government has missed payments on the obligations, as well as its $727 million of Eurobonds, since early 2017, as it sought to restructure them.\u201cThe indictment unsealed today alleges a brazen international criminal scheme in which corrupt Mozambique government officials, corporate executives, and investment bankers stole approximately $200 million in loan proceeds that were meant to benefit the people of Mozambique,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said Thursday in a statement.The DOJ indictment identified Antonio do Rosario, who was an official in the state intelligence service and the former chairman of the three state-owned companies that contracted the loans, among the defendants.

Act allows authorities to get data overseas, EU to negotiate A foreign power with possible unbridled access to Europe\u2019s data is causing alarm in the region. No, it\u2019s not China. It\u2019s the U.S.As the U.S. pushes ahead with the \u201cCloud Act\u201d it enacted about a year ago, Europe is scrambling to curb its reach. Under the act, all U.S. cloud service providers from Microsoft and IBM to Amazon -- when ordered -- have to provide American authorities data stored on their servers regardless of where it\u2019s housed. With those providers controlling much of the cloud market in Europe, the act could potentially give the U.S. the right to access information on large swaths of the region\u2019s people and companies.The U.S. says the act is aimed at aiding investigations. Some people are drawing parallels between the legislation and the National Intelligence Law that China put in place in 2017 requiring all its organizations and citizens to assist authorities with access to information. The Chinese law, which the U.S. says is a tool for espionage, is cited by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration as a reason to avoid doing business with companies like Huawei Technologies Co.\u201cI don\u2019t mean to compare U.S. and Chinese laws, because obviously they aren\u2019t the same, but what we see is that on both sides, Chinese and American, there is clearly a push to have extraterritorial access to data,\u201d Laure de la Raudiere, a French lawmaker who co-heads a parliamentary cyber-security and sovereignty group, said in an interview. \u201cThis must be a wake up call for Europe to accelerate its own, sovereign offer in the data sector.\u201dMatters of espionage and foreign interference will be at the center of talks at Europe\u2019s biggest telecoms and technology conference, the MWC Barcelona, that started Monday.The Cloud Act (or the \u201cClarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act\u201d) addresses an issue that came up when Microsoft in 2013 refused to provide the FBI access to a server in Ireland in a drug-trafficking investigation, saying it couldn\u2019t be compelled to produce data stored outside the U.S.The act\u2019s extraterritoriality spooks the European Union -- an issue that\u2019s become more acute as trans-Atlantic relations fray and the bloc sees the U.S. under Trump as an increasingly unreliable ally.Europe may seek to mitigate the impact of the law by drawing on a provision in the act that allows the U.S. to reach \u201cexecutive agreements\u201d with countries allowing a mutual exchange of information and data. The European Commission wants the EU to enter into talks with the U.S., and negotiations may start this spring.France and other EU countries like The Netherlands and Belgium are pushing for the bloc to present a common front as they struggle to come up with regulations to protect privacy, avert cyber attacks and secure critical networks in the increasingly amorphous world of information in the cloud.A Dutch lawmaker at the European Parliament, Sophie in \u2019t Veld, recently expressed frustration at what she called the EU\u2019s \u201cenormous weakness\u201d in the face of the U.S.\u2019s \u201cunlimited data hunger.\u201d\u201cBecause of the Cloud Act, the long arm of the American authorities reaches European citizens, contradicting all EU law,\u201d she said. \u201cWould the Americans accept it if the EU would grant itself extraterritorial jurisdiction on U.S. soil? And would the Commission also propose negotiations with Russia or China, if they would adopt their own Russian or Chinese Cloud Act?\"An internal memo crafted by the French government in November states that \u201cthe Cloud Act could be a test from the U.S., and they expect a political response, which ought to be European to be strong enough.\u201dThe Cloud Act was enacted just weeks ahead of Europe\u2019s data-protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which states that all businesses that collect data from EU citizens have to follow the bloc\u2019s rules, which could put the two laws at odds.Guillaume PoupardWhile waiting for the EU to get its response together, some countries are preparing their own, with the French leading the pack. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s teams are readying legal and technical measures to shield the country, four government officials involved said. The president\u2019s office, the finance ministry and the state\u2019s cyber security agency ANSSI have worked on it for the last 10 months.\u201cThe more we dig into the Cloud Act, the more worrying it is,\u201d said ANSSI chief Guillaume Poupard. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for the U.S. to enter into negotiations... but it has an immediate extraterritorial effect that\u2019s unbearable.\u201dThe French government has held meetings with banks, defense contractors, energy utilities and others, asking them to use \u201cCloud Act-safe\u201d data providers. It\u2019s also studying legal options, a finance ministry official said. One way might be to refresh a 1968 \u201cBlocking Statute,\u201d which prohibits French companies and citizens from providing \u201ceconomic, commercial, industrial, financial, or technical documents or information\u201d as evidence in legal proceedings outside the country.Bruno Le Maire\u201cNo one can accept that a foreign government, even the American one, can come fetch data on companies stored by a U.S. company, without warning and without us being able to respond,\u201d Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a speech on Feb. 18.France has been more vociferous in its opposition to the Cloud Act because its companies have borne the brunt of other extraterritorial U.S. laws. In 2014, BNP was slapped with an $8.97 billion U.S. fine for transactions with countries facing American sanctions. French oil company Total SA walked away from a $4.8 billion project in Iran after Trump pulled out of its nuclear deal.One consequence of the Cloud Act is that European companies and organizations will start looking for local alternatives.

With his lead holding up ahead of incumbent Petro Poroshenko and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, he says Bolsonaro has been an inspiration as he rushes to build out a team that may be in charge of running the country of 42 million people.

It gives people hope. For me, this is a very vivid illustration.\"Zelenskiy is targeting the anti-establishment vote in the mold of populists who\u2019ve popped up elsewhere in Europe and beyond.

Zelenskiy signaled his approach by hiring as advisers reform-minded former ministers who left the cabinet in frustration over the lack of progress: ex-Finance Minister Oleksandr Danylyuk and Aivaras Abromavicius, who used to run the economy and trade department.Like Macron, Zelenskiy is looking to convert his quick popularity to build a wider political base, planning to create his own party before parliamentary elections later this year. Beyond the electoral tactics, he said the youngest ever French president is someone with whom he shares a \u201ccommon mindset.\u201dA question Zelenskiy faces at almost every interview is whether he\u2019s backed by Ukrainian billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, an owner of the TV channel where the comedian\u2019s popular Kvartal 95 show runs.

It comes just over a year after the EU agreed to \u201cname and shame\u201d a small number of nations as part of its efforts to fight opaque practices that facilitate tax avoidance by multinationals and individuals.The blacklist \u201chas had a resounding effect on tax transparency and fairness worldwide,\u201d EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said in a statement. \u201cWe are raising the bar of tax good governance globally and cutting out the opportunities for tax abuse.\u201dThe EU list is composed of countries that \"either failed to deliver on their commitments to comply with required good-governance criteria, or did not commit to do so at all,\" according to the European Commission, the EU executive in Brussels.The updated list includes existing transgressors American Samoa, Guam, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and U.S. Virgin Islands, while new entries are Aruba, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Dominica, Fiji, Marshall Islands, Oman, Vanuatu and the U.A.E.The final list didn\u2019t come without drama, with Romanian Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici suggesting ahead of the meeting that there would be no agreement at Tuesday\u2019s session.

It\u2019s \u2018not uncommon\u2019 for professors to invest in their students The chances that your startup will become a billion-dollar company are almost zero. But if you do somehow manage to create a unicorn, the odds are better than 1-in-10 that you or your co-founder attended one school: Stanford.It\u2019s a remarkable statistic even considering its student population is overrun with go-getters -- people ambitious enough to apply and smart enough to get in. More unicorn founders and top venture capitalists attended Stanford than any other U.S. university, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on CB Insights\u2019 lists of top venture capitalists and unicorn companies. And while Harvard has spawned more alumni with self-made fortunes of at least $500 million, Stanford\u2019s are 11 years younger on average.How do they do it? One obvious answer is location. Rather than create a bubble of academia within the heart of the world\u2019s tech mecca, Stanford has embraced its proximity to Silicon Valley to give students a powerful advantage.Stanford and Silicon Valley are \u201cinextricable,\u201d said alumna Heidi Roizen, a venture capitalist and co-leader of Stanford\u2019s DFJ Entrepreneurial Leaders Fellowship, where she\u2019s on the teaching team. \u201cYou have to look at them together.\u201dHeidi RoizenWhile that bond provides students with unparalleled access to mentors, role models and funding, it also comes with problems: startups are prioritized over schoolwork and conflicts of interest arise when professors are also seed investors.Bloomberg conducted dozens of interviews about Stanford\u2019s startup scene and its perks and perils. Here are some of the people who capture different aspects of the school\u2019s culture.If you walked into Ryan Breslow\u2019s Stanford dorm room in the spring of 2014, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking no one lived there -- no pictures on the walls, no clothes in the closet, no comforter on the bed. That\u2019s because no one was supposed to be living there.Breslow was a sophomore computer science student when he dropped out earlier that year to work on Bolt, his payment startup.\u201cI just became much more passionate about that than my classes,\u201d said Breslow, 24. He spent the rest of the school year squatting on campus, secretly living in the spare dorm room and getting meals with the help of a dining hall cook he had befriended. Today, Bolt is worth about $250 million, according to Adam Augusiak-Boro, a senior associate at EquityZen, a marketplace for trading employee shares of closely held companies.At least three members of the computer science faculty are Bolt investors.Ryan BreslowBreslow isn\u2019t the only successful Stanford dropout. Take Snap Inc.\u2019s Evan Spiegel, who dropped out of undergrad, or Tesla Inc.\u2019s Elon Musk, who lasted less than a week in his Ph.D. program before withdrawing. One notable alumnus, billionaire Peter Thiel, encourages it so much that he set up a fellowship offering young entrepreneurs $100,000 to put college on hold.Dropping out is still the exception rather than the rule at Stanford, but taking a year off to work on a startup is so prevalent that there\u2019s a term for it: \u201cstopping out.\u201d It\u2019s also common for students to take a light course load -- only two classes or so -- to spend more time on their startups, Breslow said.Some companies are born in the classroom. Terry Winograd looks like an academic, with bushy white hair and a mustache to rival Einstein\u2019s. When the former computer science professor first went to work at Stanford in 1973, his intentions were academic, too. Getting crazy rich wasn\u2019t part of the plan, but as fate would have it, he was an adviser on Larry Page\u2019s graduate research project involving web search.Terry WinogradWinograd never invested in his student\u2019s startup, but he was invited to work at Google during a 2002 sabbatical and was largely paid in pre-IPO stock. The company, now called Alphabet Inc., went public in 2004 and is valued at $797 billion.\u201cI\u2019m not a billionaire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m comfortable.\u201dWinograd recognizes that there\u2019s a downside to the cozy relationship between academia and industry.\u201cThe negative side effects are cultural,\" he said. \u201cIf a student sees their fellow student getting really rich it\u2019s hard to say to them, \u2018Yes, but philosophy is important, too.\u201d\u2019Other computer science professors have taken a more direct approach to profiting from their students\u2019 ideas. David Cheriton, for example, was an early Google investor. The proceeds Cheriton has received from selling his Alphabet stock make up the bulk of his $4.3 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people.Mehran SahamiAlso in the department is Mehran Sahami, who still teaches at Stanford and famously had Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook Inc. co-founder, visit one of his computer science classes for Q&A sessions. Sahami has invested in several of his students\u2019 companies, including a mobile payments startup called Clinkle Corp. In early 2013, more than a dozen students in the computer science department dropped out to work with Clinkle founder Lucas Duplan. The company folded about two years later.\u201cMy expectation for the students and Lucas Duplan, who was the CEO, was that they would graduate,\u201d Sahami said.Sahami said he has invested in fewer than five of his former students\u2019 ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s a relationship that\u2019s been built up over years so when they\u2019re ready to do this venture or get funding, this discussion will happen.\u201dShortly after the Clinkle exodus, the university added a section to its conflict-of-interest policy, which requires any faculty member involved in a student\u2019s academic program to get permission from administrators before investing with that student.That doesn\u2019t apply to everyone. \u201cSince they do not have faculty appointments and are not paid by Stanford, our conflict of interest policies do not apply to adjunct faculty, visiting faculty, visiting scholars or visiting lecturers -- unless they have another type of appointment through which they are paid by Stanford,\u201d university spokesman E.J. Miranda said in an emailed statement.In 2009, just after his junior year, Cameron Teitelman decided to do something about a problem he noticed on campus: a school with so many entrepreneurs had no structured setting for them to connect and work through common problems. His solution was StartX, an accelerator for Stanford-affiliated founders. In 2018, StartX was ranked in the top three accelerators in the country along with Silicon Valley powerhouses Y Combinator and AngelPad, according to the Seed Accelerator Rankings Project. StartX does not call itself an accelerator.Cameron\u00a0TeitelmanTeitelman, 30, also founded StartX to create a safe space for students who are first-time founders working in Silicon Valley\u2019s shark-infested waters. After hearing stories of students who had been offered unfair deals by their lecturers, many of whom were full-time venture capitalists, Teitelman wanted to help students avoid those situations, he said.\u201cSometimes lecturers, I feel like, take advantage of students and it really pisses me off,\u201d Teitelman said. \u201cVenture capitalists who play on information asymmetry to get more out of a startup that doesn\u2019t know anything, that\u2019s just wrong.\u201dPeter Levine, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, introduces himself as an investor first and Stanford teacher second.Around the same time that Levine started at the venture capital firm in 2010, the business school invited him to teach part time, and he eagerly accepted. More than a dozen venture capitalists are lecturers at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.Peter Levine\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to teach there,\u201d Levine said. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving back and providing the expertise that I have.\u201dBeing a venture capitalist surrounded by smart and ambitious student entrepreneurs looking for funding is an added benefit, and he said they sometimes approach him to pitch startups while he\u2019s eating in the cafeteria.\u201cThey know who I am and they know what we do,\u201d Levine said. \u201cEveryone is involved together and they have very close access to investors.\u201dBusiness school student Tadia James welcomes professors who want to invest in students.\u201cThey are so generous and really believe in us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all uncommon for a professor to invest in one of their students, especially after a student has taken their class.\u201dTeitelman, who studied management science and engineering, stressed the distinction between investments from part-time lecturers and full-time tenured professors.\u201cFor the most part, tenured professors at Stanford are very careful,\u201d Teitelman said. \u201cThey first and foremost care about research and a student\u2019s education.\u201dEven Stanford itself is taking a stake. In 2013, the school founded the Stanford-StartX Fund, which allows the school to invest in StartX companies.\u201cWe train and house these creative minds, and it is only fitting that we invest in their future success,\u201d then-Stanford President John Hennessy said in a statement at the time.StartX decided to participate in the fund to reach financial self-sustainability and it recently achieved that goal. For that reason the Stanford-StartX Fund will stop making new investments after June 30, according to a statement from StartX.Stanford finance chief Randy Livingston said the school will continue to put money in the President\u2019s Venture Fund, which for the past decade has invested in new ventures that have licensed technology from Stanford. The school\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing collects royalties when inventions created on campus are successful.The university has invested more than $150 million in the Stanford-StartX Fund through the end of 2018, Livingston\u00a0said in an email, 50 percent more than he predicted in a 2013 interview with the New Yorker. That may seem like a relative pittance now for a $26.5 billion endowment, but the odds are good that Stanford is getting in early on the next Google. ","75":"Finance Minister says bank sector has very little sympathy. Comments follow allegations of laundering against Swedbank Sweden\u2019s government wants to revisit the idea of imposing a tax on the financial industry.Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson says her goal is to have a levy that singles out banks with far more precision than previous proposals.\u201cIt should include only the financial sector,\u201d she said in an interview in Stockholm. \u201cWe want one that has a more narrow tax base, which really hits what it\u2019s meant to hit.\u201dThe proposal -- part of a broader planned tax reform -- is likely to make its way through parliament as banks in Sweden get dragged into a money laundering scandal that has dominated headlines across the Nordic and Baltic regions. Most recently, Swedbank AB was targeted by allegations that it handled billions of dollars in dirty money. The bank has had a criminal complaint filed against it by Bill Browder, an investor best known for chasing Russian money launderers.Allegations that banks operating in Sweden have been involved in money laundering and helped rich clients evade taxes have shaped the public\u2019s perception of the financial industry. Andersson says voters aren\u2019t likely to feel too sorry for banks if the government is able to move ahead with its planned tax. She\u2019s previously discussed a tax of around 4 billion kronor ($425 million), which would target the biggest banks in Sweden.\u201cSympathy for the banks hasn\u2019t been so strong,\u201d Andersson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the love of banks is something that permeates the Swedish soul.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first time that Sweden\u2019s center-left government has tried to push through a financial tax. Previous attempts stalled after bumping up against European Union competition rules. Efforts to refine the proposal also failed after local authorities criticized it for putting Swedish firms at a competitive disadvantage.More recently, the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven have looked into designing a tax that targets bank operations regardless of where the parent company is based. The idea follows a decision by Nordea Bank Abp to move its headquarters to Finland from Stockholm.When it comes to allegations of money laundering against Swedbank, which is Sweden\u2019s biggest mortgage lender and the country\u2019s oldest bank, Andersson says the government is \u201cvery concerned.\u201d\u201cThe bank needs to fully cooperate with the authorities and of course, we want to know what happened,\u201d she said.Swedbank is being investigated by the financial supervisory authorities of Sweden and Estonia after broadcaster SVT published a report alleging the bank handled almost $6 billion in suspicious funds linked to the Danske Bank A\/S Estonian laundering scandal.Swedbank has acknowledged it handled questionable transactions, which it says have been reported to the police. The bank has hired an external consulting firm to review the matter. The findings are due by the end of the month. ","76":"Board candidate testifies at European Parliament in Brussels.

Sign up here.One of the most influential European Central Bank policy makers-to be is confident that current stimulus will be enough the guide the euro area through what he considers \u201climited\u201d downward revisions to the outlook.Philip Lane, who\u2019s on track to replace chief economist Peter Praet in June, said he doesn\u2019t see Europe in a \u201csuper fragile situation.\u201d Speaking at his European Parliament confirmation hearing, he argued that the recent deterioration in data will likely lead to \u201creasonably small adjustments\u201d to macroeconomic forecasts, which the ECB will release at its next policy meeting in just over a week.The euro-area economy is predicted to expand 0.4 percent each quarter of 2019Source: Eurostat, Bloomberg survey\u201cThe market is expecting the downward revisions in data to mean a slower path of normalization -- the current strategy can deal with that,\u201d he said in Brussels. \u201cIf you had a bigger shock or more persistent shock -- so unemployment started to go up again and inflation started not only to go more slowly but actually to go into reverse -- the current strategy also indicated that above all else we\u2019re committed to reaching the target over the medium term.\u201dLane, who currently leads the Irish central bank, addressed a concern that has unsettled investors and economists for months: whether or not the ECB has the firepower the counter a more protracted downturn that seems increasingly possible amid bleak economic reports.His comments signal a slightly more optimistic stance to that of Praet, who said last week that \u201cit is too early to say\u201d how much activity will rebound and outlined options for how the ECB could respond to a deeper slowdown. Lane, too, stressed that policy makers aren\u2019t out of options.\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve deployed certain instruments, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anywhere near the case that the ECB has hit all limits,\u201d Lane said.His candidacy to join the ECB\u2019s Executive Board was endorsed by European lawmakers on Tuesday, following approval by euro-area finance ministers earlier this month. If confirmed by governments, he will start his eight-year term in Frankfurt on June 1.When the Governing Council holds its policy meeting on March 7, officials will have access to new projections for growth and inflation that will reflect the impact of a recent recession in Italy and an industrial slump in Germany.A cut to the 2019 forecast will be the third in a row, after downward revisions in September and December -- a trend highlighting the importance not to lose sight of the bigger picture even when individual adjustments seem small.The ECB has repeatedly pointed to external risks and uncertainties as factors weighing on momentum, but stressed at the same time that domestic demand continues to support employment and consumption.\u201cWe are seeing upward wage pressures, so if you like, we remain confident that the underlying mechanisms that would lead to improving inflation performance over time are still active,\u201d Lane said.\u2014 With assistance by Piotr Skolimowski ","77":"Airline emerging from period of labor strife under new chief. Group CEO Smith aims to bring the French, Dutch units closer Just as Air France-KLM looks set to turn the page on last year\u2019s crippling labor strife, the carrier is facing a revolt by its Dutch arm.A tussle over the reappointment of Pieter Elbers, who leads the KLM unit, sparked a noisy demonstration of support Thursday for the executive from staffers, managers and even Dutch officials, including a petition signed by more than 25,000 employees.Ben SmithThe show of force followed news that Air France-KLM\u2019s new CEO, Ben Smith, was considering replacing Elbers on the grounds that he might not be fully behind plans to strengthen ties between Air France and KLM. The flap brought to the fore long-simmering tensions between the French and Dutch carriers, which joined in a 2004 merger, but operate semi-independently.\u201cThere is a new top man at the firm who is obviously working on the strategy,\u2019\u2019 Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at a press conference in The Hague on Friday. \u201cThe Dutch government, we must try to act to ensure that the decisions within the company are taken in line with what was previously agreed during the merger and in line with Dutch interests.\u201dSmith, a former Air Canada executive, took over in September and quickly struck landmark deals with labor representatives, ending a bout of unrest that resulted in costly French strikes last year. An accord with pilots could be next: The results of a referendum over a union-backed pay and benefits proposal will probably be known Tuesday.A day later, Air France-KLM is likely to report an annual profit, even after the strikes in France cost it an estimated 335 million euros ($377 million).Now Smith, 47, wants to bring Air France and KLM closer. While some departments are integrated, such as revenue management -- where analysts seek to fill seats as profitably as possible -- others, including aircraft purchasing, still operate separately. To that end, Smith is seeking to join the supervisory board of KLM.The merger 15 years ago brought together the flag carriers, but their complicated governance structure still reflects guarantees given at the time to safeguard a degree of autonomy for KLM. Subsequent agreements have ensured KLM headquarters jobs won\u2019t be transferred to Paris and the carrier will keep its financial independence. Smith wants to streamline operations.He met with KLM\u2019s board Friday to discuss Elbers, joined by the Franco-Dutch carrier\u2019s appointment committee, a spokeswoman for KLM said. Smith spoke with Dutch government officials earlier in the day. Elbers will attend the presentation of Air France-KLM earnings in Paris, another KLM spokeswoman said.Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra and Infrastructure Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen, who met Smith on Friday morning, stressed the importance of the carrier to the Dutch economy, Hoekstra told reporters in The Hague. The Dutch government owns 5.9 percent of KLM, while the French state holds a 14 percent stake in Air-France KLM.The conversation was \u201cintensive and it won\u2019t be the last one,\u201d said Hoekstra, who backs Elbers. \u201cIt is strange to see that we have this discussion with each other while the Dutch part has performed well in recent years.\u201dHigher profit margins at KLM have been a source of tension since Air France acquired the Dutch business. The unit boosted revenue passenger kilometers -- the number of customers times the distance flown -- by 4 percent in 2018, compared with a gain of just 1.9 percent at Air France and its Hop! division.KLM officials sent a letter to Air France-KLM\u2019s board to insist they support Elbers at their next meeting, on Feb. 19. In the missive, the Dutch managers warned of possible social unrest at the company, should Elbers leave. KLM went so far as to hire a public relations adviser in Paris to handle the situation, and spread the #BlueStormRising hashtag to defend the 48-year-old executive.An Air France-KLM spokeswoman declined to comment on the relationship between the units.Any strikes by pilots could do damage because of their ability to ground flights. Smith\u2019s two immediate predecessors left the company after labor talks descended into open conflict. The proposed agreement with the French pilots would secure changes to remuneration and increased flexibility, according to the airline.While that bodes well, Smith will need to follow through with further measures to pare costs and boost sales if the French unit is to close the profitability gap not just to European rivals such as British Airways but also with KLM.\u201cThe strong link between Air France and KLM is seminal for both,\u201d said Geoffroy Bouvet, an Air France pilot and former president of the SNPL union. \u201cNeither has the critical size to exist in this cut-throat market.\u201d ","78":" South African Finance Minister Tito Mboweni unveiled his budget for the coming fiscal year, and the outlook for the continent\u2019s most industrialized economy isn\u2019t pretty.The National Treasury has cut economic growth forecasts, plans to reduce state spending and won\u2019t provide tax relief for citizens as it seeks more funds to prop up debt-laden state-owned companies, including yet another record bailout for power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which last week struggled to keep the lights on.Below are charts illustrating the predicament the country finds itself in.The budget gap is forecast to reach its worst level in a decade in 2020Source: National TreasuryNote: Chart shows data for the fiscal years ending March 31The National Treasury forecast a fiscal gap of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product for the year starting April 1.

The slippages come as the Treasury provides a 23 billion-rand ($1.6 billion) lifeline to loss-making power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. in each of the next three years.The fastest-growing expenditure item in the budget is debt-servicing costs, with the country spending 182.2 billion rand in fiscal 2019, rising to 247 billion rand by 2022. South Africa is \u201cborrowing about 1.2 billion rand a day, assuming we don\u2019t borrow money on the weekend,\u201d Mboweni said. ","79":"Treasury quarterly refunding sales to hit record $84 billion. Agency reminds Congress of debt-limit deadline of March 1 The U.S. Treasury Department announced plans to issue another record-breaking amount of debt, giving President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election opponents more ammunition as they question whether his tax cuts will pay for themselves.The federal budget shortfall is set to swell, driven by tax cuts, spending increases and an aging American population. As a result, the Treasury is raising its long-term debt issuance at its quarterly refunding auctions to $84 billion, the department said Wednesday, $1 billion more than three months ago. Such elevated levels of borrowing will finance the widening deficit, with Wall Street strategists projecting new debt issuance will top $1 trillion for a second straight year.The ballooning national debt is already being drawn into the 2020 presidential election campaign. Former Starbucks Corp. CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering running as an independent, earlier this week said the debt is an example of both Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 \u201creckless failure of their constitutional responsibility.\u201dDebt sales have already surpassed levels last seen when the country was digging out of its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Combined with needing to fund the shortfall, the Treasury has been selling more debt as a result of the Federal Reserve\u2019s strategy to slowly let government debt roll off its balance sheet.Initial tax receipts call into question the Trump administration\u2019s projection that extra economic growth would generate enough revenue to offset its tax cuts. Corporate income taxes paid to the U.S. Treasury fell to $205 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 -- a 31 percent drop from the prior year. A decrease of that magnitude is unusual during a period of economic growth.The Congressional Budget Office forecasts the federal budget deficit will top $1 trillion in 2020, with the U.S. government spending about $7 trillion just to service that debt.The massive fiscal shortfall has drawn concern from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The U.S. government budget is \u201con an unsustainable path and that needs to be addressed,\u201d he said during a press conference Wednesday after announcing a rate decision. \u201cThere is no time like now to go after that problem.\u201dU.S. Treasury increasingly must deal with Fed&apos;s debt roll offSource: Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury, Bloomberg calculationsIn its refunding announcement, the Treasury said it will keep auctions of nominal coupon and floating-rate debt stable over the coming quarter and anticipates boosting issuance of inflation-linked securities starting in February.Treasuries maintained their declines for the day in the wake of the announcement, with the 10-year yield touching a high of 2.73 percent in New York morning trading. Inflation-linked securities began outperforming nominal Treasuries ahead of the refunding announcement and continued to do so as the government revealed increases in TIPS auction sizes that were smaller than many dealers expected.The department reiterated that a suspension period for the nation\u2019s statutory debt limit ends March 1, though so-called extraordinary accounting measures can continue to finance the government temporarily. In the statement, the Treasury said it\u2019s too early to provide a precise forecast for how long those will last.\u201cTreasury does not anticipate bill issuance to be as volatile as it has been in the past when prior debt limit suspension periods expired,\u201d the agency said. It does not expect to reduce bill issuance in advance of the debt limit expiration date.Strategists at most dealer firms had predicted Treasury wouldn\u2019t lift nominal note and bonds sales and begin expanding TIPS issuance. That\u2019s because bolstered auction sizes over the past four quarters, along with utilizing bills sales, is seen as sufficient to allow the government to finance its funding gap with a second year of over $1 trillion in new debt.\u2014 With assistance by Laura Davison Treasury anticipates increasing TIPS auctions starting with Feb. 30-year auction and then with the April 5-year saleSees increase in net TIPS issuance of $22 bln-$27 bln this calendar yearNo rise in nominal coupon, floating-rate debt sales in upcoming quarterBill supply to gradually rise seasonally though at a more modest pace vs Oct.-Dec. 2018, before starting to moderate in early-AprilWill sell $84 bln long-term debt next week versus $83 bln in the prior quarter: $19 bln of 30-year bonds, unchanged vs last quarter; $27 bln of 10-year bonds, unchanged vs last quarter; Treasury to sell $38 bln of three-year notes, unchanged vs December but $1 bln more than three months ago","80":" The U.K. hasn&apos;t cared much about who owns its companies. Brexit drives a truck through this approach.If Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU was to have a silver lining, it was the hope that sterling\u2019s slump would spark a long overdue re-balancing of the economy. A vast finance and services sector has brought many advantages over the years (bankers are big spenders and pay plenty of tax), but the cost\u00a0of neglecting manufacturing is becoming increasingly apparent.\u00a0Poor productivity growth, regional inequality, stagnant wages and a yawning current account deficit are just some of the problems made worse by de-industrialization. But while the weaker pound has provided a bit of support\u00a0for U.K. exports since the 2016 referendum, a manufacturing renaissance \u2013\u00a0or  \u201cMarch of the Makers\u201d in the words of former finance minister George Osborne \u2013 looks like a pipe-dream. Lately, the reverse has been happening.The country\u2019s\u00a0foreign-owned carmakers have  withheld spending\u00a0and cut jobs and models;\u00a0Honda Motor Co Ltd. is  closing its Swindon plant. Even home-grown successes like Dyson Group Plc are  shifting investment\u00a0elsewhere. The CBI, Britain\u2019s biggest business lobby, warned last week that industry is\u00a0\u201cin despair\u201d about Brexit and trade union Unite says the U.K. is \u201cin the grip of a manufacturing emergency.\u201d\u00a0They have a point.Britain\u2019s political leaders\u00a0have played\u00a0fast and loose with the future EU trading relationship and\u00a0some have shown a\u00a0willful disregard for companies\u2019 concerns. Boris Johnson\u2019s infamous \u201cF*ck business\u201d\u00a0comment spoke volumes. As with so much about Brexit, this lack of seriousness is potentially disastrous given that most of the country\u2019s industrial base is in the hands of overseas owners. Britain has happily carried on selling off its companies (from\u00a0Arm Holdings Plc\u00a0to Sky Plc) since the referendum. In a post-Brexit world, this isn\u2019t sustainable. But there isn\u2019t a huge amount left to dispose of anyway.Manufacturing employment declines\u00a0as economies become more advanced, but the U.K. is extreme. The sector now accounts for just\u00a08 percent of the workforce, compared with more than one-fifth when I was born in 1982.\u00a0\n            \n\n                1\n            \nThe birthplace of the industrial revolution has a lower manufacturing\u00a0share of output than in many\u00a0other developed economies.The U.K. has slipped down the rankings of the world&apos;s biggest manufacturersSource: : UN Conference on Trade and Development,  U.K. parliamentData are from 2015As with the election of Donald Trump, the\u00a0campaign\u00a0for Britain to quit the EU appealed to blue collar workers left behind\u00a0by de-industrialization. That\u00a0Brexit will probably make things worse is one of the referendum\u2019s cruelest ironies, and hardly the best way of defusing the populist impulse.In terms of output, Britain is of\u00a0course\u00a0still an important manufacturing nation.\u00a0But its list of domestic world-class contenders is pretty thin.\u00a0There\u2019s Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, BAE\u00a0Systems Plc, GKN Plc and Cobham Plc\u00a0in aerospace, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and AstraZeneca in drugs, and Ineos in chemicals.\u00a0Then you have several big food, drink and personal care companies.\u00a0\n            \n\n                2\n            \nFor a long time, the British establishment (including Labour governments)\u00a0seemed pretty ambivalent about this situation. It wasn&apos;t the government\u2019s job to pick winners. Politicians saw a bright future in services (financial, business and professional) and the so-called\u00a0\u201cknowledge economy.\u201d\u00a0So what if big local manufacturers like Airbus, Tata Steel, Siemens, ABB, Bombardier, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota, Nissan and BMW\/Mini were all foreign-owned? Britain\u2019s attractions as an investment destination \u2013\u00a0its universities, flexible labor markets and access to Europe \u2013\u00a0were plain.\u00a0All would be well;\u00a0and in fairness sectors such as the car industry thrived in a way they hadn\u2019t under British owners and bosses.But some local industrialists have long argued that when the going gets tough, a foreign owner won\u2019t feel a particular obligation to the country when faced with hard investment decisions. That theory is getting a good testing now that the U.K. is \u2013 voluntarily \u2013 trying to leave the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc. The early signs are grim.Even today, manufacturing accounts for more than two-thirds of British companies\u2019 R&D spending and\u00a0almost half the country\u2019s exports.\u00a0Productivity growth also tends to be higher among industrials because of automation. Pay is higher too, particularly in carmaking. Having a thriving finance sector and industrial base needn\u2019t be mutually exclusive either. Switzerland manages, but the U.K. has struggled to balance the two.Britain\u2019s engineers have suffered as many of the brightest graduates sought their fortunes in the City of London. Speculative capital inflows contributed to an\u00a0overvalued pound\u00a0and\u00a0made exports less competitive.\n            \n\n                3\n            \n         And, rather than help small- and medium-sized businesses expand, finance firms have directed most of their money toward\u00a0real estate, as the chart below from think-tank Civitas\u00a0shows. Lending to the corporate sector accounted\u00a0for about 8\u00a0percent of U.K. bank lending in 2016.\u00a0In Germany, it\u2019s more than double that.\n            \n\n                4\n            \nFor a time, Britain could kid itself that this didn\u2019t matter. Industry\u2019s decline was cushioned by surging consumer borrowing and jobs in\u00a0the service sector (albeit often low-paying and with little security). Meanwhile, the U.K\u2019s net worth has trebled since 1995. Yet while that sounds impressive, it\u2019s mostly a\u00a0consequence of the decades long\u00a0property boom. The country\u2019s\u00a0stock of productive capital hasn\u2019t\u00a0increased nearly as rapidly.\n            \n\n                5\n            \nBritain&apos;s \u00a310 trillion of net wealth is skewed towards land and housesSource: ONS National balance sheet, Opinion calculations \nHere \"Net worth\" includes things like intellectual property, machinery and buildings that aren&apos;t houses. \"Land\" includes land not owned by households.

Government warns companies against further price increases Officials in Nicolas Maduro\u2019s regime told a group of executives representing about 50 consumer companies to open bank accounts in Russia, Turkey, China and India and to begin building relationships with suppliers in those countries, according to two people with direct knowledge of the meeting.The Finance Ministry will host workshops so that executives learn how to open the foreign accounts, one person said. The companies were also warned that attempts to disrupt production to destabilize the government would trigger reprisals.In the meeting called by Vice President of Economy Tareck El Aissami and Interior Commerce Minister William Contreras at the presidential palace in Caracas on Monday, the executives were told not to raise prices since inflation has allegedly begun to decelerate, the two people said, asking not to be named speaking about a private meeting. A model of price increases tied to Venezuela\u2019s official exchange rate is being studied, the government officials said.Tareck El AissamiPress departments at the government ministries didn\u2019t immediately reply to requests for comment on the meeting.Maduro\u2019s government is scrambling to try to work around U.S. sanctions and asset freezes that are crippling state finances and curtailing Venezuela\u2019s ability to operate in the global financial system. Restricted access to raw materials, price controls and a lack of dollars to import goods have already prompted multinational companies to leave the troubled nation, such as Kellogg Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp.The sudden emergence of Juan Guaido, the opposition head of the National Assembly, and the global support he\u2019s received recognizing him as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, has given business leaders and investors renewed optimism that an end to the two-decade socialist regime could be near. Still, Maduro continues to control nearly all levers of the state at home.Nicolas MaduroMaduro continues to enjoy international support from China, Russia and Turkey while India has become a key buyer of its crude oil that was previously shipped to the U.S.In October, private banks were encouraged by the monetary authority to open accounts with Moscow-based Evrofinance Mosnarbank in order to clear international transactions. The bank is half owned by the Venezuelan state with the remainder in the hands of Russia\u2019s VTB Group and Gazprombank.While the pace of price increases in the last few weeks has slowed, the annual inflation rate now stands at 359,900 percent, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Cafe Con Leche Index. Venezuela\u2019s five-year recession has wiped out consumer demand and purchasing power to the point where a monthly minimum wage is barely enough to buy one McDonald\u2019s meal or three liters of Pepsi. ","82":"President resumes attack on central bank after weeks of quiet. Remarks seem to rehash old grievences, not herald new assault President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to blame Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for any hiccups in the U.S. economy have made a comeback -- this time directed at his conservative base as he gears up for a tough 2020 re-election campaign.And many investors and economists listening in are learning to tune out the complaints.Trump may be lining up his hand-picked choice to lead the Fed as a scapegoat in case his trade and tax policies don\u2019t succeed: firing off a series of tweets, interviews and off-the-cuff remarks -- unprecedented for an American president -- that have at times shaken financial markets.Jerome PowellOn Saturday Trump laid out the same old gripes, ending a period of quiet from him on the Fed during which Powell and most of his Fed colleagues have pivoted toward being patient on further interest rate increases. That shift calmed markets and essentially gave Trump what he wanted. The S&P 500 Index is up almost 12 percent since the end of 2018, and the greenback is slightly softer on the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index.While Trump\u2019s criticisms may sound familiar to investors, the president is using those grievances to impress and motivate his supporters. During a wide-ranging, largely unscripted two-hour speech on Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump took a swipe at Powell as someone who \u201clikes raising rates\u201d and a \u201cgentleman that likes a very strong dollar.\u201dTrump\u00a0said the dollar\u00a0is too strong and took a swipe at Powell\u00a0as someone who \u201clikes raising interest rates.\"The speech also touched on an array of other long-standing Trump complaints, including Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, media reporting on the size of Trump\u2019s inauguration crowds, and immigration.\u201cThe comments were made during a political speech and appear to me more political commentary for his base, rather than serious policy considerations,\u201d said Mark Sobel, U.S. chairman for the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based think-tank. Trump\u2019s own expansionary fiscal policy, which has given the economy a boost, have \u201cheavily contributed to the outcome which he decries\u201d at the Fed and with the dollar, Sobel said.Trump\u2019s speech on Saturday was an early glimpse of his focus on the 2020 election. Democrats taking the field, including senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, are stepping up attacks on his economic agenda, including the 2017 tax cuts and the domestic impact from the trade war with China.While the Fed took some political heat during the financial crisis a decade ago, Trump\u2019s attacks come with U.S. unemployment near a 50-year low. Fourth-quarter GDP data released Friday showed a steadier-than-expected economy, though the Fed does see sufficient uncertainties ahead to warrant a wait-and-see attitude on rates. Investors bet it will stay on hold all year, according to interest rate futures pricing.Trump\u2019s comments on the dollar may give other leaders the license to also jawbone their currencies, said Sobel. And they also threaten to undermine Trump\u2019s trade team\u2019s efforts to negotiate currency provisions into trade deals. A new pact with Canada and Mexico has an exchange-rate mechanism, as will any agreement that Trump strikes with China.Traditionally, commentary on the U.S. dollar is reserved for the Treasury Secretary, while Fed officials focus on monetary policy and their dual mandates involving inflation and employment. The current secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has broadly stuck to the mantra of a strong dollar being good for the economy. A Treasury department spokesman didn\u2019t reply to emailed questions about whether Mnuchin agreed with Trump\u2019s latest comments on the dollar.Read More: Fed Puts Markets on Notice Over Its Needs for Rate PatienceFinancial markets went into a tailspin late last year over concerns the Fed would keep raising rates and on worries about a trade war. U.S. stocks suffered their steepest December losses since the Great Depression, with Bloomberg reporting that Trump had discussed firing Powell, his pick to lead the Fed. Alarm over that report, published late Friday, Dec. 21, saw stocks take another vicious tumble on Dec. 24 when Wall Street trading resumed.Trump curbed his public attacks of the Fed shortly after that episode, and central bank officials have since gone out of their way to stress they\u2019re in no rush to hike rates. They held borrowing costs steady at their January meeting, and shortly after that Powell joined the president for a steak dinner at the White House on Feb. 4 to discuss the economy\u2019s performance. Monetary policy wasn\u2019t discussed, according to Mnuchin, who was also present.Related: Mnuchin Says\u00a0Powell\u00a0May Be Invited Back to White House AgainThe U.S. dollar slipped early Monday trading in Asia after Trump\u2019s comments, but many investors are likely to discount the latest rhetoric.\u201cTrump\u2019s message has not changed since December, he\u2019s still talking about the need for a Fed that doesn\u2019t hike aggressively and is more sensitive to the markets and to avoid a strong dollar,\u201d said Tom Orlik, chief economist for Bloomberg Economics. \u201cThe impact on the markets will be less.\u201dPrior to Trump, public White House criticism of the Fed had been rare, out of respect for the central bank\u2019s independence to conduct monetary policy and keep inflation in check. Fed independence is an article of faith among investors who buy U.S. debt and finance the country\u2019s budget deficit, who rely on the central bank to ignore political pressure to keep rates unnecessarily low, which could weaken the dollar. ","83":"Authorities make series of arrests of high-profile individuals. Debt scandal may damage ruling party\u2019s chances in October vote Mozambique\u2019s government is scrambling to contain the fallout from a U.S. investigation into the country\u2019s $2 billion hidden-debt scandal, ordering a series of high-profile arrests in the past week.The detentions signal concern among Mozambican authorities that the U.S. probe may reveal more corruption by ruling Frelimo party officials as they prepare to compete in general elections in October. Those arraigned so far include the ex-head of intelligence and a son of former president and high-ranking Frelimo official Armando Guebuza.Armando Guebuza.\u201cThe investigation and prosecution by the U.S. attorney general is the biggest crisis for Frelimo since multiparty elections started in 1994,\u201d Darias Jonker, Africa director at Eurasia Group, said by email. \u201cAlthough it is unlikely that former President Armando Guebuza will himself be arrested and prosecuted, the detention of his son shows how desperate Frelimo is to contain the crisis.\u201dSince Feb. 14, Mozambique authorities have detained at least six people in connection with the case, including:Making the arrests will enable President Filipe Nyusi to tell the electorate that those suspected of corruption have been apprehended, said Domingos do Rosario, political science professor at Eduardo Mondlane University in the capital, Maputo. They may also be an attempt to appease foreign donors that the state is acting to stamp out graft, he said.\u201cThe main idea is to clean the image of the party, not only because of the general elections, but also before the Americans and donors,\u201d Do Rosario said. The strategy could backfire if it causes major fissures in Frelimo, he said. The party didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.The detentions follow the arraignment by South African authorities of former Mozambican Finance Minister Manuel Chang in December on a U.S. indictment. Chang is accused of taking at least $5 million in bribes and conspiring to commit securities fraud in connection with the hidden-debt scandal.None of those arrested has been found guilty of wrongdoing. Guebuza senior hasn\u2019t been formally accused of wrongdoing. Arguments in the Johannesburg case for the extradition of Chang, who last week lost his bid to be granted bail, are scheduled for Feb. 26. Mozambique has since also formally requested Chang\u2019s extradition, said Max Mpuzana, a spokesman at South Africa\u2019s department of justice.The request to have Chang sent home may be an attempt to limit further political damage, according to Jonker.\u201cPreventing Chang from extradition to the U.S. is key to protecting Guebuza senior and preventing an all-out expose of who all was involved in the scandal,\u201d he said.How the extradition applications are dealt with could depend on whether Mozambique is deemed to be a so-called \u201cassociated African state,\u201d according to Anton Katz, a Cape Town-based advocate who specializes in extradition law.For requests from associated states, the magistrate decides on whether or not to grant extradition, Katz said. For an unassociated state, such as the U.S., the magistrate decides whether the accused person is extraditable, and the justice minister makes a final decision on the request, he said.The timing of the competing requests doesn\u2019t matter under law, and it\u2019s up to the prosecutor which to pursue more vigorously.\u201cThe one with the less risk of not succeeding is the one I\u2019d pursue,\u201d Katz said. The recent arrests in Mozambique \u201cshould have absolutely no bearing whatsoever\u201d on the nation\u2019s bid to have Chang sent home, he said.

It\u2019s\u00a0not right that many elderly people see most of their pension benefits spent\u00a0on daily doses to manage chronic diseases, and the social insurance system\u00a0will broaden its coverage and raise reimbursement rates, he said.\u00a0For years, the nation\u2019s largest drugmakers happily sold low-cost generic medicines yielding gross margins of 80 percent\u00a0to 90 percent without giving much thought to consumer protection or innovation. Adding insult to injury, many of the drugs are no good. There are more than 4,000 generic drugs waiting to pass the government\u2019s new bio-equivalence tests, and as of last November, only 40 of those drugs have demonstrated that they work as well as the original formula.\u00a0Looking at how well healthcare stocks have been doing though, it\u2019s almost as if in the midst of a bull market, investors have forgotten the trouble they\u2019re in.

In China, healthcare costs are mainly covered by\u00a0state\u00a0medical insurance and by patients themselves. Private health insurance only\u00a0plays a very small\u00a0part.\u00a0Without government subsidies, China\u2019s 2.3 trillion yuan ($343 billion) social insurance fund would have been in deficit as early as 2011, the earliest comparable data available.

China\u2019s\u00a0medical insurance fund is broadly divided into two sections: individual saving accounts which are mostly funded by companies and their employees\u2019 social security contributions, and a social pooling fund, propped up by subsidies from the Ministry of Finance. Starting May 1, China will cut the  onerous social security burdens companies have to shoulder, which means these\u00a0individual savings accounts will need more government support,\u00a0too.\u00a0China\u2019s $3 trillion foreign exchange reserve masks the big financing headaches the government faces. While China\u2019s stated fiscal deficit target for 2019 is only 2.8 percent (lower than the international standard of 3 percent), the actual deficit, including hidden debt issued by local governments, could\u00a0be in the  neighborhood of 8 percent.\u00a0Beijing isn\u2019t going to cut corners on the middle class in its need for healthcare, because that\u2019s an important social issue; nor does it want\u00a0to plunge further into a deficit hole.

Bank board has given countries until Thursday for nominations Senior U.S. Treasury official David Malpass is on track to be named the next president of the World Bank after no other candidates emerged to challenge President Donald Trump\u2019s pick, according to several people familiar with the matter.Countries have until 9 a.m. on Thursday in Washington to nominate candidates to lead the development lender. No nominees beside Malpass have been proposed, paving the way for the lender\u2019s executive board to appoint him in the coming weeks, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.While it\u2019s possible a country could have submitted a nomination in secret or a challenger could swoop in at the last minute, those scenarios are considered highly unlikely because candidates need to build public support for their appointment.Trump nominated Malpass last month, choosing a loyalist who had been sharply critical of China and called for a shakeup of the global economic order. Critics including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz questioned the selection, pointing to Malpass\u2019s doubts about international cooperation.Before his nomination, Malpass portrayed the World Bank as too big, inefficient and reluctant to cut funding for developing countries that grow into dynamic emerging markets. He pushed the bank to lend less to China, arguing the world\u2019s second-biggest economy has the financial resources to support itself.China\u2019s Tab at World Bank May Get Squeezed Under Trump\u2019s NomineeBut since being nominated, Malpass has adopted a gentler tone, noting that he was America\u2019s lead negotiator on a package of reforms under which the bank will receive a $13-billion capital increase. Under the plan, the bank will focus more lending on lower-income countries.The World Bank was conceived during the Second World War to finance the reconstruction of Europe, but its mission has evolved to focus on eliminating extreme poverty around the world. The selection process for the next president is being overseen by the bank\u2019s executive board, which represents its 189 member countries.The board has said it wants to appoint the next president before the bank\u2019s spring meetings in Washington, which begin April 12.Malpass would succeed Jim Yong Kim, who stepped down Feb. 1 to join an investment firm. Kristalina Georgieva, Chief executive officer of the bank, has been acting as the interim president.Under an informal pact with Europe, the World Bank president has always been American, while the managing director of the International Monetary Fund has always been European. Some experts have called for the bank to break with tradition and appoint a non-American in recognition of the growing clout of emerging markets such as China and India, and the lender\u2019s focus on development.While countries outside the U.S. wanted to see more competition for the job, governments were reluctant to nominate other candidates for fear of getting into conflict with the Trump administration, said a person briefed on the matter.Malpass held senior posts at the Treasury and State department under Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. He served as chief economist at Bear Stearns, an investment bank that collapsed during the global financial crisis.As Treasury undersecretary for international affairs under Trump, he represents the U.S. at international economic gatherings including G-20 summits and the IMF and World Bank meetings.

Ahead of serving his sentence, he\u2019s spent hours supplying information to Congress and federal prosecutors in New York and Washington about alleged crimes committed by Trump, his family business and his inner circle.Cohen has accused Trump of lying to banks and insurers in business dealings; to voters about his pursuit of a deal to build a luxury tower in Moscow even as the Russian government was attempting to intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign; and about hush-money payments to women alleging extramarital affairs. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations tied to the hush-money payments. ","90":" A look at Russia\u2019s books suggests Vladimir Putin is preparing for war, though not necessarily the kind involving the invincible hypersonic missiles and\u00a0nuclear torpedoes he\u2019s been bragging about for a year.Putin&apos;s quietly built a financial fortress that government officials and Kremlin advisers say will safeguard the economy from the escalating  salvos\u00a0they see coming, all while keeping the U.S. and its allies guessing about Russia\u2019s military capabilities and intentions.It\u2019s a goal Putin\u2019s been pursuing since he rose to power at the turn of the millennium, one that\u2019s gained urgency with each new crisis with the West. During the global credit squeeze a decade ago, Russia\u2019s main stock index lost three-fourths of its value. Five years ago, the ruble halved against the dollar in the wake of collapsing oil prices and the imposition of sanctions over Ukraine, triggering the longest recession of his rule.Now Russia is growing again despite adopting one of the most tightfisted budgets of any major economy. This year\u2019s total spending bill, about $270 billion, is less than half the Pentagon\u2019s\u2014and Russia is collecting more rubles than it\u2019s disbursing. The country was one of only three in the Group of 20 to run a surplus last year and its debt burden is by far the lowest in the club.Russia\u2019s budget surplus is allowing Putin to stockpile cash for future crisesSource: 2018 IMF calculations, estimatesAll About the U.S. Sanctions Aimed at Putin\u2019s Russia: QuickTakeThe turnaround can be traced to a decision Putin made at a closed-door meeting with his economic advisers in the fall of 2016 that surprised even the most fiscally hawkish among them, according to three people familiar with the matter. Russia was about to codify a requirement to sequester all oil revenue above a particular price point and Putin chose the most pessimistic scenario presented to him\u2014$40 a barrel, less than half the average for the previous decade.What made the decision so remarkable, these people said, was the political risks it entailed. Putin was heading toward elections with a shrinking economy while managing a high-stakes military intervention in Syria and bracing for what looked certain to be a White House victory for Hillary Clinton, a virulent critic who\u2019d just compared him to Adolf Hitler.Instead of loosening the purse strings to appease the competing domestic groups that undergird his system of governance, he yanked them tight. Putin cut spending across the board\u2014including defense\u2014to replenish Russia\u2019s rainy day fund. At the same time, the central bank was refueling its reserves after abandoning a costly defense of the ruble to focus on amassing gold and yuan, liquidating most of its U.S. Treasury bills without warning.\u201cPutin is accumulating savings because they give him power,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cHe needs money to fight the West, to deal with intensifying sanctions and to address future economic crises.\u201dDebt-rating services and financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund\u00a0are applauding, albeit with caution in light of repeated threats of more punitive action from Washington and Brussels.  Moody\u2019s\u00a0this month followed S&P in restoring Russia\u2019s credit score to investment grade, saying the country\u2019s balance sheet has become bulletproof enough to absorb the likely impact of the additional sanctions its analysts are expecting.But Putin\u2019s austerity drive is eating away at the considerable cache of political capital he\u2019s amassed during his tenure in the Kremlin, the longest since Josef Stalin: Growth is anemic; real incomes continue to decline; interest rates remain relatively high; inflation is picking up; and the steady hikes in state pensions that were hallmarks of earlier terms have plateaued.Adding to the distrust that has dragged Putin\u2019s approval rating to a decade low is a law he signed after his landslide victory last March that raises the retirement age by five years. The cost-saving measure was widely opposed in a country where most people were born under communism, leading to a rare outbreak of protests. A hike in the value-added tax is further eroding purchasing power, stoking a rise in consumer debt and deepening public discontent.\u201cThe leadership of our country decided on a highly conservative scenario: save up as much as possible and spend as little as possible,\u201d said Yaroslav Kuzminov, the dean of the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. \u201cThe goal now is to preserve what\u2019s been achieved, macroeconomic and budget stability, even at the expense of spurring growth.\u201dA favorite Putin metric\u2014the central bank\u2019s reserves\u2014has risen by about $125 billion in the past four years to $475 billion. The stockpile, the world\u2019s fifth largest, is still well shy of the $598 billion peak reached in 2008, when oil flirted with $150 a barrel.Russia\u2019s sequestration mechanism and wealth fund are\u00a0modeled on Norway\u2019s system for hedging against fluctuations in crude prices and ensuring future pensions. But unlike Norway, which rarely taps its $1 trillion hoard in Oslo, officials in Moscow drain Russia\u2019s pool whenever times get tough, according to Karen Vartapetov, a debt analyst at S&P.\u201cAll previous cancellations of the budget rule were linked to some force majeure,\u201d said Vartapetov. \u201cRussia is now accumulating funds a bit faster that the current oil environment would assume because of the probability of other shocks, including new sanctions.\u201dTo keep the expansion going, Putin is relying more on businesses for investment and less on the multiyear, budget-funded infrastructure projects like those he ordered up for the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2018 World Cup. He\u2019s made it clear to constituents that he sees Russia as being under siege, both from Western financial centers and NATO forces, but he\u2019s also said that he won\u2019t make the same mistake as the Soviet Union and be goaded into a disastrous spending spree.The Soviet empire collapsed in 1991 in part because the Kremlin decided to splurge on vital industries like defense to compete with the U.S. at a time when revenues were inextricably linked to tumbling oil prices beyond its control. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, racked up tens of billions of dollars of debt to finance the purchase of food and consumer goods from the West that Putin methodically whittled down, eventually paying almost all of it off ahead of schedule.Putin&apos;s driven Russia&apos;s debt level to the lowest in the G-20 relative to GDPSource: Bank of RussiaNow, thanks in no small part to a 23 percent jump in tax collections last year, Russia\u2019s balance sheet has never looked better, according to Putin.\u00a0\u201cFor the first time in our history our reserves cover all foreign debt, both state and commercial,\u201d the Russian president told lawmakers in his annual address to the upper house of parliament on Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cWe have a powerful financial safety cushion.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Andrey Biryukov ","91":"Trump trade negotiator declines to predict success of talks. U.S. considering China request to roll back trade tariffs President Donald Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator said the U.S. must keep the option of raising tariffs on Chinese imports as a way to ensure Beijing lives up to a trade agreement that could be finalized in a matter of weeks.\u201cWe have to maintain the right to be able to -- whatever happens to the current tariffs -- to raise tariffs in situations where there\u2019s violations of the agreement,\u201d U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Tuesday in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cI can\u2019t predict success at this point, but we\u2019re working hard and we have made real progress.\u201dUnder questioning from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, Lighthizer declined to say the administration will roll back U.S. tariffs if it reaches a deal with the Chinese. \u201cThat\u2019s still a subject matter of negotiation,\u201d Lighthizer said.Lighthizer\u2019s comments push back against speculation that a deal between the U.S. and China could see them reverse tariffs on roughly $360 billion of goods they\u2019ve imposed on each other\u2019s imports since July. Investors have been heartened by signs that Trump is looking to sign a deal with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, possibly at a summit at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as early as this month or next.Lighthizer said that the U.S. is making \u201cheadway\u201d on issues it considers important, including its desire for China to make deep structural changes to its state-driven economic system. Negotiators are working continuously, and the final document will be very detailed, possibly running as long as 120 pages, he said.\u201cIn terms of timeframe, our hope is that we\u2019re in the final weeks of having an agreement, but I\u2019m not predicting one,\u201d Lighthizer said. \u201cThere still are major, major issues that have to be resolved. And if those issues are not resolved in a way that\u2019s beneficial to the United States, we will not have an agreement.\u201dAny deal must be enforceable or Trump won\u2019t sign it, he added.China is pushing for the U.S. to remove tariffs imposed on its goods last year following a USTR probe into Beijing\u2019s intellectual property practices known as a Section 301 investigation, said the trade chief.\u201cThe focus of the negotiation from the Chinese side is the removing of 301 tariffs,\u201d said Lighthizer. China is also asking for \u201cspecific market access provisions that we also are considering.\u201d ","92":" The oldest trick off the book.Investors trying to gauge how much appetite China has for stimulus should ignore official targets and look at local government bond issues instead.Premier Li Keqiang set a 2019  GDP growth target of 6 percent to 6.5 percent at the National People\u2019s Congress on Tuesday, down from \u201caround 6.5 percent\u201d\u00a0in 2017 and 2018. While Beijing\u2019s targeted fiscal deficit of 2.8\u00a0percent is higher than last year\u2019s 2.6 percent, billions will be going to cuts in personal-income and value-added taxes instead of on infrastructure projects. Tax cuts work like ayurvedic medicine\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it may be years before real benefits are seen. Hardly thrilling, is it?China is relying on special purpose bonds to finance its infrastructure projectsSource: J Capital ResearchIn reality, though, Beijing has found a new way to finance its spending, off the books and under the\u00a0radar for outside observers.\u00a0Special purpose bonds are the new fad. Just like debt issued by local-government financing vehicles, or LGFVs, these aren\u2019t\u00a0included in the balance sheets of municipal authorities.\u00a0The argument is\u00a0simple: In theory, cash flow from underlying projects can cover interest and principal payments; therefore, the credit profile of these bonds is\u00a0independent of a local government\u2019s\u00a0fiscal situation, and should be excluded from its\u00a0budget.China tiptoed into these bonds in 2015, when Beijing was starting to phase\u00a0out LGFVs. At first, they were used to\u00a0roll over old debt incurred by the financing vehicles, but increasingly, they are being deployed to finance new infrastructure projects. By the end of 2018, the country had amassed\u00a07.4 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion)\u00a0of such bonds, equivalent to about 8 percent of GDP.China plans to sell 2.15 trillion yuan in special local government bonds this year, up from 1.9 trillion yuan issued in 2018, Li said in his work report. Most likely, a higher proportion of this year\u2019s proceeds will go into stimulus spending. Last year, more than 80 percent of incremental infrastructure spending was funded by special purpose bonds.Local governments rushed to sell special purpose bonds after July&apos;s Politburo meeting, when China shifted the nation\u2019s economic priority back to growthSource: The People&apos;s Bank of ChinaMost of those were sold in the last few months of the year. Even local governments\u00a0were in dormant mode in the first seven months as\u00a0Beijing cracked\u00a0down on excess corporate debt.\u00a0But trade spats with the U.S. and a heavy-handed deleveraging campaign started to weigh on the real economy. Right after\u00a0July\u2019s Politburo meeting, during which China\u2019s 25 most senior leaders  shifted back to prioritizing growth, these issues spiked.In August, the Ministry of Finance set off a frenzy for the bonds by \u201cguiding\u201d that they needed to pay coupons at least 40 basis points above sovereign issues of the same tenor. Banks and insurers rushed in, because under the current capital adequacy rules, municipals are considered as safe as sovereigns provided they offer a 36-basis-point spread.The craze carried into 2019.\u00a0In previous years, local governments would issue new bonds only\u00a0after Beijing\u2019s\u00a0budget report, released\u00a0during the NPC\u2019s annual meeting in March. In the first two months of 2017 and 2018, for examples, new issues were nil.This year is different. Sales were robust in January, according to the latest data available. In late December, the State Council said\u00a0local governments could issue as much as 810 billion yuan of incremental\u00a0new bonds\u00a0in 2019, paving the way for sales to start before this week\u2019s congress. In general, it takes three to six months before bond proceeds can be deployed on infrastructure spending.Using debt to build railways\u00a0and highways seems to be\u00a0Beijing\u2019s\u00a0way out of recessions. After the 2008 global financial crisis, a 4 trillion yuan stimulus saved the economy. In 2012, the country turned to infrastructure spending again, mainly\u00a0with the help of\u00a0LGFV borrowing.That spending came at great cost. China has stacked up almost\u00a030 trillion yuan of LGFV debt, according to HSBC Holdings Plc, or\u00a0roughly 30 percent of GDP. Once LGFV debt and special purpose bonds are accounted for, Beijing year after year is racking up a fiscal deficit in the\u00a0neighborhood of 8 percent of GDP, more than twice the official figure, the bank estimates.Beijing has repeatedly used infrastructure spending to lift the economy out of recession. In 2008, a recovery took only three months. In 2012, it was twice as longSource: BloombergThe time it takes for an infrastructure binge to spur a recovery\u00a0is lengthening, though.\u00a0In 2008, it took China\u2019s economy only three months to bounce back. In 2012, it was six months. The question is whether Beijing will be able to use its magic wand this time, and how long it will take.The government may ignore that inconvenient truth. In its view, experience has shown that fiscal stimulus works. The theory goes that if this round of spending lifts the economy again, wage growth will reaccelerate and\u00a0so will land sales \u2014\u00a0the main source of local governments\u2019 income. By that logic, municipalities will be on a more solid financial footing and some extra debt won\u2019t be too dangerous.So China will just stay calm and carry on.

The disciplinary panel had already asked the appeals court to disbar Cohen following his guilty plea in August to five counts of tax evasion, one count of making a false statement to a financial institution and two federal campaign finance violations related to his role in paying two women to keep quiet about their alleged sexual encounters with Trump before he became president.In his appearances before Congress, Cohen is prepared to depict his former boss as a liar and a possible criminal who manipulated his financial statements and frequently made racist remarks, a person familiar with his planned testimony said.

Its local-currency bond fund for emerging markets outperformed 91 percent of peers in the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Ruble bonds handed returns more than triple the EM average this yearSource: Bloomberg\u201cWe\u2019re not sure what the U.S. administration is going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cProhibiting western investors from owning Russian debt would be a very extreme event, but just because it is extreme does not mean that its probability is low. We think it is possible.\u201dThe threat that Washington could hobble the local bond market has prompted investors including Eaton Vance, Ashmore Group Plc and Morgan Stanley Investment Management to cut their exposure to Russia. For others, the nation\u2019s investment-grade credit score and high real yields are impossible to resist, while its low debt levels and growing reserves offer the hope that the economy is effectively sanctions-proof.The optimists have driven a rally that\u2019s seen ruble-denominated bonds deliver a 7.5 percent return so far this year, even after the U.S. Senate renewed a bill last month seeking more penalties on Russia for alleged elections meddling. The currency is up 5.7 percent in 2019, the best rally globally. According to Murphy, investors could easily see those gains flip to the kind of double-digit loss posted last year if geopolitical tensions worsen.\u201cThey\u2019re probably feeling great now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might regret it later.\u201dForeigners\u2019 share of ruble notes, known as OFZs, rose in January for the first time since March, according to the latest data from Bank of Russia.

Buyout firms\u2019 record for raised money could fuel issuance There are 1.2 trillion reasons for U.S. junk bond and leveraged loan issuance to stay relatively strong this year.That\u2019s how much money private equity firms globally had available to deploy as of the end of last year, a record level that\u2019s 17 percent above 2017 figures, according to Preqin. The buyouts they\u2019ll need to finance should keep U.S. issuance volume from plunging this year.\u201cIt all depends on what the private equity shops do,\u201d said Randall Parrish, senior high-yield portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management in Atlanta. \u201cThey have raised enough capital that there has to be pressure on them to deploy.\u201dPrivate equity dry powder at recordPreqin\nIt\u2019s easy to lose sight of that fact amid recent market slowness. With the Federal Reserve on hold with rate hikes, investors have lost some of their passion for floating-rate debt offerings. New U.S. leveraged loan sales have fallen nearly 20 percent to $45.7 billion through Feb. 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. High-yield bond sales have also declined, down about 7 percent to $35.5 billion.Figuring out how much issuance will come in 2019 is a critical question for loan and bond investors. The recent lack of supply has helped high-yield bonds gain about 5.5% this year, a record start to the year, and leveraged loans pick up to 3.42%. And light supply could give private equity more negotiating power in deals that do come to market, allowing them to argue for looser terms, for example.The near-term pipeline for issuance still looks relatively weak. There\u2019s a $10 billion financing expected in the coming weeks for the buyout of Johnson Controls International Plc\u2019s car-battery unit. But most of the biggest acquisition-related offerings in the works at the start of the year have already been sold, including CommScope Holding Co.\u2019s $7 billion deal and TransDigm Group Inc.\u2019s $4.55 billion of issuances.Read More in the Credit Brief: Preparing for the Credit Cycle\u2019s EndAcquisition volume, an important source of issuance, was hurt by big fluctuations in stock and bond markets starting in October. That volatility makes it hard to determine exactly how much assets will be worth and how high financing costs will be at any given time. Fourth-quarter merger and acquisition volume in the U.S. fell to about $460 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, the lowest level since the third quarter of 2017.\u201cHigher volatility does tend to lower M&A,\u201d said Bradley Rogoff, global head of credit strategy at Barclays Plc. \u201cWhen the market is volatile, opportunistic financing goes away.\u201dVolatility has been settling down this month, according to the VIX index for stocks and MOVE index for bonds, which could help lift acquisition volume, and issuance from current levels. Wall Street banks, including Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., and Bank of America Corp., forecast only slightly less leveraged loan sales this year compared with 2018.\u201cIn terms of M&A, I do expect more issuance as this cycle still has legs,\" said Bill Housey, senior portfolio manager at First Trust Advisors.Even with expected LBOs, there are other factors likely to cut into leveraged finance issuance volume. Tax cuts have increased cash flow for at least some companies, reducing their financing needs. Trade disputes between China and the U.S. may also be delaying capital investments, acquisitions, and associated borrowing, First Trust\u2019s Housey said.And more borrowers are getting loans in the private markets, instead of syndicated loans. This month office supply company Staples Inc. opted to get a $350 million term loan from Golub Capital to back its purchase of DEX Imaging Inc., rather than have a bank sell the debt to investors as it did for a 2017 financing.\"Private debt is one of the places where the issuance is going,\" said John Yovanovic of PineBridge Capital.But as long as buyouts keep coming, so will junk bond and leveraged loan sales.\u201cThere\u2019s bit of uncertainty right now,\u201d said Frank Ossino, portfolio manager at Newfleet Asset Management. \u201cHaving said that, there are plenty of PE dollars.\" ","96":"Jim Zelter says he wants to build the GE Capital of tomorrow.You read that right.Zelter\u2019s firm, Apollo Global Management, is slowly picking off pieces of the finance arm that nearly brought down General Electric Co.Apollo has already bought billions of investments once managed by GE Capital, and it\u2019s been sizing up GE\u2019s insurance and jet-leasing businesses, people familiar with the matter have said. GE\u2019s new leader, Larry Culp, is working to turn around the embattled conglomerate, which expects negative cash flow this year in its industrial businesses.Jim ZelterIt\u2019s quite a switch for both GE and Apollo, the buyout giant led by Leon Black. Apollo is trying to rekindle some of GE\u2019s old magic without repeating the company\u2019s mistakes, which led to a 2008 taxpayer bailout. Few think it\u2019ll be easy to recreate GE Capital, which, at its peak, held more than $500 billion in assets, dwarfing Wall Street rivals.\u201cApollo can still build a great business, but it\u2019s quite hard to build one of the scale and breadth that GE built,\u201d said John Dionne, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and a senior adviser to one of Apollo\u2019s closest competitors, Blackstone Group LP. The talks with GE aren\u2019t Apollo\u2019s only foray into industrial financing. On Thursday, it agreed to buy a majority stake in Direct ChassisLink, one of the largest companies for chassis leasing and other services to shipping firms, railroads, terminal operators and logistics companies. The price: $2.5 billion, according to a report by Reuters.It\u2019s part of the reordering of Wall Street following the longest recession in 70 years. No longer do the biggest banks have domain over extending credit. The so-called shadow banking system has filled the gaps where regulators limited deposit-taking institutions, and firms like Apollo have swooped in to take advantage. Regulators employ less oversight on shadow banks, which don\u2019t take customer deposits.In the meantime, GE Capital has shrunk to about one-fifth its peak size.Zelter, Apollo\u2019s co-president, is betting Apollo can do GE Capital better than GE could. Apollo\u2019s credit business already manages $193 billion, the most of its private equity rivals. The New York-based firm will benefit from a range of funding sources that GE Capital could only envy. They include investors in its funds, its own employees and Athene Holding Ltd., an insurance company with more than $125 billion in assets and most of its funds invested with Apollo.Assets under management of credit businessData: Company filings\u201cI don\u2019t come into work every day thinking I want to have a bigger business than everyone else,\u201d Zelter said in an interview. \u201cSize is a result, not an objective.\u201d Zelter and an Apollo spokesman declined to comment on any discussions regarding transactions with GE.Apollo\u2019s three co-founders, Black, Josh Harris and Marc Rowan, know their way around debt markets, having built their careers at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk-bond pioneer run by Michael Milken. Harris has had his eye on GE Capital assets since at least 2015.The firm is no stranger to GE Capital. It boosted the growth of MidCap Financial in 2015 with the purchase of $3.6 billion in loans managed by GE Capital and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala Development Co. Apollo had acquired MidCap, a health-care lender with a $2 billion portfolio at the time, two years earlier.MidCap now has more than $19 billion of commitments and is one of Apollo\u2019s largest permanent-capital vehicles, meaning investors can\u2019t pull their money out on short notice. MidCap\u2019s 2018 returns were 19 percent, according to a February investor presentation. It finances real estate, mid-market companies and corporate takeovers led by other -- usually smaller -- private equity firms.Merx Aviation Finance, which Apollo created in 2012, also boosted growth through an acquisition from GE Capital. It bought 26 planes from GE Capital Aviation Services in 2013, launching the buyout firm\u2019s jet-leasing business. Merx has acquired 168 aircraft since its founding.One of Apollo\u2019s ready-made money sources -- its own employees and investors -- gave the firm the luxury last year of replacing a $275 million leveraged loan sale that had failed to clear the market. They provided additional equity to close the acquisition of a $1 billion portfolio of energy investments from GE Capital, people familiar with the transaction said.Apollo and Athene have expressed interest in buying all or part of GE Capital\u2019s insurance business, people familiar with the matter have said. Problems at the unit have caused the industrial conglomerate to take billions of dollars in writedowns and spurred a regulatory review.Culp said it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether GE will sell the insurance division or continue to manage it as a runoff liability. Apollo is one of only a few potential buyers that would be able to acquire such a portfolio. Blackstone has expressed interest in helping to manage the assets rather than taking on the liabilities directly, people familiar with the matter said.Larry CulpAnother advantage Apollo has over its peers: It chooses to underwrite most of its loans. Jim Belardi, Athene\u2019s CEO, told investors that Apollo had about 150 people dedicated to direct origination and looks to double that.

The legal and political drama involves a deal between the country and a tiny natural gas company that was scuttled after the sudden death of Nigeria\u2019s president in 2010. The company, Process & Industrial Developments (P&ID), sued and won a staggering judgment, now worth $9 billion. But it\u2019s spent years trying to get the country to pay that award, equivalent to almost 2.5 percent of its annual gross domestic product.Now a hedge fund managed by VR Capital Group has taken a large stake in P&ID. And the gas company is trying to pull levers of power in the U.S. and the U.K. to make Nigeria settle or, failing that, enable the company to start seizing assets.Two years ago, P&ID won a decision against the government of Nigeria, which reneged on an agreement allowing the natural gas company to harvest hydrocarbons. Although lawyers for Nigeria say the company never put a shovel in the ground, a London arbitration tribunal in 2017 awarded it $6.6 billion\u2014with more than $1 million in interest accruing daily.To collect, P&ID, owned by the hedge fund and a firm called Lismore Capital Ltd., late last year hired lobbyists, lawyers, and a public-relations firm. The attorneys are also trying to confirm the award in courtrooms in Washington and London, which would allow P&ID to start seizing Nigerian assets in the U.S. and the U.K.Representatives from VR Capital, which is managed by Richard Deitz, didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment. Dayo Apata, Nigeria\u2019s solicitor general, said in a statement that the country \u201cwill ensure that its interests and that of the people of Nigeria are vigorously defended.\u201d He wrote that the arbitration panel assumed too much confidence in the success of P&ID\u2019s project in calculating the damages, leading to an excessive award.In a statement, Brendan Cahill, one of P&ID\u2019s founders, said \u201cit is disappointing that Nigeria chose to repudiate the terms of a deal that would have benefited the country by bringing electricity to millions of its citizens.\u201d He said the company, \u201cbacked by its investors,\u201d would pursue enforcement of the award.VR Capital\u2019s bet appears to be the latest example of a tactic used by investors in distressed assets. Companies including Paulson & Co., Elliott Management, and Pershing Square Capital Management in the past several years have taken stakes in investments that few would touch, and then hired lawyers and lobbyists to change the political winds to make them succeed. The strategy worked for Elliott and its co-investors when they won a  massive settlement on defaulted Argentine debt. The outcome is less certain for some Puerto Rico bondholders and shareholders in U.S. mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The Nigerian saga began almost a decade ago and is revealed through court and arbitration filings and other public documents. Despite the country\u2019s ample natural resources, Nigeria\u2019s state-owned electric and petroleum companies have  struggled to power the country. To help fix the problem, in 2010 then-President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua authorized partnerships with private companies to develop the nation\u2019s energy infrastructure. The Ministry of Petroleum Resources struck one such agreement in January 2010 with P&ID, which was founded in 2006 by two Irishmen, Michael Quinn and Cahill.Under the agreement, Nigeria planned to pipe natural gas from two offshore oil rigs to a refinery that would be built by P&ID. There, P&ID would remove hydrocarbons from the gas and send the fuel to Nigerian power plants. P&ID wouldn\u2019t get paid for the endeavor, but it could keep and sell the hydrocarbon byproducts, which themselves had value, with the government getting a cut.The company hoped it would make billions of dollars from the arrangement while helping to provide Nigeria with much-needed power. Quinn, in a statement before an arbitration panel, said he thought the deal would have been \u201cthe high point of my own career in Nigerian business.\u201d He said P&ID spent tens of millions of dollars on preparatory work before winning the agreement.But the project never got off the ground. In May 2010, Yar\u2019Adua, who\u2019d been suffering from pericarditis, died. The oil rigs couldn\u2019t provide the volume of natural gas promised in the agreement, and, in any case, the government didn\u2019t construct the pipeline. After about two years of trying to resolve its dispute with the government, P&ID filed for arbitration in London, where the agreement specified disputes would be handled. The arbiters sided with P&ID.The Nigerian government appealed the decision in London, arguing that the petroleum ministry didn\u2019t have the authority to enter into the agreement and the arbitration panel used the wrong legal standard. The government lost there, though it also turned to Nigeria\u2019s court system, where it won.Then the London arbiters came back with an award amount. P&ID never broke ground on the natural gas refinery, but said it spent about $40 million in the planning stages. It calculated its damages by estimating the profits it believed it would have earned over 20 years had the project gone forward: about $6 billion. Two of the three arbiters granted the enormous award. The third also said there should be damages, but set the level much lower.At some point, the Cayman-based fund, VR Advisory Services Ltd., bought 25 percent of P&ID, according to public records. A P&ID spokeswoman declined to comment on when VR bought its stake or to identify the owner of Lismore Capital.Last fall two firms registered with the U.S. Senate to lobby Congress and the Trump administration on behalf of the energy company. One of them, Kobre & Kim, which also represents P&ID in the District of Columbia courtroom, has a history of attempting to enforce judgments against foreign governments. The other, DCI Group, has made a specialty of public-relations work for Wall Street companies that attempt to use public pressure to make bets pay off. DCI in January said it had made $80,000 in fees in the fourth quarter from P&ID and lobbied the U.S. Department of State. Black Diamond Strategies LLC, which is stocked with conservative lobbyists, has also disclosed that DCI hired it for lobbying work on P&ID\u2019s behalf.The battle made headlines in Nigeria, where President Muhammadu Buhari was campaigning for a second term. (He won in February.) In November, when Nigerian officials visited the U.K. to pitch an offering of bonds, columnists there said Nigeria had to pay P&ID if it hoped to raise money from British investors. This prompted some in the Nigerian press to accuse commentators of being hired to attack Buhari. Cheta Nwanze, an analyst at Lagos-based risk advisory firm SBM Intelligence, says the government should have resolved the dispute and moved on. He says the president\u2019s decision not to do so \u201chas now caused a liability far exceeding any the country has ever incurred.\u201d \u2014With Elisha Bala-Gbogbo An arbitration judgment against Nigeria for pulling out of an energy deal could be worth almost 2.5 percent of the nation\u2019s annual GDP.","99":"Pay cap at asset managers has prompted many people to move. Twenty-five hedge funds launched in Israel last year alone Israel\u2019s small but fast-growing hedge-fund industry is getting a shot in the arm as staff from the nation\u2019s investment houses move across in search of higher pay.Twenty-five funds launched last year as money managers left their old firms and brought clients with them, according to Tzur Management, a Tel Aviv-based firm that tracks the industry. Hedge funds have seen an influx of staff since 2016, when the government capped pay at finance companies such as banks and money managers.\u201cWhen they do the math,\u201d money managers quickly recognize the higher earning potential at hedge funds, Tzur Managing Partner Yitz Raab said in an interview. \u201cThen there\u2019s also the freedom of running your own fund as opposed to being limited by the internal controls and rules and policies that you may be subject to at a pension fund.\u201dThe movement of people is the latest spur to Israel\u2019s hedge-fund sector, which has gained traction over the past decade with the country\u2019s rapid economic rise. The emergence of a world-class tech industry, in particular, has created a new class of Israeli millionaires keen to put their money to work.Fund managers are flocking to Israel&apos;s hedge fund industrySource: Tzur ManagementIn 2016, the Israeli government capped pay at certain finance companies at 2.5 million shekels ($690,000), defending the move as a blow against inequality.Warnings of a brain drain seem to have been borne out. The number of hedge funds in the country increased by a net 10 in 2018 to an all-time high of 150, according to Tzur. The total amount such firms oversee more than doubled in the past four years to $7 billion, the fund administrator\u2019s data show. That\u2019s still a small fraction of the $3 trillion-plus global hedge-fund market.The Israeli hedge-fund sector is growing, though, in contrast to the global industry, which has been blighted by outflows. Investors pulled $37.2 billion from hedge funds worldwide in 2018, while more funds closed than opened in the past three years, according to data from eVestment and Eurekahedge.Read more: \u2018Extraordinary\u2019 Month Heaps Further Pain on Hedge FundsIsraeli hedge funds actually suffered similar losses to the global industry amid last year\u2019s volatile stock markets, both ending the year down about 5 percent, according to Tzur and Hedge Fund Research. Yet investors\u2019 desire for a place to put their money helped shield Israel from the exodus of cash suffered by the industry as a whole.While most Israeli movers opted to start their own funds, existing hedge funds also took the opportunity to swell their ranks, Raab said.Among the most prominent examples is Noked Capital Ltd., founded in 2013 by former money managers at Psagot Investment House Ltd. Since the pay restrictions were introduced, the Tel Aviv-based hedge fund has added five more Psagot veterans to its management team, and poached several more from insurers and other investment houses. Noked declined to comment.\u201cThis means great things for the hedge-fund industry in Israel, which barely existed a decade ago,\u201d Raab said. \u201cWhen someone now leaves an institution and they are known and have a strong network, that makes the people in their network take notice.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Nishant Kumar ","100":" Want to receive this post in your inbox every day?\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for the\u00a0Balance of Power\u00a0newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for more.When Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. election after threatening to upend the global trading system, it looked like China had a rare chance to win friends and garner influence.More than two years on, things aren\u2019t working out so well for the budding superpower, Peter Martin reports. Opinion polls show China has failed to capitalize on Trump\u2019s international unpopularity \u2014 and its diplomats seem to be making things worse, particularly in the past few months.China\u2019s envoy to Canada publicly accused his hosts of \u201cwhite supremacy,\u201d its ambassador in Sweden blasted the country\u2019s \u201cso-called freedom of expression,\u201d and its chief emissary in South Africa said Trump\u2019s policies were making the U.S. \u201cthe enemy of the whole world.\u201d Foreign diplomats say their Chinese counterparts have become more aggressive and ideological in private meetings.The shift in tone appears to stem from the changing political climate in Beijing: Proving loyalty to President Xi Jinping has become a top imperative, and officials worry that publicly expressing dovish views could hurt their careers.With more countries growing skeptical of Chinese investment and its tech behemoths such as Huawei, it\u2019s becoming more important for China\u2019s diplomats to smooth the way. The question now is whether they can deliver.Socialism scare | It\u2019s been a conservative attack line for generations, and now Trump and fellow Republicans have begun painting proposals embraced by many 2020 Democratic hopefuls as socialist. While Trump\u2019s\u00a0happy to embrace communist leaders from China, North Korea and Vietnam, his dire warnings that the U.S. risks Venezuela-style chaos if Democrats have their way are being amplified by Republican lawmakers in the fight for congressional seats and the White House.Brexit brinkmanship | Against the odds, Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal is clinging to life before next week\u2019s crunch vote in Parliament.

The company will buy a home and put it in a trust, then sell stakes for as little as $5,000. The aim is to provide investors direct access to rental income -- and the tax benefits of owning commercial real estate -- while lowering the buy-in and eliminating inconveniences like having to carry a loan on their personal balance sheet.\u201cThe whole idea at our founding was to create a platform where real estate could trade much more like a stock,\u201d said Gary Beasley, chief executive officer at Roofstock, a four-year-old startup based in Oakland, California. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can go to a website and after a few clicks, you have real estate exposure.\u201dThe move is the latest attempt to popularize strategies developed by institutional investors in the aftermath of foreclosure crisis, when firms such as Blackstone Group LP and Starwood Property Trust Inc. amassed large portfolios of rental homes. As the deep bargains dried up, the nascent industry consolidated, and companies that sprung up to serve the Wall Street landlords started offering property management, finance and brokerage services to smaller investors.Beasley more or less personifies that trend: He was CEO at Waypoint Homes, one of a handful of landlords that were eventually rolled up into industry behemoth Invitation Homes Inc., then co-founded Roofstock. The company also brokers portfolio sales of rental houses to larger investors, but for the most part, pitches itself as a popularizing force that helps small property owners invest like institutions.Roofstock plans to start with properties in the $100,000 to $200,000 price range, beginning in Atlanta and Indianapolis, using loans to finance no more than half the purchase price. The program is limited to accredited investors, who are theoretically savvy enough to evaluate the risk that home repairs or soft rental markets eat up profits.The company will take property- and asset-management fees out of rental income before distributing returns. Eventually, it plans to launch a secondary market to connect buyers and sellers, but in the near term, it will buy shares back from investors who want liquidity.

ABS spreads have narrowed compared to a month earlier Vehicles sit on display for sale at a\u00a0car dealership in Louisville, Kentucky.While more Americans than ever are behind on car payments, investors in bonds backed by auto loans haven\u2019t flinched.Prices of risky auto bonds have risen even as car loans that haven\u2019t been paid in at least three months exceeded 7 million at the end of last year, the highest since the New York Federal Reserve began tracking the data two decades ago. As demand surged, the extra yield investors get to hold the highest-rated debt instead of what\u2019s seen as a risk-free rate has shrunk over the past month.The tighter bond spreads are a sign investors remain confident credit protections will continue to prevent losses in the subprime auto asset-backed securities market, as well as the fact that the rising late payments haven\u2019t yet turned into a big increase in defaults.Credit: Wells FargoSecuritized debt makes up just a fraction of the overall auto credit market, while the majority is kept on finance companies\u2019 balance sheets. Only about 10 percent of the $437 billion of low-rated car loans have been turned into ABS, according to Wells Fargo.\u201cABS investors still feel pretty good on credit,\u201d said Amy Sze, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. \u201cRecent subprime auto new issues have priced well. Vintage loss data for 2018 is running just a touch under 2017, so it\u2019s within expectations.\u201dThe 60-day-plus delinquency rate for loans underlying subprime auto bonds has been steadily rising since 2011 -- and is currently higher than its peak in 2009 -- but those missed payments haven\u2019t translated into heavy losses for investors. The default rate edged higher to 5.5 percent percent in 2018 from 5.2 percent a year earlier, according to S&P.\u201cThe deterioration appears to be largely due to late payments trending higher on some deep-subprime issuers\u2019 2015-2017 securitizations,\u201d S&P said in its latest monthly auto ABS report. However, performance of the bonds for deals issued between 2015 and 2018 \u201chas been fairly stable,\u201d the analysts said.Despite the stability, observers are still wary of some trends in the market. Over the last three years, companies that offer loans to the riskiest borrowers tend to be the ones who use securitization the most. And at the same time, strong demand for higher yields has led to more lower-rated bonds in deals.That\u2019s a concern because there are fewer protections baked into the lower end of subprime ABS. So as a result, investors are starting to demand more robust credit protections than compared with a few years ago, eating away at already-thin profit margins at lenders struggling with deteriorating loan quality.\u2014 With assistance by Gabrielle Coppola ","105":" Want to receive this post in your inbox every morning?\u00a0Sign up hereChina plans to tie Hong Kong and Macau more closely to the mainland, European and U.K.\u00a0officials are working on a new Brexit text, and Trump turns up the pressure on Venezuela\u2019s Maduro.

Even Democrats split on getting rid of cap on deductions Politicians from New York, New Jersey and other high-tax states may be making a lot of noise, but the new $10,000 cap on deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT, isn\u2019t going anywhere any time soon.Some 30 Democratic members of Congress, joined by one Republican, last month introduced a bill that would eliminate the cap on SALT deductions introduced in the 2017 tax overhaul. And New York Governor Andrew Cuomo formed a coalition of Democratic counterparts from high-tax states to push for a change.Yet their efforts are likely futile, lobbyists and tax policy experts say.The problem: Republicans have no desire to tinker with the signature legislative achievement of the Trump administration. And many Democrats don\u2019t want to eliminate the cap, which would be seen as a massive tax break for the wealthy, at a time when the progressive left is gaining popularity.\u201cSimply lifting the cap with no other reforms is just an additional windfall for high income taxpayers on top of the other cuts\u201d from the GOP tax law, said Seth Hanlon, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, who helped devise tax policy for President Barack Obama.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act gave a large tax cut to corporations and wealthy taxpayers. It also limited to $10,000 the amount households could deduct for property taxes and state and local income taxes, a measure that hits residents of high-tax -- and Democratic -- states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California harder than others. The change rankled Democratic lawmakers who saw it as a deliberate political assault.Read More: Tales of\u00a0SALT\u00a0Woe From the Rich Who Try to Flee High-Tax StatesA Treasury Department analysis released last week concluded that about 10.9 million filers had to cap their deductions for state and local taxes, paying an extra $323 billion in taxes. Other provisions in the law benefited filers, and many of those 10.9 million likely received a net tax cut.Thirty of the 40 current co-sponsors on House version of the bill released in February, dubbed the \u201cStop the Attack on Local Taxpayers\u201d (or \u201cSALT\u201d) Act, are from New York, New Jersey or California. The bill would try to offset the cost of repealing the SALT cap by reintroducing the 39.6 percent marginal tax bracket, which the 2017 law eliminated.Representative John Larson, a Connecticut Democrat who co-sponsored the bill, said he expects the House Ways and Means Committee to consider adjustments to the SALT cap, but that movement would be slow.Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa where taxes are lower, quickly declared any effort to repeal the cap was futile.Some governors are taking a stab at change. Cuomo, along with seven other Democratic governors, banded together to pressure House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bring up legislation repealing the SALT cap.Cuomo met with President Donald Trump in February and quoted Trump as saying he was open to discussing a SALT change, but received no assurances from the White House.Earlier: Democrats Embrace Tax-the-Rich Label After Years of Ducking ItYet Republicans like Grassley aren\u2019t the only problem. Within a Democratic Party that\u2019s embracing proposals to tax the rich, the math behind a SALT cap repeal is unforgiving.More than a quarter of the benefit in repealing the SALT cap would go to the top 0.1 percent of income earners, according to an analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Nearly 57 percent of the benefit would go to the top 1 percent -- households making $755,000 or more.\u201cMany members of our caucus need to see the distribution tables on complete repeal of SALT and who it impacts,\u201d said Wisconsin Democratic Congressman Ron Kind.Kind, who is part of the tax-law-writing Ways and Means committee, said that would be eye-opening for the members.Without universal support for a full repeal, lawmakers could settle for more modest adjustments.Andrew Grossman, chief tax counsel for Ways and Means Democrats, has said that the tax-writing panel is trying to figure out how to adjust the SALT cap to provide relief to filers in high-tax states without entirely repealing the new limit -- a move that could make the change easier to pass.One option, according to lobbyists, is to double the SALT deduction cap to $20,000, either for all filers or for married taxpayers, who currently are treated the same as single filers.Without major adjustments to other parts of the tax law, a Democratic repeal of the cap would look like a giveaway to the wealthy, said Don Snyder, a tax lobbyist with the Federal Policy Group.\u201cI can\u2019t see how they do it. It was a central piece of the law as a revenue raiser, and it\u2019s definitely not a progressive thing to do,\u201d Snyder said.\u2014 With assistance by Laura Davison, Allyson Versprille, and Kaustuv Basu ","107":" Payday loan businesses\u00a0advertise their services in Phoenix.During the recent government shutdown, U.S. Secretary of Commerce\u00a0Wilbur Ross  wondered aloud why financially stressed federal workers didn\u2019t just \u201cget a loan.\u201dA\u00a0wealthy private equity investor, Ross faced excoriation. But the underlying question remains, even with a second shutdown\u00a0less likely\u00a0to occur.\u00a0For Americans with limited options and desperate for cash, this is where consumer lenders such as\u00a0Enova International Inc.,\u00a0Curo Group Holdings Corp. and Elevate Credit\u00a0Inc. step in.They\u2019re part of a\u00a0growing industry of online companies which specialize\u00a0in risky borrowers. Enova, for example, offers loans with interest rates ranging from 34 to 450 percent, depending on the\u00a0amount, date of maturity and borrower\u2019s credit score, according to its website. The expectation for\u00a0the priciest kind of short-term borrowing, the \u201cpayday loan\u201d of storefront\u00a0fame,\u00a0is that you will pay it back when your paycheck clears. Still, one could be forgiven for wondering how such sky high rates exist at all.\u201cHaving no access to credit is worse for consumers,\u201d said Mary Jackson, chief executive of the Online Lenders Alliance, a lobbying group that represents fintech lenders. She said high interest, high-risk loans have a widely known parallel\u2014the bridge loan\u2014which struggling homebuyers sometimes use to close a deal.\u00a0\u201cMost of these loans would be considered bridge loans\u2014for major car repairs and plumbing leaks.\u201dAnd forget about the obvious Hollywood images that triple-digit interest rates bring to mind. The average\u00a0customer isn\u2019t an unemployed. recidivist gambler down on his luck. According to Jackson, they\u2019re often college-educated thirtysomethings who are gainfully\u00a0employed. But no matter what a borrower\u2019s background is, critics warn that the price to be paid for such loans can get very high, very fast.\u201cRight now, 80 percent of payday loans are taken out within two weeks of a previous payday loan.\u201dAbout 12 million Americans use these high interest\u00a0loans every year, both online and through about 16,000 storefront offices, said Alex Horowitz, a senior research officer with Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s consumer finance project. In fact, U.S. consumers borrow almost $90 billion every year in short-term, small-dollar loans that typically range from $300 to $5,000, according to a 2018 report from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).And the future is looking even brighter. Just last week, the industry received a boost\u00a0by Kathleen Kraninger, a Trump administration budget official who recently took over\u00a0the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She proposed the elimination of\u00a0an Obama era requirement\u2014set to take effect Aug. 19\u2014that would have forced payday lenders\u00a0to assess a borrower\u2019s ability to repay. Consumer advocates were outraged by Kraninger\u2019s proposal.\u201cBoth borrowers and responsible lenders would suffer if the CFPB were to finalize the proposal,\u201d\u00a0said Pew\u2019s Horowitz.\u00a0The new rule would eliminate \u201cwell-balanced consumer protections and deregulate 400 percent interest loans issued to millions of struggling Americans.\u201dThough the industry is largely regulated by the states\u2014only 34 even allow payday loans\u2014a lawyer for some of the bigger\u00a0lenders warned that\u00a0the Obama rule would wipe out a significant portion of the payday industry.\u00a0Alan Kaplinsky, a partner at the law firm Ballard Spahr, said the requirement that lenders make sure borrowers can repay \u201cwould have made it easier for offshore payday lenders to do business and charge consumers a lot more.\u201dBut even with the CFPB proposal and a friendly U.S. administration, some online lenders are moving away\u00a0from payday loans. Many have pivoted toward installment loans, which are paid back over time rather than in a single payment. Additionally, these lenders also offer what they call \u201clines of credit,\u201d which operate in a fashion similar to credit cards.Still, even installment loans can come with\u00a0eye-popping interest rates. One example on Enova\u2019s website shows a $1,000 loan with 13 payments at a 172.98 percent annual percentage rate (APR). In the end, this would require a total of $2,225.18 to pay off.\u00a0Enova declined to\u00a0comment.The industry argues that high interest rates are needed to counter the risk associated with giving money to consumers more likely to default. In a securities filing last year, Chicago-based Enova spelled out just how risky its business can be.For the third quarter of 2018, the company projected that close to 33\u00a0percent of its \u201cshort-term loans\u201d balance outstanding would never be repaid. The expected\u00a0loss dropped to about 19 percent and 13 percent for line-of-credit and installment loans, respectively.\u00a0For context,\u00a0banks only saw a 3.5 percent loss on credit card loans over the same quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.While such exorbitant rates might be justifiable to lenders, Horowitz said the cost to borrowers could be grave.\u00a0\u201cRight now, 80 percent of payday loans are taken out within two weeks of a previous payday loan because the loans on average take up one-third of the borrower\u2019s next paycheck,\u201d he said, a burden that can grow with each new loan. \u201cThe average payday loan customer pays $520 a year in fees to repeatedly borrow $325 in credit.\u201d\u201cBanks can be profitable at a price point six to eight times lower than average payday loan pricing.\u201dWhile in the short-run these lenders might have the upper hand, the days of super high-interest loans may be numbered. The payday loan industry sprang up because traditional banks were reluctant to serve the low credit score universe. This was in part because regulators didn\u2019t give\u00a0them clear guidelines. But that may be changing.In 2017, another CFPB rule opened the door for banks and credit unions to offer small installment loans at reasonable prices. Last May, the OCC followed up with guidance for short-term, small-dollar installment lending. Then in November, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued a\u00a0request\u00a0for public comment\u00a0on small-dollar credit products.Horowitz sees this evolution as a great benefit to Americans who use payday products.\u201cBanks can be profitable at a price-point six to eight times lower than average payday loan pricing,\u201d he said.\u00a0For example, a payday borrower accumulates $350 in fees on a $400 loan in just over three months. At USBank, under its new \u201cSimple Loan\u201d product\u00a0launched in September, a similar loan offered to a similar customer goes\u00a0for just $48.\u201cIt\u2019s a really good thing that some of the banks are getting into small-dollar lending,\u201d said Kaplinsky, the industry lawyer. \u201cThat will create more competition and ultimately help interest rates come down for consumers.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Kristina D&apos;Alessio, Kyle Ashworth, and Colleen McElroy ","108":"Government offers 14 million euros for Brexit salary boost.

NBFC growth will disappoint: Kotak Mahindra Asset CEO Shah As key engines of loan growth in the world\u2019s fastest-expanding major economy, they once were investor favorites. But now traders won\u2019t go near India\u2019s shadow banks.About $22 billion has evaporated from a group of almost two dozens non-bank financial companies since Aug. 31, before confidence was rocked. And investors aren\u2019t rushing to get back in, according to Citigroup Inc. analyst Manish B Shukla.\u201cDespite the sharp correction in stock prices of NBFCs, most investors are cautious on these names given near-term uncertainties,\u201d he wrote in a report earlier this month. He notes volatile third-quarter results and potential funding tightness after the recent events may be reasons for the lingering skepticism in the sector.Until last summer, non-bank financiers were a major part of investment portfolios. But a series of missed payments by one of the biggest firms, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. -- once categorized as \u201csystemically important\u201d by the central bank -- then roiled India\u2019s stock market. Now, the nation\u2019s shadow-lending industry, which accounted for nearly four out of every 10 consumer loans in the last three years, has grown more cautious about extending new credit amid a funding crunch of its own.From small-ticket loans for smartphones to funding large apartment clusters, the firms have a finger in every pie. At some point, the growth in their loan books even rivaled that of the state-run banking giants facing lending restrictions owing to the large burden of bad debt.\u201cWe believe NBFC growth will disappoint and there is a marked slowdown for most, which is now starting to reflect in their valuations,\u201d said Nilesh Shah, who helps oversee $24 billion as chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co.

You can\u00a0sign up here.Add smog to the signs of China&apos;s economic rebound.Air pollution in Beijing has increased noticeably in the past month. That trend stood out even more this week with high-profile legislative meetings starting in the Chinese capital.Premier Li Keqiang opened the annual full-session of the  National People&apos;s Congress on Tuesday with his state-of-the-nation speech at the Great Hall of the People. Outside, the smog was ten-fold worse than what the World Health Organization defines as healthy.The most likely culprits are the country&apos;s factories. China&apos;s manufacturing sector contracted for a third straight month in February, but a closer look at the data reveals what could be a turning point.While surveys of manufacturers showed a contraction in activity, they also showed that inventories are falling, new orders are strengthening and confidence is improving; all signs of a pickup. Tax cuts announced this week should add to that momentum.Pollution is the unfortunate byproduct, at least for now. That will change as heavy industry becomes a smaller part of the economy and those that remain upgrade their technology. In the short term though, the choice is often  looser enforcement that keeps\u00a0factories humming or tighter enforcement that turns the\u00a0skies blue.Beijing is well aware of how precarious that balance is. China needs jobs and growth. Just as obvious is the public&apos;s aversion to breathing dirty air and the power of pollution to spark protests. It will be, as the premier noted in his address, a  challenging year ahead.This week&apos;s top headline from the NPC\u00a0was the slower growth target. Set at a range of 6 to 6.5 percent versus 2018&apos;s \"about 6.5 percent,\" this year&apos;s mark should give policy makers more leeway to tackle some of China&apos;s longer-term problems. That includes pollution, the country&apos;s massive debt pile and an increasingly competitive relationship with America.Speaking of U.S.-China ties, it emerged this week that President Donald Trump is pushing his negotiators to hammer out a trade deal. A big win on the international stage combined with a stock market bump that might come with it would be advantageous ahead of an election campaign. That said, there were also signs this week that a deal may take some time yet, including a former Chinese finance minister saying that Beijing isn&apos;t ready to make big concessions.Military spending was also in focus. China&apos;s budget for 2019 includes a proposed 7.5 percent increase in defense outlays. That&apos;s slower than the 8.1 percent proposed last year but still notably faster than the pace of overall economic expansion. Beijing, which has the world&apos;s second biggest military budget after the U.S., has defended its spending as reasonable, necessary and not meant to threaten other countries.It does seem Huawei is on the offensive. The Chinese technology giant, whose equipment the U.S. claims is a security threat, is  suing America. The key to its case is legislation that bars Huawei gear from being used by the U.S. government and government contractors, which Huawei argues is unconstitutional. That comes just days after Meng Wanzhou, the company&apos;s finance chief and the daughter of its founder, sued Canada on allegations she was wrongfully detained and searched.And finally, China\u2019s diplomats aren\u2019t being very diplomatic. Incidents like accusations of white supremacy, verbal attacks on police and digs at Trump show they&apos;re taking an  increasingly strident approach from Canada to South Africa, and foreign envoys in Beijing say Chinese officials have become far more aggressive in private meetings. While the\u00a0assertive behavior might win them applause at home and prove their loyalty to Xi Jinping, it could\u00a0be damaging the president&apos;s efforts to win friends abroad.

That\u2019s created a raft of opportunities: For a growing group of asset managers who are making the loans; for borrowers, including not only mid-sized companies but some big enough to tap the syndicated debt markets if they wanted; and for investors looking for an answer to low-yield woes. For regulators, the question is whether the market can sustain such growth without making a mess.It starts with asset managers -- initially, mostly hedge funds and private-equity funds, but now other types of investors as well, including insurance firms -- raising pools of money from investors interested in higher-yielding debt. The managers field pitches from debt advisers with investment opportunities, or private-equity funds looking to finance acquisitions. The direct-lending fund does its own research before deploying its money. Direct lenders tend to hold onto the loans long-term, sometimes offering growth support to the company and entering into multiple funding rounds, although some funds do sell a small proportion of their debt.Global private debt fund raising has skyrocketed in recent yearsSource: PreqinTypically, what are known as \u201cmid-market\u201d businesses that banks are no longer interested in lending to. Their need for credit and lack of good alternatives means direct lenders have historically been able to extract higher interest rates -- though reaching that higher yield is expected to become more challenging amid increased competition for business.Direct lenders are consistently accumulating large sums of money and pursuing different types of deals. Roughly a third of investors surveyed by research firm Preqin plan to invest more in private debt in 2019 than in 2018, with nearly half intending to boost their allocation long-term. Capital raised for private debt strategies reached $110 billion in 2018, following a record of $129 billion the previous year, according to Preqin, with 41 percent of the money secured to direct-lending funds. This has taken the industry to almost $770 billion in assets under management as of June from $275 billion in 2009. North America is the biggest center for direct lending, with a 61 percent share of the market, according to Deloitte.In the U.S. and Europe, intense competition for deals has led to weaker protections for lenders in many cases. It\u2019s similar to what\u2019s happened in the larger market for broadly syndicated loans. Borrowers that have previously tapped the traditional leveraged loan market for their debt are increasingly pursuing direct loans instead as well. And the growing firepower of private debt funds mean they have been able to write bigger checks for single deals. For example, Ares Capital Europe in February said it provided a 1 billion-pound\u00a0financing\u00a0to U.K. telecom services firm Daisy Group in one of the biggest private debt transactions in Europe. Often funds also team up to offer larger financing packages.Investor demand, driven by the search for yield. And a sort of virtuous cycle -- as more money comes into direct lending, fund managers are able to write bigger loans, which makes direct lending even more attractive. Asset-management firms are raising a lot of money from pension funds and institutional investors that need to deploy cash and find yield in a low-rate environment. There\u2019s also demand for funding from small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that have struggled to get loans from the more cautious banks and are unable to issue bonds. At the lower end of the high-yield spectrum, direct lenders can be attractive to companies facing business-specific or sector-wide challenges.Getting riskier. As the cycle has reached its later stages, credit quality has deteriorated across the board. While the direct-lending business grew up concentrating on solid, safe companies that were just too small for banks, a growing number of direct lenders are extending higher-risk debt financing to more distressed companies. Some funds are buying into so-called story credit -- lending to companies that are seen as higher-risk after a financial restructuring or other difficulty. That\u2019s partly a reflection of how competitive the market has become.The main thing is that direct lenders say yes to companies that banks don\u2019t want to lend to. And as direct lenders are not as constrained by capital requirement guidelines, they are able to take on companies with higher leverage, which means attractive returns for investors if the deal runs smoothly.The extra leverage that can make direct loans look more attractive is likely to put a damper on recoveries in a downturn. UBS credit strategists have flagged private credit as \u201cground zero\u201d for concerns in such a scenario. Borrowers might not like the fact that a single lender can have more power in negotiations than a group might.\u00a0And like the rest of the shadow banking sector, direct lending operates without regulatory oversight. Lastly, new entrants to the space may face challenges during a slowdown. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, said some non-bank lenders may not survive an economic slump because they\u2019re holding lower-quality loans -- and their disappearance could leave some borrowers \u201cstranded.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Marianna Duarte De Aragao QuickTake explainers on leveraged loans and shadow banking.A white paper from Ares Management on the history and future of U.S. and European direct-lending markets.A Deloitte report on global direct-lender fundraising.

Symbolic divestment may signal more disruption lies ahead The decision of the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund to reduce holdings in oil stocks wasn\u2019t as far-reaching as the industry feared, but dealt a symbolic blow to fossil fuels that will reverberate for energy companies and their investors.While the divestment by Norway\u2019s $1 trillion fund doesn\u2019t include Big Oil, instead rooting out $7.5 billion of companies that focus purely on exploration and extraction, the impact of the announcement rippled through the sector. Shares of all oil companies initially plunged on the news, suggesting the move sets the industry up for greater disruption.These are the 10 largest shareholdings affected by Norway&apos;s decisionSource: Norges BankIt\u2019s a bitter taste of the new reality for oil producers, which increasingly have to fight for investor dollars rather than enjoying the perks of being indispensable to the global economy.\u201cThe Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is seen as something of a poster-child amongst sovereign wealth funds,\u201d said Alejandro DeMichelis, director of oil and gas research at Hannam & Partners LLP. \u201cThis decision could also trigger other large investors to review their stance toward investing in the oil and gas sector.\u201dLife is changing for oil companies. Ten years ago, they accounted for about 15 percent of the S&P 500 index. Today, they make up just 5 percent, having been mostly displaced by technology giants such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.Driving this shift is a smorgasbord of new energy sources that\u2019s bringing unprecedented competition for capital. Consumer choices are set to drift farther from the hydrocarbons of the 20th century, with renewables potentially meeting about a quarter of demand by 2040, according to oil major BP Plc.It\u2019s no surprise, then, that investors are increasingly questioning the wisdom of betting on oil and gas. A divestment campaign started by activist group 350.org in 2012 has already persuaded funds holding $8 trillion to back away from fossil fuels, according to its website.Scrutiny could intensify as AGM season approaches. Catherine Howarth, chief executive officer of ShareAction -- a group that has targeted Royal Dutch Shell Plc in the past -- said she expects a \u201cramp-up\u201d of pressure at annual general meetings that start in the spring.\u201cInstitutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable,\u201d Howarth said in an email.It\u2019s not only oil companies facing pressure. One of the world\u2019s biggest sellers of coal, Glencore Plc, yielded to investor demands earlier this year by promising to limit production of the fuel and align the business with Paris climate targets. In oil and gas, Shell and BP have made pledges around transparency and climate after facing the wrath of shareholders.The list of companies to be excluded from the Norwegian fund includes Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Cnooc Ltd. and Tullow Oil Plc. Shale producers like EOG Resources Inc., which extract fuel from the heartland of America\u2019s oil and gas boom, are also included.In the longer term, a dearth of capital will push up the cost of borrowing to explore for oil and gas, with those costs likely passed on to consumers, according to Georgi Slavov, head of research at energy broker Marex Spectron. That makes renewables comparatively cheaper, further pushing fossil fuels out of the market.While Shell, BP and other oil majors were spared in Norway\u2019s decision on Friday, they may yet be earmarked for divestment in the future.\u201cThe country may eventually revisit the issue and target such holdings,\u201d said Rob Barnett, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In particular, the fund could consider shedding \u201cintegrated companies not allocating a portion of their capital spending toward clean energy.\u201dFor those oil companies moving to diversify, there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. In its statement, Norway said some of the biggest investments in renewables now come from Big Oil. The fund \u201cshould be able to participate in this growth,\u201d the Finance Ministry said.\u201cWhile the fund was initially built on revenue from oil and gas, the Ministry of Finance understands that the future belongs to those who transition away from fossil fuels,\u201d said Mark Campanale, founding director of energy researcher Carbon Tracker. \u201cNow is the time for smart investors around the world to follow their lead and make decisions driven by the reality of the energy transition.\u201d ","118":" Welcome to the Brussels Edition, Bloomberg\u2019s daily briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union.

Light first-quarter forecast highlights uncertainty in India Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s sales and earnings in the busy holiday quarter beat analysts\u2019 estimates, showing the world\u2019s biggest web retailer can maintain rapid growth while improving profitability and fending off online competition from rivals like Walmart Inc.Advertising was a key moneymaker, highlighting Amazon\u2019s ability to charge brands and merchants for visibility to its 100 million-plus loyal Prime subscribers, who pay fees in exchange for delivery discounts, movie and music streaming and other perks. Overall revenue rose 20 percent, and the company\u2019s \"other\" revenue category, which is mostly advertising, grew 95 percent to $3.39 billion in the quarter.Shoppers will spend $484 billion globally on Amazon this year, up 26 percent from 2018, and the Seattle-based company will capture more than half of all online spending in the U.S., according to EMarketer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has been pushing beyond the low-margin business of selling goods online into more profitable categories like cloud computing and advertising. Those profits also help fuel Amazon\u2019s growing devices business, which includes smart-home and connected-car gadgets that operate on Amazon\u2019s voice-activated Alexa platform.Strength in online sales over the holiday period showed Amazon still has room to grow in its core business and is benefiting from excitement around its new devices, said Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities.\"This company continues to take wallet share and operate very well,\"  he said.Revenue was $72.4 billion in the fourth quarter, the e-commerce giant said Thursday in a statement. Analysts projected $71.9 billion. Net income was $6.04 per share, compared with an average estimate of $5.56. Sales at Amazon Web Services, the top seller of cloud-computing services, climbed 45 percent to $7.43 billion. Operating expenses grew 18 percent in the recent quarter.Sales will be $56 billion to $60 billion in the current period, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $61 billion. First-quarter operating income will be $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 estimates of $2.99 billion. Shares fluctuated between gains and losses in extended trading after the report and were little changed at 5:19 p.m. in New York. Losses from international operations widened to $642 million, reversing a trend of narrower losses internationally. The potentially weak revenue outlook highlighted concerns about how Amazon will do in India, its biggest international expansion target, where rules on foreign-owned e-commerce companies are changing. On a call with reporters, finance chief Brian Olsavsky also said headwinds from foreign currency exchange rates are curbing revenue in the current period.Investor excitement about Amazon\u2019s growing profits helped push the stock to a record high in September, before the shares dipped during a broader market slump at year\u2019s end. Amazon shares are up about 14 percent this year on investor optimism that the company can maintain growth and profitability, and closed at $1,718.73 before the results were released. Amazon had jumped back above Microsoft Corp., which is No. 2 in cloud computing, as the most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of $840.4 billion.A tight labor market, rising shipping costs and money-losing investments abroad remain threats. Amazon in October pledged to pay all of its warehouse employees at least $15 an hour, while eliminating some bonuses and stock awards. The cost of stowing, packing and delivering goods increased 12 percent in the holiday quarter to $10 billion, in line with online sales growth of 12.5 percent.The fourth quarter offered investors the first glimpse of year-over-year results since Amazon\u2019s $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market in 2017. Sales in physical stores, which are predominantly Whole Foods locations, decreased 2.7 percent to $4.4 billion. In-store pickups of online grocery orders don\u2019t count as physical store sales, further clouding the ability to track the performance of Amazon\u2019s grocery push. The online retailer\u2019s brick-and-mortar strategy also includes bookstores and a cashierless convenience store called AmazonGo, which lets customers check in with a smartphone app and be charged automatically based on what they remove from the store.Amazon has historically delivered relatively little profit as it fulfills Bezos\u2019s strategy of investing to stay ahead. Building warehouses and data centers around the world, inventing new devices and automating tasks usually done by humans are just some of the places Amazon spends its money.Bezos, the world\u2019s wealthiest man and Amazon\u2019s biggest shareholder, announced earlier this month that he was divorcing MacKenzie, his wife of 25 years.  ","120":"Former risk head of Australia\u2019s CEFC warns of tougher lending. More corporate power agreements needed to boost solar, wind The profitability of Australia\u2019s first wave of renewable power projects may be threatened as lenders will likely push for some deleveraging when they come up for refinancing, according to the former chief risk assessor at the nation\u2019s green bank.During Australia\u2019s clean energy investment boom in recent years, domestic banks were generally unwilling to lend beyond five years. That means projects will face refinancing just when they\u2019ve barely started to earn returns, Stephen Panizza, the former chief investment risk officer for the Clean Energy Finance Corp. said in an interview. That may force developers to use up cash paying down more of the loan principal or take on higher interest rates.Clean energy investment has soared in past two yearsSource: BNEF\u201cI don\u2019t think people have taken into account that refinancing risk,\u201d Panizza said. \u201cBanks will want to see some deleveraging, so I don\u2019t think the returns on equity are going to be as great as everybody expected.\u201d Panizza said the amount of renewables coming up for refinancing over the next three to four years was likely to run to several billion dollars.According to MUFG Bank Ltd., one of Australia\u2019s biggest renewables lenders, refinancing risks vary widely across the market, but shouldn\u2019t be a problem for well-structured projects with long-term, investment-grade off-take contracts. The bank is a unit of Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.\u201cThere are certainly a number of projects that we did not participate in, and if they have been financed on the terms they were originally presented to us, may be more stressed when it comes to refinancing,\u201d said Geoff Daley, head of MUFG\u2019s Australian structured finance office. The bank has an Australian renewables loan book in excess of A$1 billion ($714 million) spread over about 25 wind and solar projects.Panizza is now head of renewables at Federation Asset Management, and plans to target mainly wind and solar projects in the A$20 million ($14 million) to A$50 million bracket. He also sees opportunities in waste-to-energy and landfill gas.Competition from a deluge of new projects seeking access to the grid, coupled with Australia\u2019s strong uptake of rooftop solar, is making it increasingly difficult for big solar projects to stack up economically, according to Panizza.\u201cWe want to stay away from the really big-scale stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk profile, particularly in solar, of the large-scale stuff is too high.\u201dFor Australia\u2019s renewables industry to thrive, it\u2019s vital to develop a framework for corporate power purchase agreements to reduce the dominance of the three so-called gentailers -- retailers which also own the majority of the country\u2019s generation assets -- AGL Energy Ltd., Origin Energy Ltd., and the CLP Holdings Ltd.-owned EnergyAustralia.Panizza said some regulatory reform may be needed to facilitate direct purchase agreements between corporates and green power producers, and sees encouraging signs as more companies seek to meet tougher environmental, social and governance criteria.Australia also needs to upgrade its electricity transmission network to smooth the transition to renewable power. Panizza says there\u2019s a rash of projects trying to jump onto a grid, which wasn\u2019t set up to accommodate the surge in clean power.The government\u2019s backing of a second interconnector between the island state of Tasmania, where generation is dominated by hydropower, and Victoria, home to the country\u2019s second-biggest city Melbourne, is a positive step, he said. That could ultimately render Victoria\u2019s coal-fired power stations obsolete.But Panizza acknowledges the difficulty in backing transmission investment.\u201cThe cost of improving transmission needs to be borne by consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is problematic because high energy prices are sensitive politically.\u201d ","121":"Loyal base, fractured political system work to his advantage. Blue & White might not be able to form a coalition government Criminal charges seem to be looming, but don\u2019t count Benjamin Netanyahu out: Chances are good that he\u2019ll form Israel\u2019s next government.A fragmented political system, many undecided voters and the stature that comes with 13 years in office could converge with a loyal base to hand Israel\u2019s prime minister a fifth term on April 9. And though the attorney general plans to indict Netanyahu for bribery and fraud, a decision is months away.\u201cDuring his lengthy career, he has had this Teflon quality to him, where these things bounce right off,\u201d said Sarah Yerkes, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who served in the U.S. State Department\u2019s office of Israel and Palestinian affairs. \u201cHe is Trump before Trump.\u201dFitch Solutions, just before the attorney general released a draft indictment last week, put the odds of a Netanyahu victory at 75 percent. It predicted such an outcome would likely see Israel \"continuing to veer to the right on regional security and Palestinian issues, while making efforts to maintain a pro-business environment.\u201dNetanyahu\u2019s ability to weather the storm could have a profound influence in a Middle East that\u2019s realigning as the U.S. confronts Iran and prepares to present its formula for regional peace. He has labored to contain Iran\u2019s influence and sideline the Palestinians\u2019 quest for statehood as ties with Gulf Arab states warm, often finding a sympathetic ear in Trump\u2019s White House.Immediately after Attorney General Avihai Mandelblit told Netanyahu last week he plans to put him on trial, polls that had favored his Likud party swung to give a small edge to a bloc led by Blue & White. Its co-chairman, former military chief Benny Gantz, provides the security gravitas important to Israeli voters and a clean-hands image that contrasts with the taint of corruption surrounding Netanyahu.By Tuesday, only one of three surveys showed Gantz\u2019s bloc besting Netanyahu\u2019s alliance of nationalist and religious parties.During the campaign, Netanyahu will continue to characterize the attorney general\u2019s investigation as a left-wing \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and his supporters will likely continue to accept that, the Eurasia Group think tank said in a report. And later this month, Netanyahu will flaunt his diplomatic credentials during a likely meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington.Gantz, who\u2019s leading Blue & White with former Finance Minister Yair Lapid, spent 38 of his 59 years in the military and has never held public office.\u201cNetanyahu is acting the prime minister and he enjoys greater attention in the media, he can use policy to demonstrate his popularity,\u201d said Ofer Zalzberg, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group research center. \u201cAll of these things are things that Gantz can\u2019t do.\u201dHours before the polls closed in the previous election in 2015, Netanyahu convened a last-minute news conference and boosted right-wing turnout by warning that Arab citizens were \u201cgoing to the polls in droves.\u201d He\u2019s playing that card again, warning that the centrist Blue & White -- which his campaign calls \u201cleftist\u201d -- would rely on Arab parties to put together a government.\u201cOf course it\u2019s an effective strategy -- saying they\u2019re on the left and rely on Arabs,\u201d said Camil Fuchs, a professor emeritus of statistics involved in polling. \u201cThat\u2019s the message in the campaign.\u201dNo single party has ever won a majority in Israel\u2019s history, meaning the country has always been run by coalitions. What\u2019s key is which faction can put together the most stable bloc and that isn\u2019t always the best-performing party.An electoral threshold that\u2019s been raised over the years could also deliver surprises. It\u2019s not clear which of the dozen or so parties in serious contention will pass the bar of 3.25 percent of the vote.Polls show Blue & White winning about 36 of parliament\u2019s 120 seats, to about 30 for Likud. But Netanyahu seems to have a clearer path to building a narrow coalition. Blue & White, by contrast, can count only on about 50 lawmakers, according to polls. It would have to rely in parliament on support from Arab factions, which would not be in a government, because right-wing religious parties have said they won\u2019t sit with Blue & White. \u201cThere\u2019s a high chance they\u2019ll be the largest party,\" said Fuchs, \u201cand a very small chance they\u2019ll create a coalition.\u201d ","122":"Over 40,000 protesters marched throughout France on Saturday.

This weekend marked the 14th consecutive week of protests, though the number of participants dwindled by about 10,000 from last weekend to 41,500, according to Interior Ministry figures cited by Agence France-Presse.The movement, which started out as a protest against higher gasoline taxes, has led to regular clashes with police, resulting in 1,800 criminal convictions, with another 1,400 people awaiting sentencing, the government said last week.France will cut taxes in response to the protests once decisions have been made on corresponding spending cuts, Le Maire said. It\u2019s up to French people to define what is important and what concessions they\u2019re willing make during debates organized by the government, he said.While polls show roughly half of French people still support the Yellow Vests, President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s idea of opening a national debate on taxes and democracy in response has helped lift his approval rating.

Shock to confidence could see overseas money flow back out China\u2019s increasing success at luring global investors to its stock and bond markets may be laying the seeds of future volatility as its financial system becomes subject to overseas sentiment like never before.The country\u2019s years-long campaign to attract steady streams of foreign capital is now paying off, providing support for the yuan in the face of diminishing current-account surpluses. Foreign ownership of Chinese bonds has climbed to a record of more than $260 billion, while holdings of stocks stood at $172 billion in the most recent data.Wider inclusion of Chinese assets in global bond and equity indexes will offer China a fresh source of funding, the need for which was underlined Tuesday when the government widened its budget-deficit target and boosted plans for local-government debt issuance. Capital inflows will also cushion a shrinking current account surplus that the International Monetary Fund tips to fall further over coming years.\u201cChina\u2019s increasing openness to foreign investors will help in the development of its financial markets -- but at the risk of increasing exposure to capital flow volatility, which will also complicate exchange rate management.\u201d said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the IMF\u2019s China section who is now at Cornell University.Foreign investors hold less than 3 percent of China\u2019s domestic bonds and equities, making them marginal players for now, although they\u2019ve had increasing impact on the government debt which forms the bulk of their bond holdings. Their sway is set to rise as the country\u2019s weightings in global portfolios expand. Similarly, China\u2019s impact on those portfolios will rise.\u201cThis will be a double edged sword: more access but also more transmission of volatility to the global market,\u201d said Hui Feng, a senior research fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute and co-author of \u201cThe Rise of the People\u2019s Bank of China.\u201dLast week, MSCI Inc. announced it will boost onshore Chinese stocks in its emerging-market index to 3.3 percent by November, from 0.72 percent now. Next month, Chinese government and policy-bank bonds are set for a phased inclusion in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index that will bring China\u2019s share to an estimated 6 percent. Bloomberg LP owns the Bloomberg Barclays indexes, and is the parent of Bloomberg News.\u201cFor foreign investors, issues such as insufficient information, lack of transparency, pricing distortions created by implicit government guarantee and policy swings in capital flow management are major hurdles for investing in China bonds. Even so, these should not stop long-term allocation into China\u2019s bond market.\u201d--Chang Shu and David Qu, Bloomberg Economics, Hong KongClick here to view the pieceThe decisions marked wins for Chinese officials who have sought a stable source of capital inflows to balance long-standing pressure from Chinese companies and individuals to park money overseas. The efforts became all the more important after the country saw a $1 trillion slide in its foreign-exchange reserves in the wake of a messy yuan devaluation in 2015.To be sure, China\u2019s tightly controlled capital account gives the government ample opportunity to clamp down on cash moving into or out of the country. That offers a vital buffer against the kind of capital flight that typically destabilizes emerging economies.Yet the implicit vulnerability to a sudden outflow of foreign holdings raises the stakes for China to enhance its communication efforts on regulatory changes, to avoid anything like the instability seen in 2015 and 2016. If done right, the increased participation of global investors could actually reduce volatility by increasing the diversity of asset buyers.\u201cThe U.S. stock market attracts a large amount of capital from the world. Did that make it more vulnerable over the last decades? No, it actually helped it become the largest and a very efficient stock market,\u201d said Rujing Meng, who lectures on finance at the University of Hong KongFor now, China needn\u2019t worry, as it\u2019s likely to see sustained net inflows for the foreseeable future given the low starting point, economists say. Most of the purchases of bonds have come from central banks and sovereign wealth funds, with private-sector fund managers only starting to diversify portfolios to include China.China\u2019s sheer economic weight and massive pool of domestic savings also offer buffers that the likes of Argentina and Indonesia don\u2019t have.\u201cForeign investors are in the early stages of a major commitment to Chinese equities,\u201d Morgan Stanley economists and strategists wrote last month in a report on the \u201ctransformation\u201d of China\u2019s capital flows. Similarly, \u201cbond inflows into China have the potential to pick up significantly in the coming years,\u201d they wrote, predicting steady appreciation in the yuan as a result.Winning those long-term inflows will require easing the concerns of some investors that China could lock up their money in cases of extreme moves.\u201cWhen volatility spikes there, it could be tricky for investors if they can\u2019t trade bonds and A-shares freely,\u201d said Jean-Louis Nakamura, Asia-Pacific chief investment officer at Lombard Odier, using the term for domestically listed shares. \u201cIn China, rules can change overnight. We need to have assurance and policy clarity first.\u201d\u2014 With assistance by Molly Dai ","125":"Women make up just 7.2% of boards of companies in Mexbol index. Of the index\u2019s 35 companies, only one has a female CEO Mexico City.When Blanca Trevino took her first job, working for a family-run company in Mexico, her new bosses demanded that she sign a blank resignation letter -- just in case she decided to get married.They later waived the marriage clause after she had become too instrumental to lose, but at that point she had decided to move on, jumping ship to start a new business on her own terms.\"I still see social and family limitations on what women can do in Mexico,\" said Trevino, now the CEO of Softtek, an IT services company that operates across the Americas, Europe and Asia. \"Women should not feel guilty for giving their time to their business.\"The Mexbol index companies only have one female board member on averageSource: BloombergIt\u2019s a refrain that\u2019s growing louder in Mexico as women struggle to find a foothold in the male-dominated world of business and finance. The only female CEO on the country\u2019s Mexbol index, Ienova\u2019s Tania Ortiz Mena, says she often hears the phrase \"did you come here by yourself, miss?\" when going into a meeting, and recounted a time recently when she walked into an energy conference in Mexico with about 300 attendees. Only two of them were women.\"Unconscious prejudice is there,\" she said. \"The role of women isn\u2019t visible, and men just take that for granted -- it doesn\u2019t seem strange to them.\"Of course, that doesn\u2019t prevent the industry from congratulating itself. On Friday, the country\u2019s largest stock exchange, the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores will \"ring the bell for gender equality\" in an event at its venerable domed headquarters in the center of Mexico City. Just don\u2019t look for the women there. The stock exchange counts just one woman on it\u2019s 16-member board, and it\u2019s Trevino herself. The BMV did not respond to a request for comment.That\u2019s not just an issue for the Bolsa alone. One female member of the board is roughly the average for the 35 companies in the country\u2019s benchmark Mexbol stock index. On the whole, 22 of the companies have at least one woman on the board, but women only represent 7.2 percent of total board members in the index.Compared to regional peers, Mexico\u2019s biggest companies are more likely to have a woman on the board. Mexbol companies average 0.9 women per board, compared with 0.8 for Brazil\u2019s Ibovespa Index and 0.7 in Chile. Colombia leads the pack with 1.2 percent on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Effort to Add Women to Boards Is Slow to Get Results: QuickTakeGoing by percentages, Walmex stands head and shoulders above the rest with women representing 36 percent of their board. Of the 35 companies in the index, 12 have no women among their board members, including Becle, the manufacturer of popular tequila brand Jose Cuervo, and Mission tortilla maker Gruma. Both Becle and Gruma did not respond to requests for comment.And that\u2019s made it harder for women further down the chain of command. Ortiz Mena -- herself a mother of three -- recalls having to build the company\u2019s first lactation room in perhaps the least welcoming of places for a nursing mother: a gas compression facility packed with valves, pipes and metal in northern Mexico. She also extended maternity leaves and created career paths for top performing female employees.Trevino, meanwhile, has set up a committee within the company to make recommendations on women\u2019s issues and has made hiring more women a priority within the company. While she acknowledged that her experience came in the context of a strong safety net, she also said that she well remembers plenty of teary calls to her two young daughters from airport payphones before jetting off on business trips. But she says it\u2019s time for a change.\"I have absolute conviction that the most successful companies, the most successful economies, and the most successful countries are the ones that bring in the best talent,\" Trevino said. \"Talent doesn\u2019t have a gender.\" ","126":"U.S. budget already deep in the red, and markets have shrugged. Trump, Ocasio-Cortez and Japan also offer support for MMT case Over a lifespan of about three decades, Modern Monetary Theory has often been badmouthed -- by obscure bloggers. Not by the likes of Jerome Powell and Larry Fink.The economists who developed it mostly operated on the periphery of academia and the internet. Now their ideas have broken into the mainstream. Hardly a day passes without some Wall Street titan or policy heavyweight weighing in \u2013- usually to dismiss the doctrine, though there\u2019s been support too.Ignored for years, MMT suddenly finds itself at the center of America\u2019s economic debate, raising the question: why now? Here are some possible answers.The theory\u2019s headline argument is that governments with their own currencies have more room to spend than is generally supposed, and don\u2019t have to finance it all with taxes. According to this view, there\u2019s no risk of the U.S. being forced into default, because it can create the dollars it needs to meet any obligations.The claim may look less contentious today because the U.S. has already been piling up public debt for a decade. The initial surge came out of crisis firefighting, a fairly orthodox response to the Great Recession. But fiscal stimulus is now being used to make an already expanding economy grow faster -- on a scale that hasn\u2019t been tried since the 1960s.Average growth is 59 basis points faster than during the Obama recovery, and a deficit-spending government delivered most of them.Source: Bureau of Economic AnalysisNote: Households = consumption + residential investment. Business = other private investment.That\u2019s why advocates say MMT shouldn\u2019t be seen as a policy package that might get adopted one day. Instead, it\u2019s more like a framework for understanding what tools are available to a government. And some of those tools are already being used.\u201cDeficits are going to be driving interest rates much higher,\u201d BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Fink said last week, describing MMT as \u201cgarbage.\u201dSentiment can swing on a dime, but investors are currently relaxed about all the red ink. The U.S. budget gap has already blown past 4 percent of GDP. It\u2019s forecast to keep widening at least through 2021. Yet the government can borrow 30-year money at about 3 percent. There\u2019s no shortage of people warning about deficit dangers, but the markets aren\u2019t joining in.The theories leaned on by policy makers since the inflationary 1970s have primarily focused on achieving price stability. But the standard models they use, which view inflation as at least partly a function of the unemployment rate, seem to have broken down. Record-low jobless numbers in the U.S. should be stoking prices, but they aren\u2019t.As a result, economists have been losing confidence in ideas that 25 years ago seemed obvious. And with a generation having passed since inflation looked like a serious problem, the case for fighting it as public enemy number one has weakened too. That\u2019s opened the door for frameworks geared more toward addressing 21st-century concerns such as rising inequality -- more extreme in the U.S. than in any other developed country -- or America\u2019s lack of a universal health-care safety net.Politically, the MMTers tend to lean left -- but they insist their ideas are applicable by a government of any stripe. And they sometimes express a sneaking admiration for Donald Trump\u2019s approach to fiscal policy, because the president appears to pursue his real-economy goals (lower business taxes, more military spending) and worry about budget outcomes later.\u201cI don\u2019t think good growth policies have to obsess, necessarily, about the budget deficit,\u201d Trump\u2019s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday. That\u2019s pretty much what MMT would advise -- even if most of its adherents disagree with Trump\u2019s economic goals and would spend the deficits very differently.Trump speaks during the State of the Union while Ocasio-Cortez listens.It was Senator Bernie Sanders who opened the door for MMT into U.S. politics. He hired Stephanie Kelton, the economist and Bloomberg Opinion columnist who\u2019s become the public face of the doctrine, first at the Senate Budget Committee and then as an adviser during his 2016 tilt at the presidency. Sanders sometimes nodded toward MMT by saying America needs to address real-economy deficits in infrastructure or education as well as financial ones in its budget. But he never endorsed it explicitly.Freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who also worked on the Sanders campaign, has done so. She\u2019s said MMT should be \u201ca larger part of our conversation\u201d and urged Congress to use deploy its \u201cpower of the purse.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez has millions of followers on social media, where economic and political ideas are spread.The country that\u2019s probably come closest to deploying the full MMT toolkit is Japan, where interest rates hit zero 20 years ago and public debt -- partly financed by the central bank -- is now almost 2 1\/2 times the size of the economy.Japan isn\u2019t growing quickly, but its image among Western economists as some kind of basket-case has been undergoing a rethink. Serial deficits haven\u2019t triggered inflation or a flight from bond markets. And real incomes have kept pace with America\u2019s (and exceeded Europe\u2019s) since 2008.Budget deficits helped Japan and U.S. to recover after the 2008 crisis.Source: World Bank, Bloomberg data for period from 2009 to 2017.Big-name economists from top U.S. universities are lining up to denounce MMT. \u201cFallacious at multiple levels,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Larry Summers called it. Others to join the attack include Nobel laureate Paul Krugman and Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.At the same time, it\u2019s become more common to see these same high-profile liberal economists coming out in favor of deficit-spending, and dismissing concerns about the national debt as overblown. Summers, Krugman and Blanchard have all made that case in recent weeks -- even while arguing that MMT gets the mechanics wrong. ","127":"Carl Heastie says he\u2019ll propose pied-a-terre tax for budget. Governor, mayor support the levy to raise revenue for transit \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Source: Getty ImagesSource: Getty ImagesNew York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie added momentum to the idea of taxing non-resident owners of multi-million dollar apartments as a way to help pay for billions of dollars of regional transit improvements.The state Assembly has supported such a tax for years, Heastie said Friday, and will propose it in a budget resolution that his Democratic colleagues are preparing this month. The chances for enacting it have improved, he said, because Democrats control the state Senate for the first time in decades, and Governor Andrew Cuomo supports the idea to help finance a 10-year, $40 billion plan to upgrade regional transportation.Carl HeastieDuring a breakfast forum sponsored by Crain\u2019s New York magazine, Heastie said Cuomo supports the measure because \u201cyou have people coming in buying $200 million apartments and there\u2019s no mortgage-recording tax because they\u2019re pretty much paying cash, and we still have to provide services. So we\u2019re asking people to contribute a little more.\u201dThe idea gained momentum this week with Cuomo\u2019s budget director, Robert Mujica, and Mayor Bill de Blasio each saying they could support the idea. Mujica included the proposal in a discussion of potential sources of revenue that could finance the regional transit upgrade. The so-called \u201cpied-a-terre tax\u201d could raise as much as $9 billion, he said, adding to $15 billion from congestion pricing, $5 billion from Internet sales and $2 billion from yet-to-be-legalized cannabis.The items, all under discussion as lawmakers prepare a state budget due by April 1, remain uncertain, Heastie said. The idea of congestion-pricing fees for motorists entering Manhattan\u2019s central business core remains controversial with lawmakers concerned about whether the program\u2019s revenue would benefit residents in outer-borough areas who need express bus service and other transit options as well as suburban residents commuting by car and train, he said.Cuomo has warned that if congestion pricing fails to pass the legislature, subway and bus riders could see a 30 percent increase in fares to more than $3.50 per ride.Under a 2014 proposal by economist James Parrott for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group, a luxury-apartment tax would raise about $665 million annually, requiring part-time New Yorkers to pay surcharges on dwellings valued at more than $5 million. The revenue could then be leveraged into billions of dollars more to pay off bonds for making transit-related capital improvements. Absentee owners pay no city or state income taxes.The pied-a-terre tax has been opposed by the Real Estate Board of New York, which has said it would harm the city\u2019s economy by suppressing investment, cutting jobs and lowering demand for high-priced apartment towers.
