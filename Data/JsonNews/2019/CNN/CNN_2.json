Dow closed up 435 points on Wednesday, boosted by the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep interest rates steady. The Dow finished above 25,000 for the first time since December 7.  The S&P; 500 finished 1.6% higher and the Nasdaq was up 2.2%. Fed governors unanimously agreed at their first two-day policy-setting meeting of 2019 to keep the federal funds rates, which influences the cost of mortgages, credit cards and other borrowing, at a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. That was largely what Wall Street expected. Stocks were lifted Wednesday morning, mostly by Boeing and Apple. Boeing, the largest US exporter, posted record sales for 2018. Shares closed more than 6% higher. Apple closed up 3%, despite reporting a drop in iPhone sales Tuesday.","1":"  The early 2020 presidential race has everyone talking about taxing the rich, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. The verdict? He's willing to pay higher income taxes. \u201cI believe that individuals earning the most can afford to pay more, and I have no problem paying higher taxes to address some of the fundamental challenges and inequities in our society,\" he said in a statement first obtained by CNBC. But the offer comes with a caveat. \"However, we need to ensure that our tax dollars are going where they can be most effective \u2014 like expanding the earned income tax credit and other programs that support the people and communities who really need it,\" he continued.\u00a0 Dimon, the longest serving chief executive on Wall Street,\u00a0noted that he's also \"argued for fair and competitive corporate taxes.\"","2":" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell strongly hinted that the Fed may be done raising rates for now \u2014 and perhaps for all of 2019. At a press conference today, he said the American economy could slow, while concerns that inflation could spiral out of control have abated. That means the Fed's case for raising rates has \"weakened.\" It kept its target interest rate steady near 2% Wednesday. Powell said the uncertainty of the economic and inflation forecasts means the Fed is \"patiently awaiting greater clarity.\" He said December's rate hike didn't match the patience that the Fed now has. It is also open to slowing the pace of another key tool: the unwinding of its balance sheet. The Fed has been selling off assets it purchased to prop up the economy during the financial crisis. Update 2:50 pm ET: \"Wait and see\" Anyone with \"patience\" on their Powell press conference bingo board is a winner. Powell said the Fed is taking a \"wait and see\" approach to rate hikes as \"we will patiently wait and let the data clarify.\" He noted the jobs market remains strong, and the Fed continues to expect the American economy will grow at a strong pace this year \u2014 although at a slower pace than in 2018. \"Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly China and Europe. Brexit, ongoing trade negotiations and the effects of the partial government shutdown are problematic.\" Powell also noted some surveys of business and consumer sentiment have moved lower. Update 2:55 pm ET: The shutdown Powell said the shutdown is \"less important\" than other impacts on the economy, although he acknowledged that it \"will leave some imprint\" on first-quarter GDP. \"If that's all there is and there isn't another shutdown, we'll get some of that back in the second quarter,\" Powell noted. The Congressional Budget Office suggested the shutdown cost the American economy $11 billion, and GDP will never recoup about $3 billion of that. Powell said that, more than the shutdown, the Fed is concerned that financial conditions have become \"significantly tighter\" in recent months. Update 3 pm ET: Did Powell cave? Asked whether Powell and the Fed caved to President Donald Trump's pressure to stop raising rates, Powell said the Fed only considers economic data when making its rate decisions. \"That's strongly our culture,\" he said. \"We're always going to do what we think is the right thing. We're never going to take political considerations into account.\" Powell conceded that the Fed is made up of humans and \"We're going to make mistakes.\" Update 3:05 pm ET: What the Fed will do in the next recession Powell said the Fed does not foresee a recession on the horizon. However, if the economy should get much worse in a hurry, the Fed doesn't have much room to reduce interest rates: They remain historically low at around 2%. By contrast, rates were above 5% before the Great Recession. Powell noted the Fed \"could be in a situation in the future where we'd like to cut rates more than we can,\" although he made clear that the Fed doesn't think \"anything like that is in the cards \u2014 we have no reason to think we would be.\" If that were to happen, Powell said the Fed \"would use the full range of our tools,\" and \"there would be room to do substantially more\" to rescue the economy. Update 3:15 pm ET: Trade and America's debt problem America's trade war with China and tariffs on other countries have not produced any \"material effects\" on US GDP, Powell said. But he is concerned with Corporate America and the government's growing debt problem.  Powell said corporate debt poses a \"macroeconomic risk,\" because companies may have to lay off employees to pay back what they owe investors. Powell said the Fed monitors those risks \"very carefully,\" cautioning that \"it's a concern \u2014 it's something we're watching.\" Similarly, Powell said the US government's budget is \"on an unsustainable path and that needs to be addressed.\" He blamed America's health care system, including Medicare and Medicaid, combined with an aging population. Powell said the government will \"have to go after that problem,\" suggesting that lawmakers rein in spending now while the economy is strong.","3":"The Federal Reserve just announced it would hold interest rates steady, another clear signal it intends to take a cautious approach in an uncertain economic environment. The Dow climbed higher on the decision and is now up more than 400 points. Fed governors unanimously agreed at their first two-day policy-setting meeting of 2019 to keep the federal funds rates, which influences the cost of mortgages, credit cards and other borrowing, at a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. Today's decision isn't surprising, according to our Paul R. La Monica:   The Fed said it would be \"patient\" on future hikes. ","4":"More like Tupper-scare. Shares of Tupperware (TUP) plunged 30% after an abysmal earnings report and a stark China warning. The home-goods maker said its fourth-quarter 2018 sales fell 14% compared to the same time period a year earlier and missed analysts' expectations. Tupperware also adjusted its 2019 guidance lower. CEO Tricia Stitzel said on an analyst call that the company is \"seeing increasingly problematic consumer spending trends in China as their economy slows down.\" Even before today's sharp drop, Tupperware's shares had tumbled nearly 60% over the past year. ","5":"   Lots of important economic reports have been held up for weeks due to the partial government shutdown, but some of them will start rolling out this week. November home sales, which was scheduled to come out on December 27, will be published Thursday by the Census Bureau. Reports on construction spending and wholesale trade \u2013 also based on November data -- will both post on Friday. Next week, the Census Bureau will publish three reports that were due out in January. Manufacturers\u2019 shipments, inventories and orders from November will release on February 4. November numbers on goods and services trade will come out on February 6, as will a separate measure of steel imports.\u00a0 Still missing: The fourth quarter GDP report that was scheduled to come out today remains delayed. A new release date has yet to be set by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which publishes the report. The monthly jobs report will be published by the Labor Department as scheduled on Friday. That department as funded by Congress through September, and remained open during the shutdown.","6":"Boeing's blockbuster earnings and guidance are quieting Wall Street's slowdown fears. Boeing (BA) led the way higher on the Dow, soaring 7% after notching its first $100 billion sales year. Apple (AAPL) advanced 5% -- despite revealing a drop in iPhone sales. Wall Street was apparently bracing for even worse news from Tim Cook & Co.  Those rallies overshadowed a 4% slide for AT&T; (T). The owner of CNN and HBO posted a sales miss on disappointing mobile phone subscription growth. Meanwhile, US oil prices climbed by another 3% as traders brace for supply constraints caused by US sanctions on Venezuela. Next up, Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve. Traders will begin dissecting the Fed policy statement at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Powell's press conference 30 minutes later.","7":" McDonald's (MCD) new growth strategy in 2017 beefed up its digital capabilities, modernized its stores and introduced delivery. Those efforts drove growth this year, CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement on Wednesday.\u00a0 In the last three months of 2018, global comparable sales grew 4.4% and US sales grew 2.3%. It\u2019s the 14th consecutive quarter of global sales growth for the company. Plus, more people are coming to the stores. In both 2018 and 2017, McDonald\u2019s customer count grew.\u00a0 The company tried aggressively to convince consumers to download its app last year, running promotions like free fries with a $1 app purchase. It also revealed a new breakfast sandwich in the fall.\u00a0 Though comparable sales grew, overall revenue fell in 2018 because of refranchising costs, the company said. Shares were flat before the market opened on Wednesday.","8":"  Shares of Anthem (ANTM), the health insurance company, soared 10% Wednesday to a new all-time high. Anthem, which runs Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, reported earnings that topped forecasts. It issued a healthy outlook for 2019. Investors were also excited by the company's plans to launch its own pharmacy benefits management company, IngenioRx, with drugstore chain CVS (CVS) in the second quarter \u2014 several months earlier than expected.  Anthem had been using Express Scripts as its middleman between insurers, drug stores and pharmaceutical companies. But the two had a falling out in 2016 when Anthem sued Express Scripts over a pricing dispute. Anthem announced in 2017 that it would end its deal with Express Scripts at the end of this year.  But a lot has changed in the health care world since then. Express Scripts was bought by Cigna (CI), the insurer that Anthem had hoped to merge with before that deal was killed by regulators. And CVS scooped up Aetna, another insurer.  Anthem now finds itself in an alliance with CVS in order to try and keep drug prices low \u2014 and Wall Street happy.","9":"  The Dow closed up 181 points, or 0.7% on Friday, boosted by optimism the US-China trade talks were making progress. The Nasdaq was up 0.9% and the S&P; 500 was up 0.6% For the week, the Dow was up 0.6% -- extending its winning streak to nine. The Nasdaq was also up for the 9th straight week, finishing up 0.7%.\u00a0The S&P; 500 was up 0.6% for the week. Investors cheered signs of progress on the trade front as US and Chinese officials met in Washington to try and hash out a trade agreement ahead of a March 1 deadline. Alibaba (BABA) was up 3%. Friday\u2019s big winners included home furnishing site Wayfair (W), which was up 28% on solid earnings. Food companies got hammered, dragged down by bad news from Kraft Heinz (KHC). The company\u2019s stock was down 27%. Campbell Soup (CPB) fell 7%, and JM Smucker (SJM) dipped 5%. Stamps.com (STMP) plunged 58% after it said it was ending an exclusive relationship with the US Postal Service","10":"  Tesla (TSLA) has had a bad week -- not as bad as Kraft Heinz (KHC), but still.  However there was one bright spot: The automaker delivered its first Model 3 to a customer in China on Friday, weeks ahead of schedule, according to CNN Business' Chris Isidore. There was even a ceremony held for the delivery in Beijing. China is a critical market for Tesla -- it's the largest market for both overall car sales and for the sale of electric vehicles. Read more about Tesla's most recent travails here.","11":"Stocks are higher at midday: The bad news from Kraft Heinz (KHC), which is down 27%, is also hurting General Mills (GIS), which is down 4%. Campbell Soup (CPB) plunged 8%, and JM Smucker (SJM) dipped 6%. Friday's big gainers include Wayfair (W), which jumped 30% on strong earnings, and Roku (ROKU), which gained 22% after it also posted good results.","12":"The bad news from Kraft Heinz (KHC) is hurting its competitors.  Shares of General Mills (GIS) and Conagra (CAG) fell about 4% on Friday. Campbell Soup (CPB) plunged around 8%.  Mondelez (MDLZ ) and Nestle (NSRGY) both dipped around 1%.  Investors likely fear that the troubles that contributed to Kraft's whopping $15 billion write-down could impact its competitors, as well. Big consumer packaged goods companies rely on similar supply chains and face similar challenges, like rising commodity and transportation costs.   Kraft shares are still plummeting. Mid-morning on Friday, the stock was down 28%.  ","13":"  Wayfair (W), the online home furnishings' retailer, surged more than 30% on Friday after it reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street's predictions. The company lost $143 million during the quarter, but that was less than investors expected. The company also posted $576 million in sales, a 40% increase from the same period a year ago. \"Our offering is resonating more and more with our customers in North America and Europe,\" said Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah. Opening brick-and-mortar stores could become the next big thing for Wayfair. The company opened its first permanent store in Kentucky earlier this month, and Shah said there are \"a lot of opportunities\" for stores in the future.","14":" Kraft Heinz (KHC) shares lost more than a quarter of their value Friday following the shocking news of a big writedown and an accounting probe by the SEC. But nobody is feeling the pain of this Velveeta-esque meltdown more than the Oracle of Omaha. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) is the biggest investor in Kraft Heinz. It owns nearly 326 million shares. Following the huge drop Friday, that stake was worth about $4.3 billion less than what it was on Thursday. Buffett's partner on the Kraft Heinz deal, giant private equity firm 3G Capital, is getting hit hard too. The value of its investment plunged by about $3.5 billion.   Other big losers? Average Americans that likely own at least a small slice of Kraft Heinz in mutual funds or ETFs. Vanguard, State Street, BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity are all among the 10 largest shareholders of Kraft Heinz. ","15":"  Shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC) plunged 26% after the company had one of the worst days imaginable on Thursday. The company: Sales were up about 1% in the fourth quarter.  But higher-than-expected manufacturing and logistics costs plagued the company, and it overestimated that savings from its 2015 merger would continue to help lower costs. Kraft said cutting the dividend will help the company reduce its debt faster, support its investments and help the company divest businesses that aren't supporting the bottom line.","16":"The Dow rose 90 points as American and Chinese trade negotiators continue talks in Washington.

But the company's bread and butter is struggling. CNN Business' Seth Fiegerman explains Apple's (AAPL) new iPhone reality, and gets to the heart of Tuesday's earnings report. ","19":"  The last time Apple's holiday quarter sales fell, America was consumed with Bush v. Gore and Tom Brady had one completed pass in his career. Apple's sales fell 5% in the last three months of 2018 -- and that's the first time Apple's sales dropped during the final quarter of the year since 2000. In the last three months 2000, Apple posted $1 billion in sales, less than the $2.3 billion in revenue it made in the 1999 holiday quarter. (By contrast, Apple's sales totaled $84.3 billion last quarter). In 2000, Apple's biggest product was the Macintosh. But it only sold 659,000 of them in the holiday quarter of 2000 -- down from 1.4 million a year earlier.  Apple (AAPL) attributed the loss in sales to \"continued deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers,\" price cuts and rebate programs to cull inventory. At the time, Apple was selling a lot of its new iMac computers and iBook laptops but still had a ton of Power Macs at stores that it had to get rid of.  The company also had introduced the G4 Cube in July 2000, its biggest flop of all time.  Apple sold just 29,000 of them during the 2000 holiday quarter and had to sell them at a steep discount to get them out of stores. *An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated Apple's quarterly sales decline.","20":"  For the first time in years, Apple (AAPL) did not disclose the number of iPhones sold as part of its quarterly earnings report. On a conference call for its last earnings report in November, Apple announced that it would stop disclosing the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs sold each quarter. The move came as a shock to Wall Street. For years, this figure has been a focus among industry watchers -- and it only seemed to go up, up, up. In more recent quarters, however, iPhone shipments have flatlined or even declined. On Tuesday, Apple said iPhone revenue for the quarter fell 5% amid weakness in China. (See correction, below.) The figure suggests a decline in the number of iPhones sold.  Unlike other quarters, however, Apple won't say exactly how much. Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated Apple's quarterly sales decline.","21":"  Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook said on Tuesday\u2019s earnings call that iPhone sales have struggled for three reasons.\u00a0It's important to understand what's going on from the customer perspective at the point of purchase, he said:\u00a0 1. Foreign exchange rates. Cook says the strength of the US dollar has hurt sales around the world.  2. Fewer subsides. iPhone subsidies are becoming less common around the world.  3. Apple\u2019s battery replacement program. \u201cFor millions of customers we made it inexpensive and efficient to replace the batteries,\u201d Cook said of the company\u2019s year-old battery replacement program. The program was launched after it was discovered that Apple was slowing down older iPhones to stop them from shutting down unexpectedly. \u201cWe strongly believe it was the right thing to do for our customers.\u201d","22":"Here's a quick glance at Apple's revenue last quarter, courtesy of Neil Cybart, an analyst who follows Apple closely.   ","23":" As iPhone sales continue to fall, Apple (AAPL) hopes that its services business can eventually more than make up the difference. Although we're a long way from that happening, Apple services had a very nice quarter. Revenue from the app store, Apple Music, Apple Care and other subscriptions rose 19% to a record $10.9 billion. That's far less than the $52 billion Apple brought in from iPhone sales. But unlike the iPhone, it's growing -- strong. Apple delivered solid growth from its wearables, home and accessories business too. Sales grew 33% from that business unit, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods and HomePod.","24":"  After resetting Wall Street's expectations about last quarter, Apple (AAPL) had to level with Wall Street once more Tuesday: It's not too optimistic about the current quarter either. Apple said it expects sales to come in between $55 billion and $59 billion this quarter, below analysts' median estimate of $59 billion, according to a survey of Apple analysts conducted by Refinitiv. The company's profit will be pinched too. Apple expects its gross margin to come in between 37% and 38%, below Wall Street's expectation of 38.1%. That's also below the 38.3% gross margin Apple earned a year ago. Investors weren't overly concerned, perhaps because the guidance wasn't quite as bad as some had feared: The stock was up 3% in after hours trading.","25":"  Apple's (AAPL) first quarter 2019 earnings results, by the numbers:\u00a0Apple said Tuesday that its sales for the all-important holiday quarter hit $84.3 billion. The figure was slightly better than Apple had warned investors to expect earlier this month, but nonetheless represented a 5% decline from the same quarter a year ago. The sales decline was driven by a dip in iPhone sales, which Apple CEO Tim Cook previously said was primarily due to a slowdown in China. Apple's iPhone revenue for the quarter fell 15%, to $51.98 billion. Apple's sales in China also fell considerably. It reported revenue in the region of $13.17 billion, down from $17.95 billion in the same period a year ago. Apple stock initially rose as much as 3% in after hours trading Tuesday following the report.","26":"  The last time Apple reported earnings results, it was the most valuable public company in the world. Today, it\u2019s fourth on the list.\u00a0 What a difference three months makes. Apple (AAPL) stock is down about 30% since the last time it reported earnings in early November. Investors are worried about the future of the company\u2019s core business: the iPhone.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On a conference call with analysts for the last earnings report, Apple announced it would stop reporting how many iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells each quarter. The move sparked fears that Apple expects iPhone shipments to begin declining. Less than two weeks later, iPhone parts suppliers began cutting sales outlooks, which raised more alarms. Then came the biggest red flag of all. On Jan. 2, Apple CEO issued a stark warning to investors that the company would miss its revenue target for the final quarter of 2018 by a wide margin \u2013 as much as $9 billion below the high end of its earlier guidance.  The reason: weak iPhone sales, primarily in China. \u00a0","27":"  Total public debt in the United States has topped $22 trillion for the first time, according to data released today by the Treasury Department. Talk about a milestone. The national debt has been rising at an a faster clip since the 2008 financial crisis, when Congress and the Obama administration approved stimulus funding to prop up the economy. The debt began to level off at the beginning of President Trump's term. But it jumped again after his 2017 tax cuts took effect.","28":"A dose of good news out of Washington sent Wall Street into party mode on Tuesday. The powerful rally snapped a four-day losing streak in the stock market.  Investors were boosted by hopes that Congress and the White House have reached a deal to avert a government shutdown.

According to a filing with the SEC, the Marlboro owner plans to sell bonds to finance its $12.8 billion acquisition of a 35% stake in Juul. Altria (MO) also is making a nearly $2 billion investment to buy a stake in Canadian cannabis company Cronos (CRON). The Financial Times and Bloomberg both reported that Altria was looking to sell $11.5 billion in bonds to help fund its investments.  Adding that much debt is a risky, but probably necessary, move for Altria as the company faces a steady decline in the use of traditional tobacco cigarettes. Vaping and marijuana are markets that are growing much faster.

The Dow jumped more than 300 points Tuesday after politicians in the United States tentatively agreed on a plan to avert another government shutdown. Stocks also got a boost after Saudi Arabia decided to cut oil production.

","33":"  As gridlock mounts in Washington, small businesses are getting more worried about the future.  The National Federation of Independent Business' small business optimism index, which surged after the election of President Donald Trump and reached all-time highs last summer, last month dropped to the lowest level since November of 2016.  The survey was taken in the midst of the 35-day government shutdown. Although hiring and business investment remain strong, half of the decline in the reading came from business owners' expectations for economic growth in the second half of the year. Most economists expect to see a deceleration as the effects of tax cuts and spending wear off.  Other \"soft\" measures of consumer and business sentiment have also cooled off markedly in recent months, though the January hit may be temporary if the White House and Congress manage to head off another shutdown before the deadline passes this week.  Also on Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that job openings reached a high of 7.3 million in December, with a particularly large jump in demand for construction workers and accommodation and food service employees.  Since March 2018, there have been more job openings than unemployed people. ","34":"The roller coaster ride that oil prices have been on lately isn't ending anytime soon.  Several factors are driving these swings, according to Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

The Dow soared 444 points, or 1.7%, on Friday in response to more progress on US-China trade talks.  The S&P; 500 jumped 1.1%. The Nasdaq advanced 0.6%, gaining ground for the sixth day in a row. For the week, the Dow surged 3%, notching its eighth straight weekly rally. That\u2019s the longest such streak since the fall of 2017. The Nasdaq is also up eight weeks in a row for the first time since the summer of 2016. Investors cheered further signs of progress on the trade front. President Donald Trump said on Friday that talks with China are going \u201cextremely well\u201d and will continue next week in Washington.  Banks led the rally, with Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) climbing 3% apiece. Mattel (MAT) plummeted 18%, its worst day since October 1999, after giving a weak outlook.","37":"   So much for that big turnaround for Mattel. The toy maker's stock plunged nearly 20% late Friday, its worst drop in nearly 20 years, after executives warned during an analyst presentation at New York's Toy Fair that sales for the first quarter of 2019 and profits for the full year wouldn't be as good as hoped. The news comes shortly after Mattel wowed Wall Street with better-than-expected results during the holidays, led by solid sales for its iconic Barbie and Hot Wheels toys. The company said in its presentation Friday that those brands should still do well in 2019 but that momentum may slow a bit. Other problems? A stronger dollar is eating into its foreign sales -- a problem that many big  US multinational firms are facing. But Mattel also said that the demise of Toys \"R\" Us will continue to hurt it this year and that China sales will fall too. Mattel's (MAT) bleak outlook likely doesn't bode well for rival Hasbro either. Hasbro reported weak holiday sales earlier this month as well. Hasbro (HAS) shares fell 4%. ","38":"  Amazon (AMZN) hasn't been shy about its plans to take more control of the package delivery process. That's not good news for traditional delivery companies.  One of them, XPO Logistics, warned in its latest earnings report it was cutting its outlook due to \"the impact of our largest customer substantially downsizing its business.\" XPO Logistics added in its annual filing with the SEC that the decision will lead to a $600 million hit to its 2019 sales.  XPO Logistics wouldn't name the customer. But Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra said in a report it likely was Amazon. Several other analysts have speculated as such too. Amazon told CNN Business it had no comment. A spokesperson for XPO Logistics remained hopeful though. \"We intend to replace this business over time with other customers,\" the spokesperson said. And CEO Bradley Smith noted during a conference call that its five biggest customers will only make up about 8% of its total sales this year. But investors are nervous. XPO Logistics (XPO) plunged nearly 15% Friday -- and that dragged down FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) as well.","39":"US and UK officials signed two agreements Thursday that will ensure $5 billion in trade isn\u2019t disrupted between the two countries once the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.\u00a0 The agreements don\u2019t cover all trade between the two countries.

Investors are squarely focused on one thing: getting a China trade deal. The Dow soared 335 points, or 1.3%, midday on Friday  While Washington debates the merits of Trump's emergency declaration, investors are relieved that Congress and the White House have avoided another government shutdown. Even better from the market's perspective, the border wall may not be used as a bargaining chip in a future fight over raising the debt ceiling. Trump's Friday press conference offered more hints of tentative progress on trade. The president said talks are going \"extremely well\" and he confirmed that China's negotiators will come to Washington next week to continue negotiations. Newell Brands (NWL) got badly left behind by the Friday rally. The maker of Sharpie markers and Graco strollers plummeted 20% after posting disappointing sales and guidance. ","41":" Electronic Arts has a huge hit with its new Fortnite-esque game Apex Legends. 25 million players in just one week. But the game could soon get another big boost from the world's biggest market. The South Morning China Post reported Friday that Chinese tech giant Tencent (TCEHY) is talking to EA (EA) about a deal to distribute the game in China.  A deal would obviously be great news for EA, whose shares have surged nearly 15% this month thanks to the success of Apex Legends -- and despite the fact that the company reported weak earnings and a lousy outlook last week. EA and Tencent were not immediately available for comment. But if Tencent does do a deal with EA, it will be interesting to see if that impacts playing time of Fortnite in China. That actually could be a problem for Tencent since it has a 40% stake in Fortnite developer Epic Games, the privately held company that's now worth $15 billion. ","42":"Industrial production in the United States slid .6% in January, which was below expectations. The Federal Reserve also adjusted December's reading lower.  Here's more from our Matt Egan: ","43":"The dissolution of Toys 'R' Us is impacting another company: Newell Brands (NWL). Shares plunged 17% following a dismal fourth-quarter earnings report. Partly driving the stock's decline is a 3% drop in sales for its Graco baby products brand.  Newell said the \"continued negative impact of the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us bankruptcy\" was the issue. The company sold strollers to Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us.  The company also adjusted its full-year sales range lower. Today's plunge wipes out Newell's year-to-date gains: ","44":"Hopes for trade peace between the United States and China continue to carry the stock market higher. Markets were boosted by news that US-China trade talks will continue trade negotiations next week in Washington. \"That has turned what was a modestly negative tone to a modestly positive one,\" Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, wrote to clients.  Hickey added, \"Let the record show that we are getting just as tired about typing subject lines related to Chinese trade talks as you are reading about them.\" Nvidia (NVDA) jumped 6% after posting guidance that wasn\u2019t as bad as feared. Newell Brands (NWL), the maker of Rubbermaid and Sharpie markers, tumbled 14% on a sales miss and tepid guidance.  Caesars Entertainment (CZR) gained 2% as billionaire investor Carl Icahn reportedly pushed the casino operator to sell itself.","45":"Here's something that hasn't happened since the dotcom bubble. The Nasdaq finished up this week for the 10th in a row. That marks the index\u2019s longest weekly winning streak since 1999, according to Bespoke Investment Group.  The Dow closed narrowly lower on the week, snapping its nine-week up streak. The Dow hasn't had a 10-week streak since 1995, Bespoke said.  US markets finished solidly higher on Friday, with the Dow jumping 110 points, or 0.4%. The S&P; 500 gained 0.7% and finished above 2,800 for the first time since November. The Nasdaq climbed 0.8%.  Gap (GPS) rallied 16% in response to a breakup plan that will split off Old Navy into its own public company. Tesla (TSLA) dropped 8% after announcing the launch of its $35,000 Model 3 and warning of a first-quarter loss.  Kroger (KR) fell 4% on concerns about Amazon (AMZN) reportedly planning to launch a new grocery chain.  US oil prices declined 2.5% to $55.80 a barrel.\u00a0","46":"The American economy may have just slammed on the brakes. The initial Atlanta Federal Reserve GDPNow estimate, released Friday, calls for first-quarter growth of just 0.3%.  That would be a sharp deceleration from the fourth quarter, when the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.6%. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow is a forecasting model that provides a \"nowcast\" by adjusting to the latest economic data. That makes it subject to sharp revisions.  The New York Fed's Nowcast, also released Friday, is calling for first-quarter GDP growth of just 0.9%. Goldman Sachs sees first-quarter GDP coming in at 0.9% as well.  That call was bolstered by Friday's ISM manufacturing index, which showed that factory activity in the United States expanded at the slowest pace in two years. The weaker growth reflects the sharp slowdown in China, lingering trade tensions and a hangover from the market turmoil of late 2018.  The good news is that Washington and Beijing could be nearing a trade deal and markets have rebounded sharply.  Goldman Sachs on Friday predicted second-quarter US growth will rebound to nearly 3%.","47":" Lyft beat Uber in its race to go public. The company filed\u00a0paperwork\u00a0on Friday to raise as much as $100 million in its public offering. The amount could change, depending on investor demand.

","48":" Amazon is already a major player in the grocery business. But the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the company may open even more supermarkets in major cities. And that's spooking investors in supermarket leader Kroger (KR). Shares tumbled 5% at one point before recovering a little bit. Other retailers with big grocery businesses, such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), were down slightly too.  But it seems odd investors would be so nervous. It's not really news. Amazon (AMZN) is already a major player in groceries -- both with physical Whole Foods stores and online deliveries.  Still, one hedge fund manager noted that it's just more bad news for smaller grocers like Weis Markets (WMK). Its stock fell Friday. So did shares of Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM).

If the market closes around these levels, the Dow would finish slightly lower on the week, snapping its nine-week winning streak. The Nasdaq, however, is on pace to advance for the 10th week in a row. The retail sector is the big bright spot on Wall Street on Friday.  Gap (GPS) surged 18% on its breakup plan, while Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (LB) jumped 7% despite its weak guidance. Victoria's Secret announced plans late Thursday to shut 53 stores. Strong sales also lifted Foot Locker (FL) 5% to the highest level in nearly two years. Energy stocks (XLE) also advanced despite a 2% drop in US oil prices to $55.88 a barrel.

First, the state's Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo is \"working intensely behind the scenes to lure the company back,\" reports the New York Times. He's reportedly made \"multiple\" phone calls with Amazon execs and even offered to help them get the necessary governmental approvals to move forward.  Cuomo admitted he's talked with Amazon (AMZN) to reconsider its decision, but hasn't heard of \"any changes\" about the company's decision, according to his office.  In addition, top business leaders wrote an open letter to Amazon execs. It will be published in Friday's edition of the Times.  The letter, which was written by the nonprofit organization Partnership for New York City, said Cuomo will take \"personal responsibility for the project's state approval.\" Signatories include the CEOs from JetBlue, Hearst, MasterCard and Deloitte.

It was an Air Canada flight from San Francisco that took off shortly before President Trump announced that the U.S. would be grounding all Boeing Max jets. Today, the world's skies are completely empty of the jet that, just three and a half years ago, Boeing said would take the 737 model \"to the next level of performance.\" Whether and when the Max series will fly again remains to be seen -- you can read about the jet's maiden flight in 2016 here. ","77":" Boeing's 737 Max series, now steeped in controversy and grounded around the world, is the fastest-selling model in the history of the firm. The company has delivered 376 Max planes to airlines -- but a further 4,636 from around the world are unfulfilled, according to Boeing's latest reports.  What happens to those orders is a crucial question, and one that is undoubtedly being discussed by carriers already. While some airlines will have the luxury of time before making a decision on their orders, others are expecting new planes -- which they are currently unable to fly -- to be delivered in the coming weeks and months.  American Airlines has 76 Max planes still to be delivered, United is expecting 123, and Southwest -- which already flew more Max jets than any other carrier -- is awaiting 249 more. In addition, several US companies that buy planes and lease them out to carriers have placed orders for more than 100 planes. Ethiopian Airlines, which suffered Sunday's crash, still has 25 Max planes on order. Lion Air, whose Max jet went down in October, has 187 on order. In Europe, budget carrier Ryanair is awaiting all 135 of its Max orders. TUI Airways -- one of the UK's largest air carriers\u00a0-- saw its fleet of 14 Max planes grounded this week, but it must make a decision on its 58 orders. A full list of Boeing's deliveries and orders for its Max planes can be found here.","87":"US stocks closed slightly higher Tuesday, with investors cautiously optimistic as US-China trade talks continued. The Nasdaq and S&P; 500 were both up about 0.2%. The Dow finished mostly unchanged. Walmart was the Dow\u2019s top performer, closing 2.2% higher following a strong earnings report. Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) shares both rose more than 1%. Shares of WW (WTW), formerly Weight Watchers, closed down 4.5% after two analysts cut their price targets. \u00a0","88":"Investors have been waiting to see how Ford plans to spend the $11 billion the company says it will take to transform its business. We now know what's happening to the first piece of that total. The company announced Tuesday that it's leaving the large truck business in South America, and will shut down a truck factory in S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil. Ford is taking a $460 million charge as a result of that closure. South America is one of Ford's biggest money losers, so the decision is not a surprise.  Ford did not disclose the number of employees it has at the plant, which is one of four that it operates in Brazil. It has 11,500 workers in the country in all. Shares of Ford (F) were up 3% in midday trading.\u00a0","89":" Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn wants to make a gamble with Caesars Entertainment (CZR).  A new regulatory filing reveals that Icahn has a 9.78% stake in the gambling and hotel company. He is pushing for changes, including a possible sale. Here's what the filing says: The filing confirms a report last week that Icahn has a near-10% stake in the company. Shares of Caesars are up nearly 5% following the news. It will report earnings on Thursday.","90":" Markets have been bobbing between negative and positive territory during the first half of Tuesday's trading session. Here's where they stand at midday: Walmart (WMT) continues to trade higher after crushing its earnings: Shares are up nearly 4%. Target (TGT) is also up roughly 2%.  Papa John's (PZZA) is 3% lower after an analyst downgraded the pizza chain's stock. Shares of WW, formerly Weight Watchers (WTW), have recovered from earlier lows after two analysts cut their price targets. It's now down 4%. ","91":"Investors can exhale. Earnings season is finishing \"much better than feared,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, told \"First Move\" anchor Julia Chatterley.  Hogan said that roughly 70% of companies beat on earnings. He cautions the first quarter could be \"flat or down a little\" compared to the same quarter a year ago when companies were experiencing momentum from tax reform.  He's bullish on the rest of 2019, casting doubts on a recession. \"If we can get 5% earnings growth for the year, that's a spectacular year\" on top of last year's growth, Hogan said.  ","92":" Weight Watchers' stock is going on a diet. Shares of the company, which is now known as WW, plunged 8% Tuesday after two analysts cut their price targets.  JPMorgan's Christina Brathwaite downgraded WW (WTW) to an \"underperform\" \u2014 that's essentially a sell. She cut her price target from $37 to $25, which is more than 10% below its current price.  Brathwaite is worried about reviews for the WW app becoming \"increasingly negative\" and competition from rival weight-loss services Noom and Diet Doctor. Oppenheimer's Brian Nagel lowered his target Friday to $40. That's still 40% above where it is trading now, but it's a drastic cut compared to his old target, $98 a share.  Nagel conceded that \"investors have increasingly fretted over the potential for waning subscriber growth at the company.\" WW is now down more than 25% this year and is 70% below its 52-week high. That's bad news for spokesperson Oprah Winfrey. She owns more than 8% of the shares. Her stake is now worth about $150 million, down from more than $400 million a year ago.","93":"Markets start the first trading day of a short week with a whimper as talks between the United States and China resume. Here's a snapshot of the open: Walmart (WMT) jumped 4% after the company released holiday sales figures that beat expectations. The numbers show the retailer can more than hold its own against Amazon. WW (WTW), the company that used to be known as Weight Watchers, declined 7% after its most bullish analyst cut its valuation in half.","94":" Walmart (WMT) earnings are out and they crushed expectations:","95":"  US stock futures\u00a0are slightly lower this morning. Walmart\u00a0(WMT) is set to release earnings, and investors will be watching closely to see if the world's largest retailer managed to avoid the slowdown some of its competitors faced during the crucial holiday quarter. The company increased its full year guidance when it reported earnings for the third quarter of 2018 in November.  But the mood in the retail industry has darkened considerably since then. Core retail sales dropped 1.7% in December \u2014 the most in nearly twenty years \u2014 as American shoppers started to worry about their wallets amid market turmoil and the longest government shutdown in US history.  Yet\u00a0Walmart\u00a0stock has gained over 7% so far this year to trade near $100.","96":" Amazon (AMZN) said Thursday that its holiday quarter sales hit $72.4 billion, up 20% from the same period a year earlier and at the high end of its previous forecast.  Amazon's annual revenue reached $232.9 billion. But sales growth is slowing down. Its 20% sales growth for the quarter was well below the 38% growth it saw in the same period a year earlier. Amazon also forecast weaker than expected sales for the first quarter of 2019. Amazon reported $3 billion in profit for the final three months of 2018, marking the fifth consecutive quarter that its profits topped $1 billion. Amazon's total profit for 2018 topped $10 billion for the first time in the company's history. Its shares were essentially flat following the earnings report Thursday. But the stock has had a strong start to the year. It was up more than 10% in January.","97":"  Foxconn is in line to collect $4 billion in state and local\u00a0government incentives when it builds a new location in the state of Wisconsin. But exactly what kind of facility the electronics giant has in the works is unclear. Our own Chris Isidore breaks it down: The original plan: Build a massive manufacturing plant to make flat screen panels that would employ 13,000. The new plan: A\u00a0technology hub\u00a0dedicated to research and development rather than manufacturing, that also has a smaller factory component. In a statement, the company said: Nothing with the incentives plan has changed -- yet. But Governor Tony Evers only just learned about the revised plans this week.  ","98":" It was freezing on Wall Street but the stock market was on fire. The S&P; 500 climbed nearly 1%, lifting its January gain to 8%. That's the biggest January rally since 1987.  The Dow closed just slightly higher on the day, but still achieved its strongest January since 1989. The Nasdaq soared 1.4%.  Facebook (FB) was the big winner. It surged 11% on its booming bottom line and solid user growth. And General Electric (GE) cruised 12% higher, its best day in nearly a decade. Wall Street is betting GE's earnings report and subprime mortgage settlement mean the company's crisis is finally over.","99":"Wall Street is on the verge of closing out January on a positive note. The stars of the show on Thursday were GE and Facebook, two of the biggest disappointments of last year. GE (GE) soared 15% after reaching a $1.5 billion subprime mortgage settlement and posting results that were better than feared. GE is on track for its best day since 2009. Facebook (FB) wasn't far behind. The Mark Zuckerberg-led company climbed 13% in response to a record profit and solid user growth. The Dow was held back by DowDuPont (DWDP), which tumbled nearly 8% after announcing disappointing results. If the markets avoid an afternoon slide, the Dow and S&P; 500 could notch their best January performance in at least 30 years. ","100":"  Maybe the housing market isn't cooling off that much after all?  The government said Thursday new home sales in November increased nearly 17% from October, well above Wall Street's forecasts. (The data is a little old since the report's original release date was postponed during the partial government shutdown.) A big reason for the pop in sales is housing prices tumbled sharply. The median sales price was $302,400, compared to $325,100 in October and $343,400 a year ago.  The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was hovering around 5% in November. During the past few months, mortgage rates have cooled to about 4.46%. If prices and mortgage rates continue to fall, that might entice even more previously reluctant buyers to shop for a house.  That would be great news for housing-related stocks. The S&P; Homebuilders ETF (XHB) was up 2% Thursday. The index includes Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), insulation company Owens-Corning (OC) and floor maker Mohawk (MHK) as well as major builders.","101":"  Marlboro owner Altria and the analysts that follow it clearly believe the company's future is more about vaping than smoking. Juul, the e-cigarette company in which Altria bought a 35% stake in December for $12.8 billion, was mentioned 98 times during Altria's earnings conference call Thursday. Altria chairman Howard Willard noted that Juul's sales topped $1 billion last year, up from about $200 million in 2017. The company added that it expected US vaping volumes to grow about 15% to 20% annually for the next five years while traditional cigarettes should continue to post declines of around 4% to 5%. Willard also touted Altria's recent investment in Canadian marijuana company Cronos (CRON), saying that \"the\u00a0growth opportunities are significant\u00a0and will extend across the globe as cannabis markets open.\"\u00a0  Shares of Altria (MO) rose 2% in early trading. But the stock is still lagging the broader market this year as some analysts remain skeptical of the Juul deal. Morgan Stanley downgraded Altria a few weeks ago, citing concerns that it overpaid for Juul.","102":"US markets opened mixed Thursday.  Facebook (FB) stock soared 11% at the opening bell, a day after the social media company posted a record $6.9 billion profit. Tesla (TSLA) slumped 4% the morning after CEO Elon Musk told investors that the company\u2019s chief financial officer is leaving. General Electric (GE) spiked 10% after the company said it reached a $1.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department, putting to rest a major question about the beleaguered business. Shares were already up 20% this year on investor hopes that the company\u2019s decade-old struggles are coming to an end. Intel (INTC) shares fell 3%. The company announced that interim CEO Robert Swan will take the position permanently after a months-long search.","103":"  The number of people filing first-time unemployment insurance claims soared to its highest level since September 30, 2017. The probable culprit: The five-week government shutdown, which ended last Friday. Initial jobless claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 253,000, up from a 49-year low of 200,000 the prior week. That's well above the four-week moving average of 215,000 unemployment claims. That's potentially troubling news for the jobs report, which the Department of Labor will release tomorrow morning. Although furloughed workers will be counted as employed in that report, it's still a mystery how many out-of-work government contractors will be considered unemployed. Seasonal adjustments may have also thrown the initial claims number a bit off course, according to Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.  \"It looks that the seasonal factors are having trouble adjusting for the winter weather-related layoffs this time of year,\" he said, noting the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday may have thrown the Labor Department's calculations for loop. ","104":" The growth of online shopping might be hurting brick-and-mortar stores, but it's helping delivery companies such as United Parcel Service UPS (UPS) shipped more packages than ever over the holidays. The record helped lift earnings to $1.7 billion, a 17% rise from a year earlier.  The results were slightly better than Wall Street forecasts. Revenue was up nearly 5% in the quarter. It wasn't all domestic deliveries helping results. Despite concerns about slowing overseas economies and trade wars, UPS reported record results in its international division. The company was not only helped by an increase in the number of shipments but also higher average revenue per packages. It expects earnings to continue to improve in 2019. Shares of UPS were up nearly 5% in premarket trading.","105":"Stocks finished Friday mixed following a stellar jobs report.\u00a0 The Dow rose 64 points, or 0.3%. The index was up by as many as 193 points earlier in the day, but that rally faded by market close.  The S&P; 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq fell 0.3%.  The Dow is now on a six-week winning streak. All three indexes finished with gains of at least 1.3% for the week.\u00a0 Oil giants ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) helped lead the market higher thanks to strong earnings and production gains. Both stocks rose more than 3%.\u00a0 Papa John's (PZZA) fell 9% following a report that suggested the pizza chain is no longer looking to sell itself.","106":" Foxconn says it is returning to its original plan to make flat screen panels at a new plant in Wisconsin following an appeal from President Donald Trump. The Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer caused a storm this week when it said\u00a0it was considering dropping plans\u00a0to build the panels at the facility, even though it said it was still anticipating hiring 13,000 workers.  The company has been promised $4 billion in state and local incentives to develop the Wisconsin facility.  ","107":"A solid rally on Wall Street is losing some momentum Friday afternoon. The early gains were driven by enthusiasm for a series of upbeat economic reports. Most notably, the Labor Department said the United States added 304,000 jobs in January. It was the strongest jobs report relative to expectations since June 2009, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The energy sector is in full rally mode, boosted by a 2.3% leap for US oil prices to $55 a barrel.  ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) rose sharply after their big earnings beats. Exxon snapped a string of production declines, while Chevron rolled out a $25 billion buyback plan.","108":" Shares of Papa John's (PZZA) sank 7% after Reuters reported that the pizza chain has given up on trying to find a buyer. Instead, it's looking to sell a stake of itself. The report says the acquisition offers Papa John's received \"did not meet its valuation expectations.\"  Papa John's founder John Schnatter was forced to resign as the company's chairman last July after he used a racial slur on a conference call. He remains on the board and still owns 30% of the company's shares. Papa John's has struggled since the incident. It has lost roughly one-third of its value over the past year and sales are down. The company didn't immediately reply to CNN Business' request for comment.","109":" No ugh for UGG: Decker Brands (DECK), the maker of Tom Brady's favorite cozy clogs, surged 9% at the open after a strong earnings report. The company's third-quarter sales, which consists of the final three months of last year, rose nearly 11% to $874 million\u00a0compared to the same  period a year earlier.  And it has UGGs to thank for that. Sales for the brand raked in $761 million for the quarter \u2014 an increase of 3.6%. Decker said it saw an \"accelerated growth\" in UGG's mens shoes.  Decker raised its 2019 guidance which also gave the stock a bounce. The company now expects full-year sales to be roughly $2 billion, slightly above the $1.96 billion it previously expected.","110":"US markets were mixed at the open Friday, but the Dow moved higher on the heels of a surprisingly strong jobs report. The Dow's positive open came after the Labor Department reported solid hiring numbers in January it said were largely unaffected by the shutdown. The US economy added 304,000 jobs \u2014 the 100th straight month of job gains. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%, a move the government did attribute to the shutdown. ExxonMobil (XOM), a Dow component, also moved 2% higher after the company posted solid earnings for the most recent quarter that suggested its investments in American shale are paying off.","111":"  Yesterday was the last trading day of the month, so\u00a0here at CNN Business we decided to update our presidential stock market tracker.\u00a0 The S&P; 500 is up 19% since President Donald Trump was inaugurated a little more than two years ago.   Trump has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0pointed to the stock market\u00a0as one of his preferred scorecards of his administration\u2019s policies -- so we made a data visualization to show how the stock market performed under each president since Ronald Reagan.  We'll update this tracker after the last trading day of each month.","112":"  US employers added 304,000 jobs in January, well above what economists had expected of 165,000 jobs.  The unemployment rate ticked slightly higher to 4.0%. It was the 100th consecutive month of job gains. The government said there were \"no discernible impacts\" from the government shutdown on hiring and wages, but that it did contribute to the uptick in unemployment. Our Paul R. La Monica notes that November and December 2018 numbers were revised down: He's also keeping an eye on wage growth numbers, which matched estimates: ","113":"The US jobs report for January will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. It's expected to reveal solid results despite the partial government shutdown that lasted for much of the month. Here are some key numbers:","114":"   Stocks fell on Thursday as investors worried that the United States and China would not be able to reach a trade deal before a March 2 deadline. The declines followed comments by White House adviser\u00a0Larry Kudlow that there was a \u201cpretty sizable distance\u201d\u00a0between Beijing and Washington in trade negotiations.\u00a0President Donald Trump also said he was unlikely to meet with Chinese counterpart\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0before March, when a 90-day trade truce between the two sides is set to expire. Twitter (TWTR) shares sank 10% after the company reported losing millions of users. Tapestry (TPR),\u00a0which owns fashion brands Coach and Kate Spade, plunged 15%\u00a0after it missed Wall Street estimates. SunTrust (STI) and BB&T; (BBT),\u00a0two of the largest US regional banks,\u00a0soared 10% and 4%\u00a0respectively\u00a0after they announced plans to merge. Chipotle (CMG) was up 11.4% after reporting strong quarterly results on Wednesday.","115":"   Who says traditional toys are dead?  Mattel on Thursday reported holiday sales that were much better than expected \u2014 and the company even posted a profit. Analysts were expecting a loss.  Mattel (MAT) shares surged nearly 15% after hours on the news. Mattel said Barbie sales were up 12% compared to a year ago. And the company's iconic Hot Wheels line of cars posted a sales increase of 9%, hitting its highest level in the company's history.  The news is especially good considering the doom and gloom surrounding the industry following the demise of Toys \"R\" Us.  It also comes at a time when Mattel is trying to morph into an entertainment company. Mattel just named Disney Channel veteran Adam Bonnett to lead its own TV efforts. Mattel also has deals with Warner Bros. for a live action Hot Wheels film, along with a Barbie movie with Margot Robbie. (Warner Bros. and CNN are both owned by AT&T.;) Rival Hasbro (HAS) will report earnings Friday morning.","116":"  So much for a trade deal with China happening before next month?  Stocks fell sharply Thursday after Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, suggested that the US and China weren't close to a new trade pact. The Dow plunged more than 350 points in late morning trading. \"The president has indicated that he's optimistic with respect to a potential trade deal,\" Kudlow said on Fox Business. \"But we've got a pretty sizable distance to go here.\" It was the latest case of good cop-bad cop in the Trump administration with regards to  China.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who will be heading to Beijing next week to conduct more trade talks, has been more optimistic about a deal getting done before a March 2 deadline. Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday that the administration has had \"productive talks\" with China.","117":"With the Brexit deadline rapidly approaching, Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put said he's concerned about a potential \"no deal\" between the European Union and Britain.  He told First Move anchor Julia Chatterley if that happens, there will be a disruption to the flow of Mondelez's products because 50% of what it sells in the United Kingdom is produced in Europe and vice-versa.  \"If it's a hard Brexit, that leads to tariffs and potentially the devaluation of the British pound,\" causing higher prices and inflation. He also said that the middle class needs to be paid more because their unhappiness has led to disruptions like Brexit and the yellow jacket protests in France. ","118":"A potential economic slowdown isn't scaring Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put.  He told First Move anchor Julia Chatterley the US consumer is feeling \"pretty good\" and said the Oreo-maker's sales are strong, growing 7% last year.  Van de Put said he's a \"little bit worried about the consumer not feeling that confident of the future.\" He said the company isn't currently seeing that and is \"bullish\" about the US economy. Mondelez will increase the price of its products by 2% over the next year, but Van de Put doesn't expect that will hurt sales.  \"We feel the consumer has a connection to the brand and a slight price increase is not going to break the confidence they have in us,\" he said. He's also feeling \"quite good\" about Mondelez's business in China, pointing to the popularity of regional products like wasabi-flavored Oreos.  ","119":"US markets all opened sharply lower Thursday. BB&T; (BBT) and SunTrust (STI), two of the largest US regional banks, soared 6% and 12%, respectively, after they announced plans to merge. The $66 billion combination will make them the sixth largest bank in the country based on assets and deposits. Tapestry (TPR), the fashion company that owns Coach and Kate Spade, plunged 17% after it missed Wall Street estimates. Twitter (TWTR) fell 8% after the company reported that it is losing millions of users.","120":"Shares of Coach-owner Tapestry (TPR) are down 17%. The company, which also owns Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, missed on earnings and lowered its full-year guidance. Declining sales at Kate Spade is a particularly big problem for Tapestry. Same-store sales sunk 11%, and the brand's revenue dropped slightly compared to the same period a year ago. Sales at Coach rose 1% for the quarter, but missed analysts' expectations.  Today's losses wipes out the company's gains for the year: ","121":" Lyft and Uber are competing over who goes public first. Lyft \"will pull out all the stops to go before Uber,\" Christopher Zook, founder and chairman of CAZ Investments, told CNN Business from the sidelines of the Cayman Alternative Investment Summit in Grand Cayman. Zook, whose Houston investment firm owns a $49 million stake in Lyft, said the company wants to score all of the media coverage that will surely accompany the first US ride-sharing company to pull off an IPO. He predicted Lyft will go public between April and June.  In December, Lyft filed a confidential IPO proposal to the SEC. Zook is very impressed with Lyft's management, though he conceded there's always a risk of distraction when companies go public. \"Will they keep their eye on the ball?\" he asked.  The Uber-Lyft rivalry will be here for a long time to come, Zook predicted.  \"This is going to be a Coke vs. Pepsi situation,\" he said. ","122":" Cool video games like Fortnite are incredibly popular -- and so are $100 headsets that deliver the best gaming audio experience. Turtle Beach, the company that makes the popular Stealth line of high end headphones geared for the gaming market, said Thursday it was expecting its fourth-quarter sales to be up nearly 40% from a  year ago. That's more than what Wall Street was expecting and it helped push shares of Turtle Beach (HEAR) up 6% in early trading. The company said in a press release that it finished 2018 with a nearly 50% share of the North American headset market. That's a big reason why the stock soared more than 750% last year. And as long as gamers are still doing The Floss and other wacky dances on Fortnite, it looks like there may be no end in sight for the company's growth. Shares are already up another 20% this year.

The S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq both closed slightly higher, up about 0.1%, after trending lower for most of the day. It was the seventh straight week of gains for all three. Video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) jumped 16% after touting the strong debut for its Apex Legends game. Tire manufacturer Goodyear (GT) was the worst performer in the S&P; 500, falling 9% after reporting weak results.","124":"Video game maker Electronic Arts badly needs a hit to compete with the Fortnite juggernaut. It might just have one. Shares of Electronic Arts (EA) surged nearly 15% Friday after the head of the company's Respawn Entertainment subsidiary tweeted about huge numbers for its new Apex Legends multiplayer \"battle royale\" game.  Ten million players in three days is an impressive feat. If Apex Legends can continue to gain momentum, that would be great news for EA. Fortnite has crushed the traditional gamers lately.

Lu said that about 40,000 people per year die due to car accidents -- and more than 90% of accidents are due to driver error.  Ford recently announced plans to have a driverless car in commercial operation in 2021. The vehicles will be \"fully autonomous,\" operating without a steering wheel, gas pedal or brake pedal.

The Dow fell roughly 180 points, or 0.7%. The index is now below 25,000 and is solidly down for the week \u2014 its first negative week since before Christmas. The S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq both moved lower. If Friday\u2019s selloff continues, it would be the market\u2019s third straight day of losses. Stocks closed slightly lower Wednesday, and plunged Thursday on suggestions that the United States and China aren\u2019t close to a trade deal. Toy company Mattel is still up about 22% after it said its Barbie and Hot Wheels franchises performed well in the last quarter. Rival Hasbro slumped 4%.

Murray fondly recalled that Morgan Stanley (MS) had a cordial relationship with its regulators during the 1980s when she worked there. But that link broke down after the 2008 financial crisis, which was caused in part by lax regulation.  \"I've heard people whine quite a bit about regulation. If we step back and think about why we're in this position, we only have ourselves to blame,\" she said.

He tweeted that something is broken with the agency:  This is his second response since the SEC asked a judge yesterday to hold Musk in contempt\u00a0for violating a settlement deal reached with the powerful regulator last year. He earlier cited a Tesla earnings transcript about production numbers. Musk said in September that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share.

Although Musk corrected his mistake, regulators scolded Tesla's billionaire CEO because he \"once again published inaccurate and material information about Tesla to his over 24 million Twitter followers,\" according to court papers filed Monday.  The SEC noted that he did not ask for or receive company approval before publishing his tweet.

The company reported holiday sales that missed forecasts and also issued a tepid outlook for the next quarter. Shares of Electronic Arts (EA) plunged more than 10% in after hours trading Tuesday. EA CEO Andrew Wilson was unusually blunt about the company's recent struggles. He said in the earnings release that it was a \"difficult quarter for Electronic Arts and we did not perform to our expectations.\"  Competition from hot mobile games and multiplayer action titles like the insanely popular Fortnite is hurting EA. Wilson said \"the video game industry continues to grow through a year of intense competition and transformational change,\" while EA COO and CFO Blake Jorgensen noted that it was \"a tumultuous year in the video game industry.\u201d  Shares of Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), which will report its latest earnings Wednesday morning, fell after hours too.

Disney (DIS) reported sales and earnings that topped Wall Street's forecasts for the latest quarter. That's despite the fact that box office revenue plunged 27% from a year ago, largely due to the lack of a new movie about Jedi Masters and the Force. (\"The Last Jedi\" helped lift Disney in the final three months of 2017.) So how did Disney wind up beating expectations? The House of Mouse posted solid growth at its TV networks and theme parks. Disney said that its Disney-branded channels helped lift the cable unit, offsetting continued weakness at ESPN. And a boom in political ad spending helped ABC's sales and profit. Disney also got a lift from its theme park unit, with increased tourist spending at its US theme parks and Hong Kong Disneyland. Shares of Disney rose nearly 2% in after hours trading on the news.

Shares of Boeing (BA) rose nearly 3% Tuesday and closed at a new all-time high of above $410 after the jet maker announced a partnership with supersonic plane maker Aerion.  Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Boeing said it made \"made a significant investment\" in Aerion to help it develop new technology for ridiculously fast business travel.  Aerion's AS2 plane will be able to travel at 1,000 miles per hour \u2014 70% faster than current business jets. That will cut about three hours off the time of a transatlantic flight. Aerion has said it expects the first flight to take place in 2023.  Boeing's investment could help the company take even more market share from European rival Airbus. Boeing's stock has already soared 26% this year because of strong earnings, making it the best performer in the Dow. ","154":"Retail sales will grow between 3.8% and 4.4% this year, industry group National Retail Federation (NRF) estimated on Tuesday. That's down slightly from the 4.6% increase in sales in 2018, the group said.   But NRF said that retailers remain in a strong position, despite the volatile stock market and ongoing trade war with China. \"We believe the underlying state of the economy is sound,\" said NRF CEO Matthew Shay, pointing to low unemployment, rising wages, and high consumer confidence. Companies like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have gotten a boost from low interest rates and a drop in gas prices. Shay cautioned, however, that increasing tariffs on Chinese goods or future government shutdowns could damage retail.

He told First Move anchor Julia Chatterley that investors are finally taking notice of an issue they previously brushed aside.   For example, the number of children out-earning their parents continues to decline. \"The trend is not your friend there,\" Slok said. Slok pointed that the world has experienced chasms over the frustration caused by inequality, including Brexit, yellow vests protests in France and the rise of populism.  Those and other issues, including a decline in the rate of home ownership, change \"the economic agenda very significantly,\" Slok said. ","156":" The US stock market hasn't been this high since early December. All three major indexes are trading at two-month highs.  The broad rally was led by consumer stocks.

A series of reports painted a mixed picture about the health of the US economy. While US housing starts unexpectedly plunged in December, US consumer confidence rebounded strongly in February.

Bureau of Competition Director Bruce Hoffman said the task force was not created in response to any specific merger and declined to name any specific transactions that it plans to review. But he did mention that it will investigate tech firms that acquire smaller competitors to limit the threat they pose to their business. That's what Facebook was been accused of doing with its 2012 acquisition of Instagram, for example. \u201cTechnology markets, which are rapidly evolving and touch so many other sectors of the economy, raise distinct challenges for antitrust enforcement,\u201d said Hoffman, who will oversee the task force.

The pizza company's quarterly results broadly missed Wall Street's expectations, sending shares of the company down about 7% before the market opened Thursday.  US same-store sales popped 3.6% at company-owned stores and 5.7% at franchises in the last three months of 2018.  But Wall Street analysts expected better performance on both counts. They were looking on average for 6.6% growth in company-owned stores and a 7.25% spike for franchises, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Domino's net income came in at $111.6 million for the quarter, about 19.6%more than the same period the previous year. The company's earnings per share also fell short of expectations.  Competition among Domino's, Pizza Hut and Papa John's is fierce, and the earnings results may signal that Domino's is struggling to stay competitive.  Last month, Domino's introduced a promotion which rewards customers for buying pizza, even from a competitor, in an attempt to show off its digital capabilities and get new customers to try its food.  The \"points for pies\" program is an \"example of how we do things a bit differently,\" said CEO Richard Allison during a call with analysts on Thursday. He added that the program has been a good way to make news and raise customer engagement with the brand.  Meanwhile, Pizza Hut announced plans to expand its beer delivery program and Papa John's launched a new tuition reimbursement program for employees that could help brighten its tarnished reputation.

Sales at stores open at least a year fell 7% during the company's most recent quarter, parent company L Brands (LB) said on Wednesday.  Despite a strong economy and consumers spending at stores like Walmart and Best Buy, Victoria's Secret struggled to draw customers during the holidays. The company's profit during the quarter fell compared to last year. That signaled that L Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works, resorted to discounting to clear out inventory.  But even deep discounts were not enough to drive traffic. The difficult holiday period is the latest mark of a brand in turmoil. In November, the brand's CEO resigned. Last month, its annual fashion show sunk to its weakest ratings ever. Victoria's Secret's path to a turnaround looks challenging too. L Brands' forecast for 2019 disappointed Wall Street, sending its stock down 5%  after-hours. L Brands will provide a clearer picture of its future on Thursday, when it hosts an earnings call with analysts. Competition in the lingerie industry has increased in recent years. Startups like Adore Me and ThirdLove have broken Victoria's Secret's grip on the industry\u00a0by selling better-fitting bras and using inclusive advertising.  Big retailers threaten Victoria's Secret, too. Target (TGT) launched a new bra and underwear brand for women and teenage girls called\u00a0Auden on Monday. Auden bras will cost $22 and under. Lululemon (LULU) and Walmart (WMT) have also expanded their efforts in the space. Although marketing trends in lingerie have shifted, Victoria's Secret has mostly stuck to the same playbook that helped it dominate the industry: push-up bras and celebrity models. \"People identify Victoria's Secret with what's it been for the last 20 years \u2014 very sexy and airbrushed models,\" she said. \"If they were going to pivot now, I don't think it would come off as authentic. They don't have a great option.\" ","185":"  Monster Beverages (MNST) reported a 14% surge in net sales in the last three months of 2018 compared to the same period in the previous year.

Health insurers fell sharply after House Democrats released a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill that would eliminate most private health insurance. UnitedHealth (UNH) dropped 5%, while Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) declined 4% apiece.  Markets were also pressured by cautious comments from US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The administration\u2019s trade chief told lawmakers the issues are \u201ctoo serious\u201d to be resolved by China\u2019s promises to purchase more US agricultural products.

Traders feared Saudi Arabia could be forced to back off its strategy: boost prices by cutting production. Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of OPEC, doesn't appear to be flinching though.  OPEC and its allies, he said, \"have taken a very slow and measured approach.\" Al Falih added that Saudi Arabia is \"unshaken\" in its focus on bringing supply and demand in balance by reducing swelling oil inventories.  Those comments helped lift US oil prices 2.6% to $56.94 a barrel on Wednesday. The oil market was also helped by a new report showing a surprise plunge in US oil stockpiles. The oil rally sent a jolt through energy stocks, with Concho Resources (CXO), Apache (APA) and ExxonMobil (XOM) all rising.

US stocks slid on Lighthizer\u2019s comments, with the Dow down as much as 150 points. Lighthizer said the process is under way for the Trump administration to update the Federal Register notice before the March 1 deadline soon so that tariffs don\u2019t escalate from 10% to 25% on $200 billion of goods. Additionally, when asked about whether a currency deal with China had been ironed out, Lighthizer says, \u201cThere\u2019s no agreement on that until there's an agreement on everything,\" he says. \"We've spent a lot of time on currency and it will be enforceable.\" He also described the deal with China as a \u201cbinding agreement\u201d but have no intention to submit it to Congress.  \"This is a settlement of a 301 action...we're not changing any tariff lines. We're not using TPA,\u201d he said.  \"This is not a free trade agreement,\u201d says Lighthizer. \u201cMy scope is narrow here, it\u2019s based on 301.\u201d\u00a0","189":" Elon Musk is at it again on Twitter. Even though the SEC is asking a judge to hold Musk in contempt after he recently tweeted (and then corrected) information about vehicle sales. Musk cryptically tweeted early Thursday morning that the company will have some news to share in California on Thursday at 5 pm ET. It's hard to know whether Musk will announce something truly newsworthy or if this is just another way for Musk to poke fun at the SEC, which he called \"embarrassing\" in a tweet (naturally) earlier this week. He has also previously referred to the agency as the \"Shortseller Enrichment Commission.\" Musk also curiously changed the name on his Twitter handle to Elon Tusk and added an elephant emoji to it. And his photo now shows a picture of Mars with an arrow pointing to part of the planet with the word \"Revive\" above it. It's all very confusing. But investors may be brushing it off as Elon being Elon. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose nearly 5% Wednesday. ","190":"  Campbell Soup (CPB) stock shot up more than 9% Wednesday after the company beat its earnings expectations and reiterated its 2019 guidance of earnings per share between $2.40 to $2.50 after its divestitures. Net sales in the three months ending in January grew 24% compared to the same period the previous year, aided by Snyder\u2019s-Lance and Pacific Foods, both of which Campbell recently acquired.  The results were a far cry from Kraft Heinz's disastrous day last week. Still, some analysts think Campbell could face trouble down the line.  Campbell's margins fell during the three months ending in January because of cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, among other reasons. Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said that investors will have to keep an eye out for lower margins going forward.

Despite the enthusiasm on Wall Street, Tusa kept his $6 price target on GE. That implies a 44% plunge from current levels.  However, Tusa is bullish on GE boss Larry Culp, the first outsider CEO in the company's storied history. \"We love Larry. I think Larry is a phenomenal CEO,\" Tusa told CNBC.","193":" (CNN)New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Saturday morning that \"our gun laws will change\" following the mass shooting at two Christchurch mosques that left 49 people dead. \"There were five guns used by the primary perpetrator,\" she said at a news conference in Wellington. \"There were two semi-automatic weapons and two shotguns. The offender was in possession of a gun license. I'm advised this was acquired in November of 2017. A lever-action firearm was also found.\" She said the suspect, identified as Brenton Tarrant, obtained a gun license in November 2017 and began purchasing guns legally in December 2017. \"While work is being done as to the chain of events that lead to both the holding of this gun license and the possession of these weapons, I can tell you one thing right now. Our gun laws will change.\" Ardern said. Nation's last mass shooting 3 decades ago Until Friday, the biggest massacre in the country's history happened 30 years ago, when a man named David Gray went on a shooting rampage, killing 13 people. Following that attack, the nation's gun laws -- which were first passed in 1983 -- came under scrutiny. The ensuing debate led to a 1992 amendment on the regulation of military-style semi-automatic firearms. Despite those laws, New Zealand's weapons legislation is considered more relaxed than most Western countries outside of the USA. Gun owners do need a license but they aren't required to register their guns -- unlike in neighboring Australia.  While authorities do not know exactly how many legally or illegally owned firearms are currently in circulation in New Zealand, estimates put the number at about 1.2 million, according to New Zealand Police. This figure equates to about one gun for every three people -- a rate that is considered high when compared with Australia, which has 3.15 million guns, approximately one for every eight people. That said, gun-inflicted fatalities remain relatively low in New Zealand. The number of gun homicides per year in the decade up to 2015 was in the dozens, according to figures compiled by the University of Sydney. This equated to an annual rate of about one death per 100,000 people -- in contrast to the United States, which had 12 deaths per 100,000 people in 2017.  Potential gun owners in New Zealand must be over the age of 16 and pass a police background check, according to GunPolicy.org and its founder Professor Philip Alpers.  According to Alpers, New Zealand firearm legislation has remained substantially unaltered since 1992. Five years later retired High Court judge Thomas Thorp's year-long Review of Firearms Control in New Zealand (1997) recommended major changes, among them that all firearms be individually registered; that restricted weapons like privately held machine guns be permanently disabled; and for a buy-back of military-style semi-automatic weapons.  Alpers, who is based at the University of Sydney but originally from New Zealand, told CNN: \"Not one of these measures has been addressed by legislation. Government has since considered a range of similar recommendations, but special interest groups prevent meaningful change.\" In 79 countries surveyed by the United Nations, firearm registration is the accepted norm and a cornerstone of gun control, according to GunPolicy.org. Among developed nations, New Zealand's decision not to register 96% of civilian firearms makes it a stand-out exception, alone with the United States and Canada, Alpers said. Weapons legislation in Australia Gun laws in Australia were tightened following a 1996 mass shooting in which 35 people were killed by a lone gunman in Port Arthur, Tasmania. Within two weeks, Australian lawmakers banned rapid-fire rifles and shotguns and introduced tighter laws governing ownership of other weapons. New applicants must undergo thorough background checks and present a \"justifiable reason\" for ownership -- with self defense not applicable. The laws have had a dramatic effect on the frequency of mass shootings, as well as homicides. In the years after the Port Arthur massacre, the risk of dying by gunshot in Australia fell by more than 50% -- and stayed there.  A 2012 study by Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University also found the two nationwide, federally funded gun buybacks and voluntary surrenders of firearms led to a drop in firearm suicide rates of almost 80% in the following decade. Using those measures, Australia collected and destroyed more than a million firearms, perhaps a third of the national stock, according to Alpers. The national government also banned the importation of new automatic and semiautomatic weapons. And the buyback was paid for by a special one-off tax on all Australians. The gun lobby is \"small but very strong,\" in New Zealand, according to Alpers. He told CNN: \"They are very vocal and have managed to foil every attempt to tighten the gun laws since 1992. It's a powerful little lobby group, whereas the gun lobby in Australia had its back broken by the Port Arthur massacre.  \"In New Zealand the gun lobby has gone from strength to strength and has dominated policy advice to the police and government.\" That said, Alpers believes things will now have to change. He told CNN: \"It's always a terrible surprise when this sort of thing happens. You can never predict where it's going to happen. The most common comment you get from people when this sort of thing happens is that they never thought it could happen here and that's how the people of Christchurch must be feeling.\"  Despite the relatively lax controls, \"guns are rarely used in the way they are in the US so to New Zealanders this will be a tremendous shock,\" said Alpers. He added: \"It has shocked the country to the core and I can't imagine any country less likely to let this slide.\" New Zealand police support carrying guns New Zealand police officers are not routinely armed, but recent figures suggest more officers are in favor of carrying guns.  A 2017 survey from the New Zealand Police Association showed that that 66% of its members support arming officers, according to TVNZ. That figure has significantly increased from a decade ago, when 48% of officers supported general arming in 2008. New Zealand also has a low murder rate, with a total of 35 homicides in 2017 -- fewer than the number of people who died in Friday's double mosque attack. Iain Overton, author of \"Gun Baby Gun\" and executive director of London-based charity Action on Armed Violence, told CNN: \"The gun laws of New Zealand are not that contentious and fit into broad line with many other nations, with one exception -- the reported permission to use, albeit with a special permit, pistols, semi-automatic weapons and machine guns.  \"Many European nations outlaw semi-automatic weapons full stop, and the UK -- for example -- bans handguns, except under exceptional and rare circumstances. The possible, more concerning issue is the ubiquity of firearm ownership in New Zealand -- with as many as 1.5 million guns there.   \"People may cite that as many as one in three New Zealanders will be gun owners based on this, but this would be wrong. Gun owners often have multiple weapons, so it is likely that it is a smaller group of rural gun owners holding the most guns there. The presence of so many guns, though, in a small nation raises challenges when it comes to over-burdening a police force with regulation.\"","194":"New York (CNN Business)The biggest comeback kid on Wall Street is 126 years old. General Electric's (GE) stock price has spiked 67% since crashing to $6.45 in mid-December. The staggering rally reflects a sense that the crisis phase at GE is finally over. CEO Larry Culp, who took the job in October, has impressed investors by moving with a sense of urgency to raise gobs of cash that can be used to pay the mountain of debt he inherited.  \"GE is making rapid progress in its transformation plan,\" CFRA analyst Jim Corridore wrote in a report Monday. Up 47% so far this year, GE is the fourth-best stock in the S&P 500 in 2019. That's a far cry from last year, when it was in such a nosedive that it got kicked out of the exclusive Dow Jones Industrial Average.  \"We are doing everything in our power to return GE to a position of strength,\" Culp wrote in his inaugural annual shareholder letter on Wednesday. GE, which makes everything from light bulbs to jet engines, has been blasted by analysts in the past for buying businesses at high prices and then selling them for much less. That buy high, sell-low history has come back to haunt GE. The company's stock price collapsed by 75% between the end of 2016 and last year. However, GE is suddenly getting credit for smart dealmaking. No fire sale Wall Street applauded GE's decision to sell part \u2014 but not all \u2014 of its healthcare division. That's a shift from GE's earlier plan to say goodbye to the profitable and cash-rich business, likely through an IPO.  GE said Monday it would unload its BioPharma unit to Danaher (DHR), Culp's former company. The sale raised $21.4 billion, or roughly seven times the unit's annual revenue. That's a rich price and gives GE yet more ammo to clean up the balance sheet.  \"GE is thinking creatively and intelligently about how to restructure,\" Corridore wrote.  GE has signaled that the breathing room created by the BioPharma sale will allow the company to put off an IPO of the profitable healthcare division.  For now, GE will hold onto the remaining business, which makes imaging equipment like MRI machines and diagnostics products. The deal puts \"us on better footing to consider the right option\" for GE Healthcare \"over time,\" Culp wrote. In other words, no fire sale.  \"By shelving the IPO, GE keeps a fairly high cash conversion business in the portfolio, at least for now, and allows for a more opportunistic exit,\" Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote in a report to clients.  Dismantling GE to raise cash The BioPharma sale is just the latest in a series of major moves Culp has announced since becoming CEO. Perhaps most importantly, GE slashed its long-cherished dividend to a penny late last year \u2014 a move that will save it $4 billion each year. Culp acknowledged in his shareholder letter that it was a \"painful but necessary\" step.  GE is also speeding up its divorce from oil-and-gas giant Baker Hughes (BHGE), a retreat that will raise another $4 billion or so.  GE raised another $1.5 billion by selling a GE Capital portfolio of healthcare equipment leases and loans.  This week GE also completed the spinoff of its century old railroad division to Wabtec (WAB). The deal raised $2.9 billion in cash and gave GE a 24.9% stake in the new company, which is already dealing with a massive strike.  GE is still worth less than $100 billion Of course, GE's recent rebound is little comfort to the company's long-suffering shareholders.  Once America's most valuable company with a value of $400 billion, GE's market capitalization is just $93 billion today.  GE's rebound has no doubt been helped by the buoyant mood in financial markets this year. Investors have piled into a wide range of risky assets, including everything from crude oil and junk bonds to Snap (SNAP) and yes, GE. Some believe the GE comeback is overdone. Big time. \"It has gone way too far,\" JPMorgan Chase analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr. told CNBC on Wednesday.  Tusa, who correctly went negative on GE years ago, warned that the company's power and financial divisions still face serious challenges that will take a long time to fix. He kept his $6 price target on GE, implying a decline of more than 40% from current levels. \"The math is the math,\" Tusa said.  GE will give out more numbers to crunch March 14. That's when Culp will host a highly anticipated conference call and give GE's outlook.  The 2019 figures that GE will pencil in won't be pretty. Power is still a mess. And GE Capital is still draining the company of cash.  But Wall Street is betting that Culp has successfully pulled GE back from the brink.","195":"New York (CNN Business)Washington's attacks on stock buybacks haven't scared away Corporate America. Buybacks by corporate clients of Bank of America Merrill Lynch have spiked 91% to $12.2 billion so far this year, the firm said in a report this week.  Completed stock repurchases surged last week to their fourth-highest weekly level since Bank of America began tracking the metric in 2009.  Taken together, Bank of America said buybacks are \"on pace for another record year\" in 2019.  Corporations, not retail investors or large institutions, appear to be the driving force behind the sharp rebound on Wall Street this year.  Coca-Cola (KO) announced plans on Thursday to repurchase another 150 million shares \u2014 worth about $7 billion at the current stock price.  Companies are supporting the market rally Excluding corporate buybacks, Bank of America said its clients have sold individual stocks for the last two weeks.  Last week, just two of the 11 major sectors of the stock market experienced inflows if buybacks are excluded, the bank said.  It's a fresh reminder of how much the decade-long bull market has relied on companies themselves to be a major source of demand.  Although corporate clients of Bank of America bought $12.2 billion of stock so far in 2019, hedge funds have only acquired $363 million. Excluding ETFs, hedge funds have been net sellers of $2.7 billion of equities. Institutions, including pension funds, and retail investors have likewise been net sellers despite the rebound in stocks. Both groups have unloaded about $2.4 billion of equities. Buyback announcements did slow a bit during earnings season. US companies announced $5.8 billion of buybacks per day, down 35% from a year ago, according to TrimTabs Investment Research.   Announcements were concentrated in just two companies: Union Pacific (UNP), which announced plans to repurchase $22.4 billion of stock, and Cisco Systems (CSCO), which announced an additional $15 billion of buybacks.  Should buybacks be limited? The steady drumbeat of buybacks comes despite the political backlash against the tactic. Many Democrats and at least one major Republican have expressed concern that US companies aren't investing enough of their windfall from the 2017 tax cut into job-creating investments.  Although Corporate America announced $1 trillion of stock buybacks in 2018, the tax law has yet to inspire a lasting boom in business spending on things like factories, software and new equipment. \"Corporate boardrooms have become obsessed with maximizing only shareholder earnings to the detriment of workers and the long-term strength of their companies,\" Senators Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed earlier this month. The lawmakers argued that Congress should limit stock buybacks \u2014 a move that some believe would be short-sighted. \"If they've got nothing to do with the money, get it out of there,\" David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, told CNN Business' Julia Chatterley. \"I'm afraid we're trying to lock money into corporations, force them to do things with their money things they wouldn't otherwise do.\" But the backlash has gone bipartisan. Republican Senator Marco Rubio recently called for ending the tax advantages that share buybacks enjoy over dividends.  \"We have too often failed to make the well-being of working Americans the terms for market success,\" Rubio wrote in a report.","196":" (CNN)After seven years of drought, elated cattle farmers in the Australian state of Queensland welcomed the rainstorms heading their way as a blessing.  Warning: This story contains graphic images But now, after one of the most devastating deluges in state history, a billion-dollar industry could be left in tatters.  Authorities estimate that nearly 500,000 cattle -- worth about $213 million (AU$300 million) -- have been killed by flooding in Queensland's north since the rain began falling late last month, CNN affiliate Seven News reported.    The downpours have ended but the cattle carcasses remain, baking in the record-breaking summer heat. If not buried or burned, they will pose a health hazard. Video taken from overhead at one location shows scores of dead cattle huddled together amid the devastation.  \"People have gone through drought, they have come out of years and years of drought, and they have now gone smack-bang into a natural disaster the likes of which no one out there has seen before,\" Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. But cattle farmers and industry lobbyists say the worst could be yet to come.  One of the farmers affected, Rachel Anderson, says she lost an estimated 2,000 cattle in the floods and more are still dying from pneumonia from the cold rain and wind.  \"Some cattle are still quite weak from enduring the many days of rain and not able to access feed,\" Anderson, who has five children and owns a farm at Eddington Station near Julia Creek in western Queensland, told CNN.  Anderson said her family was already in a lot of debt from hand feeding cattle during the long drought. Now, the devastating floods is putting even more strain on the household.  \"We can't borrow any more money as we have nothing as equity as we have lost our cattle and income for the next two to four years,\" she said.  \"This will see a massive collapse of our industry. It will have an economic impact on our trade with other nations as a lot of our cattle is sold to overseas markets either by live export or by packaged beef products.\" Australia's beef industry is one of the country's biggest economic drivers, with exports in 2017 worth $5.3 billion (AU$7.4 billion). About $6.1 billion (AU$8.6 billion)  worth of beef was consumed domestically from July 2017 until June 2018, according to trade group Meat & Livestock Australia.  But farmers like Anderson are also in a state of emotional and psychological shock after losing the cattle.  \"We are so saddened by the suffering the animals went through with the flood, wind and rain,\" Anderson said. \"Some were washed away in the floods. They now hang in trees, fences, bridges, railway lines. They piled in corners to huddle together to get out of the wind and rain but ended up trampling each other. These images are hard to see.\" The CEO of rural production advocate Agforce Queensland, Michael Guerin, described the flooding as a \"humanitarian crisis\" and \"a disaster of unprecedented proportion.\"  \"The speed and intensity of the unfolding tragedy makes it hard to believe that it's just a week since farmers' elation at receiving the first decent rains in five years turned to horror at the devastating and unprecedented flood that quickly followed,\" he said.  \"Although we won't know the full extent of the livestock losses and infrastructure damage until the water fully recedes, it is certain that the industry will take decades to recover.\" Many of the cattle that survived can't be reached since roads aren't passable yet. Authorities have resorted to air drops to provide feed, but the affected areas are so vast they may not be able to reach all the animals in need.  Georgie Somerset, the general president of Agforce Queensland, said on Tuesday that \"we're literally ferrying one barrel of hay at a time to feed the stock that we can find.\"  Many cattle farmers are bracing for major losses. The Queensland government is providing emergency hardship assistance to those affected. Farmers are eligible for grants up to $53,000 but may need more to rebuild herds. Cattle farmer Jodi Keough told Seven News she expected to lose half her herd, adding that if authorities do nothing \"we're talking about a possible collapse of a primary industry in Australia.\"  Meanwhile, one person has died from a soil-borne bacterial disease after the flood waters receded from the regional center of Townsville, Dr. Julie Mudd from the local health unit told reporters. Another seven have been hospitalized, she said.","197":"Washington (CNN)In the months since Patrick Shanahan became acting defense secretary following the departure of James Mattis, President Donald Trump has repeatedly praised the former Boeing executive. Yet Shanahan's relationship with his former employer has emerged as a point of controversy that could pose challenges if he's nominated to permanently lead the Pentagon. That controversy got more heated on Wednesday, when the Pentagon's inspector general's office announced an investigation into complaints that Shanahan has promoted Boeing and disparaged its competitors.  The investigation comes in the immediate aftermath of the Boeing 737 Max 8 crash in Ethiopia, which has prompted a closer examination of the relationship between the company and the federal government. Shanahan has largely avoided scrutiny from the crash. Although he served as general manager of Boeing's commercial airplane programs, he did not lead the 737 Max's development program. The ethics accusations leveled by the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington accuse Shanahan of violating his signed ethics agreement by praising Boeing during discussions of government contracts in his current position and criticizing the company's competitors. A Pentagon spokesman said Shanahan welcomes the inspector general's investigation and that he has always upheld his ethics agreement.  But an aide to Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CNN if Shanahan were nominated for the permanent job, the committee couldn't move forward in bipartisan manner until the inspector general's investigation is completed.  Although Shanahan has recused himself from Boeing-related matters, his ascension to the top of the Pentagon marks an unprecedented moment in which a decades-long executive for a top defense contractor occupies ultimate influence over government programs that rely on defense contracts.   Shanahan spent 31 years at Boeing before officially joining the Pentagon in July 2017. That has stoked concerns over the potential for impropriety, particularly as the defense budget swells to near-record levels and the Pentagon implements expensive new initiatives such as Space Force. Much of that new money will be spent on contracts signed with the country's top defense contractors, including Boeing, the second biggest defense contractor in the country. \"He may not be directly negotiating contracts, but he now directs overall policy. Boeing provides so many services for DOD, so I don't see how Shanahan can pull back from all decisions that could potentially affect those issues,\" said William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy.  Shanahan was originally nominated to work at the Pentagon in June 2017 as deputy secretary under Mattis. Though Shanahan had no military and little foreign policy experience, Mattis brought him in to handle internal reform and budget issues. To avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest, Shanahan divested stocks in more than a dozen defense contract companies, including Boeing. But a review of his financial disclosures shows that Shanahan still makes money from the company. He continues to receive about $218,000 annually from a Boeing retirement plan, which Shanahan said is permitted under his ethics agreement. The disclosures also show that he earned roughly $19 million in income from various Boeing stock sales, payouts and awards as he separated from the company to enter the Pentagon. Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said in a statement, \"Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan welcomes the Inspector General's review of the complaint filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\" \"Acting Secretary Shanahan has at all times remained committed to upholding his ethics agreement filed with the DoD. This agreement ensures any matters pertaining to Boeing are handled by appropriate officials within the Pentagon to eliminate any perceived or actual conflict of interest issue with Boeing,\" Buccino added. The Defense Department's inspector general has not yet concluded whether a violation occurred, according to a US defense official.  The official told CNN Wednesday that the IG precisely chose to use the word investigation because there is enough credible initial information beyond the complaint filed by CREW to warrant a probe into whether Shanahan violated his ethics agreement. Since 2009, Boeing has ranked second behind Lockheed Martin on a list of the top 100 U.S. government contractors, earning an average of about $22 billion a year through contracts, according to Federal Procurement Data System data. Boeing boasted record revenue in 2018 in part due to its defense contracts, according to a January press release.  Boeing announced Wednesday a long-planned Navy contract worth $4 billion for 78 upgraded F\/A-18 jets. The contract would likely not have made it to the secretary of defense level for approval. Shanahan previously managed some of Boeing's departments that seek such contracts. He was vice president and general manager of Boeing's Missile Defense Systems and also served as vice president and general manager of Boeing's Rotorcraft Systems, where he oversaw facilities that produce military aircraft like the V-22 Osprey and Apache helicopters. Prior administrations have also appointed individuals with defense-industry experience as senior Pentagon officials. Gordon England worked at General Dynamics before becoming deputy secretary of defense under President George W. Bush. William Lynn, who lobbied for Raytheon, was appointed deputy secretary of defense under President Barack Obama. But Mandy Smithberger, director of the military reform program at the Project on Government Oversight's Center for Defense Information, said Shanahan is the first secretary of defense whose experience is almost exclusively rooted in the defense industry, and she argues that his former employer Boeing has a unique level of government influence. A Project on Government Oversight report she compiled found that in 2018 Boeing hired more senior government and military officials as executives, directors or lobbyists than other major defense contractors. Smithberger also expressed concerns about a memo Shanahan authored in March 2018, when he was deputy secretary of defense, in which he encouraged Department of Defense officials to communicate more with the defense industry. In the memo titled \"Engaging with industry,\" Shanahan wrote that \"a competitive mindset requires that we optimize our relationships with industry to drive higher performance.\"  Though he stressed the importance of following ethics regulations, Shanahan also wrote that events hosted by industry associations could provide opportunities for military officials \"to efficiently, effectively, and ethically connect\" with industry leaders. \"We think that there is already too much pressure to be cozy with industry, and this confuses what's in the best interests of taxpayers and troops with what's in the best interests of defense-industry profits,\" Smithberger said.  Gordon Johndroe, a spokesperson for Boeing, said in a statement, \"Boeing adheres to and respects Secretary Shanahan's decision to recuse himself from Company matters. We have not spoken to Sec. Shanahan regarding Boeing programs during his entire Pentagon tenure.\" Another Boeing official told CNN the company sees Shanahan's position in the Pentagon as a disadvantage because his recusal means that the company cannot communicate with him about its programs, as other companies can. Despite Shanahan's promised recusal from all things Boeing-related, the late Sen. John McCain expressed discomfort in 2017 during Shanahan's confirmation hearing that he sought to enter the government straight from the defense industry. \"I have to have confidence that the fox is not going to be put back into the henhouse,\" McCain said, later adding, \"I am not overjoyed that you came from one of the corporations.\" Although the Trump administration has pushed for defense budget increases ($750 billion for 2020, up from $716 billion in 2019), Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who analyzes military funding, said Shanahan's current leadership at the helm of the Pentagon should not be interpreted as automatically equaling increased prosperity for defense contractors like Boeing. Harrison said factors such as Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives and questions about how long Shanahan will hold his role inject uncertainty into the defense industry. Sean Kennedy, director of research at Citizens Against Government Waste, a Washington-based nonprofit, said that even if Shanahan actively avoids all issues related to Boeing, his position plays into what he described as a larger trend of former industry executives or lobbyists occupying top government roles. Kennedy added that Shanahan's role \"doesn't really fit the draining-the-swamp narrative President Trump campaigned on.\"","198":"New York (CNN)Most of the baseball caps sold in the United States are made in China, and President Donald Trump's trade war has made them 10% more expensive.  The tariff forced Missouri-based Cap America, a sports embroidery outfit that's bought most of its caps from China since 2001, to make changes. The company is trying out a new supplier in Bangladesh for some orders -- and after eating the full cost of the tariffs for months, CEO Phil Page also decided in January to raise prices on his hats.  Page and business owners across the country are waiting to hear how trade talks between US and Chinese negotiators progress when they meet this week in Beijing.  Trump has threatened to escalate the 10% tariff he's placed on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% if a deal isn't reached. But if talks go well, the tariffs might be lifted altogether. Unlike the oil price embargo of the 1970s, which led to long lines at gas stations, the drama -- and the pain -- of Trump's China trade fight has so far been invisible to most Americans. The consumer price index, which tracks inflation on a basket of consumer goods like food and clothing, actually fell by 0.1 percent in December. The administration strategically put the highest tariffs on imports mostly used in the production of other items, like semiconductors or refrigerators. The latest round, which came later in the year, did include a variety of consumers goods, ranging from luggage to baseball gloves, but the tariff rate is lower.  The duty isn't passed on to consumers if importers or retailers decide to absorb some of the added cost -- which many, like Page, did heading into the holiday season.  In a recent survey by the National Association for Business Economics, 94% of businesses said they have not raised prices because of changes in trade policy. Most haven't delayed hiring or other investments, either.  By many measures, the US economy appears strong. Job creation boomed in January. Manufacturing jobs, specifically, have been growing for two years and wages were up, too.  China's retaliatory tariffs have hit US farmers harder than consumers, prompting the administration to offer aid to soybean, corn, dairy, wheat, cotton, sorghum and pork producers, who received direct payments from the US Department of Agriculture. And China agreed to start buying soybeans again after the last time Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met. Most farmers, though, say the aid payments didn't make them whole.  There are some signs that the tariffs could be starting to have more of an effect on the US economy.  Americans imported less in November for the first time since Trump began putting tariffs on Chinese goods in July, according to a report released last week. More recent data has been delayed because of the government shutdown.  And consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest level of Trump's presidency in January, likely dragged down by trade tensions as well as rising sings of a global economic slowdown, a volatile stock market, and the government shutdown.  Sales were down through the holiday season and January at the Luggage Shop of Lubbock in Texas, where owner Tiffany Zarfas Williams is getting emails from vendors about price increases almost every day now. Backpacks, briefcases and luggage have all been hit with a 10% tariff.  Not only did she have to raise prices, but many of her customers are farmers who are struggling with tariffs on their exports, and she worries they may have less money in their pockets to spend.  \"If we all need to take one for the team, we can weather a 10% increase. But I just want to make sure the tariffs are going to get us to the end goal,\" Zarfas Williams said.  The Trump administration has used the tariffs as a tool to bring Chinese officials to the negotiating table and address what it sees as unfair trade practices, like intellectual property theft from American businesses and forced technology transfers in exchange for doing business in China. The United States has fought China over these issues for years and many in the business community believe they need to be fixed.  \"I think the big difference under the Trump administration is that we've shifted to a more combative US-China relationship,\" said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who served as a senior economist for trade under President George W. Bush. \"They want to isolate China as much as possible,\" he said.  In the meantime, business owners like Cap America's Page are doing their best to work around the uncertainty. Page actually increased his imports from China last year, in an attempt to get ahead of potential new tariffs, and wound up buying a new warehouse to store the extra inventory.   \"It's just difficult to gauge what his administration will do,\" he said. \"They're so unpredictable.\"","199":"New York (CNN)A rough ride for the stock markets at the end of last year battered Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway: It posted a rare net loss of $25 billion for the fourth quarter. Troubles at Kraft Heinz also cut deeply into the investing giant's bottom line. In his annual letter to investors posted Saturday, Buffett said the company took a $3 billion write down last year \"arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz. (KHC)\" The loss was driven by big price declines in Berkshire's investment portfolio, including Apple, (AAPL) which remains its largest holding. Buffett also reiterated his criticism of a new accounting rule that he says over-exaggerate Berkshire's performance by requiring the company to account for short-term stock fluctuations. Wild stock swings in December, the letter says, had Berkshire recording \"several days with a 'profit' or 'loss' of more than $4 billion.\" Overall, the investing giant was $4 billion in the black last year. And Buffett, who is famous for championing long-term performance over quarterly results, urged investors not to forget the forest for the trees. \"Investors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses -- our economic 'trees', so to speak.\"  Its overall portfolio was valued at $173 billion at the end of 2018.  Buffett said Berkshire does not see any potential takeover targets in the coming year \u2014 but the firm is hungry to make an \"elephant-sized acquisition.\"  \"Just writing about the possibility of a huge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar,\" Buffett said. Buybacks A surge in corporate buybacks have been the target of mounting criticism from Washington. But Buffett sung its praises in his annual letter and said that Berkshire will likely be a \"significant repurchaser\" of its own shares. He said he was pleased that many companies that Berkshire has major stakes in are embracing buybacks because they can automatically boost Berkshire's ownership percentage.  Many Democrats and at least one major Republican have expressed concern that US companies aren't investing enough of their windfall from the 2017 tax cut, which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, into job-creating investments. Berkshire received a huge boost from the tax overhaul, and Buffett said the windfall for its investees was a major boon for the company last year.","200":" (CNN)New York Times op-ed columnist and economics writer, David Leonhardt, said the US is still crawing its way back from The Great Recession that began in 2007. \"We have not recovered,\" Leonhardt told David Axelrod on The Axe Files, a podcast from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN.   \"One of the mistakes that we make is looking at some metrics like GDP or the stock market, which have recovered, and pretending that we've recovered from the crisis. But if you look at  what, to me, are more meaningful measures like Americans' net worth, like the percentage of people employed in good jobs, we have not recovered,\" he said.  The effects of the Great Recession, coupled with racism, led to the conditions under which President Donald Trump was elected, he argued.  \"You have a significant number of voters in this country who swung from voting for Barack Obama in 2012 to Donald Trump in 2016 to the Democrats in 2018,\" he said. \"I agree racism plays a role for some voters as well, but I just don't buy this notion ... that it's all racism and only marginally economics. I think it's both.\"  Although he said he worries that voters' frustrations with government could lead them to seek a strongman as leader or simply give up on government entirely, Leonhardt says he retains some optimism.  \"A majority of Americans want the federal government to play a bigger role [in] providing affordable health care. They want a higher minimum wage,\" he said. \"I actually do think on economic matters, there is a progressive, populist majority in this country.\" Leonhardt sees social and cultural issues, not economic issues, as dividing the country into \"half-and-half.\"  \"America is just not as progressive on immigration (or) on abortion as the Democratic Party is,\" he said.  But Leonhardt believes Trump is \"more vulnerable than many people may realize.\" ","201":"New York (CNN Business)Stock buybacks are supposed to benefit all investors of a public company because, in theory, they help boost earnings per share.  But a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission is calling out buybacks as de facto bonuses for corporate executives and says the agency must do more to protect ordinary investors.  SEC commissioner Robert Jackson issued a letter on Wednesday that said the agency has found that insiders sell more stock on days when buybacks are announced than on other trading days. Jackson, a Democrat and NYU Law professor, looked into trends around stock buybacks at the request of Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland. Jackson and Van Hollen were scheduled to discuss the findings with reporters Wednesday, but Jackson was advised by the SEC's general counsel to not participate in a conference call. Van Hollen led the discussion.   But Jackson didn't mince words in his letter. \"When executives unload significant amounts of stock upon announcing a buyback, they often benefit from short-term price pops at the expense of long-term investors,\" he said in the letter. Overall \"insider selling on buybacks is associated with worse long-term performance.\" Jackson spoke with CNN on Wednesday after the scheduled call had ended and put a finer point on the pitfalls of the buyback practices.  \"CEOs don't sell valuable things cheaply,\" he quipped. \"Executives are using buybacks as a way to cash out.\"  He said it doesn't make sense to see companies buy back stock at high prices at the same time that insiders are selling the stock.  Stock buybacks are increasingly coming under fire in Washington. Jackson, who was nominated for the SEC commissioner post by President Donald Trump in September 2017 and was confirmed by the Senate later that year, has been a vocal critic of buybacks for some time. \"On too many occasions, companies doing buybacks have failed to make the long-term investments in innovation or their workforce that our economy so badly needs,\" Jackson said in a speech last June. Van Hollen, along with fellow Democratic senators Tammy Baldwin and Amy Klobuchar, have been critical of buybacks, especially ones made by companies like GM (GM) that are laying off workers despite having cash to repurchase shares.   Two other Democrats, Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders, have proposed a limit on stock buybacks. And Republican senator Marco Rubio wants to put an end to tax advantages for buybacks, saying they should be taxed at the same rate as dividends. Van Hollen, who asked for the SEC review in December, said his biggest problem with the explosion in buyback activity is that companies could and should be doing more productive things with their cash. \"What I am suggesting is that the rules need to be rewritten. This conduct is clearly wrong,\" he said. He said the Senate would introduce legislation in the next few weeks to address the practice.  Many other Republicans, as well as corporate executives, think the buyback backlash is unfair though.  Public companies should be allowed to use excess capital as they see fit, they argue. What's more, many companies that buy back a lot of stock still spend heavily on research and development and wage increases for workers. Tech companies have been particularly fond of buying back their own stock. According to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, Qualcomm (QCOM), Apple (AAPL), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) were among the five largest buyers of their own stock in the third quarter. Other big share repurchasers include giant banks Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) as well as blue chip consumer companies Starbucks (SBUX), Walgreens (WBA), Home Depot (HD) and Walmart (WMT).","202":"New York (CNN Business)Stamps.com says it is ending an exclusive relationship with the US Postal Service, sending shares of its stock plunging more than 50%. The company says Amazon is disrupting the shipping business, and it needs to do shipping deals with postal service competitors going into the future.  Amazon has popularized two-day shipping with its Prime service, and Stamps.com says its customers demand two-day shipping guarantees. FedEx (FDX), UPS (UPS) and DHL offer those guarantees. The Post Office doesn't. \"One of our nonnegotiable items is that ... we will no longer be exclusive to the USPS,\" said CEO Kenneth McBride in a call with analysts on Thursday evening. \"USPS has not agreed to accept these terms or any other terms of our partnership proposal.\" McBride said Stamps.com opted to discontinue its shipping partnership with the Postal Service so it can \"fully embrace partnerships with other carriers who we think will be well positioned to win in the shipping business in the next five years.\" USPS declined to comment on the news. Stamps.com (STMP) will still allow its customers print out stamps, but McBride said that decision to end the exclusive deal will cause \"some short-term pain for us over the next few years.\"  He said that it now expects revenue to fall as much as 8% this year. Analysts forecast had forecast sales would grow by more than 16%. McBride said a key reason why Stamps.com made its decision to end the Postal Service partnership was Amazon (AMZN) publicly stating it will get into the delivery business itself. \"Amazon's track record of disrupting an industry is well established. So their threat should be taken very seriously by every player in the shipping industry,\" he said. \"We are setting our corporate strategy assuming Amazon will be a big global player in shipping.\" Shares in Stamps.com ended the day down 58%.","203":"New York (CNN Business)The stock market doesn't care about Michael Cohen's testimony. But it does care about whatever is happening with President Donald Trump's trade deal with China. Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments, said Trump may try to claim that the US-China trade standoff is coming to an end \u2014 but in reality, \"we've got weeks and weeks, if not months, to go before ironing this thing out,\" he told CNN Business's Julia Chatterley during the \"Markets Now\" live show. Valliere said he is concerned because the threat of additional tariffs still looms and the US House of Representatives could block Trump's new NAFTA deal. Meanwhile, testimony from Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, will hardly register on Wall Street. Cohen may have some \"titillating\" things to say on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, but \"I don't think he's really significantly increased the chances of impeachment or conviction,\" Valliere said.  Valliere added that investors are also far more interested in what's going on with the Federal Reserve. The Fed has pleased investors by signaling that it won't be as aggressive with interest rate hikes this year.  Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, said she predicts the Fed could soon be looking at reducing interest rates if US economic growth runs into more roadblocks. And it may be time to prepare for a recession. \"I think there's certainly evidence of weakness bubbling underneath the surface in the US economy at this point,\" she said. \"The economy may be coming to the end of a recovery.\" Piegza said she's concerned about trade policy and slowing economic growth abroad, which could translate to weakening demand for US goods.  And there are other issues happening domestically, she said, including signs that consumer markets are losing momentum, business investments are slowing down, and the housing market is softening. What could all that mean for the stock market? \"We do see sizable momentum to the downside,\" Piegza said. \"Markets Now\" streams live from the New York Stock Exchange every Wednesday at 12:45 p.m. ET.

Nike's (NKE) stock was down more than 1% on Thursday. Nike builds its reputation around creating premier shoes and clothes for athletes, but that image took a hit with Williamson's sneaker snafu.  Analysts attributed the stock move to Williamson, the presumptive top pick in this year's NBA draft and the hottest prospect since LeBron James entered the draft from high school more than a decade ago. Within the first minute of Duke's blockbuster matchup against rival North Carolina on Wednesday, one of Williamson's Nike PG2.5 shoes split apart.  Williamson left the game with a knee injury. Former President Barack Obama was sitting courtside, and clips of Williamson breaking his shoe and Obama pointing to it immediately went viral.  Nike, which exclusively supplies Duke's basketball team with uniforms, shoes and gear, quickly released a statement.  \"The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance,\" the company said. \"While this is an isolated occurrence, we are working to identify the issue.\" Endorsement deals with star athletes, including LeBron James and Serena Williams, and sponsorships with pro sports leagues and top college basketball and football teams are a crucial part of Nike's growth strategy. Nike spent $11.5 billion, nearly a third of its sales, on marketing and endorsement contracts last year. Nike and its Jordan brand sponsored 85 men's and women's basketball teams in last year's annual NCAA tournament. In its annual securities filing, Nike warned that \"negative claims or publicity involving us\" from key endorsers or sponsors can \"seriously damage our reputation and brand image.\" It added another risk: \"Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims.\" Still, analysts don't predict the Williamson incident to damage Nike's reputation in the long run. Nike's products haven't had any major malfunctions in the past, except for some NBA jerseys briefly ripping in 2017. \"This is embarrassing for Nike, but will have no material impact on the business,\" said Matt Powell, analyst at NPD Group. Nike has also reduced its dependence on high-top basketball sneakers for growth in recent years. It has instead focused on lightweight running and wear-to-work shoes.  Nike's basketball sneaker sales fell last year as consumers move away from performance sneakers to more casual and comfortable shoes. \"Basketball shoes are not in fashion,\" Powell said. \"Athleisure footwear is in style.\"  Patrick Rishe, the sports business director at Washington University in St. Louis, called Williamson's sneaker break a freak accident.  \"Nike is a massive brand and has tremendous power,\" he said. \"If they're smart, they'll reach out to Zion and have him wear their shoes again.\"","205":"New York (CNN Business)Biogen announced Thursday it would cancel a promising drug trial it hoped could treat Alzheimer's disease. The company's stock fell more than 28%. Shares of Biogen are on track for their worst day since February 2005.  Biogen (BIIB) said in a statement that it had decided to end the Phase 3 trials of the drug, called aducanumab, after an independent audit revealed the drug was unlikely to work.  Aducanumab was widely believed to be the company's next blockbuster drug because of its success in earlier trials. But treating Alzheimer's is proving elusive.  Biogen is the latest in a series of pharmaceutical companies to halt research on Alzheimer's treatments in recent years. Eli Lilly, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Merck have all canceled Alzheimer's drug trials. \"This disappointing news confirms the complexity of treating Alzheimer's disease and the need to further advance knowledge in neuroscience,\" Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos said. \"We are incredibly grateful to all the Alzheimer's disease patients, their families and the investigators who participated in the trials and contributed greatly to this research.\" The company said it will continue to work on developing treatments for Alzheimer's, which kills more Americans than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to the Alzheimer's Association. The safety of the drug, which Biogen developed with Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai, did not play a role in the decision to end the trials according to a statement.","206":"New York (CNN Business)Levi Strauss enjoyed a fashionable debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week. Now the owner of Lee and Wrangler wants to prove that there's room for another dedicated denim maker on Wall Street. VF Corp. \u2014 which also owns Vans sneakers, The North Face jackets and Timberland boots \u2014 plans to spin off its jeans business sometime during the first half of this year.  The new company will be known as Kontoor Brands. VF (VFC) chairman and CEO Steve Rendle called the name \"a creative variation of the word contour\" last December, when the company announced its spinoff plans.  But Kontoor Brands might have a tough time duplicating the success of Levi Strauss (LEVI), which gained 32% on its first day of trading. While Levi's sales and profits are growing, VF Corp.'s jeans division is shrinking.  VF Corp. said in its most recent quarterly SEC filing that sales in its jeans unit fell 3.5% \u2014 to $1.9 billion \u2014 in the nine months ending in December compared with a year earlier. Earnings were down 13.5%. Lee and Wrangler are no Levi's This could make Kontoor a tough sell on Wall Street.  Stifel analyst James Duffy wrote in a report last month that the \"fundamentals remain challenged\" for the Kontoor Brands business.  Duffy estimated that the company could be worth about $4 billion in a spinoff. That's less than half of the market value for Levi's right now. It also remains to be seen what the investor appetite for Kontoor will be like \u2014 and not just because Levi Strauss is now public.  Investors will also soon be able to buy shares of standalone clothing retailer Old Navy, which is being spun off by Gap (GPS) and is a big seller of low-priced jeans. Finally, fashion trends are very fickle. Wall Street can be extremely unforgiving of any shortfalls.  On the same day that Levi's went public, shares of Guess (GES) plunged nearly 13% after the company reported a drop in sales at stores open at least a year, and earnings that missed forecasts.","207":"Washington (CNN)Stocks go up, stocks go down -- but that hasn't stopped President Donald Trump from celebrating the highs in his Twitter feed, which for the third time of his presidency hailed the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing above 25,000 on Wednesday. \"Dow just broke 25,000,\" the President wrote after the benchmark index closed up 435 points. \"Tremendous news!\" Tremendous \u2014 and familiar. The Dow rose above 25,000 for the first time a year ago, spurring Trump's first victorious message. \"Dow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing,\" he wrote on January 4, 2018.  The market remained above that line for a while, even reaching 26,000, before sinking lower in the spring. But it ticked up again in the summer, yielding a second message of triumph. \"The Stock Market hit 25,000 yesterday,\" Trump wrote on July 14. \"It is all happening!\" It was indeed all happening -- including a ratcheted up trade war with China, a weakening global economy, and a steady increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Those factors led markets to slide again at the end of the year \u2014 including during a dismal December that left investors, and the President, spooked. Trump grew concerned an extended slide could damage his political prospects. He lashed out at Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. And he kept vigilant watch on the markets, using the chart as a barometer of his own standing. The first month of the year has provided him some solace. Markets turned upward. And the Federal Reserve indicated on Wednesday it would keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged.  And so Trump was back to hailing a soaring stock market, at least on its upswing.","208":"New York (CNN Business)JCPenney's holiday stretch wasn't as bad as some feared, an encouraging sign for the troubled retailer. Sales at stores open at least a year fell only 4% during the holiday quarter compared with a year earlier. Investors had expected worse.  JCPenney said it got a boost from its women's clothing business and toys during the holidays. It posted a $75 million profit for the quarter.  JCPenney's  (JCP)stock jumped 27% Thursday. Its stock rebounded somewhat this year after falling under $1 for the first time in the company's 90-year history in December, because of uncertainty about its long term future. It's currently trading around $1.57.  \"This is not business as usual,\" CEO Jill Soltau told analysts on Thursday. \"We are taking deliberate actions to improve.\" Soltau, who took over last year, previously pledged \"quick action\" to put JCPenney on the path to profitability. She installed a new management team and on Thursday brought in a new chief merchant from Target.  But the picture for JCPenney remains grim: The company said it lost $255 million for the full year. JCPenney plans to close 18 under-performing department stores in 2019, as well as nine home and furniture stores. But it still has more than 800 stores around the country. In a strategy shift, JCPenney recently said it would stop selling appliances and most furniture. It has also marked down inventory to clear out the glut of clothes and handbags sitting on its shelves. Going forward, Soltau said JCPenney plans to focus on women's clothes, including athletic brands and the booming plus-size market, and home goods.  But Penney's path looks uncertain. An estimated $2.1 billion in loan payments come due in 2023, and that has credit rating agencies and analysts worried. \"Our main concern is that JCP has very little time to course correct,\" said Neil Saunders, analyst at GlobalData Retail. Penney is not the only legacy department store struggling in a healthy economy. Macy's (M) sales at stores open at least a year during the holidays grew a tepid 0.7% compared with last year.  Amazon (AMZN) has squeezed department stores on the online side, while TJX (TJX) has undercut them with lower prices.  Target (TGT) has also pressured department stores by improving its private-label clothing brands.","209":" (CNN)Bernie Sanders advocated for the nationalization of most major industries, including energy companies, factories, and banks, when he was a leading member of a self-described \"radical political party\" in the 1970s, a CNN KFile review of his record reveals. Sanders' past views shed light on a formative period of his political career that could become relevant as he advances in the 2020 Democratic primary. Many of the positions he held at the time are more extreme compared to the more tempered democratic socialism the Vermont senator espouses today and could provide fodder for moderate Democrats and Republicans looking to cast the Democratic presidential candidate and his beliefs as a fringe form of socialism that would be harmful to the country. Aspects of Sanders' plans and time in the Liberty Union have been reported before, but the material taken together, including hundreds of newly digitalized newspapers and files from the Liberty Union Party archived at the University of Vermont, paint a fuller portrait of Sanders' views on state and public-controlled industry at the time. In a statement to CNN, Sanders campaign spokesman Josh Orton said, \"Throughout his career, Bernie has fought on the side of working people and against the influence of both the powerful ultra-rich and giant corporations who seek only to further their own greed. The record shows that from the very beginning, Bernie anticipated and worked to combat the rise of a billionaire ruling class and the exploding power of Wall Street and multinational corporations. Whether fighting to lower energy prices or expand access to capital for local development, Bernie's first priority has always been -- and will always be -- defending the interests of working people across the country.\" After moving to Vermont in 1968 several years after graduating college, Sanders became an active member of the left-wing Liberty Union Party. Under the Liberty Union banner, Sanders, then in his early 30s, ran for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate for US Senate in 1972 and 1974. Sanders, also served as chairman of the party from 1973-1975. During this time, Sanders and Liberty Union argued for nationalization of the energy industry, public ownership of banks, telephone, electric, and drug companies and of the major means of production such as factories and capital, as well as other proposals such as a 100% income tax on the highest income earners in America. Sanders also rejected political violence and criticized the anti-democratic nature of communist states such as the Soviet Union. \"I favor the public ownership of utilities, banks and major industries,\" Sanders said in one interview with the Burlington Free Press in 1976. In his career as a US Senator, Sanders has backed away from such ardent calls for nationalization, but maintained similar rhetoric on wealth inequality. In one 2015 speech, he said he didn't want the government to take over private business or \"own the means of production.\" But his early views are notable because they are far to the left of the current Democratic party and most candidates running for office. Sanders left the Liberty Union Party in 1977, over what he said was the party's lack of activity between elections. Sanders said in his farewell that workers would need to take control for the country to be sustained. \"The function of a radical political party is very simple,\" he said. \"It is to create a situation in which the ordinary working people take what rightfully belongs to them. Nobody can predict the future of the workers' movement in this country or the state of Vermont. It is my opinion, however, that if workers do not take power in a reasonably short time this country will not have a future.\" The energy industry In 1973, during his time as chairman of the Liberty Union Party, Sanders took to a Vermont paper to oppose Richard Nixon's energy policy and oil industry profits, calling for the entire energy industry to be nationalized. Consumers at the time had been facing steep price increases and heavy shortages as a result of the OPEC oil embargo. \"I would also urge you to give serious thought about the eventual nationalization of these gigantic companies,\" Sanders wrote in a December 1973 open letter to Vermont Sen. Robert Stafford that ran in the Vermont Freeman. \"It is extremely clear that these companies, owned by a handful of billionaires, have far too much power over the lives of Americans to be left in private hands. The oil industry, and the entire energy industry, should be owned by the public and used for the public good -- not for additional profits for billionaires.\" Electric and telephone utilities Efforts to push for public ownership of Vermont's utilities like telephone and electric companies played prominently in Sanders' political career in the 1970s. Sanders ran for Senate in a January 1972 in the special election and governor in that year's November election, registering in the low single digits in both races.  When he launched his first campaign for the Senate in 1971, Sanders said state utilities needed to be run by the state of Vermont on a nonprofit basis and that if revenues exceed expenditures they could be used to fund government programs and lower property taxes. In 1976, Sanders went even further: calling for the state to seize ownership of Vermont's private electric companies without compensation to investors. He defended his proposals routinely by pointing out that municipally owned utilities, not uncommon throughout the country, often had lower consumer prices. Utilities like the Green Mountain Power company and the New England Telephone company had been steadily pushing, successful and unsuccessful at times, for approval from state regulators for rate increases. Sanders was particularly incensed by a proposed 27% rate hike by the New England Telephone company, and it became a rallying cry for his political campaigns. In 1973, as chairman of the Liberty Union Party, Sanders had organized boycotts to stop proposed rate increases from New England Telephone company. Sanders' efforts through the \"The Vermont Telephone Boycott Committee\" -- a committee he coordinated that year -- proved successful in blocking NET rate increases. Newspapers commended Sanders for efforts when the rate increases were blocked by the state's utility regulators. Sanders would declare for the Senate again the following June in 1974 and for governor in 1976, and Vermont's utilities would remain a major focus point of his campaigns and Liberty Union Party. Sanders' rhetoric was strongest during his 1976 campaign for governor of Vermont, his last before he left the Liberty Union Party. In a press release on his policy positions, Sanders campaigned on the public ownership of the state's electric companies, without compensating the banks and stockholders. \"I will be campaigning in support of the Liberty Union utility proposal which calls for the public ownership of Vermont's private electric companies without compensation to the banks and wealthy stockholders who own the vast majority of stock in these companies,\" he said in a July 1976 press release. \"I will also be calling for public ownership of the telephone company -- which is probably the single greatest rip-off company in America.\"  Sanders argued utility companies engaged in \"economic blackmail,\" saying the state gave the companies the right to charge \"outrageous\" rates for utilities or have consumers suffer from poor service. Sanders' comments went beyond the Liberty Union's proposal for public takeover of state utilities, which said investors and bondholders with more than 100 shares would have to convert their holding to non-voting stock and income bonds which carry no fixed claim to dividends or interest payments. Public ownership of banks, corporations and the major industries Sanders' policy proposals that year also included an ambitious plan to deal with companies attempting to leave towns. \"We have got to begin to deal with the fact that corporations do not have the god-given right to disrupt the lives of their workers or the economic foundation of their towns simply because they wish to move elsewhere to earn a higher rate of profit,\" Sanders said in a press release in August 1976. Sanders' plan would require large businesses attempting to leave cities to get permission from the towns and the workers in them. If the company did not get that approval they would be required by law to pay a guaranteed two years of severance for workers and 10 years of taxes for the town. Nationally, Sanders said, legislation corporations leaving cities would have to be dealt with by turning the means of production over to the workers. \"In the long run, the problem of the fleeing corporations must be dealt with on the national level by legislation which will bring about the public ownership of the major means of production and their conversion into worker-controlled enterprises,\" he said. Campaign literature that year from Sanders, including a 1976 brochure for the party, said, \"I believe that, in the long run, major industries in this state and nation should be publicly owned and controlled by the workers themselves.\" Public control of the economy would become the key issue in his race. Speaking at one forum, Sanders called for workers to control of capital, factories, banks and corporations. \"There is a handful of people sitting at the head of the main banks controlling the destiny of underprivileged nations, the country as well as Vermont's economy,\" Sanders said. \"That is not tolerable. That control cannot be held by them. We need public control over capital; and the capital must be put to use for public need not for the advancement of those who made the investments.\" In an interview with the Burlington Free Press, Sanders argued the richest two or three percent should not control capital. \"I favor the public ownership of utilities, banks and major industries. In Vermont we have some $2 billion of deposits in our banks,\" Sanders told the paper. \"In Vermont, as well as nationally, it is not tolerable to me that the control of capital would remain in the hands of the richest two or three percent of the population to do with it as they like.\" Sanders called that year in a policy paper for Vermont's banking laws to be \"radically\" revised, so that the public and the state \"determine in what manner our savings are invested so as to make Vermont a better place to live.\" Socialized medicine and public ownership of drug companies  Asked about healthcare, Sanders said there would need to be publicly-controlled drug companies. \"I believe in socialized medicine, public ownership of the drug companies and placing doctors on salaries. The idea that millionaires can make money by selling poor people drugs that they desperately need for highly inflated prices disgusts me,\" he said. Taxing assets at 100% Heavy taxation of wealthy people played prominently into Sanders' plans to pay for expanding government services. In February 1976, Liberty Union put out a state tax proposal calling for a radical revamping of the system, including the removal of all taxes of sales, beverages, cigarettes, polls, and the use of telephones, railroads or electric energy. Tax rates for those earning more than $100,00 would be 33.47%, $50,000-$99,999 would be 19%, $25,000-$49,000 would be 13.56%, and $10,000-$14,999 would be 4%. Anyone earning less than $10,000 would pay no state income tax. But Sanders' rhetoric at times went much further. During his 1974 Senate run, Sanders said one plan to expand government included making it illegal to gain more wealth than person could spend in a lifetime and have a 100% tax on incomes above this level. (Sanders defined this as $1 million dollars annually).  \"Nobody should earn more than a million dollars,\" Sanders said. ","210":"Hong Kong (CNN)President Donald Trump has warned that US tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese exports are unlikely to go away anytime soon \u2014 even if the two countries reach a deal to end their trade war. \"We're not talking about removing them, we're talking about leaving them for a substantial period of time,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"Because we have to make sure that if we do the deal with China that China lives by the deal because they've had a lot of problems living by certain deals.\" The United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, are trying to negotiate a resolution to their trade dispute that escalated dramatically last year with both sides imposing new tariffs on huge portions of each other's exports. The clash has shaken financial markets, fueled political tensions and caused problems for companies around the world. Businesses have already begun shifting their supply chains out of China to other countries in Asia to avoid the trade-war tariffs. Trade talks between the two governments will resume next week after a pause in negotiations. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will travel to Beijing for discussions meant to finalize an agreement between the two countries. It's expected that a Chinese delegation, led by Vice Premier Liu He, would then go to Washington for further talks. China's Ministry of Commerce announced during a press conference Thursday that a US trade delegation will be in Beijing for talks March 28 and March 29. It also announced a Chinese delegation will be in Washington D.C. in early April. Negotiations had been on hold as the two sides tried to figure out how to overcome disagreements about how the United States would ensure China is abiding by any deal. US concerns about how China goes about getting hold of American technology and trade secrets have also been a sticking point. Aiming for summit in late April The Trump administration, citing longstanding complaints from US companies, accuses China of stealing valuable commercial information though cyberattacks and forcing American businesses to hand over proprietary technology in exchange for access to Chinese markets.  Beijing rejects the accusations. But at the same time, it has recently introduced measures that attempt to address the US concerns, such as a new foreign investment law that was rushed through this month. For its part, the US government last month indefinitely postponed a major increase in the tariffs on Chinese goods as the negotiations continued to progress. Trump is eager for a deal that could boost the stock market and improve his re-election chances in 2020. At the same time, the Chinese government is trying to counter an economic slowdown that has dragged the country's annual growth to its lowest level in three decades, weighing on businesses and consumers.  The Trump administration official told CNN this week that the two sides hope to reach an agreement to be signed at a summit in late April at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he previously hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2017. Trump's rhetoric on the trade negotiations has veered between hawkish and highly optimistic. He said nearly a month ago that the two governments were \"getting very, very close\" to a deal for which he would participate in a \"signing summit\" with Xi. Reports suggested the summit could take place in late March. But that bout of optimism was soon followed by the pause in negotiations. On Wednesday, Trump said that the agreement \"is coming along nicely,\" adding that \"we have our top representatives going there this weekend to further the deal.\"","211":"New York (CNN Business)The stock market has the right ingredients for monster gains this year. The S&P 500 (INX) could grow as much as 25%, Matt McCall, founder and president of Penn Financial Group, told CNN Business editor-at-large Richard Quest on the \"Markets Now\" live show Wednesday.  McCall didn't say when he expected the index to reach that point, and he admitted it's entirely possible the S&P won't end the year with that large of a gain.  But McCall said he sees a \"Goldilocks\" scenario for stocks to grow by a large margin: low interest rates, steady inflation and strong earnings growth in the first quarter of 2019.  He added that price-to-earnings ratios \u2014 or PE ratios, which compare a company's stock price with the amount of money it brings in  \u2014 are below average. That means the stock market overall could be undervalued, McCall said. \"Ask yourself: Do I want to own stocks for the next 10 years?\" he said. \"If you say yes, then you need to be in now.\" The S&P has grown about 9% so far in 2019, but it lost 5.3% over the course of 2018.  McCall said he thinks the biggest threat to continued market gains in 2019 comes from the US political climate. But he thinks the trade standoff between the United States and China will come to an end soon, which would be a major boon for stocks in both countries.  Matthew Ceslock, an equity trader with Virtu Financial, agreed with that prediction. \"If we can solve this China tariff war by the end of this month, that's going to provide a big, big tailwind to this market,\" he said.  Top negotiators for the Trump administration are due to arrive in Beijing next week to continue talks ahead of a March deadline. Both sides are looking to reach a permanent deal to end a months-long trade standoff. \"Markets Now\" streams live from the New York Stock Exchange every Wednesday at 12:45 p.m. ET.

MSCI, the company that compiles some of the world's most closely followed share indexes, said Thursday that it will quadruple the amount of Chinese stocks in its key benchmarks this year.  Trillions of dollars of investments are based on MSCI's indexes. The New York-based company's decision to boost the inclusion of Chinese shares could draw an extra $85 billion into China's stock market, the second biggest in the world, according to JPMorgan analysts. Many analysts and investors welcomed the move, saying it could boost confidence in Chinese stocks and encourage companies in the country to become more transparent. But they also advised caution for anyone tempted by MSCI's announcement to rush into mainland China's volatile, underdeveloped market. \"Many global investors will view China's onshore market as a bit of a basket case,\" Nicholas Yeo, head of China equities at investment firm Aberdeen Standard Investments, said in a commentary on the MSCI decision. About 80% of trades in China's $8.5 trillion stock market are made by mom-and-pop investors, rather than the big institutions that dominate the US and European markets. This can make Chinese stocks susceptible to unpredictable swings.  \"Local retail investors [are] more easily swayed by the latest headlines than the earnings prospects,\" Yeo said.  Wild swings China's stock market earned a reputation in recent years for wild surges and brutal sell-offs, most notably in 2015 when many companies froze trading in their shares as prices tumbled, trapping investors' money.  Last year, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index (SHCOMP) plunged more than 25% as fears mounted over the country's economic slowdown and its trade war with the United States. But the index has surged about 20% since early January, putting it in bull market territory. Chinese stocks could now be overvalued given that the economy is still weakening, according to some analysts. \"Stock prices risk becoming increasingly unmoored from the fundamentals, which are generally downbeat,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at research firm Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients Friday.   Disappointing earnings growth among Chinese companies raises questions over \"how long the current rally can be sustained,\" he added. Access to Chinese stocks is also tightly controlled by the government.  Unlike other major global markets, investors either have to apply for a trading quota from Chinese regulators or buy and sell through the Hong Kong market.  MSCI said in its announcement Thursday that Chinese regulators have taken a number of positive steps, including improving access to the market. It noted a \"significant reduction in trading suspensions in recent months.\" 'Compelling reasons' to view China more favorably Investors hope the greater inclusion of Chinese stocks in MSCI's indexes will push firms to step up their game. \"This should be a good incentive for local companies to increase the transparency of their reporting practices and to adopt strategies that more firmly consider shareholders' interest, as companies with better corporate governance are more likely to be owned by foreign investors,\" Eric Moffett, an Asia-focused portfolio manager for investment firm T. Rowe Price, said in a market commentary. MSCI first started adding Chinese shares to its indexes two years ago after previously rejecting them. This week's decision means 20% of Chinese stocks will eventually be included in MSCI's index compared with 5% at the moment. Just over 3% of MSCI's Emerging Markets index will now be dedicated to Chinese shares. Many investors approve of the move, despite the Chinese market's shortcomings. \"We believe there are compelling reasons for international investors to view this market more favorably, particularly over the longer run,\" Yeo said, pointing out that China's economy is still growing a lot faster than many developed countries and that the Chinese government is trying to steer it away from its reliance on debt-fueled growth.  \"We see the brightest earnings prospects among consumer-oriented stocks in line to benefit from the nation's structural growth,\" he said. \"After all, China's middle class is growing fast, with 380 million millennials earning and spending more than their parents ever did on luxury items, travel and health care.\"","213":" (CNN)If you splurge on the sea bass or snapper, you may not always be getting what you pay for, even at the fanciest restaurants and upscale fish markets.  There's something, well, fishy going on with certain favorite fish dishes, according to a new study from the conservation group Oceana.  DNA tests showed that about 21% of the fish researchers sampled was not what it was called on the label or menu. That's despite nearly a decade of investigations, more regulations and Americans' appetites growing beyond fish sticks and tuna surprise. \"Consumers are getting ripped off,\" said Beth Lowell, Oceana's deputy vice president. Lowell said this isn't an isolated problem. Her organization tested more than 400 samples from 277 locations in 24 states and in the District of Columbia. Oceana did not name the markets, stores and restaurants where it purchased the samples. Among the samples they tested, seafood was more frequently mislabeled in restaurants and at smaller markets than in larger grocery chains. One out of three stores and restaurants visited by the investigative team sold at least one mislabeled item. Favorites like sea bass and snapper had some of the highest rates of mislabeling. Sea bass was mislabeled 55% of the time and snapper 42% of the time, Oceana's tests showed. Often, instead of sea bass, they'd get giant perch or Nile tilapia, fish that should be less expensive and is considered lower quality. Dover sole they tested was actually walleye. Lavender jobfish had been substituted for Florida snapper. \"We've been testing seafood for nine years now, and every time we do a study, we think, 'maybe we will no longer see a problem,' but we keep finding it, and we know it's having an impact on our oceans,\" Lowell said. Some of the substituted fish was not sustainably caught, even though it was sold as such, meaning an overfished and endangered Atlantic halibut was sold as the more plentiful Pacific halibut. One in four halibut samples the group tested was mislabeled. For Americans who are trying to be more mindful about the fish they eat; who are worried about the impact of climate change and endangering fish stock; who want to eat food from lakes or oceans closer to home; or for pregnant women trying to avoid fish with high mercury content, this news has got to be frustrating, Lowell said. \"We need to do more to protect consumers,\" Lowell said. Oceana's is not the only recent study to find fish fraud. In December, a New York state Attorney General's Office investigation found that more than one in four samples, or 26.92% of the seafood they bought and tested was mislabeled. In that investigation, the problem was in virtually \"every tested seafood category.\" New Yorkers who paid 35% extra for \"wild\" caught would be disappointed to learn that the investigation found it was often farm-raised. The fish substitutes were often cheaper. \"You have to imagine how complex seafood commerce is,\" said Dan Distel, director and research professor at the Ocean Genome Legacy lab at the Northeastern University Marine Science Center. The lab performed the DNA work in the New York Investigation. \"A lot of mislabeling is probably intentional, sure,\" he said. \"There is also plenty that must be accidental or just the result of the ignorance of the rules.\"  With so many species and with 80% of the fish Americans eat coming from international sources, labeling is complicated. \"In order to maintain accurate labeling, you have to track it from the fisherman, who is sometimes in remote locations or in the developing world. And then you track it through a variety of middlemen to the distributor, the store, to the high school kids stocking the shelves. There are a lot of places where things could go wrong,\" Distel said.  Names of fish can also be confusing for people who sell them. Something sold as snapper, for instance, can actually be a few different species. If it's sold as the more expensive red snapper, that's got to be a specific fish, according to FDA rules. Sometimes, rules even allow a fish to be called something else. Chilean sea bass, for instance, is actually Patagonian toothfish or Antarctic toothfish -- not sea bass. But the restaurant or market has to use \"Chilean\" in the name. If it's just called \"sea bass,\" it's mislabeled. \"With regard to fraud, honestly, it is fairly simple. Yes, there's a complex global supply chain, like there is for so many products, but the reality is, if something is mislabeled or there's some kind of species substitution, it is fraud plain and simple, and it is just illegal,\" said Gavin Gibbons with the National Fisheries Institute, an association for the industry. \"You would not accept this in any other scenario, and you shouldn't accept it in seafood.\" He wishes Oceana would have investigated further to find the source of the mislabeled fish, and he doesn't think the industry needs more regulation. He thinks more of the existing laws should be enforced.  In 2014, the federal government tried to do something about mislabeling, creating the US Government Task Force on Combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and Seafood Fraud. The task force's recommendations in 2018 created the Seafood Important Monitoring Program, known in the industry as SIMP. SIMP requires traceability and catch reporting for 13 types of imported seafood considered most at risk for mislabeling, including red snapper, Atlantic cod, grouper, swordfish, tunas, king crab, mahi mahi, sharks and sea cucumber. Oceana wants the government to expand the requirements to all seafood. Some groups have taken on the issue without waiting for additional regulations.  Demian Willette, an assistant professor of biology at Loyola Marymount University, has worked on an investigation of the mislabeling problem in Los Angeles sushi restaurants. That 2017 investigation found that 47% of the sushi it tested was mislabeled. He works with the Los Angeles Seafood Monitoring Project team, a group effort that purchases fish from area restaurants, runs DNA tests to see whether it is accurately described and then works with the restaurants and regulators.  \"This is not a gotcha operation,\" Willette said. \"We're trying to work with those restaurants to improve this issue.\" There are steps consumers can take to get a better chance of eating what you ordered.  Gibbons, of the National Fisheries Institute, suggests asking the fishmonger or your server or chef whether the establishment is a Better Seafood Board member. Members must adhere to industry principles that include correctly labeling products. Oceana's Lowell also suggests asking your server about where the fish is caught. \"Their ability to answer might indicate how much information they have about it,\" Lowell said.  If you can look the fish in the eye, it can also help. \"You up your chances of getting what you order if you buy as close to the whole fish as possible,\" Lowell said. \"The more processing, the more opportunity for a bait and switch.\"","214":"Part 2 in a series on unlicensed gun dealing. Read part 1  The prosecutor, however, pressed for prison time. Wince\u2014as a cop\u2014should have known better than anyone the risks associated with his black-market gun sales, he argued.   But there was one issue on which both sides could agree: The law under which Wince was about to be sentenced that day in a federal courtroom in Virginia was badly flawed.    It's \"unconstitutionally vague,\" the defense attorney said.   \"I'm not a big fan of the statute,\" the prosecutor conceded.    Both men were referring to the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, a decades-old federal statute originally proposed by the National Rifle Association that dictates who is required to have a license to sell guns, and who is not.   The law's fuzziness on that distinction and its provision that defendants must willfully violate the law in order to face prosecution, has frustrated efforts by law enforcement to combat the problem of unlicensed gun dealing in America, a CNN investigation found. Unlicensed dealers are a go-to source of firearms for criminals and others who can't pass the sort of background checks that licensed dealers are required to perform, according to a review of dozens of court cases and interviews with federal agents and prosecutors across the country.   Guns sold by unlicensed dealers often turn up in the hands of convicted felons, at crime scenes, and in police investigations, including cases of armed robbery and murder, CNN found. Some dealers continued their illegal sales even after receiving warnings from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.   Last year a gun sold by an unlicensed dealer was used in the slaying of an off-duty police commander in Chicago. In 2017, a gun allegedly sold by a suspected illegal dealer in Nevada to another individual was used in the fatal shooting of a California sheriff's deputy and the wounding of two California Highway Patrol officers. \"The crime they're committing is a white-collar crime,\" Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said of unlicensed dealers, in a recent interview. \"But the crimes they're facilitating are violent crimes that impact our communities across the country every day.\"   Despite the impact of their illicit sales, criminal filings against unlicensed dealers represent a small fraction of federal firearms prosecutions and receive comparatively little attention in the national debate on guns. Even successful prosecutions sometimes result in wrist-slap punishments because defendants have no previous criminal record, CNN found. A common refrain from Second Amendment advocates is that the country does not need any new gun control laws; it just needs to enforce the ones already on the books. But the Firearms Owners' Protection Act is widely seen by those in federal law enforcement as more of a hindrance than a tool, according to current and former ATF agents and prosecutors interviewed by CNN.   \"It's a huge problem,\" said Jill Snyder, a recently retired supervisory agent with ATF.   The impact of unlicensed gun dealing would be greatly reduced if every gun sale -- not just those by licensed dealers -- required a background check on the prospective buyer, law enforcement officials told CNN.   That's the goal of a bill passed by the House last month. But the prospect of such a measure passing the Republican-controlled Senate, where the NRA holds significant sway, is slim, political observers say.   Engaged in the business   Laws regarding the purchase and possession of firearms vary from state to state. State and local jurisdictions can enact and prosecute laws that are more restrictive than federal law, but not less so. When it comes to dealing firearms, federal law requires that all dealers, regardless of the state they live in, be licensed by the ATF. CNN focused on the federal law because it is the regulation that applies to all gun dealers throughout the country.   Under federal law, licensed dealers are required to conduct background checks on prospective buyers to ensure they don't sell to convicted felons, domestic abusers or people who are mentally unstable.   They are also required to maintain records on weapons they acquire and sell, in part, to provide a clear path for law enforcement to follow when they recover a gun that is used in a crime.   But an ordinary citizen who decides to sell a weapon or weapons, but does not fit the definition of a dealer, faces no such requirements under federal law. And a fundamental problem with the current law, according to critics, is that what constitutes a dealer is not all that clear-cut.   The statute says anyone \"engaged in the business\" of selling firearms requires a license. \"Engaged in the business\" means devoting \"time, attention and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.\"   The law states that it does not apply to someone engaged in only occasional gun sales or collectors or hobbyists adding to, or selling from, their personal collection.   The law places no set number of transactions that differentiates between a person engaged in the business and one who makes \"occasional sales.\"   Assistant U.S. attorney Peter S. Duffey, who successfully prosecuted Wince, criticized the law last year at the ex-officer's sentencing hearing.   \"I don't understand why they couldn't set a number,\" Duffey told U.S. District Court Judge M. Hannah Lauck.   The law that sought to define gun dealers was enacted in 1986 after complaints by the gun lobby that the national Gun Control Act, passed two decades earlier following the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Attorney Gen. Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., was overly broad.   That law required anyone \"engaged in the business\" to obtain a license, but offered no further definition on what that meant.   Firearms advocates accused the ATF of using the law to go after occasional gun sellers who weren't really dealers and to, literally, make federal cases out of innocent paperwork violations.   Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, defended the current law, which she said is sufficiently clear to prosecute people for dealing guns without a license. Setting a fixed number of transactions to distinguish between a casual seller and a dealer is arbitrary, she said, and \"doesn't work.\"   The fact that some unlicensed sellers do get prosecuted demonstrates that the law is effective when applied, Baker said.   She rejected the phrase \"unlicensed gun dealer\" as a \"politically charged term.\"   \"There's no such thing as unlicensed gun dealers,\" Baker said. \"They're called felons. If you're breaking the law, you should be prosecuted and punished.\"   Thomas Chittum, a veteran ATF supervisor who is also an attorney, said that's much easier said than done.   He said the vague wording in the statute and the requirement that defendants be shown to have willfully violated the law make such cases difficult enough. On top of that, he said, many unlicensed dealing suspects have no previous criminal record, making them sympathetic to juries and unappealing to prosecutors.   \"In my view, they're the most challenging prosecution that ATF has,\" he said.   Because unlicensed dealers typically do not document their sales, Chittum said, it is impossible to quantify how many guns pass through their hands each year. Whatever the number is, he said, \"it's not small.\"   The ATF routinely warns suspected unlicensed dealers that they may be breaking the law. They do so by sending out so-called \"cease and desist\" letters instructing recipients to stop selling guns until they've obtained a federal firearms license.   CNN filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the bureau in June seeking, among other things, the number of such letters sent per year in recent years.   The ATF had not provided those statistics prior to publication of this story.   Hidden in plain sight   They are hidden in plain sight, peddling weapons on the internet, at gun shows, in parking lots, from the trunks of their cars. Some boast of hassle-free \"no paper work\" deals to set themselves apart from their licensed competitors. They are in some cases the most unlikely of suspects: Police officers. Federal agents. A fire department captain.   Their ranks include an aerospace engineer with a government security clearance, members of a prominent farming family, and retirees who have lived a lifetime free of previous brushes with the law.   These defendants were among those in more than 50 cases reviewed by CNN involving allegations of unlicensed dealing and related offenses.   In some cases, suspects made clear that they were aware of the risks associated with black-market gun sales, but chose to ignore them.   \"The [ATF] is really watching us,\" a suspect in Wisconsin told a purported gun buyer he didn't realize was an undercover agent, according to an affidavit filed in federal court. \"I'm nervous as shit.\"    \"As far as you know, you didn't buy it from me,\" the suspect added.   In Maryland last year, a suspected dealer sold an undercover agent an illegal machine gun without a serial number, according federal court records.   \"You can get in more trouble for having this right here than you can for selling crack to six-year-olds,\" he said of the automatic rifle, which he later sold for $750 cash.   Often, when unlicensed dealing suspects are confronted by the ATF they deny they are dealers. Rather, they claim to be a collector or \"hobbyist\" who is not required to obtain a license.   That's what Wince, the former Washington, DC police officer, told ATF agents. He later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison.   It's also the argument retired mechanic Paul D. Boltz tried to make when agents served a search warrant on his home in Ohio. He did so, despite the fact that he had sold more than 1,800 guns \"which generated over $694,000 in gross income,\" according to court records.   \"The defendant was involved in selling a large quantity of weapons, over time, without any background check whatsoever,\" the prosecutor wrote in a sentencing memorandum. \"Ultimately, this activity presents a significant risk to the public.\"   Boltz, then 65, pleaded guilty in 2017 to dealing firearms without a license, a felony, and surrendered 136 guns to authorities. He received no prison time. Instead, he was sentenced to five years of probation and fined $40,000. Attempts to reach Boltz through his attorney were unsuccessful.   There is no indication in Boltz's court file that guns he sold were later linked to crimes. But, often, authorities say, when unlicensed dealers sell a high volume of weapons without determining who they're selling to, it's only a matter of time.    One egregious example involved an aerospace engineer in Virginia who authorities said sold about 200 guns to a crack dealer who in turn sold them to various people, including some he knew were barred from possessing weapons. Scores of guns linked to the two men have been recovered by police in Washington, DC and five East Coast states. Guns linked to the drug dealer have been tied to three different homicides, including that of the dealer's own cousin, according to court records. The crack dealer was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The aerospace engineer got 18 months.   On the West Coast, more than a dozen firearms sold by members of a farming family in Washington state turned up at crime scenes or in police investigations scattered around the San Francisco Bay Area, according to authorities. Each of the family members was charged with felony unlicensed gun dealing, but they pleaded guilty to a lesser misdemeanor offense and were sentenced to probation.   One reason cases against unlicensed dealers sometimes involve otherwise sympathetic suspects is that would-be dealers benefit from a felony-free record that allows them to continually buy guns to later resell, according to court records and interviews with agents.   They obtain their stock of weapons from licensed sellers who properly conduct background checks prior to the purchase. The unlicensed dealers then re-sell the guns at a profit without performing any background check or filling out the required paperwork documenting the sale, agents say.   Recent cases of alleged unlicensed gun dealing around the country include charges filed earlier this year against a supervisor with U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Southern California. Authorities arrested Wei \"George\" Xu after seizing an arsenal of more than 250 guns from his Los Angeles-area home, including AK-47 and AR-15-style rifles and Uzi-type sub-machine guns, according to prosecutors. Xu has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. His lawyer did not return a call seeking comment.   Two other Southern California police officers have been charged in a separate case and a third, a former lieutenant, was sentenced to a year in prison for unlicensed dealing last month. Other recent cases have involved a former fire department captain in Kansas City, Mo and former supervisors with the Border Patrol and DEA in Arizona.   Acevedo, the Houston police chief who also serves as president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, was particularly critical of fellow law enforcement officers who engage in illegal gun dealing.   \"Shame on them,\" Acevedo said. \"They're the ones who should know more than anyone that firearms are ending up in the wrong hands.\"   Because defendants in unlicensed gun dealing cases must be shown to have willfully violated the law, their cases sometimes begin with a warning letter from the ATF that serves to put them on notice that they are at risk of prosecution.   Kenneth Cherry received three warnings, according to court records -- one from the ATF, one from the licensed dealer who was legally selling him guns and one from his own brother, who works in law enforcement.    Still, five years after the initial warning from the ATF in 2012, Cherry continued selling guns at flea markets in Georgia and Tennessee.   In 2017, the ATF sent an undercover agent to attempt to buy a weapon from Cherry at his home in northern Georgia. Sitting in the living room were two metal gun safes, fully stocked with dozens of weapons. In the drawer of a nearby coffee table was a blue book on the value of guns, according to an affidavit filed by an ATF agent.    Cherry acknowledged to the agents having been given an application for a gun dealer's license years earlier, but said he didn't want one. \"He did not like the government telling him to whom he could and could not sell firearms,\" court documents state.   Cherry's defense attorney wrote in a sentencing memo to the judge that his 70-year-old client had spent his entire life as \"a law-abiding and productive citizen\" and was \"deeply upset about his situation, and has felt that his poor judgement has jeopardized his ability to assist his family.\"   Cherry's punishment? Three years on probation -- with the first six months spent in home confinement.  His attorney declined comment. Attempts to reach Cherry himself were unsuccessful.   In the case against former DEA supervisory agent Joseph Michael Gill in Arizona, the prosecutor told the judge in a sentencing memorandum that Gill was \"selling large numbers of firearms to whoever would purchase them,\" including \"a member of a drug trafficking organization.\"   Assistant US Atty. Phillip N. Smith said Gill betrayed his oath and undermined the DEA's mission \"all for personal profit.\"   \"Individuals who illegally sell firearms,\" Smith wrote, \"pose a clear and present danger to society as a whole.\"   The prosecutor implored U.S. District Judge Raner C. Collins to send a message by putting the disgraced agent behind bars.   Gill's defense attorney asked the judge for a sentence of probation, citing his client's \"model career in law enforcement\" and \"otherwise spotless record.\"   The judge granted his request.   He sentenced Gill to five years of probation for felony unlicensed gun dealing and fined him $15,000. Like Cherry, he was to spend the first six months in home confinement, \"at the discretion of the probation officer.\" Gill declined comment through his attorney. Operating with impunity   Most cases of unlicensed dealing not only go unprosecuted, but undetected, said Snyder, who led the San Francisco Field Division of the ATF until she retired last year.   \"Unfortunately, we work everything backwards with these cases,\" she said. \"There's no interest in a case unless a gun actually gets used in a violent crime.\"   Some black-market dealers were able to operate with apparent impunity for years.   John Stewart Davis, an Army veteran living in Montana, sold guns illegally for decades before he was finally caught. When agents raided his home in 2015, they seized 354 weapons, including multiple machine guns and a \"Street Sweeper\" shotgun, according to court records.   During the investigation Davis allegedly boasted to undercover agents about selling \"$200,000 worth of stuff\" at a gun show in Spokane,Washington, according to court documents. He suggested that one of the undercovers \"pay him extra since there was no paperwork.\"   The investigation also unearthed a possible explanation for his longevity in the illegal gun trade: Davis obliterated the serial numbers from two handguns and a rifle he sold one agent so the guns couldn't be traced, according to court records.   He also gave the purported buyer a cover story.   \"If you do get caught with 'em,\" the 71-year-old gunsmith said at the time, according to court records, \"say you bought them [off] ...some real young guy in a parking lot of a gun show.\"   At Davis' sentencing hearing in October 2016, the prosecutor sought a prison term of at least eight years based on his conduct, including obliterating serial numbers and illegally possessing short-barrel shotguns, both of which called for enhancements under federal sentencing guidelines.   \"Davis sold any type of firearm, including machineguns, to anybody with the cash to pay for it,\" assistant US attorney Paulette L. Stewart wrote in a sentencing memorandum to the judge.   Davis' defense attorney asked the judge for a sentence of probation. He characterized his client as an old school craftsman who built and sold weapons based on a \"handshake and a look in the eye.\"   Only recently, after learning from the ATF that one of his guns \"ended up in the possession of somebody that wasn't a good guy,\" had he come to appreciate why gun laws exist, the lawyer said.   Davis then spoke briefly on his own behalf.   \"Now I'm starting to realize, yeah, I was wrong,\" he told U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen.   The judge noted that Davis once had a federal firearms license back in the 1980s and asked why he let it lapse.   \"I'm just not good at jumping through hoops and doing all the paperwork,\" he said.   He also asked the defendant why he'd obliterated the serial numbers on the guns he sold to the undercover ATF agent.   \"That was probably to protect myself,\" Davis said. \"I thought they might misuse it, maybe, or get caught with something that wasn't right.\"   Christensen said he was mindful of Davis' military service, his clean record, and his obligations as a family man.   \"All of those matters are on the front of my mind and make this, quite frankly, a difficult case for me,\" the judge said shortly before imposing sentence.   The problem, he said, was the parade of drug defendants he either read about or sentenced in his court on a daily basis \"who possess firearms, many of them purchased from individuals like Mr. Davis at gun shows or at gunsmith shops, and many of these firearms have obliterated serial numbers.\"   It \"defies belief,\" the judge said, that Davis only recently realized that drug dealers were buying his guns. \"These same individuals shoot and kill law enforcement officers,\" Christensen added.   He then sentenced Davis to four years in federal prison -- less than half the time the sentencing guidelines recommended.","215":"Washington (CNN)The annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) event attracts college Republicans, populists, nationalists, some libertarians, and the occasional Revolutionary reenactor. For the past three years, it's also attracted President Donald Trump.  While waiting more than half-an-hour (much of it on their feet) for Trump's speech to begin, the CPAC audience was treated to a video montage of CPAC's chairman Matt Schlapp arguing against journalists and media personalities on a pro-Trump spree -- as event staff closed the doors and kept anyone from leaving.    When he finally showed up, Trump did not disappoint. He spoke for more than two hours, delivering the longest speech of his presidency to a wildly enthusiastic crowd. In what felt at times like a standup comedy special -- \"I'm in love, you're in love and we're all in love together,\" Trump told the audience at one point -- the President touched on favorite topics ranging from the Mueller investigation, North Korea, trade, and the Democrats' Green New Deal.  Here are the facts.    Tariffs In talking about trade and tariffs, Trump pulled out one of his favorite lines, telling the audience, \"Billions of dollars right now are pouring into our Treasury.\"  Facts First: Technically this is true. It's just that the billions of dollars aren't coming from foreign countries and companies, as Trump has suggested in the past. Instead, it's American companies and consumers that are paying most of the cost of these tariffs.   We fact checked a similar statement from Trump during his speech in El Paso last month. Here's what we found:    When Trump talks about tariffs, he often talks about the amount of money that is now pouring into the US Treasury. He tends to give the impression that money is being paid by foreign companies. But that's not really what's happening. Instead, most of those tariffs are being paid by US companies that import those foreign goods.  The real question is who bears the cost. Often, US companies will pass it on to the consumer by raising prices, while other times a company will reduce compensation or employment internally to offset these higher costs. In some instances, the Chinese supplier might take on the burden of the tariff by reducing its prices in order to maintain its price advantage in the US.    Trump is trying to realign trade so that US products become more competitive with their cheaper Chinese alternatives. That will likely require a long-term adjustment of the US industrial base. In the short term, US consumers and companies will most likely end up bearing the cost of the tariffs. The Tax Foundation said last year that it expects the tariffs to lower the gross domestic product and wages, and cost American jobs, hitting lower- and middle-income households the hardest.    Mueller Trump also went after the Russia probe, claiming that \"13 Democrats\" work on Robert Mueller's team.    Facts First: According to several reports, 13 members of Mueller's team have registered as Democrats in the past. The majority of them though have been longstanding Department of Justice employees.     As CNN has previously reported: Mueller assembled a team that at its peak consisted of at least 17 lawyers and \"dozens\" of FBI agents to help with his investigation. Nine of the lawyers donated to Democratic candidates before 2017, according to federal records. Eight of those lawyers gave only to Democrats, while one has donated to Democrats and Republicans before.   It's worth noting that making political donations is within the rules and is not itself a disqualification, as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (who appointed Mueller as special counsel) told Congress in 2017.    Asked by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham whether political donations should prevent attorneys from working on the investigation, Rosenstein replied, \"No, senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not.\"     The Washington Post has reported that \"13 of the 17 members of Mueller's team have previously registered as Democrats.\"   Mueller was a registered Republican as recently as 2017 and was appointed as FBI director under George W. Bush. Rosenstein is also a registered Republican.   Trump also claimed that one of the lawyers on Mueller's team has been \"involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it.\" Facts First: This is false. No one on Mueller's team ever ran the Clinton Foundation.  Trump may be referring to one of Mueller's lawyers, Jeannie Rhee, who previously represented the Clinton Foundation in a civil racketeering lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. Manufacturing Trump claimed that he brought back \"600,000 beautiful manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country.\"  Facts First: While the pace of manufacturing job creation has increased since Trump took office in 2017, he is overstating the number by nearly 150,000. It's also unclear how much credit any president deserves for the decisions made by manufacturing companies to hire more workers.   Based on current data, 454,000 manufacturing jobs were added since the beginning of 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   We've also fact checked the idea that manufacturing jobs were not increasing before Trump took office, something he has suggested before:    By the time former President Barack Obama left office, there were some 190,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than existed at the start of his administration. But that doesn't tell the whole story. The US was in a deep recession when Obama entered the White House in January 2009, and the manufacturing sector was shedding tens of thousands of jobs a month. But the losses stopped by early 2010. Over the next six-plus years, manufacturing jobs rose by more than 800,000.  Under Trump, the pace of growth is certainly faster. During his first two years in office, the economy has added more than 470,000 manufacturing jobs. (According to MarketWatch, the manufacturing job growth from August 2017 to August 2018 was \"the best 12-month stretch in 23 years.\")  The reason for this result is likely multifaceted. Oil prices dropping, healthy job numbers nationwide, and deregulation are all often cited reasons for the uptick. However, the decline in vehicle sales paired with uncertainty around trade might harm these numbers.  Also, while the number of manufacturing jobs continues to increase, the total is stil below its pre-recession level.  Employment Trump repeated the claim that \"more people are working today in the United States than ever before in our country.\"    Facts First: This is true but needs context.   In a way, this is the equivalent of Trump taking credit for a growing population. The more relevant statistic is the percentage of people who are participating in the labor force. That number, which is up recently, still remains below pre-recession levels.    Here's what we found when Trump made the same claim during his State of the Union address:    According to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total number of people employed in the US stands at 156,694,000. That works out to an employment-population ratio of 60.7 percent, according to data from the Federal Reserve, which is below the 64.7 percent ratio from April 2000. That figure from 2000 is the highest-ratio since 1948, when the Fed began mapping the data.   Immigration The President repeated the claim that one in three women are assaulted on the journey to the US southern border.   Facts First: This appears to be somewhat true though there are reasons to be skeptical of the data it's based on.     Trump made a similar claim during a speech on immigration in January. \"One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims by far of our broken system,\" he said. \"This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.\"    Here's what we found at the time:   Indeed, the trek to the US-Mexico border has been reported to be violent. According to data from Doctors Without Borders, 68.3% of migrants and refugees \"entering Mexico reported being victims of violence during their transit toward the United States,\" and nearly one-third of women said they'd been sexually abused. But this very violence is also why women have chosen to travel in caravans.    This data from Doctors Without Borders, however, is measuring a small group of migrant women and more data is needed to accurately assess the number of women that are assaulted, physically or sexually.   Stock market    Touting the decrease in food stamp recipients, more manufacturing jobs and other successes, Trump said that if Hillary Clinton had won in 2016 the stock market would have gone down 50%, claiming that it \"was heading down\" before he took office. Was it really going down?    Facts First: No.     CNN Business reported at the end of 2016 that the \"Dow closed 2016 more than 4,300 points above its January low of 15,451,\" finishing out the year with a 13.4% gain.    All three major indexes saw gains in 2016, with the NASDAQ up 7.5% and the S&P 500 gaining 9.5%.     RELATED: The Obama economy in 10 charts    Obama's tenure saw a near tripling of the S&P 500, mostly due to very low interest rates and recovery from the recession.     Trump's claim that the stock markets were \"heading down\" is not correct.       California forest management Trump also poked fun at California's canceled bullet train, said he liked Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and claimed that the forest fires in California had been caused, at least in part, by a lack of forest management.      \"When I'm with (Newsom) face-to-face, nice guy. When he speaks about me, not so nice, but face-to-face he loves me,\" Trump said before suggesting that California needs some \"forest money.\" \"I think they need some forest money because, honestly,\" said Trump, \"the management of the forest is very bad and that's one of the problems they have.\"    \"Gotta clean it up. It's called management. When a tree falls you can't let the environmentalists say you can't take that tree out. Becomes like a matchstick, that tree. It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves, every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves.\"    Facts First: This is claim is more nuanced than Trump's previous statements on forest management, but it still overstated. He also misses what is involved in \"forest management.\"   Experts do cite a lack of forest management among a list of reasons some California wildfires have been so large. However, Trump is overemphasizing this factor.  The primary reason these fires have been so devastating is windy and extremely dry conditions. And not all of these fires -- like the Woolsey Fire -- were in forest areas.     Additionally, almost 60% of the forests in California are managed by the federal government, not California's government. The majority of the remainder is privately owned.   Lastly, forest management is much more complicated than removing dead leaves and fallen branches as Trump claimed. Often it involves tree-thinning and the removal of smaller trees -- but there are many different methods of forest management based on the terrain type, among other factors.   Abortion Invoking the recent story of the \"Covington kids\" (where video of high school students approached by Native American activists created a media firestorm) CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp claimed on Saturday that New York and Virginia governors supported post-birth abortions.  \"How many of you followed this Covington story?\" Schlapp asked the CPAC audience Saturday. \"Do you know why they came to the nation's capital? They came to the nation's capital to march against what the governor of Virginia and the governor of New York want to see happen, which is literally post-birth abortions.\"   Facts First: Recent legislation introduced in Virginia and New York has sought to ease restrictions on certain third-trimester abortions. Much of the current controversy stems from a radio interview Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam gave, in which he made some odd claims on proposed abortion legislation that created confusion around the bill. But Schlapp's characterization of the legislation in New York and Virginia is not accurate.   Trump made a similar claim regarding New York and Virginia during his State of the Union address. Here's what we found in our SOTU fact check:    New York The Reproductive Health Act, signed into law by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in January, allows for abortions after 24 weeks if an authorized health care practitioner determines that \"the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health\" or if \"there is an absence of fetal viability.\"    New York's new law expands access to abortions into the third trimester by loosening restrictions on when the procedure is permitted. Previously, an abortion could only be performed after 24 weeks if the physician deemed it necessary to preserve the life of the mother. Under the new law, the requirement has been expanded to include the general health of the mother.    Virginia   Virginia Democratic Delegate Kathy Tran recently sponsored legislation that would have relaxed certain requirements around third-trimester abortions in the state.    Under current state law, third-trimester abortions can only be performed if three doctors agree the \"pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman.\" The failed bill would have reduced the number of physicians needed to approve the abortion to one, and removed \"substantially and irremediably\" from the language of justification for the abortion.   During a committee hearing on the now defunct bill, Tran was asked \"how late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?\" \"Through the third trimester,\" Tran responded, clarifying that there was no limit in the proposed bill for when an abortion could be performed prior to the birth.    Northam was asked about Tran's comments in a Jan. 30 interview with the radio station WTOP. Northam began to explain what he thought occurs in such an instance. His comments sparked confusion and controversy among abortion opponents.    \"The infant would be delivered,\" Northam said, \"the infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\"    Later, a spokesperson for Northam said his \"comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman in those circumstances [i.e. nonviable pregnancy and severe fetal abnormalities] went into labor.\"    This clarification, however, does not address the statement made by Northam that \"the infant would be delivered.\"    By the numbers    According to the Guttmacher Institute -- an organization focused on sexual and reproductive health -- \"slightly more than 1% of abortions are performed at 21 weeks or later.\" From states that report abortion procedures to the CDC, 638,169 abortions were performed in the US during 2015.  The battle over abortion legislation continues to rage in state capitals around the country. Nothing is expected to come from the currently divided Congress. In February, the US Supreme Court blocked Louisiana's Unsafe Abortion Protection Act from taking effect. The law would have required a doctor to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where the abortion is performed. Opioids While discussing the opioid epidemic and illicit drugs, Fox News contributor Sara Carter told CPAC's audience that in the height of the crisis, places in Ohio ran out of room for bodies in the morgues and had to put some in freezer trailers outside. \"I've never seen anything quite like this then when I went to the epicenter in Ohio and other states who are facing this crisis,\" said Carter, \"where the morgues were so overflowing with bodies that they had to rent freezer trailers to put the children in the freezer trailers outside of the mortuary.\"  Facts First: This is true.   Initially, Carter's claim was met with skepticism online, with some accusing her of overblowing the opioid crisis.    As CNN reported, the state of Ohio purchased several mobile morgues (trucks that have refrigerated trailers) in the mid-2000s. Originally, the trailers were meant to be used for emergency\/mass casualty incidents like mass shootings and so forth. Several times in 2015 and 2016 some morgues in Ohio had to use the trailers due to overcrowded morgues, with officials citing overdose deaths as the primary cause of the overflow.   In 2017, Ohio Coroner in Montgomery County Dr. Kent Harshbarger told CNN \"overdoses are coming in all the time and we're constantly full on a day-to-day basis.\"   Tax cuts While praising President Donald Trump during his remarks at CPAC, Vice President Mike Pence listed off some of the accomplishments he believes the administration has made in its first two years. Among them, of course, was the 2017 tax reform.  \"With the support of this generation of conservatives, President Trump signed the largest tax cut and tax reform in American history,\" the Vice President said. \"That's promises made and promises kept.\"  Facts First: The tax cut Trump signed into law in December 2017 was certainly large, but the largest? No.  When it comes to measuring the size of these tax reforms, many studies look at how the federal tax revenue lost from the cut compares as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over time.  An analysis from CNN on this very claim found that Trump's tax reform comes in at around -1.1% of GDP.  By this measurement, the 2017 tax reform is below at least six previous tax cuts passed under presidents including Obama, George W. Bush, John F. Kennedy, and Reagan. When looking at the current inflation-adjusted dollar amount the tax reform would cost, it still comes in under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, and the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 according to data from the Treasury Department.  No matter how many times the administration makes this claim, it's still incorrect.   Dead cows During the second day of CPAC, several speakers made jokes (some more seriously than others) about the Green New Deal, specifically suggesting that Democrats are looking to get rid of cows.  Referencing the Green New Deal resolution, former Deputy Assistant to President Trump Sebastian Gorka claimed that Democrats \"'want to take your pickup truck, they want to rebuild your home, they want to take away your hamburgers. This is what Stalin dreamt about but never achieved.\" Sen. Ted Cruz, too, made reference to the removal of cows. \"I hope to see PETA supporting the Republican party,\" he said, \"now that the Democrats want to kill all the cows.\" Rep. Mark Meadows joined in on the joke, suggesting that Chick-Fil-A's stock will increase with Democrats \"trying to get rid of all the cows,\" citing the Green New Deal.   Facts First: Getting rid of cows was mentioned in a now-removed FAQ on the Green New Deal but is not in the actual resolution. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's team released an FAQ following the Green New Deal resolution. Dealing with the question of why the resolution focused on \"100% clean and renewable\" energy as opposed to \"100% renewable\" the FAQ explained that \"we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.\"  Those 18 words set off a wave of attacks from conservatives and Republicans, quickly becoming a focal point of their criticism of the Green New Deal. (The upcoming cover of the conservative magazine National Review features Ocasio-Cortez surrounded by cattle.)  The FAQ was later renounced by Ocasio-Cortez and her team, with her Chief of Staff Saikat Chakrabarti tweeting that an \"early draft of a FAQ that was clearly unfinished and that doesn't represent the GND resolution got published to the website by mistake.\"   Regarding agriculture, the resolution does not mention cows but focuses on \"working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.\"  This story is breaking and being updated. ","216":" (CNN)One of K-pop's biggest idols has dramatically quit the entertainment industry after it emerged he is being investigated on suspicion of violating South Korea's prostitution law. The youngest member of K-Pop mega-group Big Bang, Seungri made the announcement on his official Instagram account on Tuesday.    \"I think I'd better leave the entertainment industry at this moment,\" he wrote. \"I just cannot bear causing any further damage to people around me, while being hated and criticized by the public and being treated as a nation's enemy during the investigation.\" Seungri has for years maintained the squeaky-clean image required of South Korean entertainers. But in recent months a scandal dogging the Burning Sun nightclub in Seoul, which Seungri sat on the board of, had put that reputation in danger. It had also caused some to question how clean-cut K-pop idols really are. The Burning Sun club, located in the upscale Gangnam neighborhood, faces allegations of bribery, violence against customers, securing prostitutes for VIPs, rape, drug trafficking and drug use, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Police. Numerous women have come forward with claims of being assaulted or drugged at the club, which the authorities have been investigating for two months.  Burning Sun last month posted a statement on social media saying it was \"actively cooperating\" with the police. It had also promised to introduce measures to protect customers, including female security officers and extra surveillance cameras. But since then the hotel in which it is located said Burning Sun has opted to end its lease early and close. The club did not respond to a request for comment. Last month, 28-year-old Seungri, who also oversaw publicity for Burning Sun, resigned from the club's board. Neither Seungri or his label, YG Entertainment, responded to CNN's request for comment, but a statement from the label said that he and its executives were cooperating with police. According to multiple reports, Seungri apologized on stage at a concert on February 14 and canceled events in Osaka and Jakarta this month. But, in the end, those efforts were not enough to save his career. \"I'm truly grateful for all my fans in Korea and in the world for showing much love for the past 10 years,\" he wrote on social media. \"I feel that I need to end it here for the reputation of YG and Big Bang.\"  Spiraling scandal  K-Pop stars are expected to conform to notoriously high standards of conduct, both from their management and fans. Their labels impose restrictions on who and how publicly they can date, what they wear and how they behave in public. Big Bang has been at the forefront of the K-Pop industry since its debut in 2006, and was the first Korean group to win the Best Worldwide Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2011. That success put additional pressure on Seungri. CedarBough Saeji, an expert in Korean culture and society at the University of British Columbia, said that for K-Pop stars: \"Their every public moment is a product to be consumed as representative of the nation, representative of ideal behavior, and representative of performative talent.\"  Jenna Gibson, a Korea expert at the University of Chicago, said that if the allegations against Seungri and Burning Sun were true, \"this level of scandal goes beyond anything we've seen in recent memory\" in K-pop. Drug laws are exceptionally strict in South Korea and drug use is also rare. Only about 7,800 arrests were made in 2017, according to the Korean Statistical Information Service, in a country of more than 51 million people.  Celebrities caught with even small amounts of marijuana can find themselves suspended by labels or forced to make public apologies.   \"Scandals involving drinking, drugs or even dating not only make waves in the entertainment news section but also the finance news section,\" Bernie Cho, a Korean music industry executive, told CNN last year.  \"Many of the biggest Korean music management companies are also publicly traded stocks on the Korean stock exchange. Sensational headlines can take a serious hit on the bottom line.\" Often in the wake of a scandal, labels and stars will cancel events -- as Seungri has done -- and postpone record releases until attention in the story wanes.  Gibson predicted Seungri might choose to begin his mandatory military service early in order to get out of the public eye.  All South Korean men are required to perform between 18 and 21 months of public service, something that can be devastating for entertainers' careers. But in this case it could benefit Seungri.  Gender divide  Fresh accusations around the Burning Sun scandal have been appearing in the Korean press almost every day. There is huge public appetite for the story because part of the case resonates with an ongoing reckoning with attitudes in South Korea towards women, said Korean culture expert Saeji. Last year, tens of thousands of women took to the streets of Seoul to protest against an epidemic of illegal filming and sexual harassment, under the slogan \"My Life is Not Your Porn.\"  An increasingly active women's movement has also taken aim at the country's gender divide and pay gap, one of the worst in the developed world, which President Moon Jae-in has described as \"shameful\" and pledged to improve. In 2018, the country ranked 30 out of 36 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations for women's employment, even though it has the highest tertiary education rate of the group for women aged 25 to 34.  Politics is particularly unequal. Women hold just 17% of seats in South Korea's parliament, according to the World Bank. Saeji said that the Burning Sun scandal came at a time when such issues \"are being faced by society more directly than ever before.\"  Like the spy cam epidemic -- which exposed a constant unease many South Korean women felt about being watched, both in public and private -- the nightclub scandal, particularly the allegations regarding date rape and sexual assault, has painted a picture of a predatory environment many women know only too well.  \"Many Korean women have had unfortunate or scary experiences at clubs, and some men are also aware and outraged about this sort of predatory and illegal behavior,\" Saeji said.  The presence of Seungri on the board, who as a K-Pop star \"presumed to represent the best role model for young Korean men,\" only heightens the anger over it, she added.","217":"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)The languid whack of a ceiling fan stirs the heat around the Intensive Care Unit. It's the only sound on the ward. Because there is none of the life-saving equipment an ICU should have. A solitary oxygen cylinder is the only object that separates the modern scene from the medieval.  There are three ICU patients in the State University Hospital of Haiti that occupies two blocks of the capital's downtown area. The rest died, or left. \"The majority of patients have fled since the troubles began (when Haiti was hit by widespread rioting). We don't have any records anymore, really. But as you can see -- there are hardly any patients,\" said junior doctor Wislet Andre -- one of only two still working in the facility. He specialized in emergency medicine, but the emergency room was deserted. Violent protests and unrest have gripped Haiti since February 7, with demonstrators calling for President Jovenel Moise to resign over soaring inflation and corruption allegations. Protesters have clashed with police on the streets, cars have been set ablaze and several people have been killed. The government on Sunday called on the Haitian population to return to normal activities on Monday.  The country's capital, Port-au-Prince, has seen especially heavy violence on the second anniversary of Moise taking office.  Many more were injured. Reliable official figures don't exist because \"many people have been hurt but are lying in their homes because they cannot get to the hospital for treatment,\" says Dr. Cadet Joseph. Nine days after the riots began a relative calm returned. Many streets were strewn with cobblestones, thrown by demonstrators demanding Moise stand down.  Hundreds gathered to stock up on petrol, cooking gas and water, which locals say is getting scarce.  \"The hospital has been besieged for nearly 10 days. We can't get doctors through the demonstrators and we cannot get medicines in, even if we had them. But to be honest this is normal for this hospital -- we don't have medicines, we don't have any working equipment. \"So this is normal,\" said Dr. Andre. \"Except that usually there are patients everywhere.\" Over the last two years, the doctor says, patients have had to buy their own medications, dressings, all their medical supplies and come to the wards for treatment. Now many rooms are entirely empty. Broken blood pressure reading machines lined one corridor, their tubed and wires hanging to the ground. Patients have no where else to go In the ICU, a 46-year-old identified only as Robenson lies inert. His legs are swollen so badly his skin has cracked. He says he's been here since December -- he's one of only three patients in an eight-bed room.  \"There is nowhere else for me to go,\" he says. \"Or I would have gone.\" Nearby in another room Claudette, who said she did not know her age but appeared to be at least 70, sat propped up in a bed. Dr. Andre explained that like an unwanted child, Claudette had been left at the hospital by a family that could not care for her. \"They said they'd be back for her -- but I don't think they will come,\" he sighs. Chickens wander the grounds outside that serve as a graveyard for abandoned, broken vehicles.  More protests have been called for this week by a wide range of opposition groups. Local radio stations broadcast locations where demonstrators are expected to gather. More than 100 Canadian tourists were evacuated by plane during the apparent lull in violence, but many other groups of expatriate aid workers remain cut off as Haiti braces for another bout of chaos and bloodletting. Haiti's Prime Minister Jean-Henry Ceant stepped in last on Saturday night with a televised address to the nation, calling for calm and promising to root out the corruption -- which for many is at the root of the country's problems. Referring to the government's own auditor's report into how revenues from Venezuelan subsidized oil were siphoned off, he said: \"Corruption is one of the biggest problems. We need to fight corruption. \"I promise to find where the Petrocaribe money went. We need to make and example of the people who stole the Petrocaribe money,\" he vowed, referring to the Caribbean oil alliance. How much Haitians will accept will determine the violence and extent of protests promised for the coming days.  It may mean patients can return to the hospital, but it won't solve the drugs and equipment shortages.","218":"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump conveyed optimism about the American economy on Friday, despite a new jobs report showing that the US added only 20,000 jobs in February --  a surprisingly low number that bucked the trend of huge jobs gains in recent months. Trump, while departing from the White House, was asked if 20,000 jobs -- the fewest jobs gained in a month since September 2017 -- was good enough for him.  \"It's a step,\" Trump said, adding, \"I think you'll probably find out it averages out.\"  Trump has made the economy a centerpiece of his presidency, and routinely celebrates the monthly jobs and GDP reports as well as strong stock market performance -- but has been quick to blame others, including the head of the Federal Reserve, when results are weaker than he wants.  The stock market fell 200 points at the open before recovering slightly, though Trump pointed out that it's still doing well -- one of his favorite performance yardsticks.  \"Certainly since my election it's up, getting close to 50 percent,\" Trump said.  He also found a silver lining in Friday's weak numbers, pointing out the uptick in worker pay.  \"I think the big news really was that wage growth is up. And that's great for the American worker,\" Trump said. Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, speaking on Bloomberg, called the number \"an absolute fluke.\" \"There are a million reasons for that, winter seasonals, the government shutdown, the scoring of it, classification of people working and non-working,\" Kudlow said. \"I think it's crazy.\" According to the new jobs report, unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, as fewer unemployed people were looking for work. The Labor Department suggested that furloughed workers returning to work after the government shutdown also contributed to the lower unemployment rate. Trump also suggested that the economy will benefit if he can close a trade agreement with China, which has struggled with a slowing economy in part due to Trump's tariffs.  \"I think as soon as these trade deals are done, if they get done, and we're working with China. We'll see what happens,\" Trump said, adding \"But I think you're going to see a very big spike.\"  \"A lot of people are waiting to see what happens with the China deal. We'll be submitting to Congress very shortly,\" he continued. ","219":" (CNN)Universities are working to contain the fallout from allegations that families with money and clout paid bribes for their children to attend eight prestigious institutions. They're facing questions about the fates of students involved and whether they knew about their parents' alleged acts. And, at a time of year when colleges are whittling down the mountain of applications and sending out acceptance letters, they're having to look for prospective students who might be connected to the scandal.  Fifty people -- including Hollywood stars, top CEOs, college coaches and standardized test administrators -- allegedly took part in the scheme to cheat on tests and admit students to leading institutions as athletes, regardless of their abilities. At least eight universities are named in a federal indictment and criminal complaint.  Thirty-three parents face charges in the investigation dubbed \"Operation Varsity Blues,\" according to Andrew Lelling, US attorney for Massachusetts.  William Rick Singer, the plot's accused mastermind, allegedly told prospective clients that he created a \"side door\" for wealthy families to get their children into top US colleges. Singer was paid roughly $25 million by parents to help their children get into the schools, the US attorney said. He pleaded guilty Tuesday to racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of justice, prosecutors said. While the names of the students involved have not been released, universities are scrambling to contain the fallout from a scandal that spans several states and raises questions about whether qualified students were denied entry to accommodate children of the rich and famous.  The prosecutor also raised the possibility that students could be charged, and at least one university has said it will deny admission to applicants connected to the alleged scam. Here's what some of the universities involved are saying: University of Southern California The University of Southern California is at the epicenter of the scandal, with some of the biggest names linked to it, including actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli.  The school plans to use any money received in connection with the alleged scheme to fund scholarships for underprivileged students, interim President Wanda M. Austin said. University spokesman Gary Polakovic said that all applicants connected to the cheating scam would be denied admission. A review will be conducted for enrolled students, and USC will make informed, appropriate decisions after it's completed, he said, adding that some of the students involved may have been minors at the time of their application process.  By Friday morning, the university released a statement saying it had identified six students in the current admissions cycle who would be denied admission to USC.  UCLA UCLA has put its men's soccer head coach Jorge Salcedo on leave as he faces a charge of conspiracy to commit racketeering.  While the university has said it's not aware of any student-athletes who are under suspicion, it said it's reviewing the allegations as it relates to admissions decisions.   \"We take the integrity of our admission process and the authenticity of the application data we consider very seriously,\" the university said. \"All students applying to a UC campus must sign a statement certifying the validity and accuracy of all information related to their application.\" If a prospective, admitted or enrolled student misrepresented any aspect of an application, the university said it will take disciplinary actions, including cancellation of admission. Stanford University Stanford University has fired head sailing coach John Vandemoer, who pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy. He allegedly  accepted financial contributions to the sailing program in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission to Stanford. \"Neither student came to Stanford; one student was initially denied admission and intended to reapply but never did, and the second never completed an application,\" the university said in a statement.  Stanford said it has no evidence that the allegations involved anyone else but said it will conduct an internal review to confirm that. Georgetown University  Georgetown University's former tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, is charged in the scheme. The university said he has not coached the tennis team since December 2017 after an internal investigation concluded he had violated university admission rules.  \"The investigation found that Mr. Ernst had violated University rules concerning admissions, and he separated from the University in 2018. The University was not aware of any alleged criminal activity or acceptance of bribes by Mr. Ernst until it was later contacted by the US Attorney's Office,\" the university said in a statement.  It said it's cooperating with investigators, and described Ernst's alleged actions as \"shocking, highly antithetical to our values, and violate numerous university policies and ethical standards.\" University spokesman Matt Hill said there's no indication any other Georgetown employees were involved.  He declined to comment on students involved, citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.   \"We are reviewing the details of the indictment and will be taking appropriate action,\" he said of the university in Washington. CNN has reached out to Ernst, who now coaches at the University of Rhode Island. The school placed him on administrative leave and said he's not involved in recruiting current players or signing new ones. Yale University  The former head coach of Yale University's women's soccer team conspired with Singer to accept bribes in exchange for designating Yale applicants as recruits for the team, according to a court filing. Rudolph \"Rudy\" Meredith was the head coach for more than 20 years. In 2015, he agreed to work with Singer, according to the filing. A spokesman for Yale said the university is a  \"victim of a crime perpetrated by its former women's soccer coach.\"  President Peter Salovey said the New Haven, Connecticut, school plans to implement several changes. The school will conduct an investigation to determine whether \"others have been involved in activities that have corrupted the athletic recruitment and admissions process,\" Salovey said in a letter to the college community on Friday. Yale will use external advisers who will suggest changes that will help the college \"detect and prevent efforts to defraud the admission process,\" he added. Salovey said officials are working to implement a code of conduct for athletic recruitment. Wake Forest University The university in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said it put volleyball head coach Bill Ferguson on leave after he was charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering. \"The indictment alleges Ferguson accepted financial payments to influence the admission of a student that had previously been placed on the waitlist,\" Wake Forest President Nathan Hatch wrote in an email to students, faculty and staff Wednesday. Hatch said the university is reviewing admissions and athletics practices, but so far it appears Ferguson acted independently and was the only person involved with the alleged misconduct.  \"No other university employees, including admissions officers or other athletics staff, have been implicated in the investigation,\" Hatch wrote.  University of Texas at Austin The University of Texas at Austin dismissed its men's tennis coach, Michael Center, a day after placing him on leave. Center is charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.  President Gregory L. Fenves said he has asked the vice president for legal affairs to conduct a review of Center's alleged 2015 fraud and determine whether the university has the necessary rules and procedures in place to prevent future violations. University of San Diego The university said it's cooperating in the investigation, and it has no reason to believe its admission team or coaching staff are involved.  \"To ensure that we have taken all the appropriate steps to respond, we are conducting an internal review. Should that review uncover any violations of USD policies, we will take appropriate action,\" President James T. Harris III wrote in a letter to alumni.  \"As you know, our admissions and recruiting policies are grounded in a commitment to integrity and ethical conduct -- principles that are embedded in our mission. The government's investigation reflects conduct that is neither condoned nor tolerated at USD.\" ","220":" (CNN)The son of a woman who was a \"true fan\" of Johnson & Johnson's Baby Powder, who made it a \"necessary part of our hygienic routine,\" testified before lawmakers on Tuesday, asking for help for women like his mother, who died of ovarian cancer after regularly using talc-based powder. \"I ask that this body use whatever power in its disposal to assist in bringing about justice for my mother,\" Marvin Salter said.  Salter's mother, Jackie Fox, sued J&J after she was diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer in 2013. She did not live to see the trial in 2016, but a jury awarded her family $72 million. The decision was later overturned. Salter testified before the House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, which wanted a closer look at the science that may link talc to cancer.  Talc is found in cosmetics, powders and personal care products. It's also widely used in paints and industrial materials. Subcommittee Chairman Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Illinois, opened the hearing by citing the actions of accessories company Claire's, which recalled three of its own-brand cosmetics Monday after the Food and Drug Administration detected tremolite asbestos in them. The products contained talc, a mineral that is often found near asbestos when it is mined and that can become contaminated, according to the FDA website. \"Let's be clear: There is no question that exposure to asbestos is hazardous to human health,\" Krishnamoorthi said. Labeling the FDA's regulatory power \"weak\" and in need of reform, he added, \"the FDA cannot order any manufacturers to recall these personal care or cosmetics products that potentially contain asbestos. The question is, why? Because a loophole in the statute that empowers the FDA to regulate personal care products and cosmetics does not allow the FDA to require necessary recalls.\" By law, companies don't have to tell customers if there have been adverse events related to their cosmetic or personal care products. Recalls and warning labels are all done on a voluntary basis. These products do not need to be reviewed or approved by the FDA.  \"To be clear, there are currently no legal requirements for any cosmetic manufacturer marketing products to American consumers to test their products for safety,\" outgoing FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement last week. The agency routinely monitors the market for any public health risk, he added. It found no asbestos contamination in a 2010 survey of 34 cosmetic products that used talc. Gottlieb said his agency will continue to work with the industry to make sure it is safe. Krishnamoorthi said at Tuesday's hearing that customers are taking action with or without the government. \"Juries across America are not waiting for Congress to act,\" he said.  Lawsuits are making their way through the courts on behalf of people who claim that talc-based powders are contaminated with asbestos and that powder has caused them to develop mesothelioma.  In some cases, lawyers have argued that J&J, the company that makes Baby Powder, knew that its products were contaminated with asbestos for decades and have introduced internal company documents to that effect. J&J says its products do not contain asbestos. Since the 1970s, talc used in all consumer products has been legally required to be asbestos-free. In December, Johnson & Johnson's stock fell 10% after a Reuters report said the company knew for decades that asbestos was in its Baby Powder.  Thousands of separate but related lawsuits were filed by women who claim that they got ovarian cancer after using talc-based powder as part of their daily feminine hygiene routines. Krishnamoorthi thanked several of those women and their families who went to Tuesday's hearing. The debate over a link between talcum powder and cancer has been growing in the scientific community. Some studies have found that women face an increased risk of ovarian cancer with the use of talc in the genital area, but others do not. Most suggest that more research is needed. In an SEC filing in December, Johnson & Johnson said it would cooperate with \"government inquiries\" and subpoenas to produce documents related to the matter from the Department of Justice, the Securities Exchange Commission and Sen. Patty Murray, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. At Tuesday's hearing, Dr. Anne McTiernan said she believes that \"increasing the amount of exposure to talcum powder products in the genital area resulted in an increasing risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer.\"  McTiernan is a witness in one of the multidistrict lawsuits against the makers of talcum powder and conducted a systematic review of the science involving talc and cancer.  Looking at 38 studies conducted over the past 40 years that included 14,000 women with cancer and a greater number without cancer, McTiernan found that the women had a statistically significant (22% to 31%) increased risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer compared with women who did not use talcum powder in the genital area. She believes that talc use may cause an inflammatory response and that the inflammation may be one pathway for cancer to develop. \"Women need to know about the risks of using talcum powder products in their genital areas,\" McTiernan said Tuesday. \"All consumers need to be warned about the contents of these products, including asbestos and fibrous talc, so that they can make informed decisions about use.\" Testifying on behalf of the nonprofit nonpartisan environmental organization Environmental Working Group, Scott Faber said that there is \"always some risk that the products produced with talc contain this dangerous carcinogen.\"  Faber, the group's vice president of government affairs, said his organization has found 2,000 cosmetic and personal care products that contain talc. But, he added, makeup it tested contained 88 chemicals linked to cancer, birth defects and reproductive harm in men and women. \"Cosmetics have fallen into a regulatory black hole,\" Faber testified.  Johnson & Johnson was not called to testify, nor were any cosmetic companies asked to speak. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of consumers and maintaining their trust in our products,\" Ernie W. Knewitz, vice president of media relations for J&J, said in a statement Tuesday. \"We have long supported legislation to modernize the US FDA's regulatory authority over cosmetics and personal care products, and believe this reform is essential to enabling the agency to increase their ability to protect the public. We are committed to continuing to work with Congress and the FDA to advance meaningful change. \"As it pertains to today's hearing, the testimony was biased with a majority of witnesses being connected to litigation against our company. As a result, decades of studies concluding that Johnson's Baby Powder is free of asbestos and safe to use were not discussed, and the subcommittee did not hear the preponderance of evidence that supports the safety of our product,\" he wrote.  \"For decades, global independent laboratories and health authorities have tested Johnson's Baby Powder and have never found asbestos. In 2010, the US FDA surveyed a range of cosmetic products, including Johnson's Baby Powder and the source talc used in the product, and confirmed that it did not contain asbestos. In a March 5, 2019 statement, the FDA reaffirmed these findings stating the results 'found no traces of asbestos contamination using the most sensitive techniques available.' \"","221":"New York (CNN Business)The tragic Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday is raising doubts on Wall Street about Boeing. Boeing's (BA) stock closed down 5% on Monday in the aftermath of the second deadly crash of its bestselling 737 MAX 8 jet in five months. All 157 people on board the Ethiopian Airlines flight were killed when the plane fell out of the sky shortly after takeoff. The stock opened down more than twice as much before recovering throughout the day. The sharp selloff reflected the serious crisis Boeing has on its hands. Almost three-quarters of Boeing's 2018 deliveries were 737 planes. And Boeing plans to build 59 new 737s each month in 2019.  The loss of life in the Sunday crash poses serious safety questions for Boeing and regulators investigating the incidents. China, Indonesia and several other airlines have already grounded the 737 MAX 8, raising the pressure on Boeing.  However, US carriers American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest (LUV) expressed confidence in the Boeing jet. And the US Federal Aviation Administration said Monday that it has deemed 737 MAX planes airworthy, which means it will allow US airlines to continue flying them. Boeing declined as much as 13.5% Monday morning, briefly putting the stock on track for its worst session since September 17, 2001, the first day of trading following the 9\/11 terror attacks.  The stock's volatility on Monday played an outsized role dragging down the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average. Boeing is the index's most expensive stock \u2014 and the index is price-weighted. The Ethiopian Airlines crash comes after a 737 MAX flown by Lion Air crashed off the coast of Indonesia in late October. All 189 passengers onboard the Lion Air flight died. Boeing said in a statement on Sunday that it is \"deeply saddened\" by the crash and extends its \"heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board.\" The company said a technical team will be at the crash site to provide assistance.  The Boeing selloff may be exaggerated by the fact that the stock had been vastly outperforming the broader market. As of Friday's close, Boeing was up 44% since Christmas Eve. Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), which makes 737 MAX 8 fuselages, closed down 4%.","222":"New York (CNN Business)Saudi Arabia has officially been elevated to an emerging market, a milestone that should steer billions of dollars into the country's stock market as the kingdom seeks to diversify away from oil. Saudi stocks joined the FTSE Russell Emerging Markets Index on Monday, beginning a process that was first announced last year. The kingdom's stock market was also added to several emerging market and global benchmarks run by S&P Dow Jones. In May, Saudi Arabia will join the even more closely-followed MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EEM).  The inclusions in prominent emerging market indexes will clear the way for investors to plow more cash into Saudi Arabia. Passive money, mainly in the form of ETFs, is especially sensitive to these classification changes. \"It provides a seal of approval that means a lot to institutional clients,\" said Erik Zipf, head of emerging markets equities at DuPont Capital, an asset manager owned by DowDuPont (DWDP) that controls $27 billion. The additions of Saudi stocks to global benchmarks will take place in phases over the next year or two. About $15 billion is expected to flow into Saudi Arabia's stock market from passive investors alone once the kingdom is fully included in the FTSE Russell and MSCI benchmarks, according to Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange. \"The inclusion into these pre-eminent indices is a testament to growing investor confidence in the Saudi market and reflects the successful implementation of far-ranging capital market reforms,\" Khalid Al Hussan, CEO of Tadawul, said in a statement. Saudi Arabia's upgrade to emerging market status comes despite sharp criticism of the kingdom following the October 2018 death and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi. The Washington Post columnist was critical of the Saudi government. The CIA concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally ordered Khashoggi's murder.  FTSE Russell declined to comment on whether it reconsidered including Saudi Arabia following the Khashoggi murder. S&P did not respond to a request for comment. Saudi stocks took a hit during the backlash over the Khashoggi murder. The iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (KSA) fell sharply last fall but has since rebounded. The ETF is up 12% so far this year.  DuPont Capital's Zipf said that the Khashoggi controversy has made Saudi Arabia a trickier place to invest in. \"It increased the political risk,\" he said. Steps to modernize Saudi Arabia Index providers like S&P and MSCI typically decide to include countries in emerging market benchmarks due to capital market reforms.  \"That's the primary driver. It's a separate issue from ethical or other feelings,\" Zipf said.  Saudi Arabia has sought to diversify its oil-dependent economy through a bold reform program known as Vision2030. The plan aims to reduce Saudi Arabia's unemployment and build up the country's industrial, tourism and entertainment industries.  Vision2030 has also included social reforms, including ending the kingdom's controversial ban on women driving. That step was aimed in part at encouraging more women to enter Saudi Arabia's workforce.  \"Across the board, they are trying to take steps to modernize the economy,\" said Dan Petruzzi, DuPont's senior equity analyst. ","223":"New York (CNN Business)Kraft Heinz had one of the worst days imaginable Thursday. The company wrote down the value of its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands by $15 billion, posted a $12.6 billion loss, cut its dividend by 36% and announced its accounting practices are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Kraft Heinz (KHC) stock plunged as much as 20% in after-hours trading. Customers weren't the problem: Sales were up about 1% in the fourth quarter. Instead, Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees blamed the company's operations. Higher-than-expected manufacturing and logistics costs plagued Kraft Heinz. The company anticipated savings from its 2015 merger would continue to help lower costs, but those efficiencies dried up. \"We are overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year-end,\" Hees said on a conference call with investors Thursday. \"For that, we take full responsibility. And we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again by planning process, procedures and organization structure.\" The prices of many commodities that food companies use are rising, such as agricultural products and materials like aluminum and pulp for packaging. Transportation costs have also added pressure on food companies, in part because of a shortage of truckers in the United States. Kraft Heinz and other food companies have faced pressure from lower food prices and retailers like Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST). The company had been praised for its supply chain management after merging Kraft with Heinz. But rapidly rising costs pinched profits to such an extent that the company's earnings were about $1 billion below its own expectations. That forced it to write down two of its most recognizable brands as well as the company's Canadian business. Chief Financial Officer David Knopf said on a conference call with investors that the company's financial performance soured in the second half of the year. But he was adamant that Kraft Heinz still had more to gain from its merger. \"The synergies that we realized are very much intact,\" he said.  SEC probe Kraft Heinz also revealed that regulators are looking into matters \"including, but not limited to, agreements, side agreements, and changes or modifications to its agreements with its vendors.\" The SEC sent a subpoena related to the matter in October 2018. The company said it \"continues to cooperate fully with the probe.\" and said it launched an independent review of its procurement practices after it received the subpoena. Kraft Heinz said it recorded a $25 million increase to product costs as a result of that investigation. \"At this time the Company does not expect matters subject to the investigation to be material\" to its bottom line, the company said in an emailed statement. The SEC declined to comment. Dividend cut The maker of Velveeta cheese and Jell-O pudding also slashed its dividend by 22.5 cents to 40 cents a share \u2014 a 36% cut.  Kraft said cutting the dividend will help the company cut debt faster, improve the balance sheet, support its commercial investments and help the company divest businesses that aren't supporting the bottom line.  \"By doing this we can improve our growth and returns over time,\" said Hees. Hees told investors that \"we still believe in strongly that our model is working and has a lot of potential for the future.\"","224":"Washington (CNN)Senate Democrats pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about his financial holdings on Thursday, calling on the former financier to explain why there have been delays in certifying his required ethics disclosures. The government's chief ethics watchdog agency has yet to certify Mnuchin's 2018 financial disclosure, which was filed more than eight months ago. The delay in certification of Mnuchin's forms by the Office of Government Ethics was first reported last week by the nonprofit Center for Public Integrity. Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, asked the Treasury secretary at the Senate Finance hearing whether he had completely shed his interest in film production company, StormChaser Partners, founded by his wife, Louise Linton. \"What we have wondered is if there has been an exchange of an asset for a loan rather than a divestment,\" Wyden asked. Mnuchin responded that he has complied with rules according to certified career ethics officials inside the Treasury Department. \"I am advised by people at Treasury that I am fully in compliance and I have no ethical issues,\" Mnuchin said. The secretary declined to go into specifics about particular divestments of assets, but said that career staff at Treasury had been in ongoing discussions with OGE. \"I'm in compliance, I have been certified, and I look forward to them resolving whatever issues there are between them and OGE,\" Mnuchin told reporters following the hearing. The Treasury secretary sold his film and real estate businesses in 2017 for at least $15 million to avoid conflicts of interest. An OGE spokeswoman declined to comment when asked about Mnuchin's disclosures. The office did, however, say deadlines for certification have been extended because of the partial government shutdown earlier this year, to April 5. Trump's top finance chief is not the only member of Trump's cabinet waiting on ethics certifications. Last month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was found to have violated his ethics agreement, while also submitting an inaccurate financial disclosure form, according to OGE. OGE Director Emory Rounds wrote at the time that Ross reported in his annual financial disclosure that he sold bank stock that other reports indicate he did not sell.   Ross asked House Democrats before testifying Thursday if he could address questions in writing about his inaccurate financial report rather than be questioned in public. The Washington Post reported earlier this week that the request was granted by the Democratic chairman of the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings.","225":" (CNN)Malaysia's tourism minister has denied the existence of gay people in the country, according to reports in German media.  Ahead of attending the ITB Berlin travel fair, Tourism Minister Mohamaddin Ketapi told German reporters that he wasn't aware of gay people in the Muslim-majority Southeast Asian country. \"I don't think we have anything like that in our country,\" he said, responding to a question as to whether Malaysia would welcome gay travelers, according to German national broadcaster Deutsche Welle. He also sidestepped a question concerning the safety of LGBT and Jewish travelers in the country, according to the broadcaster.  Mohamaddin later posted a statement on Twitter stating that his response to the reporter's question referred to the non-existence of specific LGBT-focused tourist campaigns in the country.  He added that the country adopts an open policy in welcoming foreign tourists and would \"never (place) any unnecessary obstacles to our guests based on their sexual orientation, religion and cultural practices.\" The statement added that the country has, as a sovereign nation, its own views on both the LGBT community and Israel, and expected other nations to respect the country's sovereignty.  An aide told Malaysian online news portal Malaysiakini that the comments were made in a personal capacity, but were in line with official Malaysian government policy, which does not recognize the LGBT community.  The aide, who was not named in the report, added: \"Tourists coming to Malaysia like any other country are welcome regardless of their creed, sexuality, religion or color.\"  Condemnation Gay rights campaigner Thilaga Sulathireh told CNN that the remarks were \"outlandish (and) completely disconnected from reality\" but not entirely surprising to hear. \"With the exception of a few politicians, the rest hold varying degrees of discriminatory and exclusionary position on LGBTIQ people and issues, willfully or otherwise.\"  She added that it was \"also an embarrassingly ignorant comment which carries high socioeconomic costs,\" should it impact LGBT tourism to Malaysia.  The country's stance on homosexuality, as well as its alleged antisemitism -- in January this year it tried to ban Israeli athletes from an international swim meet -- had been criticized ahead of its participation at ITB Berlin.  German Green party politician Volker Beck had sought to exclude Malaysia from exhibiting at the Berlin event, one of the world's largest tourism expos, saying that its government has specific policies which are discriminatory to gay people and Jews. \"(A country embracing) homophobia and antisemitism cannot be a partner country,\" he said, according to Malaysiakini. Local news outlet Star Online reported that the deputy president of the opposition Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), Mah Hang Soon, condemned Mohamaddin's comments, saying that they made Malaysia a laughing stock.  He expressed disbelief at the minister's controversial response to what he said should have been a straightforward question to answer.  \"He was asked by a reporter if Malaysia is safe for homosexuals. All he needed to say was that Malaysia is a safe country and every tourist is safe here,\" he said. Ingrained homophobia Homophobia is ingrained in Malaysian politics and culture, and homosexual sex is illegal throughout Malaysia under colonial era criminal law. Veteran politician Anwar Ibrahim, widely viewed as the successor to current Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, has been jailed twice on sodomy charges -- once by Mahathir's government, and gay people are routinely punished by public lashing in Terengganu, a Sharia-practicing state to the east of the capital, Kuala Lumpur. An August 2018 raid on one of Kuala Lumpur's only gay clubs saw around 20 men charged for \"illicit behavior,\" and came shortly after a brutal attack on a trans woman in a city close to the capital.","226":"Samantha Vinograd is a CNN national security analyst. She served on President Obama's National Security Council from 2009-2013 and at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush. Follow her @sam_vinograd. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Here's this week's briefing:  Before high profile meetings, the intelligence community often provides the President with a strategic assessment of the state of play and what to expect when engaging with a foreign counterpart.  President Donald Trump may have disregarded these assessments in the past and sided with foreign leaders over US intelligence experts -- but if he does choose to read key analytic assessments ahead of his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, he could digest some analysis that would help him advance US national security objectives. Reality bites While Trump may want to continue touting the lack of North Korean nuclear tests as a sign of a diminished threat, the North Korean nuclear threat is arguably worse today than when he took office. He has discounted the US intelligence community's assessment  that Kim won't denuclearize so easily because the North Korean leader considers his weapons of mass destruction critical to regime survival.  North Korea may not have conducted a nuclear or missile test in more than a year, but according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, it has not frozen its development and production of nuclear weapons either. The short-term risk may be diminished because Kim is focused on behaving well enough to get concessions from the US. But North Korea's continued stockpiling and dispersal of nuclear weapons, according to a confidential UN report -- coupled with its likely perception that Trump is turning a blind eye to certain activities to safeguard his self-declared progress with Kim -- means that the regime still poses a big threat to the US and its allies. The President's perceived inability to honestly describe the threat hinders any negotiations underway. Candidly speaking with Kim about the threat he continues to pose may be the first step in any productive conversation focused on actual denuclearization. Because of this reality, getting Kim to agree to at least a nuclear freeze in Hanoi -- in exchange for a commensurate US concession like a freeze on more sanctions -- would help safeguard US national security.  Pretty little liar Undercutting the US intelligence community's assessment that Kim is unlikely to denuclearize, the White House has cited Kim's own words as proof that he means it when he says he'll denuclearize.   This may be a strategic move aimed at making Kim feel accountable and responsible for keeping his word, but North Korean leaders haven't shown themselves to be overly concerned with doing so in the past. Taking Kim's word over the US intelligence community's is both naive and dangerous. If Kim doesn't put any actual denuclearization steps on the table, it's time to call him out. Actions speak louder than words, especially when the stakes are nuclear. Expect peer pressure  With former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe alleging that Trump believed Russian President Vladimir Putin over the US intelligence community's assessments of North Korean nuclear capabilities, it raises an important strategic issue: Trump needs to stop getting guidance from abroad.  Several world leaders, including Putin and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, are probably trying to downplay the threat from North Korea while pressuring Trump to stay engaged with Kim because of their ulterior motives, which may be inimical to US national security objectives. Trump has relied on a shadow cabinet of foreign leaders in the past. In addition to reports he agreed to withdraw from Syria after speaking with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- he's taken a lot of direction from Moon when it comes to assessing Kim's intentions.  Going into Hanoi, the President should understand that he's expected to stick with negotiations in the face of peer pressure, even if denuclearization is not really on the table, and to announce landmark moves toward peace, even if Kim doesn't deserve it. Trump's peers are probably using any engagements they have with him to push him to declare peace on the peninsula, including perhaps an armistice agreement to end the Korean War, because it serves their interests even if it doesn't yet serve ours. Russia wants to maintain the status quo that keeps Kim in power and avoids the chances of a US military strike, possibly an increased US military presence in the region and a more pro-US leader rising to power in North Korea. China also wants to avoid a military confrontation. Plus, China is Kim's most important economic partner and stands to gain financially if sanctions are lifted and trade with North Korea can resume. President Xi Jinping will continue to advocate for talks to continue, and now Vietnam has a stake in the game as it hosts the second summit. South Korea is moving ahead with intra-Korean integration projects, so Moon may also try to hand Trump rose-colored glasses so that this diplomatic foray doesn't end. Kim wants a third date Trump should expect Kim to suggest a third meeting. Extending negotiations somewhere into the future buys Kim time, and time is on Kim's side. Trump has said he doesn't want to rush diplomacy with North Korea. Leaving aside the fact that Trump has criticized his predecessor's policy of \"strategic patience,\" every day Kim pretends to be \"negotiating\" means another day that he can spend making his nuclear arsenal, bigger, better and more dispersed. Even Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has emphasized the importance of continuing with diplomacy, has stated that North Korea hasn't frozen its nuclear program. Put the horse before the cart The White House has said that the President is focused on four priorities with Kim, based on the joint declaration he signed with the North Korean leader in June: transforming relations between the US and North Korea; establishing a permanent peace regime on the Korean peninsula; denuclearization; and the return of killed-in-action and missing-in-action Americans from the Korean War. (Kim did return some US troop remains after the Singapore summit.) But Kim will likely push to make denuclearization the last thing he addresses -- when it should instead be the basis for achieving US goals. North Korea's nuclear threat will continue to grow if we allow Kim to distract us with progress (real or superficial) in other areas. The President should emphasize that improving relations and establishing a permanent peace can only come after denuclearization. Make it official  If Trump is going to meaningfully engage Kim on denuclearization, he needs to move past photo ops and love letters and establish official ways to inventory North Korean assets. First, one way to make this happen is to get his team involved with Kim's. Any additional time US experts can spend with their North Korean counterparts can provide valuable insights into their behavior and intentions. Trump can do this by establishing official ties between the US and North Korea, whether it's through a diplomatic liaison office or expert level meetings on denuclearization. And, second, denuclearization isn't rocket science -- the International Atomic Energy Agency has a track record of developing, implementing and monitoring the denuclearization of various countries -- so Kim and Trump should invite them in to take stock of North Korean assets. Failing to digest the intelligence community's assessments will likely lead to more of the same -- continued North Korean nuclear proliferation, Kim's growing acceptance on the world stage, sanctions busting, and further US concessions like suspending joint military exercises -- all of which degrade US national security. ","227":" (CNN)The tip that triggered the investigation into the largest alleged collegiate entrance scam ever prosecuted came from a financial executive's last-ditch effort to squirm out of the crosshairs of federal authorities, a law enforcement official tells CNN. The executive, identified by the Wall Street Journal as Morrie Tobin, was being investigated as part of a separate financial fraud case and gave investigators enough information that they were able to identify William Rick Singer as the mastermind of the plot, the official said. Tobin faced two charges of securities fraud for his role in a pump-and-dump scheme involving the manipulation of stock from two companies he secretly owned. The Securities and Exchange Commission said the stock from both of those companies was artificially inflated for Tobin's own profit. He told investigators that Rudolph \"Rudy\" Meredith, the head women's soccer coach at Yale University, had sought a bribe in return for getting his daughter into the Ivy League school, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The coach conspired with Singer to accept bribes in exchange for designating Yale applicants as recruits for the team, according to a court filing. Meredith couldn't be reached for comment. What followed after that initial tip was a yearlong investigation that culminated with the arrest of Meredith and other coaches; parents, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin; cogs in the alleged scam, such as Mark Riddell, accused of taking tests for others or fixing scores; and the mastermind of the plot, Singer. Tobin has not been charged in the college admissions scam case but, the WSJ reports that he is awaiting sentencing in the securities fraud case in which he signed a plea agreement in November.    The details of the investigation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, bring into focus the effort by law enforcement to collect evidence against Singer, who made $25 million by running a scheme in which he bribed coaches and university administrators to designate the students as recruited athletes and also fixed SAT and ACT test scores.   \"I created a side door,\" Singer said in federal court on Tuesday as he pleaded guilty to four counts related to the multimillion dollar scam and admitted the case against him was accurate. \"So that was what made it so attractive to so many families is I created a guarantee.\" Investigators followed the transfers of money and eventually landed on Singer, the law enforcement official told CNN. Singer, knowing he was caught and facing a mountain of evidence, agreed to work with investigators in September, Assistant US Attorney Eric Rosen said Tuesday. Singer was instructed to continue meeting with parents, this time wearing a wire, and to follow through on agreements he was already working on, the official said. Investigators knew this was the busy season for Singer: Students were declaring schools and taking the standardized tests. Parents were also looking to guarantee their children's entrance into schools. Singer admitted during his hearing that he told the father of one prospective candidate that he was wearing a wire and that they shouldn't say anything illegal. \"You haven't done anything wrong yet so please don't say anything that would be harmful to you guys because you haven't done anything, which was absolutely illegal,\" Singer said. Prosecutors said in court that Singer had warned several clients that if they received a call from him, it would most likely be recorded. Singer had obstructed justice with at least six families who had either taken part in the scam or were planning to do it, prosecutors said. Both Huffman and Loughlin have made their initial court appearances and were released after posting bond. They will appear separately before a judge in Boston on March 29. Meredith, the former Yale soccer coach, is expected to go before a judge on March 28. He has not yet entered a plea.  Riddell, who is a counselor at a private school in Florida, is scheduled to appear in court in April. He has not yet entered a plea.  \"I want to communicate to everyone that I am profoundly sorry for the damage I have done and grief I have caused those as a result of my needless actions.\" Riddell said in a statement provided by his attorney. \"I understand how my actions contributed to a loss of trust in the college admissions process. I assume full responsibility for what I have done.\"  \"This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth combined with fraud,\" said US Attorney Andrew Lelling. \"There can be no separate college admission system for the wealthy, and I'll add that there will not be a separate criminal justice system either.\"","228":"Hong Kong (CNN Business)China's biggest online movie-ticketing platform flopped in its stock market debut in Hong Kong, becoming the latest disappointing tech listing in the city. Shares in Maoyan Entertainment, which is backed by Chinese internet giant Tencent (TCEHY), fell as much as 5.4% in early trading Monday. The stock closed down 1%.  Maoyan had already priced its shares at the bottom of its targeted range for the IPO, raising about $250 million. That's far short of the $1 billion it had reportedly been seeking to raise. A series of high-profile Chinese tech companies have listed in Hong Kong in the past year only to see their shares tank, raising concerns for similar firms that are mulling a listing in the city. Smartphone maker Xiaomi has plunged nearly 40% from its $4.7 billion IPO in July, and online services company Meituan has dived 21% since its $4.2 billion listing in September. They went public during a volatile period for stocks in Hong Kong, which entered a bear market in early September. Investors' worries include the trade war between the United States and China, the slowing Chinese economy, stricter regulation of tech companies by Beijing, and doubts about how much Chinese tech companies are really worth.  Maoyan dominates online movie ticket sales in China, accounting for about 60% of the market, according to data from Chinese analytics company iResearch cited in the company's IPO prospectus. It was originally part of Meituan but was spun off as a separate company in 2016.  Like many tech companies that go public, Maoyan is not yet profitable. It reported an operating loss of 142 million yuan ($21 million) for the nine months ended in September. China is the world's second-largest movie market, with box office revenue growing 9% in 2018 to 60.98 billion renminbi ($9 billion), according to state media.   China is widely expected to overtake the United States in movie ticket sales in the coming years. ","229":"The authors are co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This article is adapted from their 2019 Annual Letter. The views expressed here are those of the authors. View more opinion on CNN.  The discussion was organized by Youth Guidance's Becoming a Man, a program that helps young men in neighborhoods with a lot of crime and gang activity explore their emotions and hone their decision-making skills. The conversation started with each person sharing the last time they got angry. Although some of the guys talked about typical teenage frustrations, others had tragic stories. One had just watched a family member go to jail. Another spoke about a friend who had been shot. It was inspiring to see these young men facing such enormous challenges with thoughtfulness and resilience. Many people (ourselves included) don't develop this emotional maturity until later in life, so these young men gave us a lot to think about. In the nearly two decades since we started our foundation, we've found that surprises can be a powerful call to action. Sometimes a surprise helps you see that the status quo needs to change. Other times it underscores that transformation is happening, like what Bill experienced in Chicago.  In our annual letter this year, we wrote about that visit to Becoming a Man and eight other surprises that have helped shape the way we think about the world. We think they might surprise you, too: Africa is the youngest continent. While the rest of the world keeps getting older, the median age of Africa -- and especially sub-Saharan Africa -- stays young. This can be either an asset or a source of instability, depending on these young people's access to high-quality health and education services. At-home DNA tests can help prevent premature birth. By looking at genetic samples voluntarily submitted by 23andMe users, scientists discovered a potential link between preterm labor and a gene that regulates how the body uses a mineral called selenium. Insights like this will help doctors extend more pregnancies to full term.The world will build an entire New York City every month for 40 years. The world's building stock is expected to double by 2060, according to Architecture 2030. Manufacturing the cement and steel needed for all that construction will emit a lot of greenhouse gases. To solve climate change, we need to get to near-zero emissions on all the things that drive it, including making building materials.Data can be sexist. There are huge gaps in the global data about women and girls. For example, we don't know how much income women in developing countries earned last year or how much property they own or how many more hours girls spend on household chores than boys do. Better data will help policymakers take action to improve women's and girls' lives. There's a nationalist case for globalism. Nationalism is a loaded word. At its core, it's the belief that a country's first obligation is to itself. But even if a person believes countries should only act in their own self-interest, that doesn't erase the need to engage with the broader world. Investing in the world's poorest people makes all of us healthier and more secure.Toilets haven't changed in a century. Flush toilets (which became prevalent in the 19th century) haven't had an overhaul in a while. And while they're still working just fine for rich countries, they aren't an adequate solution for places that can't afford or support sewer systems -- which means more than 2 billion people don't have access to a decent toilet, according to the World Health Organization. As a result, their waste often ends up in the environment untreated. A reinvented toilet that doesn't require a sewer could save millions of lives.Textbooks are becoming obsolete. US classrooms are starting to replace traditional (heavy and expensive) textbooks with digital learning tools. These online tools are facilitating a new approach to student learning that is particularly beneficial to today's college students, who are increasingly likely to be balancing school with earning an income and even raising a family.Mobile phones are most powerful in the hands of the world's poorest women. For the world's most marginalized women, a mobile phone does more than make their old life more convenient -- it can help them build an entirely new life. Women are not only using their mobile phones to access services and opportunities; they're using them to change social norms and challenge the power structures that perpetuate gender inequality. Some of these surprises worry us. Others inspire us. All of them are prodding us to action. We hope they do the same for you, because that's how we can make the world better.

Diversification is a tricky thing to achieve these days if you, like many investors, stick primarily to mutual funds and ETFs that are tied to top indexes. It's especially tough if your funds rank their holdings by how big the companies are. Take a look at the S&P 500. The popular index of blue chip US companies might as well be a tech fund. Five of the six most-valuable companies in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) are Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). They make up nearly 15% of the fund's total assets. \"People have been fooled into thinking that the S&P 500 is diversified,\" said Lamar Villere, manager of the Villere Balanced Fund. Do your homework and know what you own Villere told CNN Business that investors have to do their homework and not base decisions on faulty assumptions.  Here's an example: His fund owns Steris (STE), a medical equipment company based in the UK, as well as Euronet (EEFT), an electronic payments firm with its headquarters in Kansas.  Which company is more exposed to Brexit concerns and sluggish growth in the EU? Euronet. That's because Steris generated more than 70% of its sales last year from the US while Euronet only got a quarter of its revenue from America. Nearly half its sales were from Germany, the UK, Poland, Spain, Italy, Greece and France. But Villere is confident both companies will continue to post solid earnings, despite geopolitical turmoil.  The key lesson for investors to learn is that if you own quality companies that can do well in most environments, you don't have to worry as much.  A truly diversified portfolio should have companies of all sizes There are other ways to diversify your portfolio, too. Villere said he typically finds better investing opportunities with smaller and mid-sized companies, because their stocks are not as widely followed by Wall Street. So they often wind up being less expensive.  But he doesn't think investors should shun giant companies either. In the spirit of diversification, it makes sense to own a mix of companies of various sizes \u2014 and hold on to them for several years. Villere said his fund's top holding is payments giant (and Dow component) Visa (V), which he said he first bought in 2011. Villere also said he bought Apple (AAPL) after Steve Jobs passed away in 2011 and just sold it last year after a \"great ride.\" Don't get caught up in the daily news cycle \"We're more intent on finding the best possible companies. We try not to be heavy traders and second guess ourselves,\" Villere said. \"It does not serve you well to invest based on headlines.\" Louis Florentin-Lee, a portfolio manager with Lazard Asset Management, agreed with that. He told CNN Business he likes \"companies with sufficiently strong economic advantages\" that are making a product that's \"invaluable\" to their customers. \"We don't care what sector a company is in,\" Florentin-Lee said, adding that buying shares of healthy companies is increasingly important at a time when investors are worried about global trade tension.  Any investor should want to own businesses that can not only withstand the threat of tariffs but even be able to raise prices if they must without worrying that they will lose sales. Florentin-Lee said some examples of these types of companies are British alcoholic beverage giant Diageo (DEO), German flavors and fragrances maker Symrise (SYIEY) and credit card company MasterCard (MA).

Now that it has, the President isn't prepared to let go. Even as the specter of Robert Mueller's probe has vanished, Trump plans to turn the investigation, Democrats' constant accusations of wrongdoing and the media's coverage of it all into a new foil, half a dozen advisers and aides said. He has already signaled he'll weaponize the results, targeting those who ordered the investigation and Democrats he says waged political warfare. The counteroffensive has some advisers concerned the President could overstep, diminishing a clear victory by sinking back into old grudges or calling for extreme steps to punish those he views as foes.  The conclusion of Mueller's investigation without evidence of collusion could present an opportunity to move past a dark period and toward a sunnier, more disciplined presidency -- an outcome some advisers have wished for in private. Maybe for a different President. Instead, Trump appears poised to relive the first two years of his presidency and the \"witch hunt\" investigation that clouded it, this time through the lens of personal and political vindication. His public comments since his attorney general summarized the report for Congress on Sunday have all carried the threat of payback -- for Democrats who accused him of stealing his office and the media that he says fanned the flames -- and offered a preview of his rhetoric on the 2020 campaign trail. \"There are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things. Very bad things. I would say treasonous things against our country,\" a furious Trump said Monday in the Oval Office, where he was meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \"We've gone through a period of really bad things happening. Those people will certainly be looked at.\" There is no indication so far that Trump is planning to order the counter-investigation he has floated, but as he prepares to wage a tough battle for re-election, the President and his campaign advisers see the report's conclusions as political gold, even if it means keeping the lingering questions of Russian election interference and legal wrongdoing in the political bloodstream for years to come. Just as Trump embarked on a victory tour in the months after the 2016 election, reliving the greatest hits and assailing those who said he could never win, his upcoming rallies are likely to resemble a victory lap centered on the Mueller probe -- one that could stretch through November 2020. The result will likely be an amplifying of the President's biting criticism of Democrats and the media, attack lines that have consistently been effective fodder to rev up his political base.  One Trump adviser who speaks to the President regularly told CNN's Jim Acosta to expect Trump and his team to \"slam and shame the media\" over Mueller's conclusions in the Russia investigation.  Even as the President on Sunday referred to the investigation as an \"illegal takedown that failed,\" sources close to the President said they expect him to focus less on Mueller and more on the exonerating conclusions of the investigation and on assailing Democrats and the media. Hitting the trail The first display of this post-Mueller messaging will come on Thursday, when the President rallies his supporters in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \"I think it's gonna look like probably the second-most exciting Trump event, following the election night win in 2016,\" said Jason Miller, a top communications adviser on Trump's 2016 campaign. \"This is a cloud that has hung over the presidency in the first two years of it. Now that cloud has been lifted -- and not just lifted, but in such complete and convincing terms.\" Those around the President expect him to turn the findings of the Mueller investigation -- at least those revealed in Attorney General Bill Barr's letter -- into a political cudgel that he will use to ramp up his rhetoric assailing Democrats and the media to new heights, equating the punditry and speculation about the investigation with reporting about the investigation that did not predict an outcome either way. The President's campaign has already begun to blast out a series of fundraising emails centered on the investigation. And on Monday, the campaign's communications director sent an email to TV news producers suggesting several Democratic lawmakers and a former CIA director should no longer be considered credible guests given their allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. That messaging is unlikely to abate and could ultimately prove as central to Trump's 2020 messaging as his allegations of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton were in 2016. \"The fact that the entirety of the Democrat party through the megaphone of the national media spent every waking moment of the last two years screaming about Russian collusion is absolutely going to be an issue,\" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said of the 2020 campaign. \"We've been hearing these charges for two solid years. I think you might hear a little bit about the fact that all of it is untrue.\" The rhetoric, though, will not be enough for some of the President's supporters, who want him to go beyond the rhetoric and move to action -- raising the specter of counter-investigations. \"I believe that we need to investigate the investigators,\" said David Bossie, the President's former deputy campaign manager and an informal adviser. \"I think that there needs to be an accounting. People need to be held responsible for what they have done to this country for the last two years. I am not ready to move past that. I think that's a very important element of what we need to do.\" 'How does he mess this up?' But other allies of the President are already beginning to voice caution. Several privately worry that -- despite the report being good news for Trump that could fortify him ahead of the last 22 months of his term -- he will find a way to dampen the positive coverage. One former associate joked Sunday after Barr released Mueller's key findings, \"Now how does he mess this up?\" These supporters of Trump say they hope the President moves on and shifts his focus to his accomplishments in office and the economic growth that could be a central claim to a second term. \"I'm hoping now that we've moved beyond this investigation and he is not being personally accused of colluding with a hostile foreign power, which I think clearly there was no collusion, and at some point we need to accept that and move on,\" said Rep. Michael Waltz, a freshman Republican from Florida, on CNN. \"I'm hoping that tone and rhetoric will change.\" Inside the White House, as feelings of elation at Mueller's findings eased, some advisers expressed a private desire for Trump to attempt a more traditional presidency, one focused on sober policymaking instead of chaotic attempts to change the narrative. That includes a focus on securing a trade deal with China -- an outcome Trump is eager to achieve, believing it could boost the stock market and, by turn, his political prospects. Aides are also eyeing a long-delayed infrastructure push and steps to lower drug prices, both areas seen as ripe for bipartisan cooperation. He's also expected to embark on several foreign trips this spring. But Democrats have made clear they plan to pursue their investigations into the Trump administration and there is little to indicate Trump will adopt a more statesmanlike mien. His behavior over the past several weeks has not demonstrated a President intent on restoring order to his agenda.  Last week was dominated by his attacks on the late revered Sen. John McCain, a feud that drew widespread condemnation and distracted from his intended messaging about a resurgence of manufacturing in the heartland. At the end of the week, the administration's foreign policy apparatus appeared in disarray when Trump abruptly tweeted he was reversing new sanctions on North Korea. It took hours for officials to clarify what Trump was talking about, which turned out to be still-unannounced measures in the works at the Treasury Department. Victory lap Going forward, it's not clear Trump will stick to any singular messaging strategy, particularly as Democrats continue to agitate for access to the full Mueller report and mount their own investigations in Congress. Amid his victory lap, Trump is slated to host more than a dozen congressional Republicans at the White House on Tuesday afternoon for a meeting on the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, the pact aides describe as his highest legislative priority heading into the summer. Although some White House officials say trade deals with China and the country's North American neighbors will rank among the most important items on Trump's agenda in the weeks ahead, the President has shown few signs of an impending pivot. In talking points sent to surrogates on Sunday evening, the White House listed the passage of Trump's reworked agreement with Canada and Mexico as an immediate area of focus in the wake of Mueller's report. \"Now that the investigation has been concluded, it is time to move forward, passing USMCA, building new infrastructure, and lowering drug prices,\" the White House wrote in the talking points. But even the relatively calm domain of trade could turn contentious on Capitol Hill.  A White House official said the team is also prepared for the possibility that Democrats will unite against the deal to deny Trump the political \"win.\" Democratic lawmakers could face even greater pressure not to cooperate with Trump while he's berating them for supporting the Russia investigation.","232":"David A.

And as deeply as Pelosi understood Trump, especially his fatal flaws of ego and hubris, Xi may  be in an even better position to outmaneuver the American president. The Chinese leader is in the enviable position of having watched and absorbed how thoroughly Trump crumpled over the past month in the face of an adversary he vastly underestimated.  The next round in the potential Unraveling of a Deal begins on Wednesday when Xi's top trade negotiator, the redoubtable Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, opens two days of talks in Washington. For some time, Trump has been telegraphing his punches, claiming that China's economy is suffering far more than America's and therefore its leadership is prepared to cave at any moment in the face of strength and determination. But Trump has clearly been ignoring some early hints of just how badly an escalation of the trade war could play in the United States -- the stock markets whipsawing investors with every whisper of deal-or-no-deal, and farmers losing a stable and lucrative market. Layer onto these challenges the looming threat of another government shutdown in three weeks, and Trump may find his back very much against a wall, forced to cave yet again. At the same time, Xi has been deftly covering his own back, laying the basis for a difficult year ahead for China that he appears quite confident he'll master. Just last week, he summoned regional and ministerial-level officials to a four-day \"seminar\" on \"preventing and defusing major risks to ensure sustained and healthy economic development and social stability,\" according to the state news agency Xinhua.  At the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, Xi laid out a whole program to deal with \"profound and complicated international and domestic changes,\" including financing for small and micro businesses and stabilizing employment. \"For Trump, it's quite necessary to seize the opportunity and reach a deal [with China],\" Ren Xiao, an international relations professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the South China Morning Post. \"He could lose votes [in the next election] if the trade war drags on.\"  It is of course deeply important for Xi to arrive at some resolution to help reenergize the flagging Chinese economy that is facing any number of interrelated challenges as well. Still, the monolithic Chinese system can withstand challenges that may be utterly beyond the reach of any democratically elected leader. On many levels, the parallels with the Pelosi-Trump showdown are striking. Democrats refused to buckle and fund his wall to get 800,000 Americans back to work, and with the US heading toward zero growth and systemic threats to its economic stability had the crisis continued. How likely is it that Trump can pull a similar game of chicken with China? This time, his challenger is a president-for-life atop a monolithic party that maintains utter control over a nation of 1.4 billion people with a 6% growth rate, even if its industrial output is slowing gradually.  So, while Xi has been laying the groundwork for pain, Trump has already been deeply wounded, with the question hanging of his ability to weather another, even deeper challenge to the American economy and his leadership so soon after the monthlong government shutdown.  Without a trade agreement, Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on March 2 to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. That comes on top of the 25% tariff Trump imposed on $50 billion worth of technology imports from China. Chinese officials have held out the prospects of an equally draconian retaliation, with tariffs on American aircraft, soybean oil, smoked beef, coffee, flour and other products. Stilll, Xi does seem motivated to make a deal, even a mini-deal, though it's difficult to imagine why he would want to do so before the last minute, especially as he assesses Trump's manifold weaknesses over the next month. Without question, Xi does pay close attention to Trump's political fortunes and especially what the American media is describing as the newly weakened Trump -- even reports of potential primary challenges next year as he seeks reelection, a challenge that Xi will never have to face. The central danger remains Donald Trump's own personality and his manifest faith in his talents as a dealmaker. The president has always placed a premium on looking tough. So, having just let Nancy Pelosi, by many accounts, even from his own base, walk all over him, how likely will he be to let a Chinese leader have his way with him now? \"Hopefully, now, the president has learned his lesson,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Friday evening after Congress voted to reopen the government. \"We cannot, cannot  ever hold American workers hostage again.\" But any failure to reach an accord with China and escalating tariffs could hold the entire American economy hostage, causing long-term systemic damage that will be even more difficult to reverse than the results of a month-long shutdown. Perhaps it's time now for Trump to manage his own expectations and temper his rhetoric, while understanding that the real art of the deal is to make both sides feel like winners.","233":"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Worries over slowing economic growth are weighing on global markets.  Stocks dropped sharply in Asia as investors reacted to disappointing manufacturing data from Germany on Friday and a warning signal that a US recession could be on the horizon. Japan's Nikkei (N225) closed down 3% on Monday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) shed 2%. Fears about a severe global economic slowdown hit stocks in Europe and the United States on Friday. The pain continued Monday, with benchmark indexes in Europe closing with mild losses. US stocks also dropped, though ended the day essentially unchanged.  The new bout of fretting over the health of the global economy follows a big rebound in stock markets. \"Given just how strong equities have rallied this year, it is not surprising that investors were already questioning how much further they could go,\" said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. US stocks on Friday suffered their worst day since early January after the yield on 3-month Treasuries rose above the rate on 10-year Treasuries for the first time since 2007. A flattening yield curve, or the difference between short- and long-term rates, is typically seen as a sign that long-term economic confidence is dwindling.  An inverted curve has been a reliable predictor of a coming US recession for decades. But market experts advised investors against panicking for the time being.  Strategists at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said that while the inverted yield curve is \"an ominous sign,\" they aren't predicting a US recession anytime soon.  Craig said he interprets the US bond market move as a sign of slowing economic growth around the world. \"This means that we don't expect the market to collapse, but neither do we expect equity returns to be that inspiring from here,\" he added. Trade war: Deal or no deal? After a brutal December \u2014 the Dow's (INDU) worst since the Great Depression \u2014 many stock markets around the world have surged this year as investors have become more optimistic about the health of major economies and the prospect of an end to the damaging trade war between the United States and China. Chinese shares, which had a terrible 2018, have performed particularly well. The benchmark Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP), which had gained about 25% since the start of the year, fell 2% on Monday. Analysts said that the outcome of trade talks between the United States and China is more significant for stocks in Asia than the shift in the US bond market. \"A couple of basis points inversion between 3-month and 10-year yields does not an impending economic Armageddon make,\" Jeffrey Halley, a Singapore-based analyst at online trading platform Oanda, said in a commentary.  \"A deal or no-deal\" over trade between Washington and Beijing \"remains the only real game in town,\" he added. Negotiations between the two governments aimed at resolving the trade war will resume this week. Top US officials are due to hold talks with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing starting Thursday. A Chinese delegation is scheduled to go to Washington for further talks in early April.  Negotiations had been on hold as the two sides tried to figure out how to overcome disagreements about how the United States would ensure China is abiding by any deal. US concerns about how China goes about getting hold of American technology and trade secrets have also been a sticking point.","234":" (CNN)Greg Zanis' 26,275 crosses have been seen at nearly every national tragedy since Columbine.  Now, five more stand in his hometown. He knew something was wrong when dozens of law enforcement vehicles, sirens screaming, rocketed by his Aurora, Illinois, house on Friday afternoon. About 15 minutes later, Zanis' daughter called saying there was an active shooter. Police say Gary Martin, 45, opened fire at Henry Pratt Co., killing five colleagues and wounding five police officers and a fellow worker. \"I guess I never thought it could possibly happen here,\" Zanis says solemnly. Most Americans probably don't know his name, but many have has seen Greg Zanis' work \u2014 painted crosses with victims' name enscribed on them \u2014 erected after a national tragedy.   Each one takes about an hour to make.   \"My simple message is just that heart on the cross,\" he says. \"Love your brother, love your neighbor. Don't judge them. Life isn't that complicated. Hate and revenge is.\"  He's made crosses for nearly every national tragedy since Columbine One year and one day before the shooting in Aurora, Zanis quietly constructed and installed 17 crosses at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.   When there is tragedy Zanis slips in, often unnoticed to many, to help Americans make sense of the what's happened.   He can't do that here. Everyone in Aurora knows him and his work. The Boston Bombing. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. The Sikh temple shooting. Thousand Oaks shooting. Las Vegas shooting. Southerland Springs, Texas, shooting. In the aftermath, Zanis is there. Last year, he also drove crosses to Paradise, California, for the wildfire victims and met with 50 families. On the drive back, after his work was done, he had two days to unwind and calm down. \"There is no peace to have that drive,\" he says of the Aurora shooting. \"I can walk over there.\"   The toughest crosses he's made yet Friday night, hours after the shooting, he was already meeting with families who were asking him to make crosses for their loved ones.   They just sat there and stared at each other. \"They wanted me to go and put the memorials up,\" he says.  And Zanis did, installing the crosses, their names not yet written on them. Zanis was at the press conference on Saturday when the victims names were announced:  Clayton Parks of Elgin, Illinois, a human resources manager; Trevor Wehner of Sheridan, Illinois, a human resources intern and a student at Northern Illinois University; Russell Beyer of Yorkville, Illinois, a mold operator; Vicente Juarez of Oswego, Illinois, a stock room attendant and fork lift operator; and Josh Pinkard of Oswego, Illinois, a plant manager. As soon as Zanis got the names he left the press conference, crafting the hearts, enscribing the names onto them and placing them on the crosses already at the vigil site. \"They're the toughest that I've ever made,\" he says.   Working through the night on the crosses, Zanis says he still hasn't slept and doesn't think he will for another 24 hours. The crosses are up but his work isn't done. More work needs to be done, and he's busy organizing vigils for the families and organizing a march to thank the police officers wounded in the shooting.","235":"Hanoi, Vietnam (CNN)The night before his historic summit with US President Donald Trump last June, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took a surprise stroll in downtown Singapore to see the sights of the wealthy capitalist city. The inference seemed clear. If cash-strapped Pyongyang chooses to engage the world -- and ditch its nuclear weapons -- this could be its future.  Trump and Kim will this month have an even more symbolic backdrop for their next meeting: Vietnam, a country which transformed itself from bitter US enemy to peaceful partner in less than 50 years. Experts believe the Trump administration plans to sell North Korea on a model such as communist Vietnam, highlighting its relationship with Washington as well as its economic boom since adopting market reforms. And all the North Koreans have to do, Washington is expected to say, is give up their nukes.  Yet analysts are wary such a sales pitch will produce any tangible outcome. North Korea knows how capitalism and market economies work: it's just chosen not to embrace them. China has for years been prodding the North to embrace economic reform, dragging former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il on tours of capitalist enterprises whenever he visited. The same tactic has also been used within the United States, said Van Jackson, a former Defense Department official in the Obama administration. \"Historically, there have been many -- I know of half a dozen instances myself personally -- where senior North Korean officials were brought around and shown what capitalist industrialism looks like. They were shown what the stock market floor looks like on the New York Stock Exchange, or they were brought out to some tech lab in Silicon Valley,\" said Jackson, author of \"On the Brink: Trump, Kim, and the Threat of Nuclear War.\"  \"We've shown them what capitalism looks like ... the idea that they will see something in Vietnam physically that triggers something different than what we've shown them before is kind of nonsense.\"  'From a mortal enemy to a friendly partner' There's something for both Washington and Pyongyang to like when studying the US-Vietnam relationship. For North Korea, it's an example of a single-party communist country that reformed its economy without democratizing. For the United States, it's an example of how to redefine a relationship and make a buck at the same time. In 1995 -- the year Hanoi and Washington normalized relations -- US exports to and imports from Vietnam were worth just $252 million and $199 million respectively. However in the first 11 months of 2018, the US exported more than $8 billion worth of goods to Vietnam and imported goods worth $45 billion, according to US Census figures.","236":"New York (CNN Business)WW, the company that was known for years as Weight Watchers, is trying to \"course correct\" after some business blunders left Wall Street severely disappointed.

CEO Mindy Grossman said in a statement that customer recruitment has been slow, and the company quickly \"moved to course correct\" with revamped advertising and media campaigns. \"While we are disappointed with our start to 2019, we are confident that our strategy to focus on providing holistic wellness solutions leveraging our best-in-class weight management program is the right path to support long-term sustainable growth,\" Grossman said. WW's struggles have been bad news for spokesperson Oprah Winfrey: She owns more than 8% of WW's shares. Her stake has shed well over half its value over the past year. Tuesday's stock plunge comes a week after after two analysts cut their price targets for the company. JPMorgan's Christina Brathwaite downgraded it to an \"underperform\" \u2014 or a \"sell\" \u2014 and sliced her price target from $37 to $25. It was trading around $21 at one point during after-hours trading Tuesday. Brathwaite is worried that reviews for the WW app will become \"increasingly negative\" and competition from rival weight-loss services Noom and Diet Doctor. Oppenheimer's Brian Nagel is far more optimistic. Last week, he lowered his price target for WW to $40 from $98 a share. That's still well above where WW had been trading. Nagel conceded that \"investors have increasingly fretted over the potential for waning subscriber growth at the company.\"","237":"New York (CNN Business)Coca-Cola investors could use some refreshment. Coke is one of the worst performers in the Dow so far this year, and it is one of the biggest losers in the S&P 500, too. Coke's stock (KO) has tumbled 4% in 2019 \u2014 about the same as fellow Dow components UnitedHealth (UNH) and Walgreens (WBA). That's not a huge drop. But it comes at a time when the Dow and S&P 500 are each up nearly 12%. And Coke's top rival, Pepsi (PEP), is up about 6%. The company is trying to win more customers with new products, including the just launched Orange Vanilla Coke. It has also released several new flavors of Diet Coke in the past year, and it rebranded Coke Zero as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. Coca-Cola is starting to sell a lot of other beverages, too. The company recently completed a $5 billion acquisition of UK chain Costa Coffee, which competes with Starbucks (SBUX).  The company has branched out over the past few years in other ways. It bought the makers of Glaceau Smartwater and Honest Tea. Coca-Cola also snagged a distribution deal with the owner of the Fairlife milk brand, and it took a nearly 20% stake in energy drink company Monster Beverage (MNST).  But Coke, despite its attempts to diversify, is still a slow growth company. Coke issued a weak forecast for 2019.  Analysts expect Coke's earnings per share rise by just 5% annually, on average, for the next few years. Coke's acquisitions could also hurt profit margins this year and add more \"complexity\" to the business, according to Macquarie Research analyst Caroline Levy. The strong dollar is also expected to hurt Coke this year, CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson noted in a recent report.  Multinational companies like Coke typically get hit by dollar strength because it lowers the value of international revenue. American products are also less competitive overseas when the dollar is stronger. Although Coke has made significant efforts to diversify beyond sugary sodas, the company still is reliant on beverages.  Pepsi, on the other hand, has found success with snacks. Its Frito-Lay business, which owns Doritos, Cheetos and Sun Chips, has typically posted stronger growth in sales and operating profit than the beverage unit over the past few years.  Coke doesn't seem to have much interest in food, though. CEO James Quincey has continuously referred to Coke as a \"total beverage company.\" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in a recent report that the shift away from soda and toward tea, water, coffee and juice makes sense.  But she also conceded that Coke will likely be hurt by a slowdown in the global economy, and she added that it was a surprise to see volume for carbonated beverages in the North America market fall in the fourth quarter. That could be a sign that consumers are balking at recent price increases.  Still, Coke may need to do even more in beverages to excite consumers and investors. That could eventually mean more booze. Coke started selling Lemon-Do, a fizzy, low-alcohol content drink, in Japan last year. There aren't any plans to bring that product to the United States right now. Coke also has ruled out launching any CBD-based beverages for the time being. CBD, the non-psychoactive component of cannabis, has started to pop up as an ingredient in some products in the United States following the passage of the farm bill. Corona owner Constellation Brands (STZ) has even invested in Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth (CGC). Canopy hopes to sell CBD and hemp products here in the United States and is even setting up a hemp processing plant in upstate New York.","238":"New York (CNN Business)When investing for the long-term, when is It the most appropriate moment to sell a stock? Experts say you should never fall too madly in love with a specific company. You need to be prepared to let a stock go if the outlook has changed.  \"This is a question that our clients ask constantly and it's something a lot of people struggle with,\" said Timothy Chubb, chief investment officer at Girard. Chubb said there are typically three reasons why you should sell a stock.  The price based on earnings, sales or another key metric starts to get too high compared to historical standardsThere is really bad newsThe business strategy suddenly changes -- especially if firms are spending a lot to buy other companies. Of these three reasons, Chubb said bad news is probably the biggest reason to sell.  Chubb pointed to the 2017 data breach at Equifax (EFX), the fake accounts scandal at Wells Fargo (WFC) and the recent disastrous earnings report and asset writedown from Kraft Heinz (KHC) as examples of a time where it made sense to sell the stocks. But you don't want to dump a stock on a whim either. Arun Daniel, senior fund manager with J O Hambro Capital Management, says it is best to have a firm discipline based on numbers -- not emotions. Daniel said he sets up specific target prices for stocks in his portfolio on both the upside and downside. Once the stock gets within 10% of his high or low targets, he and his team re-evaluate if they should sell, hold steady or buy more. If the fundamentals for the company are still solid, Daniel said you should sit tight. Stocks won't necessarily begin to fall if the news is still good.  Look at how Amazon (AMZN) has continued to go up even though it's a stock that most value investors have shunned for two decades. But be prepared to sell if the original reason you liked a stock is no longer valid. Admit your mistake and move on. \"Generally, we increase the target price on a stock more often than selling it,\" Daniel said. \"But if you are wrong, you have to exit the position.\" Does gold make sense for a long-term portfolio?

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. I've charged and tried federal extortion cases. Admittedly, I had it easy. My cases involved the mafia, which tended to make obvious, explicit threats that fell squarely within both the common-sense and legal definitions of the term \"extortion.\" In one case, my defendants threatened to cut off the victim's fingers if he didn't pay them cash by the end of the week. That's Hollywood-obvious extortion. Bezos' allegations are a much closer call. Reasonable people can differ on this, but if, hypothetically, legal action were to be taken and I was back in the prosecutor's chair, I'd still bring the charge. Here's why.  Federal law defines the crime of extortion as (1) obtaining property from another (or attempting to do so), (2) by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence or fear. Let's break that down. On the first prong, If the allegations are true, AMI plainly tried to obtain something from Bezos: an end to the leak investigation. The question, however, is whether that something qualifies as \"property.\" If AMI had threatened to release the photographs unless Bezos paid it money, or gave it Amazon stock, then \"property\" would clearly be involved. The facts are murkier here. AMI likely would argue that it did not try to obtain any \"property\" -- it merely tried to get Bezos to stop doing something.   My counter-argument as a prosecutor would be that AMI recognized that Bezos' investigation might have led to the discovery of information that (1) would have had value to Bezos in his ongoing public relations battle and potential lawsuit against AMI, and (2) would have been damaging to AMI. The law defines \"property\" very broadly -- it does not have to be monetary, or worth more than a nominal amount, or even tangible.  Here, I'd argue that Bezos' investigation had real value to both parties. Exhibit A: Just look at the extreme and outrageous steps AMI took to try to stop it. You don't threaten to publish sexually humiliating photographs of another person -- never mind the world's richest person -- unless there's something big at stake. On the second prong, according to Bezos' claim, AMI seemingly used fear. The question is whether it used that fear \"wrongfully.\" AMI would likely argue that it was engaged in ongoing negotiations with Bezos over releasing potential legal claims against one another. Sure, the negotiations were tough and even distasteful, AMI would probably claim, but welcome to the real world of big money and big business.  Indeed, there is a fine line between hard-edged business or legal negotiations and extortion, and prosecutors should hesitate to criminalize aggressive tactics. Here, however, AMI's conduct goes beyond the pale: It allegedly sent Bezos an email detailing lurid and potentially humiliating photos of him before siccing its lawyers on Bezos to try to extract a \"settlement.\"  I'd be comfortable arguing to a jury that this goes well beyond legally acceptable boardroom hardball. AMI also might claim that it acted on the advice of its attorneys -- a criminal defense known as \"advice of counsel\" -- but I'd counter that nobody could reasonably believe it was truly lawful to negotiate by threatening to publish stolen nude photos of an adversary.  Again, we don't yet know the facts and we can't conclude guilt in this situation based on allegations made on a Medium post. But if what Bezos alleges is indeed true, this is a close call, right on the razor's edge. If I were arguing this as part of a case in court, here's what I would say: In the end, juries tend to decide cases based largely on their gut instincts. AMI's alleged conduct here was so over the top, so distasteful, that I'd be confident I could sway a jury that it crossed the line from aggressive business tactics and into criminal extortion.","240":" (CNN)Here is a look at the life of John Delaney, a businessman, former representative from Maryland and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.

The drivers who receive a bonus will be given the option to put that money toward stock in the company.  Lyft detailed the program in IPO paperwork it filed Friday. It's raising as much as $100 million in its public offering, beating competitor Uber to the punch.  The bonus program will provide one-time cash rewards to \"recognize drivers who have contributed to our success.\" Drivers can use those cash bonuses to buy stock in its \"directed share program\" when the company goes public. Because drivers are independent contractors, they wouldn't traditionally be eligible for such a program, unlike certain employees, investors and board members.   Drivers will be rewarded for hitting certain milestones as of February 25, 2019. Drivers who have completed at least 20,000 rides as of that date will get $10,000, and drivers who have completed between 10,000 and 20,000 rides will get $1,000.  Money will also be reserved for drivers who've served on the company's Driver Advisory Council. They could get $1,000. (If a driver is eligible for multiple cash bonuses, they'll receive the one payout \u2014 whichever is the largest.) It's a token of goodwill for the drivers who are indispensable to the company's core ride-hailing business. It also sets a precedent for rival Uber, which is also expected to go public this year. Uber is working on its own program to distribute cash bonuses to some drivers, with the option to put that money toward stock, according to a source familiar with the matter. It plans to take a tiered approach as well, granting bonuses to drivers based on various trip thresholds, the source said. San Francisco-based driver Jay Cradeur says he is eligible for $1,000 because he has given 14,000 rides to date. He plans to use his bonus to buy stock in the company \"just for the giggle.\" \"It is money I was not expecting. Let's see if and when the IPO happens. If it does, that will now be a more interesting day,\" Cradeur said. Some experts are already expressing concerns about the gesture, suggesting it could be an olive branch intended to mitigate a potential public relations nightmare about how the company treats its drivers. \"I see it as an effort to ward off negative publicity when they will be most vulnerable to publicity,\" said Thomas Kochan, George Maverick Bunker professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, told CNN Business.  Kochan told CNN Business that it's \"clear\" that both Uber and Lyft are worried the drivers will use the IPO filings as \"an opportunity raise their voices and ask how will this benefit them.\" \"I don't think it will be enough to silence the increasing number of drivers and organizations beginning to organize and call for better treatment and more equitable sharing of the gains they help produce,\" he added. The ability to attract and retain drivers is essential to the success of ride-hailing companies.  In its filing, Lyft made mention of this: \"We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including ... our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders.\"  According to Harry Campbell, author of The RideShare Guy blog and a ride-hail driver, getting to 10,000 rides \"is quite a lot for Lyft.\"  \"It looks like Lyft's cash bonus will reward mainly full-time or very veteran drivers, which I think is fair,\" he said, adding that he expects cash rewards to go mainly to San Francisco drivers and those in other big cities.  Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, suggested that a one-time cash bonus won't help the vast majority of drivers.  \"Uber and Lyft have built their business model off the sweat of drivers, paying the vast majority of New York City drivers less than minimum wage in their quests to go public,\" Desai said in a statement. \"Now, instead of raising wages in anticipation of their windfall, they only want to offer stock grants to a small minority of drivers?\" While Lyft has long been viewed as the friendlier alternative to Uber, its image has been put to the test in recent months.  The company filed a lawsuit against New York City just days before a first-of-its-kind minimum-wage law for drivers went into effect February 1. Lyft argued that the formula for determining the pay is flawed and unfairly advantages Uber. Labor law expert Veena Dubal worried that drivers having equity in the company could change the dynamic. \"I'm worried that giving shares to drivers may also impede independent worker organizing because the workers become committed to the well-being of the company \u2014 as opposed to their own immediate well-being \u2014 in a different way,\" said Dubal, an associate law professor at the University of California. \"As a result, I'm skeptical that these shares will raise compensation in the short or long run.\" Lyft says eligible drivers will get paid around March 19, or may elect to use the bonuses to purchase shares in its IPO.","242":" (CNN)A federal judge rejected a challenge to the Trump administration's ban on bump-fire stocks Monday.  United States District Judge Dabney L. Friedrich ruled against the plaintiffs in two consolidated federal lawsuits challenging a nationwide ban on the devices and asking for an injunction to prevent the ban from going forward and being enforced. Bump-fire stocks came under scrutiny following a deadly 2017 massacre in Las Vegas, in which a gunman rigged his weapons with the devices to kill 58 people and injure nearly 900. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) responded, in part, by reconsidering its definition of machine guns to include \"bump-stock-type devices.\" Bump stocks, also known by the brand name Slide Fire, modify rifles, turning them into automatic fire weapons. When the trigger on an automatic weapon is pulled once and held, the gun continues firing until the trigger is released. The ATF had previously concluded bump-fire stocks were merely a gun accessory or firearm part, not subject to federal regulation. They were tightly regulated, but legal. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker signed a new federal regulation in December that concluded that bump-fire stocks fall within the prohibition on machine guns, and therefore are illegal under federal law.  In their complaint, the plaintiffs -- Damien Guedes, the Firearms Policy Coalition, David Codrea and their co-plaintiffs -- argued that the ATF violated procedural requirements, and that Whitaker did not, at the time, have the authority to set forth a ban.  Following Monday's ruling, the plaintiffs issued a statement saying that have filed a notice of appeal and will continue to challenge the ban.  \"We are disappointed but unsurprised by the Court's ruling tonight denying a temporary injunction to protect Americans from an unlawful and unconstitutional regulation,\" they said in a joint statement. ","243":"Grand Cayman (CNN Business)1. Buybacks: Veteran hedge fund manager Mark Yusko is deeply skeptical of the stock buyback boom set off by President Donald Trump's tax overhaul.  \"I call it the tax deform bill. It was just a free handout to rich people who pay a lot of money to lobbies,\" Yusko, the founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, told CNN Business.  Instead of using its tax savings to speed up the economy, Corporate America is just \"buying back stock to stimulate their stock price,\" Yusko said from the sidelines of the Cayman Alternative Investment Summit. Yusko noted that prior to 1982, share buybacks were outlawed by the SEC. \"I think they should still be deemed insider trading and illegal,\" he said.  Share buybacks are a common practice where companies repurchase their own shares as a way to return excess capital. Buybacks boost demand for shares and artificially inflate per-share earnings.  US companies announced a record-shattering $1 trillion worth of share buybacks in 2018, the first full year since the tax law took effect, according to TrimTabs Investment Research.  After perking up in the first quarter of 2018, business investment on job-creating items like factories and equipment decelerated. Democrats in Congress have taken aim at buybacks.  Former Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein used his first tweet in six months to defend the practice last week.  \"The money doesn't vanish, it gets reinvested in higher growth businesses that boost the economy and jobs. Is that bad?\" Blankfein tweeted.  Yusko disagrees, saying the capital isn't going back to most people. \"It's like rearranging deck chairs,\" he said.  And Yusko dismissed the idea that buybacks are the equivalent of dividends. \"I believe it's simply stock price manipulation,\" he said. Rather than spending billions on share buybacks, Yusko argued that companies would help society more by reinvesting in projects, building new factories and retraining workers.  \"I find it absolutely mind-numbing that a company like Apple can sit on $260 billion of cash,\" Yusko said. \"You're telling me that all these genius people can't think of one intelligent thing to do with that capital?\" Apple (AAPL), which listed $245 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of 2018, spent nearly $9 billion on buybacks last quarter alone. During the first three months of 2018, Apple spent $22.8 billion on buybacks -- more than any company in any quarter in American history, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Last year, Apple announced plans to pay $38 billion in taxes on cash it held overseas, create 20,000 jobs and invest $30 billion in the United States over the next five years.  Defenders of buybacks argue that many people are helped by the practice. More than half of the households in the United States owned stocks directly or indirectly through retirement plans in 2016, according to the Federal Reserve.  Others say buybacks disproportionately help the rich because the wealthy own most of the stock market. The top 10% of households owned 84% of all stocks in 2016, according to Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University. Yusko believes buybacks have contributed to America's wealth and income inequality problem. \"It's a self-perpetuating loop that benefits one small group of people,\" Yusko said.  2. Markets reopen in China: Markets in mainland China will begin trading again Monday after a weeklong hiatus for the Lunar New Year holiday. That could introduce more volatility after global markets stumbled at the end of last week on concerns about trade. They fell immediately after Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, suggested that the United States and China weren't close to a new trade pact. \"The president has indicated that he's optimistic with respect to a potential trade deal,\" Kudlow said Thursday. \"But we've got a pretty sizable distance to go here.\" 3. Brexit uncertainty: British Prime Minister Theresa May failed to convince the European Union to reopen the United Kingdom's withdrawal agreement when she visited Brussels last week, though both sides did agree to keep talking. That means Brexit unknowns will loom large when the United Kingdom releases GDP data from December on Monday. More importantly, May is scheduled to update parliament on her progress Wednesday. Lawmakers are set to hold a debate on Brexit on Thursday. 4. Soda wars: Coca-Cola and Pepsi just battled it out at the Super Bowl. (Pepsi was a sponsor, while Coke's headquarters are in Atlanta, which hosted.) Now they're set to report earnings Thursday and Friday, respectively. Investors will keep an eye out for growth on a variety of products. Coke, which just launched a new flavor, had success with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. Pepsi, for its part, has reported growth with Bubly seltzer, its answer to LaCroix, and has a stable of popular products including Frito-Lay and Quakers. 5. Job openings: On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release a report on US job openings in December. The data will shine a light on hiring as the partial US government shutdown began. The US job market has been strong despite growing concerns about economic growth. The economy added 304,000 jobs in January, marking the 100th straight month of job gains. 6.

The vote was 54-45, primarily on a party-line basis with most Republicans backing President Donald Trump's nominee and most Democrats opposed. This will be Barr's second tour as attorney general; he led the Justice Department during the George H.W. Bush administration. He takes over a department that Trump has repeatedly criticized for special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. When Mueller's investigation does wrap up, the decisions around how much information should be disclosed to the public will likely fall to Barr, a noted proponent of strong executive authority. RELATED: Acting Attorney General Whitaker job hunts as new DOJ head moves in Barr's deference to the presidency -- he has referred to the role of attorney general as \"the President's lawyer\" -- is in line with a school of legal thought that draws a vision of uncompromising executive power from the Constitution. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, Barr refused to commit to release Mueller's final report unchanged, but pledged transparency and said he would put out \"as much as I can.\" He also said he would not let Trump make corrections to the report before a possible publication, and promised to protect the investigation until its finish. \"I am not going to do anything that I think is wrong, and I will not be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong,\" Barr said. \"By anybody -- whether it be editorial boards, or Congress or the President. I'm going to do what I think is right.\" RELATED: McCabe confirms talks held at Justice Dept. about removing Trump Return to the Justice Department Barr's nomination last year marked an unusual return to politics for the 68-year-old. An old guard conservative, Barr has held many of Washington's most influential legal perches, including a stint as the head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, where he helped shape legal opinions that influenced White House policy and action. RELATED: Daughter and son-in-law of AG nominee leaving the Justice Department After Bush's re-election defeat, Barr left government service for lucrative positions in the private sector, becoming the general counsel of Verizon up until 2008 and serving on the board of Time Warner, CNN's former parent company, through last year. In his confirmation hearing last month, Barr pointed to this distance from the Washington career ladder as one of the reasons he decided to take the job. \"I feel I'm in a position in life where I can do the right thing and not really care about the consequences in the sense that I can truly be independent,\" Barr said. Mueller investigation Barr's claim of independence did little to assuage Senate Democrats skeptical of his potential handling of the looming conclusion of Mueller's investigation. In their rejection, many Democrats have pointed to a 19-page memo Barr wrote and sent to senior White House and Justice Department officials last year that criticized an element of the special counsel probe. \"We must be clear-eyed about the moment our country is facing and the Attorney General's important role in ensuring the integrity of our democratic institutions,\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said in a statement Wednesday announcing his no vote. Immigration Barr has a reputation as a hardliner on immigration and crime. His plans to build a barrier along the US-Mexico border in 1992 will ring familiar in an administration currently engaged in a funding fight for a wall to stop an influx of illegal immigration, and in his confirmation hearing last month, Barr aligned himself with the President's views on border security. Barr's stance on criminal justice, however, appear to have evolved since he endorsed a Justice Department publication titled \"The Case for More Incarceration\" in 1992, when violent crime rates hit record highs in the country. Pressed by Democrats at his confirmation hearing last month, Barr said, \"I don't think comparing the policies that were in effect in 1992 to the situation now is really fair,\" and told senators that he would carry out a newly passed bipartisan sentencing reform bill. \"I think the time was right to take stock and make changes to our penal system based on current experience, so I have no problem with the approach of reforming the sentencing structure and I will faithfully enforce that law,\" Barr said. Cybersecurity Barr will face a new landscape of challenges in his second turn at Justice, including foreign threats and cyber crimes that were not on the department's radar, or even physical possibilities, in the early 1990s. Chinese state-sponsored hacking and intellectual property theft are now top of mind for the Department of Justice, and federal prosecutors have brought a number of cases against Chinese nationals \u2014 and that country's biggest telecommunications manufacturer \u2014 in recent months. \"The primary rival of the United States is China. I think Russia is half the size it was when we were facing them at the peak of the Cold War. Their economy's long-term prognosis is nowhere near China's,\" Barr testified last month. Barr has also set his sights on American technology companies, and told senators at his confirmation hearing that he would use the Justice Department's antitrust division to explore questions around competition in Silicon Valley. Barr agreed to return to the Justice Department out of a sense of \"patriotism\" and he will likely aim to helm the department in a way that restores some normalcy after a period of criticism from the President and his allies, his friends say. \"This is a person who has a special commitment to making sure that the Justice Department is really seen in a great light,\" said Paul McNulty, a former deputy attorney general who was Barr's top deputy for policy and communications. \"He'd really want his legacy on a second time around at DOJ to be that he made the department stronger, because it's that special to him.\"","245":" (CNN)President Donald Trump claims full credit for the strong economy and stock market.  In his telling, everything was set to tank when he moved into the White House and took over from President Barack Obama. Assessing that argument requires giving Trump's current economy a sort of report card as well as comparing what he's done with what Obama did. Let's get started. Trump's argument \"When I took over this economy, this economy was ready to crash,\" he said on Fox News in October. \"We were at 1% GDP. Now we're at 4.2%. It was ready to crash. It was the worst. If you look from Depression -- from the Great Depression -- it was the worst recovery in the history of our country.\" Trump deflates Obama's numbers here: The gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and at 2.9% for the year. It did achieve a 4.2% growth rate for a single quarter earlier in 2018. But growth was 1.8% in the fourth quarter of Obama's last year in office and 1.6% over his last year in office, not the 1% Trump said.  \"We've probably had the greatest first two years of any President in our history in terms of what we've accomplished with employment, with GDP, with everything,\" he told Laura Ingraham on Fox News in February. More recently, at a convention for Republican activists, he said that if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, the stock market would be down 50%, and he inflated how much it's up on his own watch.  \"Instead of being up almost 50% with the stock market, you would have been down 50%,\" he said. The market is actually up about 23% since he became President. But despite some warning signs like surprisingly few jobs created last month, it's clear that Trump will argue Obama was doing it wrong, he's doing it right and he turned it all around.  Who gets credit? The story of the current US economy is actually the Obama-Trump economic boom, according to Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He noted that the current economic expansion, at 116 months, is among the longest in history (second only to Bill Clinton's 120-month expansion). And taking stock of the various ways that economists worry about expansions ending, Blinder doesn't see any of them happening in the US, at least not in the next few months. Don't look for Democrats to suddenly embrace Trump's tax cuts or his trade bravado, and don't look for the President to suddenly embrace Obama's gift of dropping unemployment and a growing stock market he was able to continue. But the current boom needed both Obama's extraordinary measures to end the Great Recession and, perhaps, Trump's efforts to give American companies tax breaks. These two very different ideologies wove together to shepherd the country for the past 10 years.  Now for a general look at some of the economic indicators Trump can brag about and some signs of concern and unfulfilled promises he'll have to answer for: Jobs created under Trump, Obama Trump will have to hope a record run of job creation continues. He won't be helped by jobs reports like the one released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed the US economy adding only 20,000 in February, the fewest since September of 2017. When Obama took office, the US economy was shedding jobs at a frightening pace, more than 700,000 per month. The cuts eventually slowed and the US has added jobs every month since October of 2010, the second year of Obama's first term. That started a record-breaking streak in March 2018 that continues to this day, even with February's surprise drop-off. So the boom has come under both presidents.  It's hard to compare Trump's and Obama's job creation, since Obama took office when the economy was in dire straits and Trump took office when the economy -- despite his claim it was on a precipice -- appeared to be doing well.  Trump promised to create 25 million jobs in 10 years, and his economy did see about 4.9 million created in his first 25 months in office. That's just a smidge fewer than the 5.3 million jobs Obama saw created in the last 25 months he was in office, and also a touch below the pace of job growth promised by Trump. The economy is growing, but not at the rate Trump promised Republicans pledged sustained and remarkable economic growth as a result of Trump's economic policies and in particular as a result of his tax cuts. The US gross domestic product -- the total value of all US goods and services produced in a year -- has grown between 1.6% and 2.9% every year since 2010. The 2.9% growth in 2018 was very good, the highest since 2015. But it is not the 4% Trump promised as a candidate or the 3.2% the White House predicted more recently with the President's 2020 budget proposal.  Markets are up Trump is right that the stock market has continued to build value. But it's hard to argue it was on the verge of collapse when he took over the White House. There have been some ups and downs, but the market has been on a remarkable bull run for 10 years. It was in March of 2009, three months into Obama's administration, that the S&P 500 hit its Great Recession low of 676. Today it is just under 2,750.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which Trump uses as his yardstick, is similarly up. It was less than 8,000 when Obama took office and is at more than 25,000 today. Unemployment is way, way down The unemployment rate has been generally falling since 2009, after Obama took office. The current rate is an incredibly low 3.8%. That's even better than what economists generally consider \"full employment.\" But like the rising stock market, this trend began well before Trump's 2016 win. Another way to look at employment suggests there's work to do Another way to look at it is to apply the employment rate for the prime working age population, 25 to 54. While this view of employment also shows sustained improvement since 2009, it does not yet reflect a complete return to pre-Great Recession levels. The general trend of this metric has been upward since just after the end of the Great Recession in June 2009 through the majority of the Obama administration and all of Trump's. American wages are growing, but maybe not by enough The growth in American wages is up every year since 2010, but those gains have been focused recently on higher wage earners, exacerbating the real problem of income inequality in the US. That means, after accounting for inflation, that in real dollars Americans' wages have barely budged in decades, as Pew recently noted. Economists would generally tell you that with unemployment as low as it is, wages should be growing by more. Trump accuses the Federal Reserve of trying to tank his economy by raising interest rates, but that ignores that the Fed kept the rates low for so long to help the economy recover from the Great Recession -- not because Obama was President. While wages generally have grown, the federal minimum wage has not risen since early in the Obama administration, almost 10 years ago, and there's no indication Trump intends to increase it, although Democrats hoping to replace him want to. Now at $7.25 an hour, it would have to rise to $8.47 immediately just to keep pace with inflation. Many states have raised their minimum wages. House Democrats are moving toward a vote to ease the minimum wage up to more than $15 per hour by 2024, but that proposal faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Manufacturing jobs have increased, but not where Trump said Specifically, for some of the workers Trump promised to help -- auto workers and coal miners in the Rust Belt, -- wages have fallen. CNN's Lydia DePillis and Jeremy Moorhead recently profiled the closure of a GM plant in Ohio and the inability of some workers there to take part in government programs to retrain them for new careers. As DePillis wrote, \"As recently as the early 2000s, a job in an auto plant could be a launchpad to the middle class, but those jobs are increasingly rare. During the Lordstown plant's heyday in the 1970s, GM was one of the biggest private sector employers in the United States, with more than 618,000 employees. That number is now down to about 103,000. And the jobs that remain are not all what they once were. Since 1990, wages for US auto workers have declined 18%, adjusted for inflation. Retirement benefits have declined as well. As of 2017, only 8% of factories offered pensions.\" And the share of the US economy dedicated to manufacturing jobs has not risen and it likely won't since the US economy has moved away from manufacturing, which used to be the largest portion of the US workforce, but now accounts for less than 10%. The trade deficit has not shrunk Part of Trump's argument in favor of nixing some trade deals and reworking others is that the US should be making more things to export and buying fewer from other countries. Shrinking that trade deficit -- the amount more that the US imports than exports -- is what's behind his off-again trade war with China and his promise to improve the North American Free Trade Agreement. It's what's behind the tariffs he's threatened or levied on more than $250 billion in goods from China and other countries. The jury is still out on the NAFTA replacement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement he's proposed; Congress still has to ratify it.  But the US trade deficit has continued to grow. In fact, it has spiked more than $100 billion since Trump took office, according to the Census Bureau, which tracks the trade gap. That's the largest since 2008, before Obama was President. Trump didn't eliminate debt; he's exploding it During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to eliminate the federal debt within eight years. With six years left to fulfill his promise, the debt is exploding, largely because of the tax cuts he signed into law. The federal budget deficit, the annual shortfall between what the government brings in with taxes and what it spends on services, is up 77% in the first four months of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period last year, according to new data released by the Treasury Department. Taxes are down. Spending is up. The debt, as a result, is unlikely to be eliminated. The opposite will occur. If existing laws remain the same, the Congressional Budget Office projects the annual deficit could hit more than $1 trillion per year starting in 2022.","246":"New York (CNN Business)If lawmakers restrict stock buybacks, that could backfire on the American economy, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett warned on Friday. Hassett argued that buybacks are a reasonable way for companies to return excess cash to shareholders -- who can then invest in faster-growing startups.  \"It's a natural way our economy recycles cash from old successful firms to new entrepreneurial firms,\" Hassett told CNN's Poppy Harlow. \"If we were to stop share buybacks, or slow them down, we would be slowing down the cash flow to entrepreneurs.\" Worse, a crackdown on buybacks could \"trap the money in old firms,\" said Hassett, who is chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.   He held up \"zombie firms\" in Europe as a potential consequence of what can happen when companies don't recycle their cash. Hassett's defense of buybacks comes in the face of growing calls in Washington to dissuade companies from spending gobs of money on shareholder rewards.   Share buybacks are a common practice where companies repurchase their own stock as a way to return excess capital. Buybacks boost demand for a company's stock and also artificially inflate per-share earnings. It's a win-win for Wall Street.  US companies announced a record-shattering $1 trillion of buybacks in 2018, the first full year since the corporate tax cut took effect, according to TrimTabs Research. However, business spending on job-creating investments like new factories has not grown nearly as fast.   And Corporate America has continued to aggressively repurchase its shares this year. Major companies including Coca-Cola (KO), Cisco (CSCO), Best Buy (BBY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) have recently announced large buyback plans. Although that's a windfall for Wall Street, even some in finance think the buyback boom has gone too far. Veteran hedge fund manager Mark Yusko recently told CNN Business that buybacks should be \"illegal,\" in part because they are part of a \"self-perpetuating loop that benefits one small group of people.\" Worried about deepening inequality, Democratic Senator Cory Booker introduced a bill last year that would require companies that do buybacks to pay a commensurate sum to its workers. And last month Senators Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer urged fellow lawmakers to limit buybacks. Hassett isn't a fan of Rubio's buyback proposal Even some Republicans have criticized the practice. Republican Senator Marco Rubio recently called for ending the tax advantages that buybacks enjoy over dividends.  \"We have too often failed to make the well-being of working Americans the terms for market success,\" Rubio wrote in a February report.  Hassett previously told CNBC that Democrats' proposals to limit buybacks are \"economically illiterate\" and said proponents should be \"ashamed.\"  Asked by CNN if would say the same of Rubio's proposal, Hassett said: \"I will call a bad economic argument a bad economic argument -- regardless of who makes it.\" He held up Apple, one of the most voracious buyers of its own stock, as a prime example of how it should work. During the first three months of 2018, Apple (AAPL) spent $22.8 billion on buybacks -- more than any company in any quarter in American history, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. \"The fact is, share buybacks are a sign of a healthy economy,\" Hassett said. \"Apple has all this cash, repurchases shares and the money goes out to new entrepreneurial firms that need equity capital to come up with the next great thing.\"","247":"New York (CNN Business)Levi Strauss surged more than 30% during its public debut Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. The iconic maker of Levi's 501 blue jeans raised $623 million from the stock sale. Levi Strauss (LEVI) priced the initial public offering at $17 a share, above its expected price range.  At an early trading price of $22.97 a share, the 166-year old company is valued at about $8.9 billion. Traders at the NYSE were allowed to wear jeans to commemorate the occasion. There is usually a strict dress code that prohibits jeans on the floor of the exchange. Levi Strauss has returned to life as a publicly traded company after an absence that lasted more than 30 years. The company was publicly traded in the 1970s and early 1980s, but went private in 1985.  It could be the first of many well-known, brand name companies to go public this year. But unlike Lyft (LYFT), Uber and many other ballyhooed Silicon Valley startups, Levi Strauss is profitable.  It reported earnings last year of $285.2 million, a slight increase from 2017. Sales rose 14% in 2018 to nearly $5.6 billion. But while Levi Strauss is a household name in America, it has struggled to catch on in some emerging markets.  The company is hoping to expand in China and Brazil, which accounted for less than 4% of total sales last year.  Levi Strauss CEO Charles \"Chip\" Bergh said in an interview with CNN's Richard Quest on Thursday that the company was planning to use some of the proceeds from the stock sale to boost its presence in overseas markets. It is doing well in India. Levi Strauss opened a store there in December 2017, and followed up with an e-commerce site in January 2018.","248":"New York (CNN Business)China's weakening economy has claimed another corporate victim: Chipmaker Nvidia slashed its sales outlook for the fourth quarter, because of \"deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China.\" Nvidia expected sales of about $2.7 billion in the quarter but said Monday that it now predicts revenue will come in around $2.2 billion. The company also said its gross profit margin will be much lower than expected.  Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) plunged more than 16% in early trading on the news before rebounding a bit. Nvidia rival AMD (AMD) also fell nearly 5%. The broader market -- including tech stocks -- already fell sharply Monday morning after Dow component Caterpillar (CAT) reported earnings that missed forecasts by a wide margin. Caterpillar issued guidance that was below what Wall Street was expecting. Nvidia, which makes high-end graphics chips used for PC video games, self-driving cars and supercomputers, said demand for games in China was hurt by broader economic weakness.  The company added that sales of processors using its new Turing technology were lower than expected as consumers seem to be waiting for prices to drop. Nvidia will release its official results on February 14. Nvidia had been one of the hottest stocks in the S&P 500 in 2016 and 2017. But shares fell 30% last year because of growing worries about China's economy following a trade dispute with the United States.  Nvidia was also hit hard by the epic collapse in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' prices. Nvidia's powerful graphics chips have been used to mine bitcoin, solving complex mathematical problems needed to help produce cryptocurrencies. That market has dried up in the past year and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an earnings call in November that \"the crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected.\" ","249":"Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, is considering an independent run for the US presidency in 2020. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN. In fact, I asked that question during a CNN town hall in Houston Tuesday night, and not a single person in the audience raised their hand.  We live in an incredible country. But we all know we can do so much better. Everyone should have an opportunity to succeed in America. So what are we waiting for? I'm asking my fellow Americans if they agree we should consider another approach because it's clear the two-party system is failing us. The system as we know it simply isn't getting the job done.  My own love for America is rooted in my childhood. I grew up poor and never forgot what that feels like. Being poor isn't just about not having money. It's about a lack of access to good health care, good schools, good jobs, mentors, and role models. It's about a lack of time and transportation. It's about a lack of dignity and self-confidence. Without these opportunities and resources, it's hard for people to improve their circumstances.  Luckily, I inherited my mother's optimism that I could make a better life for myself. I also grew up at a time when access to education and a first job helped me earn success. After I became the first in my family to go to college, I got a job in sales, where I learned what it means to be accountable. Since then, and throughout my career, I have worked with teams of talented people to address many of our country's challenges by making opportunities like access to health care, jobs, and education available to more people. Over its history, Starbucks has employed some 3 million people. Everyone -- even part-time workers -- can opt in to health insurance, equity in the form of stock options, and a retirement savings plan. The company also provides qualifying employees in all 50 states access to a tuition-free college degree. More than 3,000 have already graduated; 11,000 are in now school. Under my leadership, Starbucks also started programs to raise money for small businesses, as well as employ tens of thousands of veterans, refugees, and young people who weren't in school or working. Today, I'm asking whether I can help bring more opportunities to more people -- not as a business leader, but as a public servant. Everyone should have equal opportunity to rise beyond the station of their birth, and to rise again if they have a life-altering setback. Everyone should have the equal opportunity to save for a rainy day and for retirement; to get an education and learn employable skills; to get a first job, get promoted, and experience the dignity of work. Unfortunately, these opportunities are not available to far too many Americans.  The hyper-partisanship in Washington, D.C., is exacerbating this problem. Extreme ideologies in both parties are holding our elected leaders hostage, and a culture of revenge politics is overshadowing collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving on behalf of the American people.  Take health care. While the far left calls for government-run health care, the far right calls to repeal the Affordable Care Act, with no clear replacement option. Meanwhile, both sides ignore the real problem: health care costs. The truth is there are ways to bring down the costs of care, while increasing choice and access. Take jobs. While the far left wants to guarantee government jobs and the far right touts the stock market as a proxy for economic health, both ignore the millions of Americans who lack employable skills for contemporary jobs. America does not lack jobs; many Americans lack skills for the million of jobs available today. We should invest in lifelong learning and increase vocational training and apprenticeships in every region of the country that touch all of the industries undergoing rapid change.  Take education. The far left calls for expensive college programs the country cannot afford. The far right doesn't want to spend another dime on this issue. Again, they are ignoring realities: four-year colleges are not best for everyone; schools can be held accountable for bringing down the cost of tuition; and public universities can innovate the student experience so more people can complete a degree. A more holistic, middle-ground approach to education reform will reflect the 21st-century economy and the needs of today's students and workers. In so many ways, the people of this great country are not getting the opportunities they deserve because our two-party system is broken. Americans know it, and they are ready to disrupt it.  My vision for what we can achieve in America is not based on building a coffee company. My vision is steeped in what I've learned over the years:  \u2022 Compassion and empathy for others help leaders prioritize and make better choices. \u2022 When passionate, talented people from different backgrounds come together for the same goal and work as a team, new ideas emerge and become reality. \u2022 When people talk honestly about what's broken and communicate disagreements with civility, problems get solved. \u2022 Even when people doubt something is possible, when everyone around the table agrees to sacrifice self-interest for the common good, has the courage to make bold choices, and does what is right and what is required, change happens. I am a product of the American Dream, and I know that a dream cannot be achieved without hard work. But hard work is not enough. More opportunities must be made available to more people. Once they are, more dreams will be realized, and so will the promise of our country: everyone will have a chance to rise from the ground up.","250":" (CNN)Here's a look at the European Debt Crisis, which affected Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.

Walgreens' (WBA) stock is down more than 10% this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow. CVS (CVS) has been an even bigger dud. Its stock has plunged nearly 15% year-to-date. The broader market is up more than 10% this year. Both chains are facing significant challenges, but for different reasons.  Walgreens has been hit by a crackdown from the Food and Drug Administration, which said last week that it was putting the company \"on notice\" for selling more cigarettes to minors than any other drug store retailer.  The FDA now wants to meet with Walgreens to discuss the sale of tobacco and e-cigarettes to teens. The FDA also announced a broader crackdown on flavored e-cigarettes and cigar sales to kids on Wednesday.  CVS doesn't have a tobacco problem. The company stopped selling cigarettes in 2014, citing the fact that carrying tobacco products was \"inconsistent\" with the company's broader mission as a health care company. But CVS shares have tanked this year because of worries about its recent acquisition with insurance giant Aetna. CVS CEO Larry Merlo said that 2019 will be \"a year of transition\" as the company works to integrate Aetna. Randy Hare, director of equity research at Huntington Private Bank, told CNN Business that lower prices for generic drugs and a persistent decline in reimbursement rates for medications from state and federal government health care plans is a problem for both CVS and Walgreens. That isn't helping Rite Aid (RAD) either. That chain, which recently sold a big chunk of its stores to Walgreens, announced Wednesday that it was cutting 400 jobs and that its CEO was leaving. Competition hurting both Walgreens and CVS Hare, whose firm does not own any of the drug store stocks, said that increased pharmacy competition from Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) is hurting CVS and Walgreens. Amazon recently bought online pharmacy PillPack. He added that the drug store chains are also getting squeezed by Costco (COST) and dollar store chains like Dollar General (DG), which offer a lot of the same products that you can get at the front of a drug store for much lower prices. Hare said that Walgreen looks like it might be in better shape than CVS for the short-term, mainly because the company doesn't have as much debt as CVS does following the Aetna purchase.  \"It's the dog with the least fleas,\" he said, before adding that Walgreens does face challenges that CVS doesn't -- most notably a bigger presence in sluggish European markets, because Walgreens also owns UK-based Boots.  Hare pointed out that Walgreens also still has the FDA tobacco overhang. \"In the front end of the store they try and kill you and in the back end of the store they try and save you,\" he quipped. CVS may be in better shape as it shifts to insurance The broader focus on healthier living might ultimately make CVS the better bet than Walgreens for the long haul. Lance Wilkes, an analyst with Bernstein, started coverage of CVS Wednesday with an \"outperform\" rating and argued that all the bad news about competition in the pharmacy market are already priced into the stock. Aetna will account for nearly a third of the company's total sales this year, and Aetna's growth rate will be faster than the retail and Caremark pharmacy benefits management businesses, Wiikes said in a report. CVS is morphing into a company that's more like insurance giant UnitedHealth (UNH) than a retailer. That should be good news for investors. UnitedHealth's stock is up more than 200% in the past five years while CVS has fallen nearly 25%.","252":"Rita McGrath is a professor at Columbia Business School and author of The End of Competitive Advantage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.  That may be a tall order. Buybacks make some investors and many corporate executives very, very rich. There are also some legitimate reasons for companies to repurchase shares \u2014 for instance, if their leaders believe the stock is undervalued, or to make shareholders whole after employees receive stock grants. And they represent one reliable way for management to boost the company's stock price \u2014 which makes sense, given the uncertainty around Brexit, trade wars and government shutdowns. And they are decisions that mostly fly under the radar \u2014 ordinary people seldom wake up in the morning breathless with anticipation about the latest buyback news.   But we should care more. The bulk of executive pay is now tied to a company's stock price, creating an incentive to make that price as high as possible. Prior to a 1982 SEC rule change, buybacks were illegal, as they were seen as a form of stock price manipulation. You don't have to be a genius to realize that if the bulk of executive compensation is tied to a company's stock price and buybacks make that price go up, that there will be powerful incentives for executives to put money into buybacks. Even buyback proponents recognize that the current lack of transparency and incentives to make decisions for the benefit of executives is problematic.  Still, though, stock buybacks are rife with unintended consequences.   Increased risks for long-term shareholders Essentially, a company is trading in a safe asset (cash) for a risky one (stock) when it buys back stock. The value of cash doesn't change with the vagaries of the market, but the value of a company's stock can vary.  Further, companies tend to invest in buybacks when they have cash and times are good; and they refrain from the practice in hard times. In other words, they're using current shareholder's money to, in effect, buy high and sell low.    Less money for investment Money used to repurchase shares extracts capital from the organization that could otherwise be used as a buffer against hard times, to pay and develop workers, to invest in innovation, to create the foundation for a more robust future and to contribute to healthier local communities. The numbers are staggering. In 2018 alone, companies spent a record $1 trillion on buybacks. Unlike other ways of returning excess cash to investors, such as dividends, buybacks can distort financial measures, such as earnings per share. Fewer shares? Voila, higher earnings per share.   A recent analysis by CNBC found that companies in the S&P 1500 that engaged in the most buybacks relative to their market capitalizations underperformed compared to their peers who didn't engage in the practice. Analysis by Deloitte found that the share of GDP being directed toward stock buybacks was increasing steadily, while the share devoted to investments in equipment and structures is flat or falling. Just look at General Electric. GE spent $24 billion on buybacks in 2016 and 2017, at an average price of $30.30 per share and $19.65 per share, respectively. Today, the stock is worth about $10 a share.  And we can't forget Sears. Since 2005, it spent $6 billion buying back shares, which it could have used for long-term investment that might have kept it from going bankrupt.   Money that flows out of organizations to shareholders is money that could have gone toward worker pay. One recent analysis found that the top five companies in the restaurant industry spent so much on buybacks from 2015 to 2017 that they could have afforded pay increases by an average of 25% for ordinary workers without changing anything else about their operations. Starbucks, for instance, could have given every one of its workers a $7,000 raise if it reallocated funds from buybacks to compensation.    Distorted reality The buyback phenomenon is also associated with a uniquely American anomaly. Our corporate leaders make more \u2014 a lot more \u2014 than CEOs in other parts of the world.  They are also compensated at a much higher worker-to-CEO pay ratio than in other places, according to a Bloomberg analysis. And this is in an environment in which a major predictor of how well a company's stock performs is beyond executive control. In a context in which most stocks are rising, even moderately competent leaders can appear to be doing well. After the great recession, in which share prices took a beating, almost every company was going to experience an increased stock price as the economy recovered, increases which rewarded whoever happened to be in the top jobs at the time.   Buybacks distort incentives in other ways, too. Dividends encourage stockholders to retain stocks for a long time, since that's how they will make money. Buybacks, however, reward those who sell their stocks \u2014 not those who hang in there. This has led even hard-nosed investors, such as Blackrock's Larry Fink, to express concern that companies are not investing enough for the long term. The role of buybacks in any number of negative outcomes \u2014 from underinvestment in the future to exacerbating income inequality \u2014 needs to be better understood. It's about time this practice is getting the scrutiny that it deserves.  ","253":"New York (CNN Business)How much bitcoin should I own? This is a controversial question.  Bitcoin evangelists would argue that you should go all in on cryptocurrencies because the digital assets could be the future of money.  Fans of bitcoin also claim that the value of cryptocurrencies should be more stable because there is a finite supply of coins. Governments can always print more money. But bitcoin skeptics, including investing legend Warren Buffett, think bitcoin is something to be avoided at all costs.  Buffett called it \"rat poison squared\" last year and said at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) annual shareholder meeting that it and other crytpocurrencies \"will come to bad endings.\"  Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger went a step further, saying at last year's meeting that bitcoin is \"just dementia.\"  \"It's like somebody else is trading turds and you decide you can't be left out,\" Munger added.  Munger is correct to note that bitcoin was, for a time, a speculative mania.  But the bubble has burst for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, litecoin and ripple\/XRP during the past two years.  Bitcoin (XBT) enjoyed an epic rally from just under $1,000 at the start of 2017 to nearly $20,000 by the end of that year. It now trades around $3,800.  Needless to say, something that volatile is not for the faint of heart. And even after its dramatic drop, some financial advisers say people should be very careful with bitcoin. \"I don't see a compelling reason for someone to own bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in their portfolio. It is highly speculative. There is so much risk,\" said John Norris, managing director of wealth and investments with Oakworth Capital Bank. Gold or silver may be a safer bet than bitcoin Norris said he understands that some investors consider bitcoin a hedge against currency fluctuations. But he said there are other investments that provide similar value and have a much longer track record. \"If you want to diversify away from currencies, go to the coin shop. Buy gold or silver,\" Norris said. Joe Mallen, chief investment officer of Helios Quantitative Research, agreed. He noted that he was at a client dinner in late 2017 where retirees were asking about bitcoin. That convinced him it was a bubble.  \"If you really have no idea what bitcoin is but people are telling you it's the next big thing, you should avoid it,\" Mallen said. This isn't to say that investors should steer clear of bitcoin-related investments entirely. There are well-known companies making big bets on blockchain, the public digital ledger of transactions that is the backbone for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Think blockchain instead of bitcoin Many companies, like software and services giant IBM (IBM), graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) and payments company Square (SQ), have blockchain and other crypto-related businesses.  Even banking titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM) recently launched JPM Coin to help speed up some cross-border client transactions. Its coin comes despite the fact that CEO Jamie Dimon is a noted crypto critic who once said he'd fire people for trading bitcoin. Norris conceded that a small wager on bitcoin could make sense. You just need to have realistic expectations. There's a greater chance that the investment won't pan out than there is of it making you rich.  \"If you want to have a little fun, bitcoin is like betting on the ponies,\" he said. \"It's a roll of the dice. You're taking a flier. You could win big. But you can lose your shirt on this.\" When should you sell a stock? Does gold make sense for a long-term portfolio? Do you have questions about how to build wealth? Ask us here and you may be included in a future column.","254":"New York (CNN Business)The backlash against stock buybacks has gone bipartisan. Republican Senator Marco Rubio released a report on Tuesday that called for ending the tax advantages that share buybacks enjoy over dividends. The goal is to encourage companies to invest in the future rather than give them tax incentives to reward shareholders.   \"We have too often failed to make the well-being of working Americans the terms for market success,\" Rubio wrote in the report, which was released through the Senate Small Business Committee that he chairs. Rubio's pushback against buybacks comes as Democrats have slammed the spike in share repurchases sparked by the 2017 tax law. US companies announced more than $1 trillion of buybacks in 2018, the first full year since the tax law took effect, according to TrimTabs Investment Research.  While announced buybacks surged by 71% in 2018, government statistics show that business spending on job-creating investments like factories and equipment grew at a much more moderate pace. Fixed business investment increased just 8.2% through the first three quarters of 2018. Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently dubbed it the \"investment boom that wasn't.\" \"Cash spent on share repurchases is not cash spent on capital investment,\" the Small Business Committee report wrote, though it conceded that the relationship varies by sector and firm type.  The Rubio-led committee noted that share buybacks are \"tax-advantaged over dividends.\" Ending this preference, the report said, could increase capital investment by shifting \"shareholder appetite for capital return.\" Taxing buybacks like dividends Under current law, dividend payouts are normally taxed as ordinary income, based on investors' income levels. But shareholders that sell their stock during a share buyback get taxed at the lower capital gains rate. And they only pay that capital gain tax if they have a realized gain, not if they have a loss on the investment. Most shareholders don't sell during share buybacks, delaying the tax impact altogether. The report was not specific about what buyback policy changes need to be considered. However, a Rubio aide told CNN Business that the Republican Senator plans to introduce legislation that would require share buybacks to be taxed just like dividends.  For instance, if a company spends $1 billion on buybacks in a given year, shareholders would get taxed on a portion of that $1 billion based on how many shares they own. Notably, this tax would apply even if shareholders decide not to sell into the buyback.  The goal is to eliminate the tax preference that investors have for buybacks over dividends, which are harder to turn on and off.  Rubio wants full expensing Rubio wants to use the revenue raised by the tax to finance other incentives for capital investment. The 2017 tax law, which Rubio voted for, allows businesses to immediately and fully expense most new capital investments. But the provision expires after 2022. The Rubio-led committee suggested using the revenue raised by further taxing buybacks to make this incentive permanent -- and expand it to include not just equipment but facilities as well.  It's not the first time that Rubio has criticized the explosion of stock buybacks.  In December, Rubio penned a piece in the Atlantic that called for a carrot-and-stick approach toward encouraging investment. The carrot is the full-expensing incentive, while the stick is taxing buybacks at the same rate as dividends.  \"At present, Wall Street rewards companies for engaging in stock buybacks, temporarily increasing their stock prices at the expense of productive investment,\" Rubio wrote in the Atlantic.  Some critics fear that the widespread use of buybacks is deepening America's income and wealth inequality problem. \"It's a self-perpetuating loop that benefits one small group of people,\" hedge fund manager Mark Yusko told CNN Business last week.  Unintended consequences? Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco, said it makes sense for Washington to focus on encouraging business investment. \"Senator Rubio is rightly concerned with American competitiveness and recognizes the tax code has an amazing ability to incentivize certain corporate behaviors,\" Hooper told CNN Business in an email. \"However, we need to recognize that any legislation has unintended consequences.\" For instance, Hooper noted that one reason companies buy back stock is to give it to employees to ensure their interests are aligned with that of the company.  \"Presumably a tax like this would discourage a positive behavior like that,\" she said.  Boston College finance professor Jeffrey Pontiff thinks Rubio's proposal could succeed in encouraging business investment. However, he worries that taxing buybacks would discourage investors from backing innovative companies in the United States rather than ones based overseas. \"It's a tax on people who own stocks. It will increase the capital burden,\" said Pontiff. \"In the long run, increasing taxes on investment by public shareholders decreases the amount of capital flowing into the stock market into firms trying to raise capital.\"","255":"If your day doesn't start until you've gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

He wants \"concrete and effective\" results. Francis started things off by floating some proposals, including creating a kind of handbook church leaders could use when abuse accusations are made. The Pope also proposed\u00a0dioceses and Catholic groups not publish lists of clergy accused of abuse before a preliminary investigation and \"definitive\" condemnation have occurred. That's controversial with abuse survivors, who say the public deserves to know when\u00a0an accusation is made. After Francis spoke, he and church leaders watched emotional video from clergy abuse victims. 4. Venezuela It's as if Venezuela is\u00a0trying to close itself off from the world. President Nicolas Maduro said he will close Venezuela's border with Brazil in a bid to stop foreign aid deliveries. He's also thinking about closing the border with Colombia. That would seal off most of his country's inland territory. And Venezuela has already closed maritime borders and blocked flights to and from nearby Caribbean islands.

He also believes a recession is not imminent in the United Sates, even though the economy is likely to slow. The market should react positively to that. Siegel has said in recent interviews on CNBC and SiriusXM that the market turmoil of late 2018 has helped bring down valuations to more reasonable levels.

","257":" (CNN)Unless a court intervenes, a federal ban on bump stocks -- attachments that essentially allow shooters to fire semiautomatic rifles continuously with one pull of the trigger -- will start Tuesday. The Justice Department issued the rule in December, deciding that existing prohibitions against fully automatic weapons also covered bump stocks.  Owners were given 90 days to turn in or destroy them, and that period ends Tuesday. Bump stocks came under scrutiny after the October 2017 massacre in Las Vegas. Stephen Paddock opened fire from his hotel suite onto outdoor concertgoers with rifles fitted with bump stocks, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds of others.  The Supreme Court on Monday night received at least two emergency appeals asking the justices to put the bump stock ban on hold. In one case out of the District of Columbia called Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, two individuals who own bump stocks and three groups say the DC Court of Appeals has yet to rule on their appeal. They are asking the justices to put any ruling on hold for 48 hours after it comes down so the groups can file a timely appeal with the Supreme Court.  In another case out of the 6th Circuit, Gun Owners of America and other individuals are asking for a stay because they say the regulation issued by the Trump administration will become effective at midnight Monday. They say the administration's rule mandates the destruction of more than 500,000 bump stocks that are valued at over $100 million. They argue the final rule \"reverses well over a decade of consistent ATF classification of bump stocks as unregulated firearm accessories.\"  Here's what to know about bump stocks, the ban and what owners need to do: What bump stocks are First, consider the difference between legal semiautomatic weapons and banned fully automatic weapons. With a semiautomatic weapon, one round is fired for each single pull of the trigger, and the weapon reloads itself as long as ammunition remains.  With a fully automatic weapon, once the trigger is pulled and held, the weapon will keep firing until the ammunition is gone or the trigger is released. Bump stocks are meant to replace the standard stock and grip of a semiautomatic rifle. They attach to a rifle's receiver, or frame. The bump stock uses recoil effects to bounce the rifle off the shooter's shoulder and bump the trigger back into the trigger finger. This speeds up what the rate of fire would have been without the bump stock. It effectively mimics fully automatic gunfire. As the Justice Department now puts it: Bump stocks allow \"the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter.\" But back in 2010, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that bump stocks were merely accessories, or firearms parts -- and therefore not regulated as a firearm. How the ban came about Soon after the Las Vegas shooting, President Donald Trump vowed to outlaw bump stocks.  But some lawmakers and some gun lobbyists resisted, making new legislation unlikely. That made a regulatory change the only realistic path to accomplishing the President's goal. At Trump's direction, the Justice Department in March 2018 proposed a rule clarifying that bump stocks were not merely parts, but instead were \"machine guns\" -- what the federal government calls fully automatic weapons -- as defined by existing law. Why? Because \"such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger,\" similar to automatic rifles, the Justice Department said. Defining bump stocks as machine guns effectively bans them. Civilian possession of fully automatic weapons was outlawed in 1986 except for those already lawfully in people's ownership. After considering public comments about the proposal, the department finalized and published the rule on December 26. And there is no grandfather clause for bump stocks, the new rule says, because they weren't manufactured until well after the 1986 law went into effect. Some gun-owner advocacy groups sued the Justice Department, asking a federal court to prevent the ban. They argued, in part, that the Justice Department violated procedural requirements. They also argued that the official who signed the rule, Matthew Whitaker, who then was the acting US attorney general, did not have authority to do so. A judge rejected those arguments in February. Who the ban affects Most immediately, people who own, make or sell them. The Justice Department says as many as seven US bump stock manufacturers have operated since 2010, but only one remained by late 2018. Two businesses stopped making them after the rule was proposed in March 2018, \"due to their inability to obtain liability insurance,\" the department says. Slide Fire Solutions, the Texas company that invented bump stocks, said it shut down its online store in June. The Justice Department says it doesn't know how many people own bump stocks, but it estimates that up to 520,000 devices were sold. What owners need to do The Justice Department says owners should do one of two things by Tuesday: Destroy the devices, or drop them off at an ATF field office. How do you destroy a bump stock? The ATF suggests cutting, crushing, melting or shredding it -- and it offers an online how-to guide. Washington state offered a buyback alternative for its residents. On Monday, people can surrender up to five bump stocks at Washington State Patrol offices in exchange for $150 per device. These are the penalties owners face risk if they don't comply Possession of a bump stock, like possession of a machine gun, will be punishable by fines and up to 10 years in prison.","258":"Trita Parsi is the author of \"Losing an Enemy -- Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy.\" He teaches at Georgetown University's Center for Security Studies. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. And with the Iran nuclear deal facing existential challenges over the next few months, the boost for Zarif could not have come at a better time. Zarif is not the first Iranian official to make this gamble. In 1952, Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh found himself curtailed by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Iranian Constitution gave Mossadegh the prerogative to name the minister of war, a portfolio Mossadegh sought to hold himself. The Shah balked, fearing that Mossadegh was angling to reduce the Shah's authority at a time when Mossadegh's popularity was rising due to his campaign to nationalize Iran's oil industry and prevent Britain from keeping all the revenue from Iran's most valuable natural resource.  Mossadegh decided to raise the stakes. He sent a letter of resignation to the Shah, stating that \"in the actual situation it is not possible for the Iranian people to be victorious in the struggle which it has begun,\" indirectly suggesting that the Shah was undermining Iran in its dispute with the British and directly appealing to the public to rally behind him.  The Shah tried to outmaneuver his premier. He accepted Mossadegh's resignation and appointed Ahmad Ghavam as the new prime minister. Ghavam was an Iranian politician who favored a softer approach toward the British. As Mossadegh had predicted, the decision did not go down well with the Iranian public. Five days of strikes and nationwide protests ensued.  Under pressure, the Shah dismissed Ghavam and reinstated Mossadegh -- and granted him the control over the armed forces that was at the center of the standoff. Within five days of handing in his resignation, Mossadegh emerged greatly strengthened and more popular than ever. (The victory was short lived, however, as the United States and the United Kingdom organized a coup against Mossadegh a year later). But not all such gambits have paid off. In 2011, the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tried his own wager. Infuriated by Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei's reinstatement of a Cabinet minister Ahmadinejad had fired, the Iranian hardliner simply stopped showing up for work. He didn't even attend his own Cabinet meetings, hoping this would force Khamenei to relent.  It did not. Instead, Khamenei gave Ahmadinejad an ultimatum: Accept the Supreme Leader's intervention or resign. After 11 days of sulking, Ahmadinejad returned to work with his tail between his legs, humiliated and weakened.  Zarif's wager was more sophisticated. When the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (also known as the Iran deal) was reached, Zarif's popularity was at its peak. He was given a hero's welcome at the Tehran airport usually reserved for Olympic gold medalists, not foreign ministers. But President Donald Trump's crusade against the nuclear deal has left Iranians deeply disappointed. The economic benefits Iran was promised were never delivered, and with Trump's new sanctions -- combined with the government's own mismanagement and corruption -- ordinary Iranians face a very dim economic future. Trump's sabotage of the Iran deal gave space to hardliners in Iran to attack the Hassan Rouhani government for seeking to accommodate the West. Increasingly, they were scapegoating Zarif, not only to block his efforts to keep Iran inside the deal and press Iranian banks to adopt international transparency standards, but also to block any future diplomatic efforts with Washington. In Iran, Zarif is synonymous with diplomacy.  The hardliners were closing in on Zarif. But after his performance at the Munich security conference last month -- which once again boosted his popularity and even forced Iranian hardliners to grudgingly praise him -- Zarif saw his opportunity. Following Mossadegh's example, he announced his resignation publicly to maximize the likelihood of a public outcry in his favor.  The shrewd Iranian diplomat-turned-academic-turned-politician knew very well that the resignation was meaningless, short of Rouhani and Ayatollah Khamenei's acceptance. Which he calculated they wouldn't provide due to the political cost. Indeed, within 24 hours, the Tehran Stock Exchange was plummeting and 150 members of Parliament issued a letter urging Rouhani to reject Zarif's resignation; all the while Rouhani was sending emissaries to Zarif, pleading with him to return and insisting that the resignation was \"against national interests.\" Even key conservatives felt compelled to praise Zarif. The powerful commander of Iran's Quds Forces, Qassem Soleimani, publicly lauded Zarif as someone who \"has always been supported by the top officials, especially the Supreme Leader.\" And less than two days into the drama, word was out that Ayatollah Khamenei believed that Zarif's resignation was not \"expedient,\" signaling his crucial support for Zarif as well.  Zarif is now serving as foreign minister per the insistence of the Supreme Leader himself, providing him with much-needed protection against Iran's anti-diplomacy hardliners.  But it is not just Iran's hardliners who were left weakened and disappointed by Zarif's success. Proponents of confrontation with Iran in Washington, Riyadh and Tel Aviv were all caught celebrating Zarif's departure prematurely. \"Zarif is gone -- good riddance,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said only hours into the drama, revealing his inability to understand the political machinations in the country he defines as an existential threat to Israel. Saudi Arabian Deputy Defense Minister Prince Khalid Bin Salman, in turn, wishfully tweeted that the episode had left Zarif's authority diminished, echoing hawks in the United States who insisted that Zarif's victory was pyrrhic at best. For the survival of the Iran deal, the strengthening of Zarif is crucial. By all accounts, the economic situation in Iran is going to continue to deteriorate as Trump escalates his economic war. The European Union effort to set up an alternative payment system for legal trade with Iran, called INSTEX, is, according to EU diplomats, more of a political signal in support of the deal than a measure to provide Iran the economic relief it has been promised.  To make matters worse, the tenures of two principal defenders of the deal in Europe -- Federica Mogherini and Helga Schmid -- come to an end in May. This will leave Zarif as the only architect of the deal who continues to hold office, besides Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Zarif's strengthened position is also crucial for two other reasons. It signals to the Trump administration that its attempt to frustrate the Iranians into exiting the deal -- which could potentially pave the way for military action against Iran -- is failing. In other words, Zarif's presence deprives international hardliners of the pretext for war they have been so desperately seeking. But it also serves as a warning to future Democratic administrations: The United States would be wise to seek a clean re-entry into the Iran deal -- without any misguided temptations to issue preconditions for the United States to uphold its obligations.  Just as the Democrats would reject any foolish attempts to renegotiate the Paris climate agreement, they should do so for the Iran deal. If they were to approach the two multilateral agreements differently, as some have suggested, then Democrats would be continuing Trump's sabotage-and-renegotiate strategy, signaling to the Iranians that Zarif was wrong and the hardliners were right all along: America cannot be trusted. ","259":"New York (CNN Business)Snapchat didn't add any users last quarter, but it didn't lose any either. For some companies, that might not be great news; for Snapchat, it's enough to get Wall Street positively ecstatic. Snap (SNAP), its parent company, said Tuesday that the messaging app had 186 million daily users in the final three months of 2018, unchanged from the prior quarter and ending a streak of two consecutive quarters of declining users. The company had said in October that it expected its user numbers to continue declining during the holiday quarter. On a conference call with analysts Tuesday after the report, Snap's interim CFO Lara Sweet said the company is \"cautiously optimistic\" that daily users will not decline in the first three months of 2019, either.  Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst with eMarketer, called the surprise leveling off \"a positive sign\" for the company after a prolonged user decline. Snap stock jumped nearly 20% in after hours trading Tuesday following the earnings report. While Snapchat's audience growth stalled, the company did manage to squeeze significantly more revenue out of the users it had. Snap's revenue for the holiday quarter hit a record $390 million, up 36% from the same period a year ago and well ahead of what investors had expected.  \"In 2018, we focused on building a foundation to scale the business over the long-term by driving sustainable product innovation, scaling our advertising platform, and hiring the leadership team that will help us achieve our future goals,\" Evan Spiegel, Snap's cofounder and CEO, said in a statement. \"We ended the year with user engagement stabilizing.\" The earlier dip in users followed a controversial early 2018 redesign of the Snapchat app, which was intended to revive user growth but initially appeared to do the opposite.  The redesign separated content posted by users' friends from content posted by publishers and celebrities, in an effort make Snapchat's confusing interface less confusing. Instead, it set off an outcry.  A Change.org petition asking the company to remove the redesign received more than one million signatures. Prominent users like reality TV star Kylie Jenner and model Chrissy Teigen also publicly took issue with the changes. Snapchat eventually redesigned the redesign after the backlash.  The company has also faced fierce competition from Facebook, which found success in cloning Snapchat's Stories feature on Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook proper. Instagram Stories now has 500 million daily users. To make matters worse, Snap has seen an exodus of high-profile executives over the past year. The list includes its chief strategy officer, VP of marketing, VP or product, human resources chief, and not one but two chief financial officers.  On the conference call, Spiegel said Snap's senior team is focused on filling the CFO and marketing roles in particular. But he said it's his belief that Snap's leadership team \"has really evolved and is ready for the next stage of growth.\" \"Change is always difficult,\" Spiegel said on the call. \"This past year was no exception.\" ","260":"New York (CNN Business)Boeing's stock fell sharply for a second straight day as more nations and airlines grounded the company's 737 MAX 8 planes. Shares of Boeing (BA) fell more than 11% over the past two days: The stock fell 6% Tuesday following a 5% drop on Monday. The stock's slide follows the tragic Ethiopian Airlines plane crash on Sunday that killed all 157 passengers and crew on board.  The European Union Aviation Safety Agency announced Tuesday that it was suspending all Boeing 737 Max 8 flights in Europe as a \"precautionary measure.\" The EU joins China, Australia, the UK and several other nations in deciding to halt Boeing 737 MAX 8 flights. The United States has yet to do so.  The FAA said in a statement late Monday that is \"collecting data and keeping in contact with international civil aviation authorities\" as more information about the crash becomes available.  Boeing said that it has \"full confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX.\"  \"We understand that regulatory agencies and customers have made decisions that they believe are most appropriate for their home markets. We'll continue to engage with them to ensure they have the information needed to have confidence in operating their fleets,\" Boeing added.   The company also noted that the FAA \"is not mandating any further action at this time, and based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators.\" But Utah Senator Mitt Romney urged the FAA to follow the lead of other international agencies.  He wrote in a tweet Tuesday that \"out of an abundance of caution for the flying public, the [FAA] should ground the 737 MAX 8 until we investigate the causes of recent crashes and ensure the plane's airworthiness.\" Senator Ted Cruz added in a tweet later Tuesday that \"in light of the decisions of regulatory agencies across the world to ground the Model 737 Max, I believe it would be prudent for the United States likewise to temporarily ground 737 Max aircraft until the FAA confirms the safety of these aircraft & their passengers.\" And the influential magazine Consumer Reports also weighed in, saying Tuesday that major airlines that have Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes in their fleets, including American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV), should ground the planes even if the FAA does not ask them to do so. \"If the airlines will not ground the planes, CR says the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should,\" the magazine said. American said it would monitor the investigation of Sunday's crash but it has \"full confidence in the aircraft and our crew members.\" Southwest said, \"We remain confident in the safety and airworthiness of the MAX 8. We don't have any changes planned to our MAX 8 operating plans.\" Wall Street is still backing Boeing as well. As of Tuesday afternoon, 19 of the 24 analysts that were following the company had it rated a buy. The consensus earnings estimates for Boeing for this quarter and the full year hadn't changed in the past week either.","261":" (CNN)Both Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and freshman New York Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez want to tax the rich -- but the two progressive Democratic icons are proposing going about it in very different ways.  Most proposals to tax the rich have focused on raising rates on income and capital gains, as well as increasing estate taxes. That's what Ocasio-Cortez raised on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month, when she proposed setting rates as high as 70% on earnings above $10 million to help fund a climate change plan she describes as a \"Green New Deal.\" Warren, on the other hand, wants to tap into different pool of money -- the assets of the wealthy. A plan developed by her nascent presidential campaign would impose a 2% tax on Americans whose net worth exceeds $50 million, with an additional 1% levy on billionaires, according to documents provided by Warren's presidential campaign.  While hiking taxes on the rich is typically a go-to move for Democrats, a recent Fox News poll found that voters in both parties generally support raising rates on multimillionaires. Democrats are more enthusiastic, with 85% favoring raising taxes on those making more than $10 million. Some 54% of Republicans agree with this. Ocasio-Cortez is the latest to lead the charge on boosting rates for high earners. \"There's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes,\" she said. \"Once you get to the tippie-tops, on your $10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%. That doesn't mean all $10 million dollars are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.\" The nation's top income tax rate was 70% in the 1970s, though the tax system was much different back then. It dropped significantly during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, then rose a bit under Democratic presidents and fell somewhat under Republican ones. Most recently, the 2017 tax bill trimmed the top rate to 37%, down from 39.6%. While it may sound good to some to raise the top rate, many experts say this is not the most effective way to hike taxes on the rich since it would only hit taxable income above $10 million. \"Just raising income tax rates on the highest-income households doesn't do as much for progressivity as some wish,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, wrote in a blog post the day after Ocasio-Cortez' comments aired. Since Ocasio-Cortez has not yet offered a detailed formal proposal, the center has not calculated how much additional revenue raising the top rate to 70% could bring in. But it's likely that high earners would try to shift their income into capital gains -- by being paid in stock, deferring compensation or other methods -- in order to minimize the tax hit, Gleckman said. Warren, meanwhile, is suggesting taxing accumulated wealth, not annual income. University of California Berkeley economics professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who analyzed the proposal for the Warren team, estimate that 75,000 households -- less than the wealthiest 0.1% -- would be subject to this tax. The plan would raise around $2.75 trillion over 10 years. Experts are divided over how well a wealth tax would work and whether it is permitted by the US Constitution, which limits Congress' power to levy so-called \"direct taxes.\" Several scholars, including multiple former heads of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, have written to the Warren campaign defending the plan's legality.  Supporters of Warren's proposal say it would enable the government to tax the vast assets of the wealthy, including closely-held businesses, mansions, artwork and financial holdings. Currently, these are typically only taxed when they are sold -- and even then, they are subject to a lower capital gains rate. \"Simply raising a tax rate on an existing base is not going to do very much,\" said David Kamin, a law professor at New York University and former special assistant for economic poilcy in the Obama administration. Warren's proposal is \"more effectively taxing people who are not captured to a significant degree in our current income tax, who have built up large fortunes and simply aren't paying very much tax relative to those fortunes.\" But wealth taxes can be difficult to administer since the rich have assets that are hard to value. \"Imagine a large privately-held company\u2014its value could change almost daily. How would the tax handle these fluctuations?\" wrote right-leaning Tax Foundation analysts Nicole Kaeding and Kyle Pomerleau in a post. They noted that several countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development have dropped their wealth taxes because of the challenges posed by collection. The wealth tax gives the IRS a chance to tighten its existing rules for valuing assets to close loopholes and to develop new valuation rules, Warren's campaign says in a summary of her proposed tax. To limit people's ability to evade the tax, she would provide a significant increase in the agency's enforcement budget and set a minimum audit rate for taxpayers in this asset category, among other measures. Both Warren and Ocasio-Cortez have made clear they're open to each others' ideas. Spokespeople for both lawmakers said they support both types of tax hikes on the wealthy since both would minimize income inequality.  \"If you really want to go after concentrated wealth, you have to tax wealth itself,\" according to a Warren campaign aide. \"This is not to say you can't change income taxes, and I think [Warren] would be supportive of that. But this is really the way to get at the dramatic inequality and concentration of wealth that we have in America.\" \"This is not an either\/or question,\" said Corbin Trent, communications director for Ocasio-Cortez. \"This is a question about how we reform our entire tax policy in this country to address two of the biggest challenges that we faced as a nation over the past thirty years, which are income and wealth inequality.\"","262":"Kate Maltby is a broadcaster and columnist in the United Kingdom on issues of culture and politics, and a theater critic for The Guardian.

But if you've been bitten by the Waller-Bridge bug, you should have also discovered the cult British show \"Fleabag,\" which premiered its second season in the UK this Monday and launches in the United States on Amazon Prime March 17.  In the TV series, we observe the mortifying life of a self-destructive 30-something incapable of adult self-reliance -- the title is a nickname which hints at the depths of her self-loathing. But unlike most millennial comedies, we're never asked to excuse away our anti-heroine's irresponsibility. Fleabag's selfishness causes real pain -- to her lovers, to her widowed father and eventually (season one spoiler!) to the best friend she turns out to have driven toward suicide.  Imagine \"Girls,\" but with ten times the self-knowledge and no pretense anyone would actually be friends with the Lena Dunham character.  Nearly a decade on from the start of \"Girls,\" which Dunham helmed, a new generation of millennial showrunners are telling their own stories, but those stories have only gotten more nihilistic. Eye-rolling about millennial fecklessness is a stock-in-trade of press and media. Yet the success of \"Fleabag\" emerges just as transatlantic culture seems to be casting a sympathetic eye on the millennial generation for the first time. This weekend, a widely-read New York Times Style feature looked into the phenomenon of millennials receiving parental financial support even into their mid-30s. It's an easy subject to mock, yet writer Hannah Seligson managed to frame with empathy the multiple reasons why baby boomer parents still hold most of society's capital; and why so many of them feel the need to transfer that wealth in time for their grandchildren to be raised securely. Although yes, most of them are white, US-born families privileging their children accordingly.   Understandably, there was a bit more online mockery for a piece at New York Magazine's The Cut profiling a 34 year old woman who receives $20,000 a year from her mother to spend on clothes. But even in that piece, we're given a glimpse of the self-doubt that can ensue when this kind of parental patronage functions as a form of parental control. \"It was always important to my mom that we look our best,\" writes the anonymous millennial. A worthy mantra, but not when it enables passive-aggressive gifts of expensive anti-aging cream.   There's one obvious reason why we're beginning to hear the millennials' side of the story. Millennials are getting older -- and a critical mass of millennials are reaching positions of influence in the workplace, including in the media and entertainment industries which write our culture's stories. Waller-Bridge is 33, and over the last few years has become one of the most powerful people in British TV. In \"Fleabag,\" she even got to cast \"the\" most powerful person, recent Oscar-winner Olivia Colman, in a supporting role. And it turns out that \"Fleabag\" is a defense of the millennial generation, after all. Waller-Bridge's character is selfish as anything, but her howl of rage is an indictment of the boomer class who've raised her without the equipment to cope in the adult world. In an allegory of boomer-economics, her father has checked out of parenting his motherless daughters, in order to enjoy life with his sex-obsessed, saccharine new fianc\u00e9e, played by Colman.  He occasionally spends money on his daughter, but only because he is compensating for investing emotionally. In the opening scene of the latest series, Fleabag is delighted to be handed a slim envelope as a birthday present. Turns out, it's a voucher for a single session of counseling. Thanks to his uselessness, and like an increasing number of millennials, she needs a lot more than just the one session.  Even sexual liberation, won by a previous generation, is a baby-boomer Trojan horse. Colman's character, at her most villainous, trills enthusiastically about destroying the old world's sexual hang-ups (notably, when she's forcing Fleabag to stare at a homemade sculpture of her father's penis.) In turn, our anti-heroine narrates her own way through a series of soul-destroying superficial liaisons, big on comedy body parts, short on love. It's here, in a series of mutually-deceptive couplings, that comedy turns to tragedy most quickly. Perhaps the baby boomers taught us all the wrong things about relationships?   It's 30 years this year since Billy Joel sang \"We Didn't Start the Fire,\" the baby boomer anthem for a generation who felt themselves born into a world their parents had irredeemably broken. Now, the boomer's children are flinging the same complaint back at the parents.  Even Villanelle, the childlike assassin at the center of \"Killing Eve,\" is a millennial acting out against a world whose problems started long before she arrived. Eventually, she even lashes out at her baby boomer paymasters. Millennials, in the Waller-Bridge universe, may be selfish and erratic. But their parents are worse -- even when they're paying the rent.","263":" (CNN)A raft of nations have temporarily suspended Boeing 737 Max flights after the fatal plane crash in Ethiopia but the United States and Canada are still flying a substantial number of those models.  The European Union began suspending Boeing 737 Max flights in Europe on Tuesday, joining more than a dozen nations and aviation authorities that have halted the aircraft's operations all over the world. The move came after a Max 8 flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Nairobi, Kenya, crashed Sunday into a field six minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board. The flight reported technical problems and asked for permission to turn back before it crashed, and investigations are underway into the cause. It's the second time in less than six months that this model has crashed soon after takeoff. A new Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 flight went down in October over the Java Sea off Indonesia, killing 189 people.  Multiple countries ground planes Before the EU's announcement, nations like Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Oman, Singapore, Turkey and the United Kingdom announced their own bans on Tuesday.   The UK, Oman, Singapore, Australia, Ireland and France and Norwegian Airlines suspended the whole Boeing 737 Max range.  India, Dubai, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Iceland, Germany and the airlines LOT Polish, TUI Airways, GOL Linhas Aereas, Aeromexico, Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas, Cayman Airways, Comair Airways, Eastar Jet, Jet Airways, Mongolian Airlines, China Airlines, China Eastern, China Southern, Lion Air and Silkair have suspended the Max 8 model. Turkey suspended Max 8 and 9 models. The Max 9 has never crashed, but It was included in an FAA emergency airworthiness directive following the Lion Air crash. These airlines are still flying 737 Max planes: American, United and Southwest airlines, Fiji Airways, Icelandair, Flydubai, Spicejet and WestJet.  China's aviation administration became the first to order a suspension Monday evening, grounding all domestic Boeing 737 Max 8 jets due to its principle of \"zero tolerance for safety hazards.\" China has one of the world's largest fleets of Boeing 737 Max 8s, operating 97 of the planes, according to Chinese state-run media. But the fallout has appeared to affect Boeing's bottom line. The aircraft maker's stock dropped 8% Monday, with investors voicing concerns about the 737 and Boeing's future in China, predicted soon to become the world's first trillion-dollar market for jets.\u00a0 While some international airlines and governments\u00a0grounded\u00a0the 737 Max 8 planes,\u00a0US airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing have not.  Daniel K. Elwell, acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, said the agency has reviewed all available data. \"Thus far, our review shows no systematic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.  Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action,\" Elwell said in a statement. Boeing said it has \"full confidence\" in the safety of the 737 Max but said it understands the decisions made by customers.  In a statement in its official Twitter account, the company also reiterated that safety remains its No. 1 priority. Growing concern There is no evidence of a link between the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, but the similarities have prompted some airlines to take extra safety precautions while both investigations are ongoing.  \"Given in both air crashes, the aircrafts were newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 8, and both accidents occurred during the takeoff, they share certain similarities,\" the Chinese aviation administration said in a statement Monday. It added that it would contact Boeing and the FAA to confirm \"flight safety\" issues before allowing the planes to fly again. On Tuesday, Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde GebreMariam said that the pilots of Flight 302 told air traffic control they were having \"flight control problems\" before the crash. GebreMariam said the flight data recorders \"will be sent overseas\" but didn't specify where since Ethiopia lack the technical capacity.  Pilots were aware of an airworthiness directive issued after the Lion Air crash in October and had had additional training, he said. Aviation safety experts and regulators around the world remain divided on whether the Boeing 737 Max 8 is safe. \"I've never said that it's unsafe to fly a particular model of aircraft, but in this case, I'm going to have to go there,\" David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector told CNN, saying that passengers don't have enough information.  Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, said he believes it's too early for American authorities to ground the jets.","264":"New York (CNN Business)Tesla is expected to post healthy sales growth this year. The company is finally starting to sell its ballyhooed Model 3 at an affordable price of $35,000. And Tesla also is about to launch a new Model Y crossover at an event in Los Angeles on Thursday. But none of that matters to Wall Street.  Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are down 15% this year -- a time when the broader market is rallying and rival auto companies GM (GM) and Ford (F) are both up more than 10%. Ross Gerber, co-founder, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, thinks Tesla has been unfairly punished. His firm owns more than 40,000 shares of Tesla, a stake currently worth about $11 million. Gerber is an unabashed Tesla bull. He said that the company is rapidly expanding its Gigafactories to build more batteries for its electric vehicles. He notes that Tesla's Model S and Model X get rave reviews from customers. And Gerber is optimistic about Tesla's plans to start making an electric pickup truck and a semi truck that has already received orders from Walmart (WMT).  But Gerber concedes that Tesla and CEO Elon Musk need to do a better job of getting its message across to Wall Street. Musk has often made lofty promises and committed to aggressive deadlines that the company hasn't been able to meet.  Then there's the issue with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has cracked down on Musk for tweeting too much about Tesla.  The SEC accused Musk of violating an agreement with the agency following a recent tweet about production targets. Tesla has shot back, arguing that the SEC is trying to restrict Musk's right to free speech. \"Tesla's biggest issue is poor communication. They continue to lurch from announcement to announcement with lot of uncertainty,\" Gerber said in an email to CNN Business.

The United States joined other countries and grounded its 737 Max planes. Shares of Boeing (BA) fell 3% immediately after President Donald Trump announced the move from the White House.  The shares then rebounded in a sign that the grounding had been largely priced in to Boeing's stock. But even after ending Wednesday slightly higher, the stock is still down more than 10% since the crash, wiping more than $25 billion off the company's market value. The US grounding comes after two fatal crashes in the last five months involving the 737 Max 8 jet. A Lion Air flight crashed in Indonesia in October, and an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday. Neither of the crashes left any survivors.  Investigators are still looking into the cause of both crashes.  A preliminary investigation shows that pilots in the Lion Air crash struggled to get control of the plane after the nose was forced down by an automatic safety feature. The CEO of Ethiopian Airlines said his pilots also were reporting problems controlling the plane before the crash. Aviation authorities around the world have been ordering the planes to be grounded for the last three days. The United States was essentially the last country allowing the planes to fly.  Boeing said it remains confident in the safety of the jets, but that it recommended the shutdown itself \"out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft's safety,\" according to a statement from the company.  \"We are supporting this proactive step,\" CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in the statement. \"We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.\"  He again expressed the company's sympathy to the families of victims of the crash and said that the company has no greater priority than the safety of its aircraft.  Shares of the three US airlines that had been using the planes - American Airlines, Southwest and United - saw their shares briefly shoot lower on the news, and then quickly rebound to positive territory. It is very possible that Boeing will compensate the three carriers for lost revenue. There are  67 737 Max planes that operate between them. The airlines all said they would work to accommodate passengers affected by the grounding. But the planes make up small portion of their overall fleets -- Boeing Max jets account for less than 3% of the capacity of each of the airlines.  Boeing has a history of paying airlines if planes they own are grounded because of safety orders. It did so after a three-month grounding of the 787 Dreamliner jet in 2013.  Earlier Wednesday, the CEO of European discount carrier Norwegian Air said it would bill  Boeing for lost revenue from the grounding of 18 737 Max 8 jets.","266":"CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals, an ongoing series. Fatick, Senegal \u2014 Marie Diouf, 35, is on her cellphone speaking swiftly in Wolof, a lyrical Senegalese language, as salt flies past her.  Dressed in a red boubou, a long traditional robe, Diouf cuts a striking figure in an otherwise muted landscape encrusted in white. As the sun sets, casting an orange hue over the salt flats of Fatick, in southwestern Senegal, Diouf stands, hand on hip, surveying a group of sinewy young men chipping away at a hardened, crystallized mound. \"When I saw other men who had their own land I thought, 'why not me?'\" Diouf said, gesturing across the expansive plains, dotted with ancient baobab trees. In the distance, tucked away in fields of dry maize, is her village Ndiemou, which means \"Salt\" in the local Serer language. When Senegal privatized land in the area in 2000, Diouf became the first woman to invest. It was a bold move in the west African country, where women have limited access to property despite providing the vast majority of agricultural labor. During the high harvesting season, from February to April, the salt flats are scattered with hundreds of women toiling away in over 40 degrees Celsius (100 degree Fahrenheit), scooping the crystalline mineral into baskets later carried aloft on their heads. But they're not necessarily the ones to benefit financially from the production. It's an inequity that didn't sit well with Diouf.  \"When I first started, men were telling me that I wasn't going to last in this business, but I would say to them that every job a man can do, a woman can too.\" Today, she employs dozens of women and men -- including her husband -- in her own micro-business, producing about four to five tons of salt daily in peak season by extracting water from a nearby river to evaporate on land.  \"At home my husband is the boss, but here, in the salt flats, it's me,\" Diouf said, breaking into an infectious laugh.  The same year Diouf leased her plot of land, a presidential decree mandated that all salt harvested in Senegal be iodized. It's a public health strategy widely considered to be the most effective way to prevent iodine deficiency, which can cause goiter (swollen thyroid glands in the neck), stunted growth and mental impairment -- health issues that had long plagued parts of Senegal. And it's cheap to do -- each ton of salt needs about 6 ounces of potassium iodate, which costs only $4.25. In most developed countries around the world, table salt has been fortified for nearly a century, which is why the concept of iodine deficiency is almost unheard of in places like the United States.  But not here. Despite being the largest salt producer in West Africa (Senegal mines nearly 500,000 tons annually), iodine deficiency is still a stubborn problem across the country. Experts say that's down to quality control. Most Senegalese people get their salt from small scale artisanal harvesters, like Diouf, who make up about one-third of the country's overall production. But many fail to iodize their salt effectively. Those quality issues are why the Iodine Global Network, Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition and others are pushing for Senegal to pivot from supporting small scale producers to deploying iodized salt industrially instead: in processed foods, condiments and seasonings, such as stock cubes.   Only 37% of Senegalese households have access to adequately iodized salt, according to a 2015 nationwide survey, and the situation is worse in rural areas. For comparison, approximately 70% of all households globally had access in 2013. And the need for iodine, which is critical to brain development, increases during pregnancy and infancy. In 2015, 30% of pregnant women in Senegal were iodine deficient, according to the same survey. Without the essential nutrient, they risk losing babies in miscarriages, or giving birth to children with permanent neurological damage. Even a slight deficiency can lower a child's I.Q. by 10 to 15 points. Other than iodized salt, sources of iodine include seafood, as well as some dairy products and grains (depending on the soil where it's grown). But in rural regions of Senegal, those foods aren't always part of an average diet -- especially for those struggling with poverty and food security.  So Diouf, supported by Canadian-based non-governmental organization Nutrition International, has taken on the mantle of local businesswoman and evangelist, going door-to-door to raise awareness about the importance of iodine. As a result, Marie's village, where she is known as \"the queen of salt,\" seems to buck nationwide data that shows access to adequately iodized salt is lowest in harvesting areas.  Only 11% of populations living in salt harvesting regions have access to iodized salt, compared to 53% in urban areas, according to the 2015 government study. Adama Nguirane, the regional representative for the government's universal salt iodization project, says this disparity is down to a few factors, but chief among them is a lack of means. It's difficult to convince people to buy iodized salt when they can get it in their backyards for free.  That's why it is critical to get women like Diouf involved in the supply chain, Nguirane says, because they're the ones cooking meals for their families and taking care of the children. \"I believe in the development of my country and it's essential that we fix this problem for our children and our future,\" Nguirane said. \"Marie is the model, and we rely on her to show us the way.\" Menno Mulder-Sibanda, a senior nutrition specialist with the World Bank, which has a long-standing partnership with the Senegalese government, says that reducing iodine deficiency is an \"essential\" part of investing in the economic growth of a nation, and, given the limited agricultural promise of Senegal, the key driver of its future will be in new service-oriented businesses and technology. \"There is a moral question, of not acting on something that is so, in a way, manageable,\" Mulder-Sibanda said. \"Obviously salt iodization in a country like Senegal is tremendously difficult to implement as a public response. But it baffles me that we haven't moved on this issue.\" Pape Coumb Ndoffene Faye, the headteacher at the village's elementary school, says he has noticed a big difference in his students' achievement as a result of Diouf's work. \"Since the project began, I know children have been getting iodized salt at home and in the canteen here, and mental capacity has improved,\" Faye says, adding that the school now ranks fourth out of 31 for test results in the region. Faye, who has been working as headteacher since 2004, adds: \"If we look at it as a curve, it's been going up since I started.\"  Diouf has high hopes for her 13-year-old daughter Fatou, a graduate of Ndiemou elementary. She now walks about 2.5 miles to her middle school each morning. Diouf wants to see her become a powerful CEO, a diplomat, or even the first female president, one day. Her aspirations may be high, but they feel attainable. President of Senegal Macky Sall was born in the city of Fatick, just 5 miles from Ndiemou, where he served as Mayor from 2009 to 2012. Local people here have a lot of pride in his success, but the region has changed little since his time in office -- it's still among the poorest in Senegal. Elsewhere in the country, however, Sall's vision for the future looks bright.  On the road to Fatick from Dakar, Senegal's investment in technology and services is embodied in the promise of a glittering, futuristic city: Diamniadio. It's the crown jewel in Sall's Emerging Senegal plan, which aims to alleviate poverty and get Senegal on the road to development by 2035. Critics have called the $2 billion urban center a vanity project for Sall, who is running for reelection in February. In any case, it's clear that if basic levels of nutrition aren't delivered in places like Fatick, parts of the population will be left behind on Senegal's road to economic fulfillment. Still, Diouf is hopeful. \"Macky Sall won't be here forever, we want our children to be prepared to replace him.\" Meissa Seck contributed to this report from Fatick.  ","267":"New York (CNN Business)Wall Street seems to believe the long-awaited General Electric comeback has finally arrived. But GE's problems are far from over. After a horrific performance the past two years, GE (GE) shares have spiked 20% in 2019.  GE is still trading in single-digits and it's worth just a fraction of its all-time high. But the rally is built on hopes that the worst is over, and it places GE among the top 10% of all S&P 500 stocks this year. If GE were still in the Dow (it was kicked out last summer), it'd be neck-and-neck with Boeing (BA) for the top spot. New GE CEO Larry Culp deserves credit for taking difficult steps to fix the maker of light bulbs, jet engines and MRI machines. Under Culp, GE slashed its dividend to a penny, sped up its divorce with oil-and-gas giant Baker Hughes (BHGE) and unloaded more assets. But GE's earnings report, which is due out before the market opens Thursday, is likely to provide more evidence of how challenging it will be for Culp to pull off a speedy turnaround in a slowing economy. More difficult decisions loom as GE races to fix its debt-saddled balance sheet. \"Larry Culp's mission is to save GE, regardless of the short-term pain,\" John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, told clients in a note this week. Inch, who has long been warning of trouble at GE, has a $7 price target on the stock. GE was trading above $9 on Wednesday.  'Show about nothing' While analysts remain bullish on GE's booming aviation business, they are still worried that land mines lurk at the slumping power division and the remnants of GE Capital. That's not to mention the lingering investigations into GE's accounting by the SEC and the Justice Department. JPMorgan Chase analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr. a longtime GE bear helped spark the rally when he upgraded the stock to \"neutral\" last month.  But Tusa, who still has a $6 price target on GE, thinks the euphoria is overdone. In a research report published last week, Tusa likened the GE comeback to a \"Seinfeld\" episode, calling it a \"show about nothing.\" Hopes for a GE recovery, Tusa said, have been backed by \"almost no hard data or tangible new news.\" GE Capital remains a cash drain Wall Street got very excited by reports that GE could unload its valuable aircraft leasing division. Sources told Bloomberg News that the business, viewed as a crown jewel of GE Capital, could fetch as much as $40 billion. But Tusa believes a deal would come \"well below\" $40 billion and would \"wipe out\" all of GE Capital's equity, which JPMorgan estimates is \"already zero\" because of a huge cash drain created by insurance problems. In a report last week, Fitch Ratings noted that GE's aircraft leasing division is built on less debt than GE Capital's remaining businesses.  \"GE Capital's overall leverage ... increases the risk it could be left with excess debt as it reduces assets further,\" wrote Eric Ause, Fitch's senior director of US corporates.  Besides GE Capital's troubled insurance business, the finance arm has been hobbled by WMC Mortgage, a subprime mortgage unit it shuttered a decade ago.  Last year, GE set aside $1.5 billion to cover a potential Justice Department settlement involving WMC Mortgage. GE has warned it could place WMC into bankruptcy. Hopes for power to turn the corner Wall Street hopes for signs of progress at GE Power, the maker of turbines for natural gas and coal power plants. The division has been slammed by the rise of renewable energy. And its headaches were exacerbated by turbine failures last year. Responding to concerns about its fossil fuels exposure, GE announced plans Wednesday to move its grid solutions and hybrid renewables units into GE Renewables.  \"This strategic realignment positions GE to lead in the fast-growing renewable energy market,\" Culp said in a statement. Investors are also anxious to hear more about the timing and structure of GE's plan to spin off its health care business, which makes MRI machines and other medical products. Culp has promised to bring greater transparency to GE, which has for years been criticized for complexity that masked decay at the company. Inch said it would be a \"welcome relief\" if GE gives more credible guidance after years of \"perpetual exaggerations, opaque disclosure and aggressive accounting.\"","268":"Hong Kong (CNN Business)China's beaten down stock market could be headed for a rebound.  The benchmark Shanghai Composite was the world's worst performing major stock market last year, tumbling more than 25%. It was weighed down by fears about China's slowing economy and the trade war with the United States. But 2019 could be much better. Analysts at HSBC (HBCYF) forecast Chinese stocks could rise a further 18% this year after already gaining 5% in January. A resurgent stock market could help improve the gloomy mood among Chinese consumers, whose reluctance to spend has hurt top global brands like Apple (AAPL). Much depends on the United States: A deal to ease trade tensions would boost Chinese share prices, and so could a lull in rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Chinese stocks would hold strong appeal \"in a world where they agree a trade deal,\" said Christopher Wood, an equity strategist at Hong Kong-based broker CLSA. He predicts the two governments will reach some kind of agreement by early March to prevent a return to their bruising trade war. \"If China is smart, they will do a deal with Donald Trump,\" Wood said, describing him as \"the most friendly president Beijing is going to deal with, given anti-China sentiment is growing in Washington.\"  The potential removal of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese exports as part of a deal would be especially positive for the Shanghai market, he said. Fed takes the pressure off The US Federal Reserve's signals this week that it will throttle back its plans to raise rates this year could be good news for China.  Rising US interest rates in 2018 pulled more money into American assets, pushing up the value of the dollar and making investments in the Chinese yuan less attractive. But after the Fed comments this week, the yuan hit a six-month high against the dollar. \"When the dollar is weak, emerging markets and China tend to do well,\" said Mark Tinker, head of Asian equities at investment firm AXA Framlington.  A more dovish Fed also gives greater Beijing breathing room to juice the Chinese economy with looser monetary policy, which tends to drive money into stocks. 'Crisis-level valuations'  Fund managers say another reason to buy Chinese shares is they look so darned cheap.  Last year's sell-off has left stocks listed on the Shanghai Composite trading at a discount of about 40% compared with those on the S&P 500, according to Refinitiv data. Chinese stocks \"are at crisis-level valuations for an economy that is still growing faster than most places around the world,\" said Eric Moffett, a portfolio manager at investment firm T Rowe Price.  Investors should focus on stocks in sectors that have been hit hardest by trade tensions and China's economic downturn, such as autos and big exporters, according to Moffett.  \"The bad news has largely been priced in,\" he said. 'A very bad earnings season' A rebound in Chinese stocks is far from guaranteed, though.  China's economic situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. A lot of economists forecast that growth will reach its weakest level in the second quarter. The latest signs are not encouraging. A closely watched indicator measuring the health of China's huge manufacturing sector sank to its lowest level in nearly three years last month. Chinese companies are feeling the pain. State media reported this week that more than 300 listed firms are warning of losses of $15 million or more for 2018.  Chinese stocks \"are hampered by a very bad earnings season,\" said Hao Hong, head of research at Hong Kong broker BOCOM International.  That leaves investors anxiously waiting to see how the trade talks with the United States pan out. \"If you don't believe there's going to be a trade deal, you should probably sell equities today,\" Wood said. ","269":" (CNN)Howard Schultz on Tuesday wouldn't commit to selling off his Starbucks shares if he were elected president in 2020. When asked by CNN's Poppy Harlow if Schultz would sell all of his shares in Starbucks if he won the presidency, the billionaire former CEO of the coffee company said, \"Well I think we're getting way premature. This is my third week since 60 Minutes,\" referring to the TV program on which he announced he was seriously thinking of running for President on in January.  After being pressed by Harlow, Schultz said, \"I will do nothing whatsoever to have any conflict of interest between my investments overall or my interest in the company that I love because I will put the role and responsibility and the accountability for results first if I run for president and I am fortunate enough to win. And that is a promise I make to the American people.\"  By avoiding giving a direct answer to the question, Schultz could invite a comparison between the former CEO and President Donald Trump, a man from whom Schultz has spent much of his time in the political spotlight differentiating himself. Presidents have typically divested themselves from their financial holdings upon taking office and put their assets into a blind trust, but Trump -- entering office directly from running the Trump Organization -- did not follow that tradition. Before Trump took office, his lawyers promised the President was \"completely isolating himself\" from his business.  But while Trump technically handed over control of his interests to his sons through a trust, he can take cash payments from the business at any time.  The President also notably has not released his tax returns, something Schultz has promised to do if he decides to run. Schultz insisted he wasn't trying to avoid the question. \"I think there's multiple ways to do this. No, no, I'm not evading the question. There's multiple ways to do this, set up a blind trust, do lots of things to remove any conflict of interest,\" he said. This story has been updated. ","270":"Washington (CNN)Trade talks between US and Chinese teams will resume next week after a pause in negotiations, according to an administration official. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will travel to Beijing for discussions meant to finalize an agreement between the two countries. It's expected a Chinese delegation, led by Vice Premier Liu He, would then come to Washington for further talks. Negotiations had been on hold as the two sides broached disagreements over enforcement mechanisms in a final deal, as well as intellectual property and technology disputes. Now, according to the official, the two sides hope to reach an agreement to be signed at a late-April summit at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Trump previously hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2017. Trump voiced optimism at the China trade progress as he concluded a joint news conference in the Rose Garden on Tuesday. \"China's going very well. China talks going very well,\" he said, declining to expand further. The US and China have been engaged in intensive negotiations as the two sides try to strike an agreement that would lift punishing tariffs in exchange for some changes to China's trade practices and agreements to purchase US goods. The talks had originally carried a March 1 deadline, but Trump announced he would extend the window because talks were proceeding well. Since the start of the month, the discussions have proceeded at lower levels as the two sides firm up their final negotiating positions. Trump is eager for a deal that could boost the stock market and improve his re-election chances. He's delayed applying new tariffs on China as the talks advance, but has insisted he has no problem using them to advance his trade agenda.","271":"New York (CNN Business)Microsoft's revenue jumped 12% during its most recent quarter, but was slightly below analysts' expectations.  Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday that its sales for the quarter ending in December hit $32.47 billion. That revenue growth was fueled in part by the company's commercial cloud business, which surged 48% from the prior year to $9 billion. The company's stock fell more than 3% in after-hours trading following the quarterly report.  In recent years, Microsoft has focused on the cloud over its legacy business, Windows. The shift has put Microsoft near the front of the fast-growing cloud technology segment after years of attempting to compete in the smartphone market and online services like search. Microsoft's cloud service Azure competes with Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the two companies are in a \"heated battle.\" \"More enterprises and governments worldwide are spending billions in an accelerated shift to a cloud based environment,\" Ives wrote in an investor note ahead of Microsoft's earnings report, adding that the firm's research indicates Microsoft is gaining market share against AWS. \"We believe Azure and AWS remain miles ahead of the nearest competitor, although we expect competition to meaningfully heat up as more tech giants chase this,\" Ives said.  Earlier this month, Microsoft announced a deal to become Walgreens' new cloud provider, in an effort to take on Amazon. The two companies said the move will help Walgreens obtain personalized data about its customers' health, which will allow pharmacists to give better, customized nutrition and wellness solutions. \"Our strong commercial cloud results reflect our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies in every industry including retail, financial services, and healthcare,\" Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, said in a statement released with Wednesday's earnings report.  Microsoft regained its title as the most valuable company in the world during the final quarter of 2018, in part by avoiding the recent regulatory and hardware sales troubles of its industry peers. ","272":"New York (CNN Business)For years, Lyft founders Logan Green and John Zimmer set the company apart from a crowded pack of rivals in part by building a warm and friendly brand. Cars were marked with furry pink mustaches. Passengers could sit in the front seat and fist bump their drivers. But now the \"nice guys\" of the ride-hailing industry, as they've often been called, are about to cement their grip over their company when it debuts on Wall Street thanks to a controversial tactic similar to one used by other Silicon Valley giants.  Lyft filed paperwork for its long-awaited public offering on Friday. In the filing, Lyft revealed plans to create two classes of stock, one of which \u2014 the Class B shares \u2014 will come with 20 votes per share and be awarded to the founders.  The result is that Green and Zimmer will collectively have outsized voting power over Lyft's future decisions, despite owning only a small percentage of the company's total stock.  The move echoes the approach of tech companies like Facebook, Google and Snap, each of which created a dual-class structure to give their founders majority voting control. This tactic ensured founders could pursue their strategic visions with minimal pushback. It also all but guaranteed that public market investors would have little say over how these companies are run. In the filing Friday, Lyft stopped short of saying the founders will have majority control. A source familiar with the matter told CNN Business the founders will have \"close\" to a majority. Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware, said the effect on potential Lyft shareholders is essentially the same.  \"Investors can do almost nothing,\" he said. \"Instead of nothing, let's say almost nothing.\" The expectation, according to Elson, is that it won't take much for Lyft's founders to pick up whatever percentage of votes they lack from allies and thereby pursue their desired strategy unfettered. Supporters of this approach defend it as enabling founders to stay innovative and focused on the long-term. In a letter included with the IPO paperwork, Lyft's founders stressed this kind of thinking.  \"We prioritize the long-term health of the business, over day-to-day reactions of the markets,\" Green and Zimmer wrote. \"Lyft has the opportunity to deliver one of the most significant shifts to society since the advent of the car. We do not take that lightly.\" But critics have likened the dual-class structure tactic to a \"dictatorship,\" where shareholders are effectively silenced and founders can operate without accountability. In its filing to go public, Lyft warns potential shareholders that this structure \"has the effect of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders.\" As result, this \"will limit your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\" \"It's arrogant to assume that your judgment is so much better than those who invested in you that you'd rather not hear from them,\" Elson said. \"And that's the tech industry. It has an arrogance bred from success. They don't realize everyone makes mistakes.\" Those mistakes have been more apparent in recent years. Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg came under pressure to loosen his iron grip over the company after a year of scandals and stock market turbulence.  At Snap, co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel pushed for a controversial redesign of the Snapchat messaging app less than a year after the company went public. Snap's stock plummeted for much of 2018 and remains below its IPO price. \"Investors do not like companies with limited voting shares. They have especially been bruised by Snap and Facebook,\" said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. \"We do not think it will derail the Lyft IPO, but it will make investors more cautious and may factor into [the] valuation.\"","273":"New York (CNN Business)Stock buybacks have come under fire lately, with politicians on both sides of the aisle arguing that the only people who benefit when big companies repurchase their own shares are already wealthy CEOs and other executives. But David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorgan Funds, thinks that elected officials are making a mistake when they demonize stock buybacks. Kelly said in his most recent weekly report for investors that companies already have \"an incentive to hoard cash\" and this would only increase if buybacks were discouraged.  The argument for buybacks is that they reduce the number of total shares outstanding, which increases earnings per share for all shareholders -- not just executives and other wealthy investors. Kelly concedes that a big problem facing Corporate America \"is that companies often don't know what to do with their excess cash.\" But he maintains it should be up to those companies, and not Washington, to decide what they should do with this money.  \"It is far more efficient to let companies distribute the cash rather than encourage them to invest in areas that seem less profitable,\" he wrote, adding that \"it is unnerving to see politicians from the left and right once again attack corporate greed as the source of all the nation's problems.\"   Kelly will be talking about all this with CNN anchor Julia Chatterley on the \"Markets Now\" live show Wednesday at 12:45 pm ET. Chatterley will also be joined by Guggenheim Securities retail analyst Robert Drbul to talk about Walmart's (WMT) latest earnings and its digital competition with Amazon (AMZN) as well as preview results from Target (TGT), Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS). \"Markets Now\" streams live from the New York Stock Exchange every Wednesday at 12:45 p.m. ET.

","274":"Hong Kong (CNN Business)Levi Strauss shares are in demand as the blue jeans maker returns to the stock market after a 34-year absence. The clothing retailer priced its initial public offering on Wednesday at $17 per share, valuing the company at about $6.6 billion. That's higher than the price range of $14 to $16 that the company had previously set.  The offering will raise $623 million for the San Francisco-based inventor of blue jeans. It's just one in a series of high-profile IPOs expected to hit US markets this year. The company's stock will start trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"LEVI.\" The exchange said that traders will get in the spirit by wearing Levi's denim from head-to-toe,\" breaking with a longstanding \"no jeans allowed\" policy. Levi's was first taken public in 1971 before being privatized in 1985. The money it's raising in its return to the public markets is part of the 166-year-old company's plans to expand. Unlike many other retailers today, Levi's isn't seeking to completely reinvent itself.  It says its core business in men's trousers \"has been and will continue to be a key driver\" of overall profits. And it's doubling down on its iconic 501 jeans, which have stayed in style with customers for years and continue to be updated over time. But Levi's is also hoping to shift away from being seen as just a jeans company. \"We are focusing our product design and marketing efforts to reshape our global consumer perceptions from a US men's bottoms-oriented company to a global lifestyle leader for both men and women,\" it said in a February regulatory filing. To do that, the apparel brand wants to push deeper into different categories, such as tops and women's wear. The company is also looking to expand in key markets such as China, India and Brazil. China, for instance, makes up about 20% of the global apparel market but only represented 3% of Levi's revenue in the last fiscal year, the company said. To chase Chinese shoppers, the brand has installed a new management team in the country that plans to open new outlets and carry out a strategy tailored to the local market. Levi's listing is expected to gauge the appetite of US investors as they gear up for a series of big IPOs that are in the pipeline. Ride-hailing firm Lyft will make its long-anticipated debut on the Nasdaq next week, while investors are watching closely for announcements from other top startups like Uber and Pinterest. If Levi's and Lyft's offerings go well, some experts say it could encourage others to follow suit. \"It's going to be a big year for IPOs,\" Jackie Kelley, EY's Americas IPO leader, told CNN Business last month.","275":"New York (CNN Business)Investors are doing a lot of waiting lately. Stocks are up, largely because of Monday's big gains. Only the Dow struggled, held back by Boeing (BA)'s more than 10% slide. the plane manufacturer's stock dropped in the wake of last Sunday's tragic crash involving an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 jet.  But it's been mostly quiet on Wall Street otherwise.  Stocks have been flattish the past few days, and volume has been extremely light. In fact, volume hasn't been this low since the half day of trading last Black Friday, according to Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist with JonesTrading. Why are investors sitting tight? To start, it seems that they want to see an actual trade deal between the United States and China. There have been plenty of headlines about how there is progress toward finalizing an agreement. But investors may be growing tired of reports, and now crave concrete details. \"Investors are in a holding pattern,\" said Suzanne Hutchins, global investment manager for Newton Investment Management. \"They are waiting for a trade deal.\" Holding out Tom Plumb, portfolio manager with the Plumb Funds, added that the unpredictability of the Trump administration makes it harder to handicap what a trade deal \u2014 if one is signed \u2014 would actually look like. \"If you are a betting person, you don't know what's going to happen. Nobody is assured that things are going to go one way or another,\" Plumb said. There may also be some unease about upcoming earnings reports. First quarter profits for S&P 500 companies that have significant exposure to sluggish overseas markets like China and Europe are expected to fall more than 10% from a year ago. Nike (NKE), which generates about 60% of its sales outside of North America, will report its earnings next week. Profits are expected to drop from the same period last year. \"People are rightfully concerned about weakness in the Chinese economy and Europe's economy,\" Plumb said. That might not already be priced in, though.  Too much optimism? Yes, stocks plummeted last November and December on worries about slowing global growth, as well as the possibility that the Federal Reserve may raise rates too aggressively this year. The Fed fears have mostly vanished now that Fed chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stressed the need to be \"patient\" given the various economic \"crosscurrents\" worldwide.   But stocks have roared back to life in 2019. The Dow is up more than 10%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained nearly 16%.  As a result, Hutchins thinks that investors may now be overly optimistic and that the Fed, the European Central Bank and other global central banks will have to come to the rescue again as they have repeatedly done in the past. \"The global economy is slowing, as is the US. We may need a huge amount of stimulus to turn things around,\" Hutchins said. \"The risk is that the economic data will be worse.\"","276":"Hong Kong (CNN Business)China's recent stock market turmoil has dealt a heavy blow to the ranks of its super-rich. The number of billionaires in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, plunged by 161 in the past year, according to wealth research firm Hurun Report. Chinese fortunes were squeezed last year by a plunge of more than 25% in the country's stock markets and a slump in the country's currency, Hurun said Tuesday as it published its Global Rich List. Chinese financial markets were rocked in 2018 by fears over the country's slowing economy and its damaging trade war with the United States. Analysts expect economic growth to bottom out later this year. The number of Chinese billionaires fell from 819 to 658 in the year ended January 31, according to Hurun. Despite the big drop, the country is still home to more billionaires than the United States, which has 584, an increase of 13, according to Hurun. Among the biggest losers in China were Ma Huateng, the CEO of internet giant Tencent (TCEHY), whose fortune slumped 19% to $38 billion. Shares in Tencent were hit hard by a freeze in Chinese approvals for many of its money-making games.  Dalian Wanda Group's Wang Jianlin, once China's richest man, suffered a 37% plunge in net worth to $17 billion. Wang, who once boasted about his sprawling global business empire, has been more focused in recent years on selling off assets from his real estate and entertainment conglomerate. Jack Ma and others get richer Some Chinese billionaires thrived amid the turmoil, though.  Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA), enjoyed a rise of more than 20% in his wealth to $39 billion, making him China's richest man. Ma's fortune rose last year thanks to a sharp increase in the value of Alibaba's online payments affiliate, Ant Financial.  He is still a long way behind the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos. Hurun pegs the Amazon (AMZN) chief's net worth at $147 billion.  A series of big Chinese IPOs also catapulted new names into the ranks of the super-rich.  Zhang Yong is now the richest restaurant owner in the world after his Chinese hot pot chain, Haidilao, went public in Hong Kong last year. Zhang is worth an estimated $8.8 billion.   Another new entrant is Zhang Yiming, the founder of internet startup ByteDance. The company, which is behind a bunch of popular social media apps like TikTok, is now reportedly valued at about $75 billion. \"Despite the slowdown in the Chinese economy, there is significant innovation going on, shown by China having more new faces than any other country in the world,\" said Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun Report's chairman.  The Hurun index measures individual wealth as of January 31. That leaves out that the impact of February's rebound in Chinese stocks, which has been driven by hopes of more stimulus measures from the Chinese government and optimism about a potential deal to end the trade war. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index is up nearly 14% since the start of February."}}
