family-run business is calling for help to get rid of 30 tonnes of buttons.A Brown & Co Buttons, based in Croydon, south London, was forced to shut down because of a slump in sales.Owner Stuart Brown feared \"hundreds of thousands\" of unsold buttons in the warehouse would have to be thrown away.But he has been able to sell off or give away most of the stock since an appeal on Twitter garnered interest from button-lovers across the globe.Mr Brown's great-uncle set up the company more than 100 years ago.But he said in recent years large clients such as M&S and Next stopped manufacturing clothes in the UK, meaning sales have dwindled.His wife Esther Brown said it has been a \"tough decision\" for them to close down.\"It has not been economically viable for a long time,\" she added.\"We thought, we want to sell as much of it as possible but if we have to we will just skip it if not.\"Mr Brown said he would have fetched up to \u00a31.5m if he had been able to sell all of the buttons he had stored in the warehouse at full price.However, when their appeal for help to rehome the buttons was posted on Twitter it was retweeted more than 4,000 times.Several people who saw the Twitter appeal asked for buttons to be shipped to other countries including the US and China.You don\u2019t understand. I love buttons. Is there any way someone in the US can get some?End of Twitter post  by @WriterJenLavoieWonder how much would it cost to send a kilo or two to Finland.

That's an epic art project waiting to happen.End of Twitter post  by @packetwrenchI think 30 tonnes would be a lifetime supply of sorting. No idea how they are currently stored, but I'm imagining 30 of those bulk builders' bags of mixed up buttons. Oh!

Not 30 tonnes obviously but apparently they're selling off a kilo for \u00a32 (see another tweet in this thread)End of Twitter post  by @heliotropiaOn Saturday, Mrs Brown's sister Sarah Janalli whose email address was included in the appeal, tweeted to say that the responses had been \"overwhelming\".\"No buttons will go to landfill,\" she added.Hi Tess, I'm Sarah of A Brown & Co Buttons - my brother in law's company. Thank you so much - the response has been overwhelming and we can't cope with any more enquiries but SUCCESS! No buttons will go to landfill. I'm so sorry we couldn't respond to everyone but thank you! xxEnd of Twitter post  by @JanalliS","1":"New trains will begin operating on the East Coast Main Line five months later than planned.Rail operator LNER said the Azuma trains would start operating between London and Hull and Leeds in May.Plans to introduce the trains in December were abandoned after the electric-diesel locomotives were found to interfere with trackside signalling equipment.Work is continuing to fix the problems on the line north of York.Test runs found the trains caused electromagnetic interference to older signals and points when running on electric power. This meant they could only run on diesel travel much slower than their promised top service speed of 125mph (200 kph)LNER said there were \"still some compatibility problems north of York\" and the company hoped to introduce services to the capital from York over summer and from \"further up the line at later date\".The delay last year attracted criticism, with former Labour transport minister Lord Adonis accusing the government of wasting public money.He said he ordered the new trains 10 years ago.\"They had 10 years to get these signalling issues right,\" he said.\"They'll be much more expensive to operate, they'll be slower, they'll have less capacity and hundreds of millions of pounds of public money has been wasted again.\"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling described the delay as \"teething problems\".\"The North needs and deserves better railways. It's getting new trains, it's getting investment, it doesn't happen overnight,\" he said. The new trains, modelled on the Japanese bullet train, are being assembled at Hitachi's plant in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. They will cut journey times by accelerating faster than existing rolling stock.Publically-owned LNER hopes to have 65 of the trains in service by 2020.","2":"Brussels has knocked down a proposed French-German rail merger, designed to help Europe compete with China.The EU's competition commission blocked the tie-up, saying uniting France's Alstom with the rail arm of Germany's Siemens would lead to higher prices.The firms had said the merger would create an industrial champion on a par with other global players.France's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire said the decision would \"serve the interests of China\".\"The Commission prohibited the merger because the companies were not willing to address our serious competition concerns,\" Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner said in a statement.\"Without sufficient remedies, this merger would have resulted in higher prices for the signalling systems that keep passengers safe and for the next generations of very high-speed trains,\" she added.Siemens makes ICE trains for Deutsche Bahn and builds units for Channel Tunnel operator Eurostar. Alstom manufactures France's TGV bullet train amongst other rolling stock and signalling systems. The tie-up would have created an entity with revenues of approximately \u20ac15bn (\u00a313bn) with significant operations across Europe's rail network. But China's state owned railway behemoth CRRC, the largest global player, has been competing more aggressively for overseas contracts in recent years.In December Alstom and Siemens submitted proposals to address the Commission's competition concerns. These included selling signalling and rolling stock products. But the measures failed to satisfy the competition authority.But those supporting the deal, including government ministers in both France and Germany said the Commission should look beyond Europe in sectors such as transport and banking.German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin and Paris were working on a proposal to change European competition rules.Siemens' chief executive Joe Kaeser said: \"Europe urgently needs structural reform... protecting customer interests locally must not mean that Europe cannot be on a level playing field with leading nations like China, the United States and others.\"","3":"Chinese exports saw the steepest fall in three years in February, adding to worries about growth in the world's second largest economy. Official data show exports from China plunged 20.7% from a year earlier, as its trade war with the US took a toll. Imports fell 5.2% and the figures sent Asia stock markets sharply lower. Economists caution the data for the first two months of the year can be affected by the Lunar New Year holiday. The fall in exports was far bigger than the 4.8% drop forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Imports also saw a sharper than expected fall of 5.2% year-on-year, the data showed. Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics said even accounting for seasonal distortions, the figures were \"downbeat\". \"Tariffs are weighing on shipments to the US,\" he wrote in a research note. The US and China have placed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods since July, casting a shadow over the global economy.Even though officials have sounded more positive about negotiations with the US recently, failure to achieve a deal would see tariffs on $200bn (\u00a3152bn) of Chinese goods rise almost immediately and could see the US impose fresh tariffs.Still, Mr Evans-Pritchard said \"broader weakness in global demand means that, even if Trump and Xi finalise a trade deal soon, the outlook for exports remains gloomy.\" The data comes as Beijing this week unveiled $298bn worth of tax cuts to boost slowing growth.","4":"Just like the Lego film, everything appears to be \"awesome\" at the plastic brick maker as it returned to growth again last year. Profits increased by 4% to 10.8bn Danish kroner (\u00a31.2bn) and sales were up 4% to 36.4bn Danish kroner.That was a rebound from 2017, when Lego reported its first fall in sales and profits for 13 years. It blamed too much stock in stores and warehouses.Star Wars, Harry Potter, Ninjago and Jurassic World were its best sellers.\"We set out with one aim in 2018, to stabilise the business,\" said chief executive Niels Christiansen.\"Our underlying mission - what the family [which owns the business] wants - is to get Lego out to as many kids as possible,\" he said.Its growth in market share in all major markets comes at time when toy retailers have been struggling, illustrated by the collapse of Toys R US. This reduces outlets for sales of Lego, which is the world's biggest toymaker when measured by sales.Mr Christiansen, chief executive of the Danish brick-maker for 18 months, said he would not be seeking \"supra-natural\" growth rates of the past.The company is still owned by the family of Kirk Kristiansen, who founded Lego in 1932. It takes its name from an abbreviation of the two Danish words \"leg godt\", meaning \"play well\". It had achieved double-digit growth for five years until 2017, when the company said it needed a \"reset\" and cut 1,400 jobs worldwide. Sales in 2017 had been hit because it had \"too much\" stock in warehouses and shops.Mr Christiansen said Lego was combining physical and digital play. \"Kids can jump between playing physically and digitally,\" he told the BBC.The company is expanding in China, adding 80 stores this year to the existing 60.A new flagship store was opened in Beijing earlier this month and China, with 270 million children, was an ideal place to expand, he said. \"A lot of the focus in China is education,\" Mr Christiansen said, and families willing to spend on toys like Lego which \"build skills like collaboration\".In 2018, sales in the US and Western Europe grew in low-single digits, while in China they showed double-digit growth.Mr Christiansen said there was still scope for growth in developed markets, as there were \"lots of kids who haven't played with Lego\".The company has pledged to use sustainable materials in its products and packaging by 2030 and Mr Christiansen said the company's issue was not about plastic disposal.\"No one throws their bricks in the ocean,\" he said.The bricks - it sells 75 billion annually in over 140 countries - and kits are manufactured in five countries - Mexico, China, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Denmark.Mr Christiansen said the company was \"taking some precautions\" against the impact on its UK business from Brexit, but declined to elaborate.","5":"Marks and Spencer is planning a big shift towards food at its stores, the retailer has said.It said it wanted to target the weekly family shop by having more stores that offer its full range of food.At the moment, only around 12 of its stores offer all 6,500 of its food products.The plan is to convert more space in existing stores to food, with new stores better designed and located for customers who want to do food shopping.In a letter to suppliers, M&S said it was not getting its line of food products \"in front of enough customers\" - leaving shoppers assuming that they do not have a full range.\"This must change, and it will. The full range will go online with Ocado and we are starting a store renewal programme that will get more products in front of more customers with bigger, better M&S Food Halls in new and existing sites,\" the letter said.The M&S new strategy was first reported by the Mail on Sunday.The move ties in with a recent deal with Ocado, under which Ocado will offer the full M&S product line for home delivery.When the deal was announced, critics said that M&S shoppers did not spend enough on each shop to justify an online delivery.At the moment, M&S shoppers spend an average of \u00a313 on each shop, while Ocado averages just over \u00a3100 per shop.However, M&S thinks that if shoppers can access the full range of goods they are likely to buy more.Larger shops will help to make customers aware of those products.M&S already has a chain of convenience stores branded Simply Food. But they are too small to stock the company's full line of food products.A store would need to devote around 12,000 sq ft to holding the full line of M&S food products. Simply Food stores are typically around 7,000 sq ft.Last May, the retailer announced that it would close 100 stores.Under that plan the retailer said it wanted fewer, larger clothing and homeware stores in better locations.In total there are 1,043 M&S stores. Of those 729 are Simply Food outlets, the other 314 are stores selling clothes and food.","6":"Anna Bergstrom had a dilemma. She loved the glitzy world of high fashion, but had also come to feel that it was unsustainable and bad for the planet. She's now found peace of mind by running a stylish shopping mall in Sweden, where everything is second-hand. \"Do you notice the smell?\" Anna Bergstrom says, as she surveys her mall from the mezzanine level. \"It smells nice here, doesn't it?\"It's very important to Anna that this place is enticing, because she feels it is making a statement. Everything for sale here, in 14 specialist shops covering everything from clothes to DIY tools, is recycled.She is usually turned off by the smell of second-hand stores, she explains, even though she adores vintage fashion. For most people flea-markets and charity shops carry a stigma, she thinks - a mark left by countless bad experiences. Too often they are worthy but depressing, Anna says. Her mission is to bring second-hand shopping into the mainstream.The mall itself is spacious and appealing, almost Ikea-like. An art installation - a tree and circular bench all fashioned from recycled materials - greets customers at the entrance.There is even a coffee shop and gift-wrapping service. The mall is called ReTuna. \"Tuna\" because that's the nickname for the city where it is based - Eskilstuna, an hour's train journey west of Stockholm - and \"Re\" because the goods on sale have been recycled or repurposed.It was set up by Eskilstuna's local government in 2015, in a warehouse which used to house trucks for a logistics company.The shops inside it are run as businesses rather than charities, and each pays a combined charge of rent and business rates. Anna Bergstrom's business mantra which she repeats to each shopkeeper is, \"Do it like Hugo Boss.\" She wants the mall to stand toe-to-toe with a regular, commercial, glitzy mall. There is a sports shop stuffed with skis and (slightly scuffed) sledges, a kids' shop bursting with toys (a little faded), a bookshop, a DIY store, a homeware specialist, even a pet accessory shop.As well as \"pre-loved\" items for sale, there are also many that have been upcycled. These are unwanted items that have been taken apart and turned into new objects.In a store that specialises in handmade household ornaments, Bergstrom is keen to show off a nice example of this, from one of her star tenants. Shopkeeper Maria Larsson proudly shows off her best-selling product - a container that resembles the body of a pine cone. Each segment of its skin has been cut from leather jackets - upcycling in action. However, Maria confesses to being a little worried. She is struggling to keep up with customer demand for this design because she can't get enough jackets. This makes more sense once you understand ReTuna's location.It's right next to Eskilstuna's recycling centre, which is also run by the municipality.A steady stream of cars passes through it, bringing cardboard, mattresses and other typical unwanted household items.But many of these cars go past the metal skips and then head down a ramp to a road that runs right next to the mall.Here locals drop off their unwanted household things if there is a possibility they can be resold or upcycled.In a vast area beneath the mall, a small army of workers in fluorescent jackets sifts through the donations, carrying them to designated zones.Every day the shopkeepers can come down and inspect what has arrived: kids' toys, household appliances, gardening equipment\u2026 perhaps even a leather jacket. This is what they call their \"treasure\", says Anna. Their business rent gives them privileged access to it.Shopkeepers sometimes hang around the basement to look at what is coming in to their zones. Anna calls these people \"peekers\" and gives them a telling-off, because they are meant to wait for set times to inspect their assigned stock. Many of the shopkeepers will come to informal arrangements with one another. So if the clothes shop knows that Larsson wants leather jackets for upcycling, they will pass on any that are too damaged to be re-sold. Any items that are unwanted by all the shopkeepers go to the recycling centre next door.\"You see,\" says Anna, \"this is why I sometimes joke that this is the 'high fashion trash shopping mall'.\"She thinks her passion for ethical, sustainable shopping goes back to her upbringing with her hippie parents.She was born in a commune, though her family moved out to the countryside to pursue a simple life when she was three years old.Her parents rejected consumerism in all its forms and tried to protect her from it. She wasn't allowed Barbie dolls or any toys at all at Christmas, she recalls.But as she grew up she reacted against this. \"Everyone has to be their own punk revolution,\" she says cryptically.  In fact she ended up forging a career in the temples of modern consumerism: shopping centres. She began by setting up retail shops, then ran two commercial malls in the Stockholm area.It was only when she had children - four daughters - that she began to have doubts. She took about a year's maternity leave for each child, which gave her time to reflect. Perhaps maternal instinct revived in her some of the values instilled by her parents, she thinks.As her daughters grew, so too did her doubts about the world she'd brought them into, and its throwaway culture.She watched them become seduced, as teenagers, by a modern kind of consumerism - their lives became shaped by big brands, promoted by influencers on social media, says Anna. They became governed by whatever the Kardashians were doing on reality TV or Instagram, she says in a tone of dismay - before breaking into a smile. In desperation she tried cutting her daughters' pocket money so they couldn't buy the latest clothes, but offered to pay for second-hand ones instead - with limited success.She realised she had to do something more, so the opportunity for a job at the ReTuna mall three years ago, as its first manager, came at the perfect time for her.\"I realised that I needed to become a role model for my children, doing something good for the planet,\" says Anna.She calls the mall \"my baby\", and wants it to be a place her teenage children are proud to visit. And they do visit. Though she hasn't persuaded them to tag it as a location on an Instagram post yet - she's working on that. Anna's bigger hope is that what works for her family can work for Swedish society as a whole.Swedes love the concept of living sustainably and doing things for the planet, but there is a \"gap\" when it comes to action, she says. Anna thinks her mall can bridge this gap.And there is evidence this may be happening. Sales are slowly rising year-on-year. Since opening, the mall has sold \u00a32.8m worth of products and last year it attracted 700 visitors per day.\"If you can have a trendy, fashionable way to do sustainable living,\" says Anna, \"I think mainstream customers can follow that - in high heels.\" You can follow writer Dougal Shaw on Twitter: @dougalshawbbcYou can take a look around the mall in this video.Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.","7":"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on.Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 34 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered.This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?!It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season.Who was he? Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher, here's his life story.Key plot line As Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said.The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know?Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called \"a complete and total exoneration\".But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension.Who was he? He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine.Key plot line He was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker.Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while.He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later).After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison.In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI.Read more: The man who helped Trump winWho was he? The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians.Key plot line Donald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is.The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton.This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting?What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought.Read more: Trump Jr's habit for making headlinesDonald Trump confounded his critics by winning the presidency. But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix.The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come.Who was he? The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI.Key plot line Flynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak.The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only \"simple things\").The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.At the end of Season Three, in December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to making \"false, fictitious and fraudulent statements\" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed.With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle.Read more: Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn?Who was he? Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 was the Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot line Kislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots.The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place.Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a \"top spy and recruiter of spies\".Who was he? Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years.Key plot line Sessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings.When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation.That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign.That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist.Read more: An attorney general dogged by scandalThis was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling.Who was she? A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an \"informant\" for Russia's prosecutor general.Key plot line Hers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign.While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges.That meeting would never have happened without...Who were they? Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough to send each other birthday messages. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow.Key plot line Again in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting.An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the \"crown prosecutor\" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton.Are you keeping up?Read more: The tough-talking networkerWho was he? He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot line When Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House.Read more: Who is Rod Rosenstein?Who was he? Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard.Key plot line Amid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him.In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave.Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose.Read more: The son-in-law with Trump's earWho was he? A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric.Key plot line Rob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov.Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton.Read more: The Music Man with a love for hatsWho was he? At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story.Key plot line He first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him.Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point.Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused.Read more: The FBI director who took centre stageWho was he? A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation.Key plot line In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia.After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone.His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so.Read more: Why Papadopoulos case mattersWho was he? The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands.  Key plot line Some characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as \"special counsel\" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI.There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office.There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series.After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four. The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...?Who was he? OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.Key plot line A little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US.In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume.Read more: Seven key takeaways from indictmentWho was he? The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him.Key plot line Cohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth.When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York.Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence.Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress.The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell.Who was he? A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: \"One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action.\"Key plot line Stone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back.Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public.After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia.All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a \"witch-hunt\" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were \"a steaming plate of bull\".","8":"A suicide bomber killed more than 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir last week in what was the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region for decades. Pakistan denies any role in the attack by militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad, which is based on its soil.  With Indian general elections around the corner, the government is under pressure to respond, or at least demonstrate that such actions are not without consequences. Dhruva Jaishankar weighs in with the options before India - diplomatic, economic and military.Political relations between India and Pakistan have been frozen for almost three years. In his first two years in office after coming to power in 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration, resumed talks between national security advisers, made an unscheduled visit to Lahore, and approved a much-criticised effort at collaborative counter-terrorism investigations. Pakistan responded to these efforts with firing across the Line of Control separating the two sides, insisting on meeting with Kashmiri separatists in India, and arresting and sentencing to death an alleged Indian spy.Days after Mr Modi and Mr Sharif met in Lahore to launch a peace initiative, six soldiers were killed in an attack on an Indian air force base in Pathankot. Indian officials blamed the attack on the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a militant group close to Pakistani intelligence.By July 2016, Delhi's patience dried up and its position on a number of issues hardened. Despite a new government in Pakistan under Imran Khan, a meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers at last year's UN General Assembly was cancelled. Normal diplomatic channels have, however, continued. After the attack in Pulwama on Thursday, India has renewed its diplomatic efforts to make the case against what it says is Pakistan's state support for terrorism. This builds upon many years of India condemning Pakistan in diplomatic pronouncements made with friendly countries. In India's joint statements with the US and others, they now name specific Pakistan-based terrorist groups such as  JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and D-Company, a criminal syndicate led by the Pakistan-based Indian fugitive Dawood Ibrahim.  India has also linked Pakistan to the primary security challenges of its partners: for example, Japan's concerns about North Korea. Such moves have sensitised others to India's concerns about Pakistan, facilitated intelligence cooperation on Pakistan-based terrorist groups and encouraged crackdowns on their financing in many countries. Delhi's continued efforts also increase acceptability for any economic or military costs that India might impose at a later date.The challenge facing India is that other countries, however sympathetic, will continue to see value in retaining their ties with Pakistan. Although the US has become increasingly frustrated with Pakistan \"tolerating and encouraging groups which use violence against Pakistan's neighbours\", China remains Pakistan's closest ally, as it has for decades. It has provided Pakistan with nuclear and missile technology and equipment, conventional arms and - under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor - billions of dollars of investment in strategic projects. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates too have continuing economic and security ties with Pakistan, although both have also been warming their relations with India over the past few years.The US and European Union continue to offer Pakistan preferential trading benefits, in some cases resulting in lower tariffs on imports compared to India. Some EU officials have privately blamed the United Kingdom for Brussels' accommodative approach towards Pakistan - and have suggested that they may take sterner measures after Brexit.The day after the Pulwama attack, India revoked Pakistan's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status, raised customs duties to 200% and vowed to isolate it in the international community. The absence of MFN will significantly raise customs duties on Pakistani exports to India, effectively resulting in unilateral Indian sanctions. Given that direct trade between the two countries is negligible, this move is largely symbolic. In some ways, India has been implementing punitive measures against Pakistan for years. For instance, India has not played Pakistan in a bilateral Test cricket series since late 2007, in part because such a series would result in a financial windfall for the Pakistan Cricket Board.Other, more severe, measures such as abrogating the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty have been suggested. Such a step would have significant costs, including eroding India's relations with other countries - China, Nepal, and Bangladesh - with which it has water-sharing arrangements. India will also likely continue to apply diplomatic pressure to raise the costs of economic ties with Pakistan. It is expected to advocate adding Pakistan to the black list (which includes Iran and North Korea) of the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body that combats money laundering. This would raise scrutiny on financial transactions involving Pakistan and effect its currency inflows, credit rating, stock market and banking sector. However, China will likely resist such a move - it only dropped its opposition to Pakistan's \"grey listing\" last year in exchange for India's support for Beijing's vice presidency of the task force. Other multilateral efforts may extend to leveraging India's position at various export control groups in which it recently acquired membership.The biggest challenge for India is that Pakistan possesses a nuclear deterrent - including possibly one of the fastest growing nuclear arsenals - and a potent military. For all the sabre-rattling in the Indian press and public, these are realities that the Indian leadership must keep in mind.However, both Pakistan and India have explored options below the nuclear threshold. In 1999, Pakistani forces made an incursion onto India's side of the de facto border (also know as the Line of Control) resulting in the limited Kargil conflict. On several occasions after that, India retaliated to Pakistani provocations with coordinated small-scale raids across the Line of Control. The 2016 attacks, in response to the Uri base attack, became widely known as \"surgical strikes\".Other military options would be long-term in nature. Indian efforts against cross-border infiltration from Pakistan have already benefited from new security technologies as well as intelligence partnerships with other countries. Improvement in this area - such as buying unmanned aircraft and enhancing technical intelligence cooperation - would count as a major investment in countering cross-border terrorism from Pakistan.Of course, these are only some of the many ways in which India might choose to respond. If recent history is any guide, we may witness something entirely unprecedented and unexpected.Dhruva Jaishankar is Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at Brookings India in Delhi and a Non-Resident Fellow with the Lowy Institute in Australia.","9":"The number of overseas dogs being entered at Crufts has dropped for the first time in almost a decade. Organiser the Kennel Club has suggested Brexit could be to blame. So what impact do breeders feel Brexit, particularly a no-deal exit from the EU, could have on the competition?The annual four-day event at Birmingham's NEC, now in its 128th year, attracts thousands of visitors, breeders, traders and, of course, dogs.However, for the first time in almost 10 years, the Kennel Club says overseas numbers have fallen - to 3,611 competing this year, compared with 3,623 in 2018.This is Belgian Annick Provost's 29th Crufts, and she says she treats the event as a holiday. She said she had noticed the drop in numbers.\"It has scared people off and I feel for the future of breeding dogs, it [Brexit] is not a good idea,\" Ms Provost said.\"We will be separated like years ago and for breeders it is harder between the EU and UK because of further blood tests that are needed [if no deal is reached] and costs and waiting several months.\"You will have to plan so much more, so far ahead - the fun has gone.\"Dogs have been able to travel to the show - and around the EU - without quarantine, using a passport under the Pet Travel Scheme since 2002.Under the scheme, animals are required to have a valid rabies vaccination and microchip.In the event of a no-deal scenario and the UK becoming an \"unlisted country\" further requirements would be introduced, which would include pet owners having to wait up to three months from a clear rabies blood test and getting a health certificate.But for Anton Stoop, a Dutch clumber spaniel breeder, this is a reality he expects to happen. He said this, his 14th Crufts, will be his last.Mr Stoop, who lives near Breda in the Netherlands , said he feared he would end up having to pay more for certificates and vet visits, which would add 200 to 300 euros (about \u00a3170-\u00a3260) on to any trip to the UK. \"Our biggest fear is that we are going to pay and do a lot of money and I think we are not going to do this.\"We love going to dog shows but it is costing us too much money - you are talking now about 1,000 euros for us to come for three or four days - so for us it's the end of Crufts for 2020.\"Myranda Wielhouwer, who also lives near Breda, and brings clumber spaniels to Crufts, said she would not be returning.\"I am not coming over here again, this is the last for me,\" she said.\"My dogs are getting older and they are not going to qualify again but if they are going to be qualified and I have to do blood tests and so on it's too hard... \"We are welcome in the UK but the EU could bring in many restrictions which could make it hard to come back [home after being in the UK]. \"There will be extra costs and it takes time and therefore you have to plan for it all more.\"Closer to home, giant schnauzer breeder Bob Marsh, from Wakefield, has another fear that may not be realised for some years to come. Mr Marsh, who has been coming to Crufts for the past five years with Chewbacca, who is also a therapy dog for school children, said he feared for the gene pool breeders in the UK rely on.\"To improve the stock that we have, we have to import,\" he said.\"There are two ways to do that - artificial insemination is one way but not the favoured way, as we prefer the natural way and consequently we need to go abroad because you always travel to the stud to improve things.\"So [Brexit] may well make our life as breeders more difficult and subsequently over a longer time, it could shrink the genetic diversity that we have.\"Down the lines you'll have the same genes we have now, if we don't import new, which will impact health and temperament.\"The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March regardless of whether there is a deal with the EU or not.The government has said it is pressing for the UK to become a \"listed\" third country when it leaves which will avoid \"burdensome\" changes to requirements.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs advised people to speak to their vets and read further guidance on its website.A spokesman said: \"The government is committed to achieving a deal with the EU. But in the event we do not reach an agreement, we have a duty as a responsible government to plan for every eventuality.\"To make sure your pet is able to travel from the UK to the EU after 29 March 2019 in any scenario, you should contact your vet at least four months before travelling to get the latest advice.\"","10":"Nigeria is Africa's largest economy and the continent's biggest oil producer.But it is a country where more than half the population lives in poverty, and 60% of the urban population cannot afford the cheapest house. There are also some very rich Nigerians indeed and the gap between rich and poor is all too clear to see in the country's largest cities.Ahead of Nigeria's elections on 23 February, BBC Reality Check examines whether the poor are getting poorer and if the wealth gap is getting wider. The government argues that it has combated poverty and blames past governments for mismanaging the oil industry and the economy.\"It is not that poverty has reduced considerably, no. I am saying that what has happened now is that we are dealing with the issue of poverty,\" said Vice-President Prof Yemi Osinbajo. Prof Osinbajo is the running mate for incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari.Mr Buhari's principal opponent in the election, Atiku Abubakar, says Nigeria's economy has never been in a worse state than it is now.\"The most important question in this election is: are you better off than you were four years ago, are you richer or poorer?\"The Nigerian economy has only recently shown signs of recovery after a period of recession that ended in 2017.The unemployment rate provided by the government's National Bureau of Statistics is more than 20%. Here's another key statistic - about 60% of the population lives in absolute poverty - measured by the number who can afford only the bare essentials of shelter, food and clothing. This figure is from a household poverty survey released by the government in 2012.  There is a frustrating lack of more recent data available, although a revised poverty survey is currently under way.However, experts see little sign that the situation for the poorest has improved significantly.\"With increase in population and continuing lack of jobs, it is evident that the gulf between the haves and the have nots will continue to widen in the future,\" said Bongo Adi, an economist at the Lagos Business School. There's certainly a widespread perception that inequality is getting worse.\"Nigeria has a long history of mismanagement, corruption and disregard for due process\" that has contributed to the high number of people living in poverty, says Abdulazeez Musa, Oxfam's Nigeria-based analyst. As for the gap between rich and poor, Nigerian economist Bismarck Rewane estimates that only 5% of the population controls roughly about 40% of Nigeria's wealth.Poverty-reduction policies do exist, he says, but they are not backed up by the political will or the good governance to implement them.\"Vested interest is far in excess of national interest,\" he says. Poverty rates are higher in northern states than they are in parts of the south.  Sokoto State in the far north-west of the country has the highest level of poverty at 81% while the figure for the south-western state of Lagos is 34%.  A widely used measure of inequality that rates the distribution of income in a society is known as the Gini scale - for which the higher the number, the greater the inequality.Nigeria's rate rose 15% between 2004 and 2010, the latest year for which the data is available.Poverty is \"staring us in the face\", says Omolara Adesanya, a candidate for governor of Lagos state.About half of Nigeria's population lives in cities, but the divide between the poor and the rich has created a paradox - many newly built houses in the wealthier areas of Lagos are empty, while overcrowding is a major issue in many poorer areas.The UN estimates that 69% of urban residents in the country live in slum conditions, with the housing shortfall of close to 18 million units.Building or buying a house is expensive. To construct a three-bedroom house costs $50,000 (\u00a338,500) compared with $36,000 in South Africa and $26,000 in India, according to the World Bank.The Centre for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa says a standard three-bedroom, middle-income apartment in urban locations in Nigeria currently costs $5,000 a year to rent or $100,000 to buy.Only about 40% of urban households can afford the cheapest newly-built house ($16,351). Although there is a general recognition that Nigeria is highly unequal, it is hard to quantify inequality because of the lack of up-to-date data, says economist Zuhumnan Dapel. But there is a wider point about the study of inequality, he says. Those in developing economies care less about income inequality than they do about living in poverty.\"Whether their people are living below the poverty line., the main aim is getting people out of poverty,\" he says.And this is where Nigeria faces its greatest challenge.According to the World Bank, Nigeria is now the country with the most poor people in the world, overtaking India.The Bank is is cautious over the reliability of the data, but it does suggest the immense scale of the problem the country is facing - whoever wins the forthcoming elections.Amendment: The Nigerian presidential election has been delayed until 23 February and this has been reflected in the article.

Created in 2015 by the merger of Kraft Foods and HJ Heinz, it is controlled by Berkshire Hathaway and the 3G Capital investment firm, which is known for its cost-cutting approach to its businesses.At Kraft Heinz, that strategy has delivered mixed results.The firm reported a $10.2bn loss for 2018, driven by flat sales of $26.2bn and the write-down on the brands. Kraft Heinz blamed the 2018 shortfall on higher manufacturing and logistics costs.  \"We were overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year-end.\" Kraft-Heinz chief executive Bernardo Hees said.Kraft Heinz said the write down reflected expectations of lower profits going forward. Results were also affected by the decision to cut prices in the US in an effort to boost shopper demand.Mr Hees said he was encouraged by revived appetite for brands such as Philadelphia creamed cheese. The firm also plans to increase prices this spring.But executives warned that profit growth would not return until 2020, as the firm's results are hit by a weaker first quarter, currency fluctuations and sales of parts of its businesses.Kraft Heinz, like others in the industry, is facing increased competition from less expensive, retailer brands, as well as growing consumer preference for non-processed food.\"Our industry has been and is likely to remain challenged,\" Mr Hees said.The firm's shares, which have been sliding for about two years, fell below $35 Friday.The struggles also affected shares in rival food makers including General Mills, Conagra Brands, Unilever and Nestle SA.Kraft Heinz also recorded $25m in extra costs in the fourth quarter following an internal review triggered by an inquiry by the US Securities and Exchange Commission into accounting practices within its procurement division.\"The company continues to cooperate fully with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,\" it said.\"At this time, the company does not expect the matters subject to the investigation to be material to its current period or any prior period financial statements.\"","12":"The head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service has said he is concerned the absence of elected ministers could become \"the new normal\".Civil servants have been in effect running departments since the executive collapsed two years ago.However, because they are not elected, they are unable to make major policy decisions. David Sterling told the BBC there had been a \"slow decay and stagnation\" in public services. The top civil servant at Stormont, Mr Sterling said that there had not yet been a \"cliff edge moment\", where the workings of government departments had collapsed, but noted that there had been a deterioration in areas.He made the comments during an interview for the BBC Radio Four documentary \"Who Needs Politicians Anyway?\", which examined the impact of the political deadlock on Northern Ireland.Mr Sterling pointed to particular challenges regarding healthcare, education and criminal justice.  He has previously warned that urgent reforms are being held up by the impasse. and that some social housing may have to be \"mothballed\" if ministers do not return, with a maintenance backlog in the state's housing stock, and housing provision needing to be \"reconfigured.\"Mr Sterling said: \"There are big issues which need to be addressed by ministers, and in the absence of that there is a real risk that we might actually have to mothball some of our social housing.\"The long Stormont stalemate began in January 2017, when the power-sharing partnership of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn F\u00e9in fell apart.The final row between them was over a botched green energy scheme, the Renewable Heat Incentive.When the late Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy First Minister, the rules of mandatory coalition meant DUP leader Arlene Foster was automatically put out of her job as First Minister. Several rounds of talks since have failed to restore the devolved government. There have been no substantive negotiations between the parties since February 2018.The only executive minister who was not in one of the two main parties was Claire Sugden - an independent unionist who was in charge of the Department of Justice. She highlighted the stalling of legislation on domestic violence - which she had initiated - as a particularly disappointing result of the political deadlock.Ms Sugden acknowledged that if the executive returned \"the problems that exist today are not going to go away tomorrow\". \"The system is broken and to fix that, we're talking a generation - perhaps two,\" she said.\"The problem we have now is that we don't even have anyone starting that process because there are no ministers.\"The word \"limbo\" is often mentioned by politicians, public service workers and others to describe the very unusual state of governance in Northern Ireland. The biggest problem is the lack of medium-to-long-term strategic planning. The day-to-day effect of the administrative autopilot may not be obvious to many citizens. That has led the political scientist Professor Matt Flinders to muse: \"One of the great risks of Northern Ireland is that allowing life to go on might add another layer to the argument of 'why do we need politicians?'\"The academic from Sheffield University is concerned about the widespread cynicism in relation to politics across much of the world.He has warned that the symbolic value of politicians is significant as well as their function as legislators.\"Politicians act as a lightning rod for social pressures, and frustrations, and antagonisms,\" he said. \"By doing that, they are really providing a very important safety net. It's only when that disappears that things can get very scary, very quickly.\"Melanie Kennedy, from Bangor, is more acutely aware than most of the difficulties caused by the empty Stormont benches.Five years ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer - and raised money to pay for a drug which is only available privately in Northern Ireland.She lobbied ministers, then civil servants, for the drugs funding process in Northern Ireland to be brought into line with the rest of the UK.In September 2018, the NI Department of Health announced the changes Melanie had been campaigning for. The department said the decision was \"clearly in the public interest\" - one of the tests which civil servants must apply to any decision to assess if it is lawful in the absence of the executive. Ms Kennedy runs the Northern Ireland Cancer Advocacy movement, which supports patients with the disease.She has given civil servants credit for listening to her - but wants to see devolved government restored.\"The longer this goes on, the more people are suffering,\" she said.\"If it hasn't affected you, you're very lucky - because I'm seeing it across the board.\"","13":"An Austrian mountain farmer whose cows trampled a German tourist to death has been ordered to pay the woman's family \u20ac490,000 (\u00a3425,550) in damages. Austria's Chamber of Agriculture voiced alarm, saying the hefty fine could prompt farmers to close many footpaths, rather than install expensive fencing.The farmer in Pinnistal, a Tyrolean valley, is appealing against it.Austrian fines for cow stampedes are usually about \u20ac30,000 maximum. The woman was walking a dog on a lead.Austrian media report that the cows charged apparently defensively, as they had calves with them. The dog's lead was clipped to the woman's belt.But the Innsbr\u00fcck court concluded that the woman was not to blame for the deadly stampede in July 2014. The court ruled that the farmer's warning signs about cows grazing were insufficient. There should have been fences at the place where the German tourist died, the judges said.But the Chamber of Agriculture warned the verdict, if upheld, \"will have a huge impact on tourism and farming above all in the Alpine regions\" - especially, it said, as farmers in the region had annual incomes of \u20ac20,000 or less, on average.\"Footpaths across meadows and pastures would have to be fenced off, and made inaccessible to walkers,\" the statement explained.\"An obligation to put up fences would be economically unreasonable for farmers and would, in many places, mean the end of pastoral farming.\"The statement also called it \"an extremely tragic incident\".Source: National Farmers' Union","14":"Aston Martin Lagonda notched up big losses last year, as the cost of floating on the stock exchange hit its results. Publishing its first results since it went public in October the firm reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a368m, compared with profits of \u00a385m in 2017.The luxury car firm also said it would set aside up to \u00a330m as part of its contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit. Shares in the firm fell by 18%. In a statement the company said since its third quarter trading update in November 2018, \"geopolitical and economic uncertainties have increased\".It said that plans had been put into place the would mitigate any disruptions in supply, should the UK leave the European Union without a transition deal.It had also recruited a chief purchasing and supply chain officer \"in anticipation of Brexit\". So far the company has spent a \"minimal amount\" on its Brexit preparations. The results revealed that car sales rose by more than a quarter (26%) last year to 6,441. Sales by value were up by 25% to \u00a31.1bn.The costs of the flotation came to \u00a3136m. If those were stripped out operating profits were 18% higher at \u00a3146.9m.  Andy Palmer, Aston Martin Lagonda president and group chief executive, described 2018 as an \"outstanding\" year for the company.He said the company was confident that it would grow again in 2019. \"Whilst we are mindful of the uncertain and more challenging external environment, particularly in the UK and Europe, we remain disciplined in our execution and maintain our guidance for financial year 2019, whilst also reconfirming our medium-term objectives.\"","15":"Gas heating for new houses will be banned by 2025, the Chancellor has said, although gas hobs will still be allowed.The homes will keep warm with devices such as heat pumps and with \u201cworld-leading\u201d insulation standards. It's part of a bid by Philip Hammond to address the concerns of children protesting about climate change.Green groups welcomed the measure but said the Chancellor had ducked major challenges on the climate.They wanted action to cut emissions from traffic, planes and existing draughty homes - which will form the vast majority of the housing stock for decades.Instead, Mr Hammond offered what they called an inadequate idea for tackling aviation emissions.He's consulting on a plan to oblige all airlines to offer passengers the chance to offset their emissions by schemes such as tree planting.But these schemes are controversial and Greenpeace said it would be much better for the government to introduce a tax on frequent fliers.Mel Evans from Greenpeace said: \"The Chancellor's rhetoric may have been strong on the environment, but tackling the climate emergency demands much bigger thinking. \"Issues like the shoddy state of our existing housing stock and rapid adoption of electric vehicles require serious money behind serious policies. \"A good start would be banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 (instead of 2040 at present).\"The Chancellor won praise, though, for appointing the Cambridge Economics Prof Partha Dasgupta to lead a global commission to estimate the global value of nature in economic terms.

One Post Office manager described the current demand as \"crazy\", adding that it was driven by fears over Brexit. Belfast's central Post Office ran out of the forms on Friday.Branch manager Irene Edgar said the demand was huge.\"High demand, especially in the last few weeks, means there is a stock and delivery issue,\" she said. The Post Office in the border town of Strabane in County Tyrone has no forms, despite ordering them three weeks ago.Branch manager Christine McNulty said the demand was \"completely crazy\".\"People are afraid, that's why they want their Irish passports, fear around Brexit,\" she said, when asked why the demand was so high. Each application for a standard 10-year passport costs \u20ac80 (\u00a371).The branch manager of Bangor Post Office in north County Down, said whilst they still have forms they are running low, describing the demand in recent weeks as \"absolutely massive\".\"It is Brexit, people don't know what is happening and they want to be prepared,\" she said. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs says application forms have been dispatched to Post Offices in Northern Ireland that operate the Passport Express Service. \"All Post Offices should be re-stocked by tomorrow or Thursday at the latest,\" said a spokesperson. \"There has been a general increase in passport applications in recent years which is due to a number of factors, including a growing population and an increase in travel abroad.\"The number of applications from Northern Ireland increased last year by 2%, from 82,274 to 84,855 - and is up from 53,715 in 2015.  Amanda Lamberton said her Rossdowney Park Post Office in Londonderry's Waterside had a lot of forms at the moment although they did run out last year. \"We are at the border as well so we would always have had a lot coming because of the Irish passport,\" she said.\"But there has been an increase in British passports as well, oddly enough.\"The government warned that Britons travelling to the EU after Brexit may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run.In Newtownards, County Down, the Post Office said it still had forms, although demand had increased - especially from entire families applying for Irish passports.Post Office branches in Crossmaglen in south Armagh, Armagh City and Ballycastle in north Antrim still had forms but said that there had been a high demand in recent weeks. You can claim an Irish passport (or Irish citizenship) if:Several other exemptions apply for those resident in Ireland for extended periods, adoptions, children of refugees, and other special circumstances.","17":"Controversy is never far from the Kardashian family.But it's not babies or boyfriends grabbing the headlines this time, but Kylie Jenner's new status as the world's youngest self-made billionaire.Jenner, who has earned a 10-figure fortune aged 21, gained global recognition in her family's reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.Though Jenner has made her fortune with her best-selling beauty business, Kylie Cosmetics, some have questioned whether her money can really be 'self-made', since she comes from such a privileged background.Jenner welcomed her billionaire status with a post on Instagram thanking Forbes for the recognition. thank you @forbes \ud83d\udc9cA post shared by  Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Mar 5, 2019 at 1:23pm PSTEnd of Instagram post  by kyliejennerShe's also defended the notion that she's \"self-made\", telling Paper Magazine last month that none of her money is inherited.In that interview, Jenner said \"the self-made thing is true\". She claims her parents, Kris and Caitlyn Jenner, cut her off at the age of 15 and told her to start making her own fortune.Jenner, who stars in the reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians, continued: \"What I'm trying to say is I did have a platform, but none of my money is inherited.\"Forbes has also weighed in on the issue, saying: \"To be clear, Forbes defines \"self-made\" as someone who built a company or established a fortune on her own, rather than inheriting some or all of it.\"The magazine has devised a scale ranking how truly self-made a business person is.  On Forbes' scale, media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who was born poor, scored a 10. Jenner, who has benefitted from being born into a famous, wealthy family, scored seven.Bybreen Samuels, author of the business book Non-Profit Booster - 10 Steps to Building a Successful Organisation, believes \"describing Kylie Jenner as a 'self-made billionaire' is a misnomer\" because \"at no time has she faced true entrepreneurial challenges\".Samuels adds Jenner's journey to becoming a billionaire is in stark contrast with that of Sara Blakely, who used all her $5,000 (\u00a33800) savings to launch the slimming knickers Spanx. Forbes named Blakely the youngest self-made female billionaire in 2012, at the age of 41.Samuels tells BBC News of Jenner: \"She gained leverage by using her family name, fame and wealth. Consequently, she had direct access to the whole range of privileges, connections and resources that flow from these factors. \"Her ascendancy into global wealth and brand recognition was already guaranteed before she even started.\"Predictably, given Jenner's background, opinions on social media about her 'self-made' status are split.Kylie Jenner is proof that all you really need to succeed in life is inherit a few hundred million dollars and already have preexisting international fame from your parents and siblings, and then it\u2019s possible to make something of yourself.

Set up in 2013, the San Francisco-based firm's founders include Brit Cal Henderson.Slack has expanded rapidly as a form of office communication intended to reduce the flow of email.The firm had about 85,000 paying customers as of January, up more than 50% in a year.It also counts more than 10 million daily active users and said more than half of its users are based outside of the US.Customers include companies such as Starbucks, Panasonic and SAP. The BBC also uses the service.Slack's leadership team also worked on the photo sharing website Flickr.To date, Slack has raised more than $1.2bn, including $427m in August, backed by firms that included Dragoneer Investment Group and General Atlantic. At the time, the investment valued the company at more than $7bn.Slack is one of several high-profile tech companies, including Uber and Lyft, looking to go public this year.The firm is reportedly planning to list shares directly on a stock exchange, rather than issue new stock to investors to raise money as it would in a more traditional launch process.The move allows early investors to sell their shares; it can also reduce some of the costs associated with a launch.The music-streaming service Spotify used a similar procedure last year when it listed on the New York Stock Exchange.","20":"The arrest of 129 Indian students in the US for enrolling in a fake university has sparked questions about how they ended up risking their future to study at a little-known institution. BBC Telugu's Deepthi Bathini reports. Veeresh (name changed at his request) was at home in California on 30 January when he heard the news - 130 students (the group included one Chinese national) enrolled at the University of Farmington had been arrested. The university had turned out to be a sham run by undercover agents investigating immigration fraud. He panicked, he says, because he was one of the 600 students who had enrolled at the Michigan-based university. \"I did not know what to believe. I thought it was a rumour but the whole story was out the next day.\"He left as soon as he could. He returned to India on 4 February. Apart from the students, eight alleged recruiters, all Indian citizens, were charged with \"conspiracy to commit visa fraud and harbouring aliens for profit,\" according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). The University of Farmington was set up in 2015 to catch foreign nationals who had travelled to the US on student visas but stayed on by transferring to fake universities and then obtaining work permits through them. The practice is common enough that US officials refer to such colleges as \"visa mills\" and the scam as a \"pay-to-stay\" scheme. In 2016, immigration agents set up the fake University of Northern New Jersey and arrested 21 people, mostly from China and India.  This time, the sting operation has sparked a minor diplomatic row - with Indian officials saying the students may have been duped. But the US government denies this, saying students knowingly enrolled in a fake institution for the visa benefits. The US has long been a favoured destination for Indian students - nearly half of those holding two types of student visas in 2017-18 were either from China (377,070) or India (211,703), according to the US government. While increased regulation has made it harder for students to stay on and work, an array of visas still offer opportunities. But the choice and the paperwork can be bewildering, say consultants, which makes students more vulnerable to fake colleges and recruiters. Veeresh, who moved to the US in 2014 to study for a master's degree, says a friend told him about the University of Farmington and put him in touch with a recruiter, who was among those arrested. Farmington offered online courses and what is called curricular practical training (CPT). This is an option that allows student visa holders in the US to work full-time while they study. Although several colleges offer this option, it can also be misused by students who wish to work rather than study in the US. Veeresh enrolled in October 2017 and he received his CPT the  following day. He says he did what he could to verify the college's credentials. He visited the website, which showed pictures of students in classes, libraries or elsewhere on campus; he compared the documents he was given to those belonging to his friends from other colleges. \"I called the phone numbers on the website to ask about classes. I was told they would let us know when they schedule them,\" he said. \"After six months, I asked a friend to contact the recruiter, who connected us with someone who again told us they would let us know.\"He claims not to have suspected anything and so paid the tuition and waited for more than a year for classes to begin. \"I did not have any other option,\" he says.Meanwhile, he continued working and applied for a H1B visa, a non-immigrant visa that allows companies in the US to employ skilled foreigners - mostly technology workers - for up to six years. It's allocated by a lottery system and those who hold the visa can apply for permanent residency and buy property in the country.Twenty-five-year-old Sravanti (name changed on her request), like Veeresh, enrolled in Farmington and got a CPT that enabled her to work in the US.But unlike Veeresh, she could not leave the US in time. On 30 January, she says, officials from the Department of Homeland Security came to her house n California to question her. \"I am wearing an ankle monitor and I have been advised not to leave the country without informing them,\" she told the BBC over the phone. She says she found out about Farmington from a friend who had already enrolled there. But she says that although she paid the tuition, she did not visit the college website or verify any of the information she was given. She was unable to answer why she did not suspect something was amiss when the online courses didn't start. Sravanti says she has been told she can opt for \"voluntary deportation\" but that would include a 10-year ban from entering the US. The other option is to wait for the court hearing in March - and hope that a lenient judge could reduce the length of the ban. \"I am very confused. I want to come back to India but my future looks uncertain,\" she says. \"I am at home through the day. I have nothing else to do. And I am running out of money.\" She says her parents know the truth and have been very supportive.The US state department has denied India's claim that students like Veeresh and Sravanti may have been duped.\"All participants in this scheme knew that the University of Farmington had no instructors or classes (neither online nor in-person) and were aware they were committing a crime in an attempt to fraudulently remain in the United States,\" a spokesperson told the Hindustan Times. Veeresh had taken a loan of 1.5m rupees (\u00a316,300; $21,000) to help pay for his education. The first university cost him $30,000 and Farmington cost him an additional $20,000. He had to borrow money from his friend to buy a ticket to come back home. He still hasn't told his parents why he returned. \"They think I am on vacation. But the truth is that I have no job and a college loan to pay off. My parents would be devastated if they knew the truth.\" His parents are farmers and Veeresh had hoped to help them out by earning an income in dollars, some of which he could send home.\"I am the only son. I wanted to take care of my parents. We do not own land or a house. I wanted to go to America to earn better so that I can buy a house for my family in India.\"This dream - of an American job that pays in dollars - is what motivates most students, says Bhaskar Pulinati, founder of Groovy Overseas Education Consultants.  \"More than 90% of the students are looking for a path to permanent residency. Very few of them are concerned about the reputation of the university,\" he adds. He says that is why many students prefer Canada and Australia, which offer an easier path to becoming a resident. But the US remains a top choice. \"For a student, the priority is to go to the US,\" says Sirisha Singavaram, a consultant based in the southern city of Hyderabad, where the US consulate issues more student visas than anywhere else in India. \"We do get requests from students who desperately want to go and ask if their documents can be 'edited' so they can enrol in a US college but we deny such requests.\"She adds that the problem is most students do not understand the application or visa process and end up relying too much on brokers and consultants. Veeresh, meanwhile, is looking for a job in Hyderabad. But he is still hopeful of returning to the US.\"To achieve my dream of having my own house and to be able to take care of my parents, I want to go back to the US for a few years.\"Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Northwestern Polytechnic University lost its Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics accreditation.","21":"\"Our songs are about tragedy... Human tragedy.\"Talk Talk may have been lumped together with synth-pop bands like Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet.But singer Mark Hollis, who has died after a short illness aged 64, possessed a lyrical depth and musical curiosity that set him apart.By their fourth album, Spirit of Eden, he'd abandoned pop formulas in favour of ambient textures and jazz structures - setting a blueprint for bands who want to outgrow their origins.From the outset, Hollis's tastes were eclectic. His first record was the Northern Soul classic Everlasting Love, which he bought at the age of 12, while his first concert was David Bowie. Speaking to Record Mirror in 1982, he cited his main influences as Burt Bacharach and counterculture icon William Burroughs.He also said the best live show he'd ever seen was a performance of Shostakovich's Symphony No 10 at London's Royal Festival Hall.Those facts aside, little is known about Hollis's early life - mainly because of his tendency to tell tall tales in interviews. Born in Tottenham in north London in 1955, he told one journalist he'd dropped out of school before his A-Levels, while informing another he had studied child psychology at the University of Sussex.Upon leaving education, he claimed to have worked as a laboratory technician - but music was always his first love.\"I could never wait to get home and start writing songs and lyrics\" he told Kim magazine in 1983. \"All day long I'd be jotting ideas down on bits of paper and just waiting for the moment when I could put it all down on tape.\"Hollis formed his first band, The Reaction, in 1977 and recorded a demo for Island Records that included a song called Talk Talk Talk Talk. The group split after one single, after which Hollis intended to pursue a solo career. After writing a new batch of songs, he recruited Paul Webb, Lee Harris and Simon Brenner to help him flesh out the arrangements in the studio.\"But we liked what we were doing so much that we decided to throw every penny we had into hiring a rehearsal room and practicing to go out and play in the clubs,\" he said.The quartet soon had a name, Talk Talk, and a record deal with EMI Records, who hoped to mould them into another Duran Duran.The company even hired that band's producer, Colin Thurston, to work on their first two singles, Mirror Man and Talk Talk. But the band were keen to shake off the \"New Romantic\" tag, even dismissing their keyboard player to make it clear they weren't a synth-pop band. \"It gets tiring to listen to the Duran comparisons\" Hollis told Noise! magazine at the time. \"I can't hear it myself.\"I get depressed about the whole thing [because] kids ought to know about music, not image.\"The band deliberately took a year to craft their second album, It's My Life, and even recorded animal noises at London Zoo for the title track.The video for the song was compiled from rushes of the David Attenborough series Life on Earth.It's My Life went on to become Talk Talk's biggest hit. A cover by No Doubt reached the US Top 10 in 2003.The year 1986 saw the release of The Colour of Spring, which hinted at their musical ambitions.Based on the strength of the singles Life's What You Make It and Give It Up, it became the band's biggest album to date.A year later, Talk Talk settled into an abandoned Suffolk church to begin working on their fourth LP.When they emerged 14 months later, it was hard to believe it was the same band. Drawing on ambient textures, jazz-like arrangements and stunning orchestral arrangements, Spirit of Eden is a meditative, melancholy six-song suite that's as downbeat as it is breathtaking.\"It's an engrossing, modern 'head' album, the kind of recording that Pink Floyd never became heavy enough to make,\" said The Times in a typically enthusiastic review.\"I'd never heard music that dynamic while being organic,\" wrote Elbow's Guy Garvey, who named Spirit of Eden his favourite album in a recent edition of Q Magazine. \"It's such a brave record. To this day, I can hear its influence.\"The record performed poorly with audiences, however. EMI deleted it after three months and promptly dropped Talk Talk from their roster. Re-signing to Polydor, the band released one further album - the equally ambitious Laughing Stock - before quietly dissolving.\"There was no big split,\" Hollis later told The Times. \"By the end, everything was so loose that walking away didn't seem like a wrench. We'd reached an end point.\" Hollis waited eight years before releasing his first, and only, solo album. Self-titled, nuanced and delicate, it was recorded with just two of microphones strategically placed to capture the musicians' every inflection, from gently caressed guitar strings to the creaking of their chairs. It ends with two minutes of analogue tape hiss.Perhaps he was always travelling towards silence. \"Before you play two notes, learn how to play one note, and don't play one note until you've got a reason to play it,\" he said in 1998, shortly before retreating from public life altogether.But there's something uniquely inspiring about a musician who puts a full stop on their career.There are no second-rate comeback albums or awkwardly staged reunions to taint Talk Talk's legacy. And that's presumably the way Hollis wanted it.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

They say it costs \u00a34,800 to install low-carbon heating in a new home, but \u00a326,300 in an existing house.What's more, these systems will only work if homes are insulated to the highest standards so they need little heating.It's the committee's job to lay down a pathway for the UK to meet its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 (on 1990 levels).They are dismayed that emissions from housing suddenly increased last year, when they should be going down.The housing emissions mainly came from heating boilers - a little-discussed source of greenhouse gases.The committee says that to meet climate targets, all homes in future will have to virtually eliminate emissions.The government said it's committed to investing \u00a36bn to improve the energy efficiency of lower income and vulnerable households in a decade.Some 14% of UK greenhouse gas emissions come from our homes, but little's being done to reduce them.The committee's spokesperson Prof Julia King told us: \"This generation of home-owners is cheating its children by leaving homes which are completely inadequate for an age of climate change.\"They're too cold in winter and increasingly, as the climate continues to warm, they are going to become too hot in the summer.\"What's more, she said, many new homes don't even meet building standards because they are poorly constructed. \"These poorly-built new homes are going to need to be retro-fitted (re-insulated) 10-15 years down the line. It's a total waste of money because retro-fitting is 4-5 times more expensive than building it properly in the first place.\"This is a scandal comparable to the VW emissions scandal. Lots of people are paying far more on their gas bills than they ought to be because their new homes are poorly built.\" Tackling existing housing stock is difficult and expensive in the short-term - though it saves on gas bills in the long term.The committee wants the government to treat renovating the UK's housing stock as a national infrastructure priority, akin to widening roads.\"There's already government cash for help-to-buy,\" said Prof King. \"That should be extended to help-to-insulate.\"The report says upgrades and repairs to existing homes should include plans for shading and ventilation to combat the extreme heatwaves expected in future.They should also have measures to reduce indoor moisture, improve air quality, water efficiency and protection in homes at risk of flooding. \"The reason carbon emissions are rising again in homes is the decision by the Cameron government to slash funding for home energy efficiency,\" Ed Matthew, from the climate think tank E3G, told the BBC. \"As a result, home insulation has crashed by 95% since 2012. \"The chancellor must make building energy efficiency an infrastructure investment priority. Failure to do so will lead to entrenched fuel poverty, failure to meet carbon budgets, higher NHS costs and higher energy bills for us all.\"The Treasury has typically been reluctant to invest in insulating private houses because it believes people who are able to pay should upgrade their homes without public money.\"They seem to have missed the memo on the climate emergency,\" Mr Matthew said. A government spokesperson said: \"The UK has reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation, and moving to a greener, cleaner economy while continuing to grow the economy is at the heart of our modern Industrial Strategy. \"We will carefully consider the Committee's recommendations.\"The chair of the Committee, Lord Deben, is being investigated by the Lords Standards Commissioner to see if he has breached rules by not declaring income from firms that benefit from pro-active climate policies. Lord Deben says he has followed advice on the rules.

What exactly is alleged?  \"What we do is we help the wealthiest families in America get their kids into school.\"It was quite the mission statement. The words were spoken by the alleged kingpin of United States' biggest ever university admissions scam, William \"Rick\" Singer, according to prosecutors.He was making a pitch to a potential client, a wealthy New York lawyer, explaining the ways to get his child into a prestigious university.There were the normal channels - which rich people did not want to be \"messing around with\", he said. And then there was the back door and the side door. The back door necessitated contributing to \"institutional advancement\" - ie family connections or a multi-million-dollar donation, such as funding a new building, which is all legal. But the side door - the one that Singer had his foot jammed in and has drawn the attention of the authorities - was more accessible.He could guarantee success, he said. All you had to do was make a \"financial commitment\". On Tuesday, reams of FBI documents were unsealed from \"Operation Varsity Blues\", an investigation named after a 1990s film about the pressures of sports scholarships. The case looked at a period between 2011 and 2018, when, according to the authorities, $25m in bribes were paid by people looking to sneak around the usual university admittance process. Fifty people - including 33 parents and various sports coaches - were indicted. \"I have never seen anything like this,\" Lenore Pearlstein, publisher of Insight Into Diversity magazine, which is dedicated to making higher education and business more inclusive in the US. \"The depth of it, the number of people involved, the amounts of money. It's mindboggling.\" It feels like a \"slap in the face\" for those genuinely trying to make change, she told the BBC.Among the most jaw-dropping revelations was the alleged involvement of Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin. \"Ruh roh!\" as Huffman might say.The authorities alleged the star of TV series Desperate Housewives using this Scooby Do expression in email exchanges with Singer. According to the FBI, she was responding to news - in October 2017 - that her daughter's school wanted to use their own exam invigilator, rather than a compromised one who would be able to boost her scores.  She allegedly emailed her concerns to Mr Singer. \"We will speak about it,\" he reportedly replied. Rick Singer, a Californian life coach in his late 50s, presented himself as an expert in the university admissions process. He wrote books about it, including the self-published Getting In: Gaining Admission to Your College of Choice, which opened with an inspirational quote from Nelson Mandela. However, he kept his more illicit techniques within a closer circle.  The FBI has traced his scam back to 2011. It is not known if this was a particular turning point in his three-decade career.In 2014, he founded a non-profit organisation called Key Worldwide, which claimed to help \"disadvantaged students around the world\". The website said it would \"open doors\" for young people escaping troubles such as gang violence. However, according to the authorities, the organisation functioned as a slush fund. It became a fa\u00e7ade through which payments could be funnelled as \"charity donations\". Singer pocketed some of the cash and paid the rest in bribes to those who could help him get the results he guaranteed.Over time he had developed two possible paths to success. One would involve manipulating exam results. The other would involve securing special treatment - most typically via faked sporting prowess.According to the FBI, the two Hollywood actresses went down separate routes. The authorities claim that Felicity Huffman knew she needed to send her oldest daughter to a specific exam centre in West Hollywood to follow the plan. Hence the \"ruh-roh\" when it nearly went wrong.Singer had connections there. It is alleged that he would typically suggest his clients faked learning disabilities for their children and then, once they got a medical certificate, they would be granted extra time and could make a more believable case for switching to external exam centre. Huffman had allegedly already secured 100% extra time for her daughter's SAT (college entrance) exam. It is unclear how. Apparently, this was not enough. The next step involved bringing in someone else to take the test for her. Singer often used the services of a man called Mark Riddell. He was in his mid-30s, an ex-tennis professional, and the director of college entrance exam preparation at a boarding school in Florida. According to the FBI, he would fly in, take the test for students in a hotel room, or sneak them the correct answers in the exam room, or inflate their scores when they finished. Sometimes he would be given a sample of the teen's handwriting so he could copy it. Riddell did not know the questions in advance, according to Massachusetts Attorney General Andrew Lelling. He was \"just a really smart guy\".It is not yet known how Huffman first came into contact with Singer. In 2017, he visited the Los Angeles home she shares with her long-term partner, William H Macy, the star of Shameless and Fargo, the court documents say. The couple - who met in the early 80s and married in 1997 - are not usually caught in negative headlines. Macy's hobbies reportedly include woodturning and playing the ukulele, while Huffman has been running a wholesome parenting site, What The Flicka, based on her childhood nickname.They have been known to post loving messages to each other on social media.Early on Tuesday morning, FBI agents turned up at their door. Only Huffman was indicted. The crime she stands accused of relates to mail fraud, which is when communication methods are used to conduct a scheme that intentionally deprives another of property or honest services. Macy has not been charged.Neither has commented publicly. The couple made a $15,000 payment to the Key Worldwide Foundation for their older daughter's exam scheme, according to court documents. In an art-mirrors-life twist, it was the exact same amount that Huffman's character in Desperate Housewives had paid to a headmaster in an episode about corrupt schools admissions. In real life, her older daughter's exam score jumped 400 points - a huge leap - after Singer's involvement, it is claimed. If those claims are proven, Huffman and Macy appear to have secured a bargain. Many people paid hundreds of thousands for his help. He usually paid $10,000 to the surrogate test-taker alone. Academic manipulation was only one side of this story, and the alleged sports scam was even more outrageous. Singer was taking students with no prowess, and turning them into sporting stars on their applications, it is claimed. In some cases he would arrange for their heads to be Photoshopped on to more sporty bodies. In others, their basic stats would be manipulated - one basketball player had his height changed from 5ft 5in to 6ft 1in, presumably betting on a once-you're-in-you're-in outcome.Police found their first strong piece of evidence of this scheme during a wiretapped encounter in a hotel room in Boston, Massachusetts, according to the Boston Globe. The newspaper says that investigators had been working on an entirely different story - alleged fraud in the stock market - when they received an unexpected tip. A financial executive told them a sports coach from Yale University, Rudolph \"Rudy\" Meredith, asked for a bribe to help the businessman's daughter gain admittance to the Ivy League school.The executive agreed to wear a recording device and meet Meredith, who then offered to designate the young woman as a member of his soccer team. Meredith - as well as Singer and Riddell - have been working with the police, hoping to reduce their sentences. Sports bring in such huge amounts of money and prestige to US universities that they will often lower academic requirements to bring in new talent. \"Student athletes often have excellent leadership qualities and excel both in the classroom and on the field, recognising that makes sense for colleges looking for the best students,\" says Eric Yaverbaum, author of Life's Little College Admissions Insights. \"The hard work it requires to be a student athlete is what makes the fact that some of these parents took advantage of this route so disturbing. It's appalling that some parents and coaches betrayed those students by buying and selling those coveted positions.\"  The daughters of Full House actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli were not outstanding sportswomen.  However, the couple allegedly spent $500,000 to get them into University of Southern California by presenting them as accomplished rowers. They have not commented since the charge were filed. After getting her place, their youngest daughter, Olivia Jade, made matters worse by bragging online, saying she would rather be concentrating on her Instagram career. She is an influencer and has 1.3 million followers.\"I don't know how much of school I'm gonna attend but I'm gonna go in and talk to my deans and everyone, and hope that I can try and balance it all,\" she said on her YouTube channel. \"But I do want the experience of like game days, partying\u2026 I don't really care about school, as you guys all know.\"She has since apologised for her comments, but the backlash has been huge. It is not clear how much any of the children knew about the alleged plots. According to the court documents, some were involved, at least to a certain degree, while others were in the dark. \"[The entire scandal] is a perfect example of the entitlement that comes with wealth and privilege,\" adds author Eric Yaverbaum. \"We knew the system was unfair (after all, wealthy parents can pay for multiple test retakes and expensive tutoring, and the wealthiest can pledge large donations to a school just as their children are applying), but we didn't know wealthy parents were taking it even further. In either case, it only reiterates the need for the admissions process to be re-evaluated.\"In recent days, the US media has uncovered that Loughlin's Full House character, Aunt Becky, was also involved in a school cheating story - perhaps indicating just how common the idea is, at least in theory.  In real life, however, the story unfolding in the news has outdone the scriptwriters. Though the focus may have been on the two actresses so far, the rest of the cast of real-life characters is almost as intriguing. Other parents indicted include a self-help author, a casino operator and a Napa Valley vineyard owner. One of the many questions outstanding is - who will play whom in the inevitable TV adaption? ","24":"Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will be hosting a fundraising dinner to help secure $1bn (\u00a3750m) for infrastructure projects in the capital.Officials said tickets will be charged at more than $175,000 per person, but further details are unclear.The dinner hopes to boost foreign investment into one of Africa's fastest growing economies. Since coming to power last year, Mr Abiy has pushed for wide-scale economic reform in Ethiopia.A video released by the prime minister's has set out plans for the redevelopment of Addis Ababa, including an expansion of green spaces and retail areas.

About $14m was raised in total.Mr Abiy came to power after three years of protest led by ethnic Oromos, who were demanding an end to what they considered their political and economic marginalisation.The prime minister, who is Oromo himself, has pushed through a series of significant reforms, making peace with neighbouring Eritrea and releasing the state's tight grip on parts of the economy.His economic ambitions including a multibillion-dollar privatisation of Ethiopia's telecoms, energy, shipping and sugar industries.

From a small stall in Cheltenham market, it went on to become a truly global phenomenon and a commercial success. But 16 years after its founding, the firm started by James Holder and Julian Dunkerton is on the decline. Its shares have lost more than 70% over the past year. In December it issued a profit warning, and last week the company announced it would cut up to 200 jobs.Now the blame game is playing out in public.The fallout began when Mr Dunkerton stepped down from the firm's board, in March of 2018. At the time, he departed quietly enough, citing \"other demands on his time\".But as Superdry's fortunes began to worsen, the multi-millionaire found his voice.  He criticised the retailer's \"misguided strategy\" - including a reduction in stock both in stores and online - which he claimed he had always predicted would fail miserably. Instead, he wanted Superdry to focus more on the jackets and hoodies that made it famous, and offer a far wider range of variations on the web.Mr Dunkerton also dismissed Superdry's caution late last year that it was losing business due a prolonged spell of good weather in many of its key markets, causing customers to delay purchases of warmer clothing. Rival brands, he argued, had fared better, while facing similar economic conditions. Yet as Julie Palmer, a partner at consultancy firm Begbies Traynor points out, falling profits in retail \"has not been a problem exclusively experienced by Superdry\".Big chains, she argues, \"are no longer in a position to bend the will of the customer to their own styles\".Superdry's styles have been at the heart of Mr Dunkerton's battle with the board.The firm says he oversaw the Autumn\/Winter 2018 range, which subsequently flopped. But Mr Dunkerton claims he was cut out of the design process, and never signed off on the collection. Regardless of who was responsible for that particular decision, Superdry's brand was on the wane, according to fashion retail analyst Kate Hardcastle. Superdry customers, she says, \"want to be seen to be on trend\" and while the company was once seen as fresh, \"newer brands filled the space and cheap competitors provided the look for less\".Its rise, she adds, \"was hugely motivated by influencers, who have moved on to other products\". To make matters worse, Ms Hardcastle says, Superdry's bold branding is an \"easy target\" for counterfeiters, in a similar way that the Burberry check was vulnerable in the 1990s.Both Mr Dunkerton and Superdry disagree - they see plenty of scope for the brand to regain its cool.But Ms Hardcastle says the company expanded too quickly, and in an attempt to maximise the brand's potential, it may have \"diluted its appeal\".\"When something is a must-have, you have to be careful not to flood the market,\" she tells the BBC. \"Soon it becomes commonplace and everyone wants the new best thing.\" Mr Dunkerton remains Superdry's biggest shareholder with an 18.5% stake.His aim now is to convince fellow shareholders to believe in his ability to turn the company around, and to bring him back into the boardroom.Mr Dunkerton's return may not be the \"silver bullet\" the company needs, says Julie Palmer, but she predicts that while Superdry bosses have labelled his bid \"extremely damaging\", shareholders \"may yet flex their muscles\".\"A change back to what was successful before could be tempting, especially in a climate where we see high profile administrations on an almost weekly basis,\" she says.","26":"The first two years of the Trump White House have been eventful, to say the least. But let's ignore the drama and instead focus on the numbers.We're tracking the president's progress on his agenda and how it is received by the American public and the wider world.And there are interesting - and surprising - comparisons with some of his predecessors.Donald Trump began his term as one of the most unpopular presidents in the modern era and he remains so. His approval rating is just 37%, according to Gallup. Presidents Barack Obama (50%), George W Bush (58%) and Bill Clinton (54%) were all higher at this point. The only president in recent decades to have anything like Mr Trump's low rating at this stage was, perhaps surprisingly, Ronald Reagan, who was also languishing at 37% in 1983. His numbers slowly improved after that and he went on to win a second term as president. One upside for Mr Trump is that he still has the backing of Republican voters - 88% of them approve of his presidency. If that number stays high, it's unlikely he'll face a serious challenge to be the Republican candidate in 2020. President Trump's administration has repeatedly been branded as chaotic and dysfunctional by his critics. There is a long list of senior officials who have either quit, been fired or forced out of the White House - but has the turnover been worse than previous administrations?Well, yes, it has. Research by the Brookings Institution found that 65% of his senior-ranking advisers had left their job within the two-year mark. That's considerably more than most of his recent predecessors. Usually, a president's top team sticks together for the first year and then changes a little in the second - but for Mr Trump, the departures have been fairly regular since day one. The lack of stability in the White House has shown when it comes to measuring Mr Trump's success with policy. He has had trouble delivering in areas where he's needed to navigate the corridors of Congress, despite controlling both chambers until Democrats regained the House at the start of January. On healthcare, for example, he failed on his promise to kill off President Obama's Affordable Care Act, which helped more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans get health cover but suffered from rising premiums. His main legislative success was passing a major tax reform bill, which saw corporation tax was reduced from 35% to 21%. However, individual cuts for families failed to help Republicans in the mid-term elections. His other big success was getting two new Supreme Court judges confirmed, including Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual assault during his confirmation process. Elsewhere, the president has used executive orders to meet symbolic policy goals like moving of the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and the withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate agreement. He has also moved to draw down troop levels overseas, including in Afghanistan and Syria. But overall, independent fact-checking website Politifact says that President Trump has delivered on relatively few of his campaign promises, while almost half have been blocked or dropped. Building a border wall paid for by Mexico was President Trump's signature issue during the election campaign but it still appears unlikely to happen.Congress has approved $1.7bn in funding for 124 miles of new and replacement barrier since Mr Trump entered the White House, but estimates for building the president's desired wall range from from $12bn to $70bn. In December, after criticism over the lack of progress on the wall from some conservative commentators, President Trump triggered an unprecedented 35-day partial shutdown of the US government. He had hoped to pressure Democrats into making a deal, but he was eventually forced into reopening the government without an agreement. The US economy lost $11bn during the five-week period but about $8bn would be recouped as employees receive back pay, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Throughout the shutdown, Mr Trump argued that the wall was needed to stem a \"growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border\", involving \"thousands of illegal immigrants\".However, figures show that illegal border crossings have seen an overall decline since 2000. President Trump continues to press Congress to change US immigration laws, including ending the visa lottery system and \"chain migration\" that gives priority to relatives of existing legal US residents. The Supreme Court also handed him a victory in June last year, when it upheld his ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries entering the US on grounds of national security. During the campaign, Mr Trump vowed to create 25 million jobs over 10 years and become \"the greatest jobs president... ever\".He used to claim the actual unemployment rate was more than 40%. Now he's America's CEO, he's embracing the same jobless figures he once dismissed as \"phony\".Those figures do show, though, that job creation under Mr Trump during his first two years in office fell slightly when compared to President Obama's final two. However, the basic trajectory of the economy under President Trump remains the same as it was under President Obama - the unemployment rate is historically low and wages are growing at a faster rate in recent months. But there are some concerns for Mr Trump. Global economic growth is down and his decision to start a trade war with China led to retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The president has been quick to take credit for booming stock markets over the past couple of years, but they have started to wobble in recent weeks.The next presidential election may be more than 18 months away, but the campaign has already kicked off. Encouraged by a good set of mid-term election results, the Democrats are optimistic on retaking the White House. Several candidates have already announced that they are standing for the Democratic nomination, with the two biggest hitters being senators - Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. Other potentials, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are still mulling a run. But whoever the candidate turns out to be, the early signs are that President Trump is in for another tough battle. A recent poll found that seven possible Democrat rivals are all outperforming the president in hypothetical head-to-heads. While that should be taken with a pinch of salt this far out from election day, it will make Republicans feel a little nervous. ","27":"Hungary's new family policies are being promoted by one of the internet's best-known dysfunctional couples.The government of Viktor Orban is bringing in a \"family protection action plan\", which includes tax breaks for mothers of multiple children.Eagle-eyed Hungarians, however, noticed something familiar about the models on posters that went up in Budapest.The poster uses a stock image featuring the \"distracted boyfriend\" meme star and his partner.Unlike the cosy picture of the couple featured in Budapest, the \"distracted boyfriend\" image has been shared innumerable times online, with text layered over the top to share jokes about indecision, disloyalty, hypocrisy or virtually anything else.They were both in a series of images shot by photographer Antonio Guillem, and are available at low cost on Shutterstock.The pro-family billboards provoked some amusement in Budapest, hours after the government appeared to have rushed to remove another series of posters across the city.Those posters, paid for with public funding, had infuriated the EU and had been condemned as \"fake news\".They featured European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, alongside billionaire philanthropist George Soros with text accusing both of backing illegal immigration. Mr Soros has frequently been targeted in Hungary with conspiracy theories and anti-immigration rhetoric.The row over the posters and Mr Orban's repeated anti-EU rhetoric annoyed so many political leaders that his Fidesz party has faced calls to be kicked out of the European People's Party - the biggest group in European politics, of which Mr Juncker is a senior member. When the leader of the EPP group, Manfred Weber, visited Budapest on Tuesday to seek an apology from Mr Orban, the offending posters along his car's route were hastily papered over. Mr Weber said the grouping's fundamental values \"have to be respected by all EPP party members and also by Fidesz\".Anti-government graffiti soon appeared in the empty blue spaces where the posters had been. While the billboard campaign appears to have stopped, the anti-EU ads were still to be seen on pro-Orban news websites on Wednesday.The poster featuring the \"distracted boyfriend\" couple promotes a family protection action plan of measures to make Hungarian women with four or more children exempt from income tax for life.Mr Orban's government is looking for a baby boom to boost its falling population numbers - rather than open the door to immigration.The image selected for the new poster is entitled \"happy couple or marriage hugging and enjoying in a couch at home\".The dramatic soap opera of the couple's life includes everything from fierce rows to financial worries to romantic evenings in.","28":"When Donald Campbell's rebuilt Bluebird K7 made a return to water more than 50 years after the crash that claimed the record-breaker's life, it was hailed a triumph of engineering ingenuity. But its next outing has been abruptly called off amid tensions about what its future should hold - and even disagreement about who owns the craft.Its paintwork glistening in the afternoon sun, and with onlookers peering excitedly from the water's edge, it was a moment long in the making.Seventeen years after Bluebird's mangled wreckage had been raised from the cold depths of Coniston Water in the Lake District region of north-west England, a painstaking reconstruction project had seen it pieced together again by an ardent team of volunteers.As the jet engine fired up and a plume of kerosene-tinged spray shot forcefully across a Scottish loch, Bluebird was alive once more.It was something many had never thought possible.On 4 January 1967, Campbell had propelled the machine to its very limits in an effort to smash through the 300mph (480km\/h) barrier.Unable to wrest it back under control, his hydroplane violently lifted from the lake's surface before smashing down with ferocious, frightening force.Its pilot, perhaps the last from an era of great British adventurers, paid the ultimate price.Those final, foreboding moments, captured in grainy black-and-white film stock, have horrified and intrigued ever since.With a tartan-clad pipe band providing a hero's welcome and Bluebird hitting speeds of 150mph (240km\/h), the mood on the Isle of Bute last August was triumphant.Questions inevitably followed about the vessel's future.The months since have seen the two sides involved in the transformation surrounded by choppy waters, with disagreements over the craft's next run, whether it should become a permanent museum exhibit - and even who owns it.Anticipation had begun to build ahead of a proposed July 2019 return to Coniston, but those dates were postponed last month by the Bluebird Event Working Group comprising villagers, business representatives and councillors.For Bill Smith, the engineer who has led the recovery and rebuild, the two-week test in western Scotland had been vindication for the countless hours of toil in his North Shields workshop.There his separate Bluebird Project team busied itself, doggedly refashioning crumpled metal and replacing original parts damaged beyond repair by the savage impact of the crash.\"It's a living, breathing, educational piece of history,\" the 51-year-old beams enthusiastically.\"Now it's about letting as many people as possible see it, getting the thing out there to inspire.\"Lock it away and interest will wane. It just will.\"If it's being used on a regular basis then it smells alive, it feels alive.\"It's got scratches and dings and dents where we've hit it. It has a soul now and you don't want to kill that off again.\"The United States, Australia and France have all been suggested as possible destinations in the years ahead.But Mr Smith's vision has put him at odds with the working group, which favours Coniston as the most fitting place for one final outing before the machine forms the centrepiece of the purpose-built Bluebird Wing in the village's Ruskin Museum.While open to a Lake District return, Mr Smith dismisses the suggestion it is the craft's \"spiritual home\".\"I hear this all the time and, OK, that's how a lot of people feel.\"Because of that there is just far too much expectation on this whole Coniston thing.\"It's this idea that it's somehow sacred. Right or wrong, it ratchets the whole thing up.\"In contrast to Loch Fad, which can be closed to other users, Coniston's open right of navigation makes obtaining permission to run Bluebird much more complicated.As swimmers, boat owners and anyone else who can legally access the five-mile (8km) stretch of water cannot be prevented from using it, a detailed public event plan must be submitted to the Lake District National Park Authority.Having announced the provisional dates last October, time to make sufficient preparations for this summer simply ran out, says Tracy Coward, chair of Coniston Parish Council.\"Due to the complexities with things like traffic management and public safety on and off the lake, we need more time to organise things logistically.\"It's very disappointing, but it's a nationally significant event and we want it to be successful.\"Running on a privately owned loch is very different to a lake in a national park at the busiest time of the year.\"Mr Smith, who says he is confident he will soon be able to confirm an alternative destination for Bluebird's next outing, is critical of the working group's efforts.\"Nothing was done for years with a view to Bluebird going back to Coniston and being put on the water to run.\"It's tragic. It shouldn't have happened that way.\"You organise a music festival and your headline act just turns up, plugs in and starts to play?\"When Coniston puts on the gig and makes the stage available, we'll come and play.\"That metaphor is met with bemusement by Anthony Robinson, who until recently held the position of working group chairman.\"It's not showbiz,\" he says wryly.Part of Campbell's support team when the daredevil decamped to the Lake District in the winter of 1966, the pair had a friendship stretching back almost 20 years.\"Robbie\", as Campbell affectionately called him, was first at the crash scene on a marshal's boat.\"It [Bluebird] literally landed more or less in front of us and rolled a few times.\"It sank before we actually got out to it. I didn't feel anything. It was too much of a shock.\"For a long time you knew it had happened, but it didn't register.\"Many cheered Bluebird's Bute renaissance, but Mr Robinson was less celebratory.\"I didn't really watch much of it on TV. It's personal.\"For me it just ceased to feel like a proper Campbell-Bluebird effort, and for one obvious reason.\"There was a man missing. He was the pilot and it was generally known Donald didn't like anyone else sitting in the cockpit unless they were there for a purpose.\"Although Mr Robinson is quick to praise the work carried out by the Bluebird Project, he rejects Mr Smith's downplaying of the craft's Coniston heritage.\"They've done a magnificent job; no-one can deny them that,\" Mr Robinson says from a reception room of the guesthouse he runs.\"They've done an awful lot of work. [But] I've got to say, that sounds like desperation.\"They're synonymous [Coniston and Bluebird]. Donald was very well liked in this village, very much respected.\"For many years people never tried to make anything of it financially because they felt they would be making money over a dead man's grave, as it were, but then I think we came round to thinking you don't want him to be forgotten.\"Further disagreement surfaced when Mr Smith made clear he views the Bluebird Project as a \"co-owner\" of the craft with the Ruskin Museum.However, curator Vicky Slowe states a 2006 document signed by the Campbell Family Heritage Trust is explicit in granting legal ownership to the museum.At a cost of almost \u00a3800,000 and standing complete since 2008, its Bluebird Wing has long billed the machine as a soon-to-be permanent attraction.Campbell family memorabilia adorns the walls and the Orpheus engine which was recovered from the lake in 2001 takes pride of place.The intended jewel in the crown, though, is missing.Ms Slowe, who was raised four miles away in Hawkshead and met Campbell as a child, says: \"The deed stipulated K7 was to be rebuilt to how she looked on the morning of 4 January 1967 and be in full operable condition.\"It was stipulated the work should be done by Bill Smith and, thirdly, that we created a new exhibition to tell the story.\"Please don't think I'm disputing the quality of the work they've done. They've given many, many years to it.\"I understand that, as engineers, they think machines should work. But more and more of the original materials might have to be reinforced and replaced. \"It's a labour of love that's created a sense of possession.\"Standing waterside at Loch Fad last summer, Gina Campbell told the BBC her views had changed having seen her father's vessel brought back to life.\"Months ago I'm thinking she must become a museum piece,\" she said, before explaining that she's changed her mind about Bluebird.\"She's not ready to sit in a crusty old museum.\"Mr Smith agrees and is calling for a part-year display at the Ruskin. He wants a new contract drawn up with an agreed number of months set aside during which the hydroplane would run.\"The reality of the situation is that in 2006 Gina Campbell, on behalf of the trust, gifted the museum the wreckage and the deal was I had to rebuild it,\" he says.\"That wreckage was only half a boat.\"We bought all kinds of bits and pieces and our volunteers made those materials into new components.\"You've got the sponsons, the nose, the hydraulics, the electrics, the cockpit, the canopy, the engine. That is all our creation and that is all our private, tangible property.\"We don't own it because we said 'we've done 15 years therefore we want half'. We own it because we bloody well created it.\"It was lifted [from Coniston Water] to protect it. There was no way on Earth to say then whether it could ever be put back together, much less run.\"You look on the [museum] website and the perception is it's coming back. Yeah, that probably was the perception 10 years ago, but things have moved on.\"Both sides reluctantly admit lawyers might eventually become involved in a bid to break the impasse.Mr Robinson describes it as a \"delicate situation\".\"There is an ongoing legacy, which is what this is all about as far as the village is concerned.\"I find it a bit disappointing and frustrating.\"I think the whole project was supposed to remember Donald Campbell and Bluebird.\"Somehow or other, they seem to have slipped down the agenda.\".","29":"Asian stocks sank on Monday amid growing concerns of a slowdown in the global economy.Investors dumped stocks in favour of safer bonds, driving Japan's Nikkei index down more than 3%.The losses in Asia tracked a  global stock sell-off on Friday, fuelled by downbeat data and a cautious Federal Reserve.Unusual moves in the US bond market have also raised concerns about a possible US recession.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index dropped 3.1% to 20,948.37. In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.6% and the Shanghai Composite lost 1% in afternoon trading. \"Asian markets are taking clues from [the] sharp decline in US equities on Friday,\" CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang said.  \"The selloff is unlikely to cease until the US markets stop bleeding.\"Downbeat data from the US and Europe, combined with a cautious tone from the Federal Reserve, frightened investors last week.The first inversion in the US bond yield curve since 2007 also heightened concerns, by raising fears of a recession in the world's largest economy.The bonds, known as Treasuries in the US, are issued as a form of borrowing by governments to fund spending.For the first time in more than 10 years, the rate of return (yield) on three-month US bonds rose above 10-year yields, something which is seen as an indicator that a recession could be coming.","30":"It's Merlin... but not as you know it. The enduring legend of King Arthur has been a rich hunting ground for cinema over the years, with films such as The Sword in the Stone, Camelot and First Knight bringing their own interpretations of the mystical story to life on the big screen.This time round, it's the turn of director Joe Cornish - formerly one half of The Adam and Joe Show and director of horror comedy Attack the Block. He's enlisted the talents of Sir Patrick Stewart, no less, to help bring his modern take on the famous tale to the masses.Set in modern-day London, The Kid Who Would Be King follows a group of kids who try to save the world from the evil Morgana, after Alex (played by Louis Ashbourne Serkis, son of Andy Serkis) finds the sword in the stone on a derelict building site.Sir Patrick - the Shakespearean titan of the British stage in the 60s, 70s and 80s - found global fame as Jean-Luc Picard in Star-Trek: The Next Generation, before going on to play Professor X in the X-Men franchise. He will soon be reprising his Star Trek role for a new series, but his latest performance as Merlin is new territory.Sir Patrick is sharing the role with rising star Angus Imrie, with both actors inhabiting the chameleon-like wizard at various points throughout the film. The old Merlin - Sir Patrick - pops up when the kids in the film need an authority figure in moments of crisis.Sir Patrick says his performance was inspired by Nicol Williamson's portrayal of Merlin in John Boorman's 1981 film Excalibur, in which Sir Patrick played Sir Leondegrance, Queen Guinevere's father.\"In this movie with the old and the young Merlin, there is a playful aspect behind all the fury and rage and despair and urgency,\" he says.\"There is a lightness... in Excalibur, Merlin was played by Nicol Williamson and Nicol was a playful character himself. He brought great irony to his performance and a winsome wistfulness about him, and I just stood back and admired and adored.\"Thankfully, Sir Patrick's experience was less fraught than Williamson's.\"He nearly died on that movie - there was a huge scaling tower up against the castle tower that fell over and hit him on the head, but he was wearing a silver helmet that saved his life.\"Of course, health and safety weren't what they are now.\"Now, heads would roll as Nicol's nearly did!\" Sir Patrick jokes.Neither of Cornish's Merlins go in for the traditional wizard look - the robe and hat are replaced by bed hair and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt.\"Merlin isn't bothered what he wears, he just wears what's available to him,\" Imrie explains.\"It might remind him of something he's familiar with. Which is why he picks up a coat with a hood as it reminds him of something he might have worn in the past. But he's without the airs and graces, the insecurities about how he looks that people might be hung up about.\"Merlin is the lynchpin of the movie, an advisor, mentor and father figure.Imrie is a revelation as the charismatic, beguiling and eccentric young wizard and steals pretty much every scene he's in.He comes from good acting stock - his mother is Celia Imrie and his late father, Benjamin Whitrow, was also an actor.But this was his first major film role, with big action pieces, special effects and so on. How did he find it?\"It's fantastic being on these phenomenal sets, and working with actors like Sir Patrick was such an exciting prospect.\"I remember Joe said when we were shooting the newsagent scene - we were in Cornwall, we'd closed down the road and we were in this tiny little room - and Joe just said, 'You know, when it comes down to it, it's all just like a student film really.'\"It just makes you remember, when we did the rooftop stuff, and it was all green screen and massive sets and everything, really it's just about that little moment that happens between you and the other actor. \"The lens is always the same size, it doesn't get any more expansive just because of the budget, and I think that's a really good thing to hold on to.\"So what does his mum think of his career choice?\"She came on Sunday (to the premiere) and she's incredibly supportive. She wasn't when I said I wanted to be an actor, she was far more discouraging because she knows how difficult it is. But she realised I was serious about it [and] she's been very encouraging. \"But we're mother and son, that's the predominant relationship but we have a very good creative relationship, too.\"The film carries a strong message about healing divisions which appears to be a thinly-veiled critique on the Brexit situation.Imrie says: \"Joe is attuned to something in the air, that there is a division, that we need to call on young people to rise up and they are powerful and they can make a change and a really positive one.\"Sir Patrick adds: \"What links the US - my wife is American - and us [in the UK] is that millions of people have not felt connected, have felt disenfranchised and are really having a tough time of it. So when someone comes along and says we're going to change all that right away - which is not possible to do - it's attractive because people do not feel represented or understood. \"Surely there are more important things than building a wall between Mexico and the US, surely there's more important things to do than throwing business out of our country?\"A country is only as good as its leaders.\"The Kid Who Would Be King is released in the UK and Ireland on Friday.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

He chose the Parachute Regiment, despite the high failure rate.Out of 72 people in his intake group, he was one of only 10 who made it through to becoming part of the elite airborne infantry regiment.Callum did one tour of Afghanistan. But after returning to the UK, he felt restless in the Army.\"When I got back, I got bored,\" he says. \"It was the same mundane [work] day in, day out.\"For me, when I knew the Afghan [tour] was coming up and when I was out there, I felt that I mattered and I was doing something that mattered.\"But that feeling disappeared when we were back in the barracks.\"After being unable to transfer to the unit that his brothers were in, Callum decided to leave the Army and start a new chapter in his life with his wife.He became a personal trainer and also worked in a whisky distillery. But civilian life didn't suit Callum for long and, after 14 months, he returned to the Army, as a tank transporter.\"That feeling, 'I have more to give,' came back, almost like a regret that I had left,\" he says. But after another two years in the Army, Callum had a change of heart again.\"I was doing 17 hours a day and was tired all of the time,\" he says. He became an apprentice at a butcher's. \"I love it - and that's me.\"\"I love working with my hands, like when you're taking all the meat off the bone, it [appeals to] the caveman in me.\" But Callum still remembers his Army days fondly. \"I miss the blokes,\" he says, \"everyone was going through the same, just close friends. The biggest thing I miss is the sense that you matter. \"When you're in the Army, you wear a uniform and you are this presence  - you are visibly serving. But when you leave, you don't matter. You are just the same as everyone else on the street.\"Now, Callum is making new plans again. He has started training to be a technician with the Scottish Ambulance Service.Scotty Meenagh, 28, had always wanted to belong to the Paras. \"If you are part of the airborne, there is nobody else to look up to. You're the best soldier,\" he says.\"They've been famous throughout history. I grew up being inspired by the Paras in the Falklands War. It was a unit that could complete impossible tasks that no other unit in the army could do at that time.\"Scotty signed up to the military at 15, joining the Army Foundation College in Harrogate. However, 18 months into his training, he was injured and discharged. He rejoined at the age of 19 and started training at the Para Depot.After 46 weeks of training, he qualified and did a tour of Afghanistan in 2010. Scotty was \"Vallon man\", which means he searched the route ahead of the patrol, including using a metal detector, to make sure it was safe. He was also a medic.\"Your mates are relying on you to protect them,\" he says. \"You're not focusing so much on the combat role, so my weapon would be slung over my back and I'd be relying on a soldier behind me for my protection.\"On 25 January 2011, Scotty was injured by a bomb that also killed one of his comrades. The injury meant that Scotty became a double amputee.Recalling his rehabilitation, he says: \"You go through so many different states, it's hard to believe you were in that position - it's a strange start of coping mechanisms.\"When you think back to such tough times, you remove the person from it.\"Scotty says he now puts all his energy into sport. \"After being wounded, you need to try different things to rediscover your purpose. I found that sport enabled me to get out of bed every morning.\"In 2014, Scotty turned his attention to cross-country skiing, after seeing it at the Paralympics in Sochi, in Russia. He went on to race on the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup circuit and, in 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, became the first British sit-skier to race at the Paralympics.He is currently training for the 2022 Beijing Paralympics, and he's also about to get married and \"make a family\" for himself. \"My fiancee and I have got a house and are living a nice normal life.\"Geoff Dunn's family tradition of serving in the military stretches back as far as the colonial wars of the 19th Century.Geoff, 48, joined the Paras when he was 17, believing them to be the pinnacle of the infantry. He went on tours in Northern Ireland and Africa.But after he got married, he felt he needed to choose between the military or his family, having seen a number of friends divorce.After leaving the Army, he took up a couple of civilian jobs before eventually settling in a role as a response officer with the police. Over time, he moved in to firearms policing. After 15 years in the police force, Geoff felt the call to once again \"do his bit\" in the Paras, motivated by the 2009 British operation in Afghanistan and the people he knew who had been killed or injured.\"To be totally truthful, [I wanted] to test myself. It really did feel like a call to arms,\" he says. \"It wasn't a light decision to go, as I had a wife and two teenage sons.\"He knew that after being out of the Paras for so long, he would have to start from the bottom again.Aged 40, Geoff passed the recruitment physical test. This included a 10-mile run carrying approximately 40lb (18kg) of kit, which he finished in less than two hours. He was quickly accepted back into the Paras.After a tour in Afghanistan, Geoff left the Army and eventually went into private protection, protecting maritime workers in the Indian Ocean. However, he says a family death made him reassess the amount of time he was spending away from home. He went to work for the Civil Nuclear Constabulary as a firearms instructor, among other duties. But after three years, a former boss asked him if he wanted to return to the police force.\"I've always thought you have one life and that it is very limiting if you tie yourself to one thing,\" he says. \"However, if you enjoy it, then get good at it.\"From a young age, Dan Eccles wanted a challenge.\"I've always known about the Paras,\" the 26-year-old says. \"I had a little recruitment book that inspired me. I was hooked and wanted a slice of it.\"At 17, Dan went to the Catterick Para Depot. It was the hardest thing he's ever done, he says, physically and mentally. After passing his training, he went to Afghanistan. Serving there was the reason he had signed up, he says.But Dan found that returning to the UK and settling into civilian life outside of the Army was not so straightforward. \"When you come back, it's hard to adjust,\" he says.\"You spend six or seven months fully switched on and you're always looking at every single person, [thinking] 'What are they doing? Are they carrying weapons? Who are they speaking to?\"So when you come back, it's very confusing. You can't switch your brain off. I didn't really get that much help. I struggled for a few years.\"Dan took a welding course, funding it himself by working in a retail stockroom. But three years in he became depressed. \"I missed the excitement [of the Army]. Being in the stock room was very mundane.\"But his perseverance paid off, with his training leading to a welding job, making metal appliances for kitchens in restaurants, cafes and hotels.Dan's other passion in civilian life has been powerlifting, a hobby he started before he left the Army. \"I was so short and skinny and tiny,\" he says. \"I wasn't interested in looking ripped. I just wanted to eat a lot of food and get very strong.\"Terry Jones, 29, joined the Army to get out of his local Welsh town. He enrolled in the Paras when he was 17.He served for nearly 10 years and completed two Afghan tours, including the tour known as Herrick 8 in 2008.He says of this tour: \"It was horrendous. It had the worst death rate since World War Two for the Paras.\"On his second Afghan tour, in 2011, Terry was hurt trying to help his injured comrade Scott. He sustained a head injury and was put into an induced coma for 10 days. He lost 70% of the vision in his left eye and was medically discharged in 2014.\"I miss the lads, the banter and how close you are down there,\" he says. \"You look out for each together. Everybody has got each other's back.\"After leaving the Paras, Terry worked as a lorry driver and then in a furniture shop. He later became the owner a PVC plastics company that made items such as bouncy castles - but since leaving the business, he has focused on looking after his family.\"Right now is the happiest I've ever been,\" he says. \"I spend a lot of time with my kids, on bike rides and taking them on holiday.\"Photos and interviews by Ed Gold.","32":"UK manufacturers prepared for Brexit by stockpiling raw materials at a record pace last month, a closely-watched survey has suggested.The research, by IHS Markit\/CIPS, found companies were stockpiling goods in January at the fastest pace in the survey's 27-year history.Employment in the sector fell, and the survey warned that export orders were \"near-stagnant\".It added that there was a risk of the sector slipping into recession.Overall, the survey's Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.8 last month from 54.2 in December, which was a three-month low and the second weakest reading since July 2016.While the figure above 50 still implies activity in the sector is expanding, IHS Markit\/CIPS said manufacturing had made a \"lacklustre\" start to the year.With two months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU, the lack of clarity over the terms of the UK's departure means firms are having to make contingency plans.\"The start of 2019 saw UK manufacturers continue their preparations for Brexit,\" said Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit.\"Stocks of inputs increased at the sharpest pace in the 27-year history, as buying activity was stepped up to mitigate against potential supply-chain disruptions in coming months.\"There were also signs that inventories of finished goods were being bolstered to ensure warehouses are well stocked to meet ongoing contractual obligations.\"An equivalent survey of eurozone manufacturers also found the sector struggling in the 19-nation bloc. The PMI reading of 50.5 for January indicated minimal growth and was the lowest reading since November 2014.The eurozone survey also found new orders were falling at the fastest rate in nearly six years, By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent With clarity as yet elusive, manufacturers are intensifying efforts to prepare for a possible a no-deal Brexit. Both raw materials and finished goods are being stockpiled at an unprecedented rate, to avoid disruption to supply chains and gaps on warehouse and shop shelves.So on the face of it, the overall PMI activity balance for this survey suggests greater manufacturing momentum last month in the UK than in  France or Germany.But away from the buzz of stockbuilding, orders, particularly for export, are struggling.  Overseas customers may be more reluctant to order goods, in case they face delays or tariffs on delivery in the event of a no-deal.This survey tends to be more volatile than official manufacturing figures. But there is increasing evidence of dwindling export demand in many sectors. Orders for British malting barley, for example, from the rest of the EU has dried up, as that crop could attract particularly steep charges.  The report referred to some UK supply chains as being \"closer to breaking point\"It noted there had been \"a marked slowdown\" in the growth of new orders, and those companies that did report an increase in output \"mainly linked this to stock-building activity\".\"January also saw manufacturing jobs being cut for only the second time since mid-2016 as confidence about the outlook slipped to a 30-month low, often reflecting ongoing concerns about Brexit and signs of a European economic slowdown,\" said Mr Dobson.\"With neither of these headwinds likely to abate in the near-term, there is a clear risk of manufacturing sliding into recession.\"","33":"As a deadly polar vortex - an Arctic freeze - sweeps across parts of North America, the plummeting temperatures and icy winds are posing serious danger to millions. Temperatures fell to -30C (-22F) in Chicago - colder than parts of Antarctica - and -37C in North Dakota.The US National Weather Service is warning that frostbite is possible within just 10 minutes of being outside in such extreme conditions.So what are the risks of extreme cold and how can you avoid them?There are often two main dangers that people will speak about - hypothermia, in which your body shuts down after reaching an abnormally low temperature, and frostbite, an injury to the body caused by freezing.The latter is most common on extremities such as fingers and toes, but can affect eyelashes too. Hypothermia\"Frost bite is deep tissue damage, so you freeze all your flesh,\" says Mike Dinn of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), \"and effectively those digits, toes just die and the only recourse is medical intervention.\"The time for action, the extreme weather expert says, is at an earlier stage called frostnip before the transition into frostbite.\"It's the precursor to frostbite, and absolutely the point you need to intervene,\" Mr Dinn explains.Frostnip can happen in a matter of a few minutes, turning your skin white and waxy. Common areas are on your hands and cheeks, which you may not see yourself, so it is important to have someone check you, and for you to check them.\"Get out of the cold, or put a hand or even a glove over the area to stop the exposure and bring back the pinkness to the skin,\" advises the operations manager for BAS.The damage can be reversed at this point, but Mr Dinn points out you can still lose some of the surface layers of the skin.The best way to avoid risk is to stay indoors, with plentiful stocks of food, water and medicine. Taps can be kept open at a drip to stop pipes freezing. Pets can be brought inside.When it's not possible to stay inside, you have to plan and prepare to limit exposure, and give extra thought to your hands, head and feet. Mittens are better for warmth than gloves, while scarves or balaclavas are best for keeping the cold off the face and hats are essential to reducing heat loss.When you do get cold, get your hands into your armpits or retreat to shelter.\"People don't think about leg cover - walking in jeans in -30 degrees won't get you frostbite, but you might get hypothermia and into trouble quickly,\" says Mr Dinn, who has over three decades of expedition experience.Insulating trousers, ski trousers or even wearing pyjamas under your trousers will give that added layer of protection.However, Mr Dinn cautions: \"You need to think of practical footwear, not just insulated footwear but you need to think of not constricting circulation with too many socks on.\"The expedition expert strongly advises people who have to go outside to stock their cars with emergency supplies.\"It's always worth having a sleeping bag or blanket in the car,\" Mr Dinn says. \"Carry some warm fluids, have a little bit of food, something to give you energy and a shovel to dig you out of remote roads.\"For those who do not have chains for their tyres, hessian sacks or a cloth bag can help with creating traction on the road.\"If people are outside for a long time, they don't notice the transitional period between frostnip and frostbite,\" warns the expedition expert.\"Even if you have to work outside, you need to go back inside regularly, take warm sugary drinks and snacks into your system, and exercise to keep your blood circulation and body temperature up.\"He warns inactivity for any length of time, for example as a result of a car accident, can lead to considerable risk.\"Stay in the car, out of the wind, because wind chill exacerbates the whole process,\" Mr Dinn says.He warns against people making the mistake of thinking they can walk to a nearby town or petrol station for help.\"That's exactly the sort of situation people don't gauge properly, and then you can rapidly lose core body temperature and succumb to hypothermia.\"The expedition expert says that, in extreme cases, people may lose their sense of awareness and discard layers because they think they are warm, when actually they are not.\"It only takes one slip up to lead to permanent injury,\" Mr Dinn says. \"But if a person goes about their daily affairs carefully and prepared, you should be fine.\"","34":"Superdry has rejected a business plan proposed by its co-founder Julian Dunkerton and urged shareholders not to allow him back on the board.Mr Dunkerton stepped down from the board a year ago since when the shares had lost 70% of their value.Now he has demanded to be reappointed and has published a plan - \"Supercharging Superdry\".However, in a blunt statement Superdry said his return, 'in any capacity, would be extremely damaging'.Its official statement just released, says: \"The Board unanimously believes that Mr Dunkerton's return to the company, in any capacity, would be extremely damaging to the company and its prospects.\" It adds the plan has \"no clear articulation of the proposed strategy or action plan\".The statement uses capital letters and underscoring to urge shareholders to \"VOTE AGAINST\" a motion at a general meeting on 2 April appointing Mr Dunkerton to the board along with Peter Williams, chairman of online retailer Boohoo.Mr Dunkerton and James Holder founded Superdry from a small stall in Cheltenham market 16 years ago.Mr Holder left the company in 2016 and Mr Dunkerton stepped down last year citing \"other demands on his time\", although more recently he blamed \"my fundamental disagreement\" with the company's strategy.Mr Dunkerton is the company's largest shareholder with 18%. He and Mr Holder have a combined stake of 28.5%.Since Mr Dunkerton's departure Superdry's fortunes have declined. In December it issued a profit warning, and this month the company announced it would cut up to 200 jobs.Mr Dunkerton criticised the retailer's \"misguided strategy\" - including a reduction in stock both in stores and online - which he claimed he had always predicted would fail, and has set up a website Save Superdry.On it he launched his business plan saying Superdry had undergone a \"dramatic shift from being a design-led business with innovative creative input, a strong brand identity and an innate understanding of the customer, to follow a misguided consultant-led business model\"Superdry said that its fall in profits were due to unseasonably warm weather and tough competition from discounters.In his business plan Mr Dunkerton said \"The weather isn't the issue, the strategy is.\"","35":"As consumers, we are spending more of our money on what we do rather than on what we wear.The beneficiary - an unlikely star bucking the downturn in retail - is the humble museum and gallery shop. Once stocked with little more than key rings and badges for visiting schoolchildren, they now offer designer homeware and exclusive gifts.They attract shoppers looking for presents with a cultural touch, or something different to the wares of a homogeneous High Street. Some 52% of adults go to a museum each year, some are visiting these venues specifically for the shops. These venues are moving from being a museum with a shop attached, to a shop with a museum attached.\"Over the last decade, our members have seen a real change in the way that people visiting cultural and heritage attractions are shopping at the stores, giving the general High Street a run for their money as shoppers are seeking out a more meaningful, and perhaps even ethically sourced item,\" says Jill Fenwick, managing director for the Association for Cultural Enterprises.Products may be original and quirky, but that is not the only reason for their success. Shops and caf\u00e9s have become vital to museums that face central and local government funding cuts, and through the doors come people with money to spend - a luxury not always enjoyed by city and town centre stores.David Fenton, head of retail at the Imperial War Museums, has witnessed both sides of this retailing coin. He has spent the majority of his career in fashion retail, having worked for 12 years at designer department store Liberty London. For the last five years, he has run retail, publishing and brand licensing at the Imperial War Museums' five sites. \"We are very lucky in this sector that we have a different reason why people experience us - they are coming to learn about the subject,\" he says, admitting he does not miss the High Street. \"The more we make of that, the better it is, and the more we will continue to grow.\"He says they will hit this financial year's target of retail sales of \u00a35.2m, making a profit of \u00a3800,000 - all of which gets ploughed back into the museums.Sales have grown by 56% in the last six years, and by 15% in the current financial year alone. Over that time, the shops have become more professional - overhauling displays (such as book covers facing outwards), cutting the product range by 30%, and concentrating on their core theme. There are no toy soldiers or guns for sale, but plenty of items that represent the social history explained in the museums' galleries.The biggest seller is the guidebook, representing one of the big factors in the museums' retail success - philanthropy. The book is sold and actively marketed at the door as the equivalent to a \u00a35 donation which helps to keep the flagship London museum free.That is a theme across the cultural sector. The latest survey by the Museums Association showed that museum visitor numbers have risen but, for many, local authority funding has been cut.Nearly half of the museums surveyed said their so-called \"earned income\" - mostly from shops and caf\u00e9s - had risen year-on-year, partly owing to visitors feeling as though they are contributing to a good cause.These visitors also have money to spend. The Mendoza Review, an independent audit of museums in England in 2017, found that nearly two-thirds of visitors are from high socio-economic groups. As a result, the effect of the squeeze on household incomes over the last decade may have been less acute than it has been for retailers in general.The High Street's response to consumers' shrinking spending power has been to discount heavily, and for most of the calendar year.That is a rarity in museum and gallery shops. Many were involved in a Black Friday spin-off called Museum Shop Sunday but, for the most part, these shops compete on content rather than price.In the shop at Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, there is a January sale but it covers only a small part of a well-stocked space. It is striking to any of the 400,000 visitors walking through the doors of this dramatic former flour mill each year that the shop and caf\u00e9 entrances are prominent long before they see any paintings or installations.The retail offer has developed as the centre has increasingly become a place to meet friends and socialise. Some 70% of visitors go into the shop - a great benefit when many retailers struggle to get people in a store as they shop online. Typically, they spend \u00a315 each rising to between \u00a330 and \u00a350 at Christmas, leading to annual sales of \u00a3500,000. A quick chat to customers reveals many are browsing for unusual presents for loved ones.Sara Ley, head of retail, says when the gallery opened in 2002, this was only a bookshop.\"Quickly we realised we needed to make more money and that Amazon were taking over the book market, so we started introducing more gifts and over the years that has expanded,\" she says. \"We don't have a permanent collection so we have the freedom to stock all sorts of interesting designs.\"Products range from little finger puppet plastic hands for 50p to \u00a3800 prints by Angel of the North artist Antony Gormley.  Sales have risen by 20% in the last year, owing in part to greater visitor numbers from last summer's Great Exhibition of the North.As with many other outlets in this sector, artists are commissioned to create products specifically for the shop and quirky ranges are encouraged - all at a time when independent shops have struggled owing to the economic climate.Ultimately, museum shops are still niche retailers, but they may just be making their own history.You can hear more on You and Yours on BBC Radio 4 at 12:15 GMT on Thursday, or via the programme's website.","36":"Medicinal cannabis was legalised last year but so far, virtually no-one in the UK has been able to access it.Now, enough cannabis to treat 30 patients for a month has arrived in the UK from the Netherlands. Three patients with prescriptions, all to treat chronic pain, will receive cannabis-derived medicines immediately.  Specialist doctors have been able to prescribe cannabis since 1 November - so what has taken so long?The new law moved cannabis from schedule 1 under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 - meaning it had no therapeutic value - to schedule 2. That category is for drugs which are controlled but have a recognised medical use and can be prescribed in certain circumstances.Cannabis-based medicines can come in the form of whole cannabis flowers, oils or capsules, or a single compound which can be isolated and extracted. The two main active ingredients in cannabis are cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) but a cannabis plant will contain hundreds of different compounds. Medicinal cannabis is currently unlicensed so doctors can prescribe it only if a patient has a need that can't be met by licensed medicines.Under the new rule, GPs are not allowed to prescribe cannabis-derived medicines. It has to be a specialist consultant, for example in neurology or paediatrics.  Even getting the right prescription pads has been a challenge according to Hari Guliani at Grow Biotech, a consultancy which has worked with both doctors and importers.Prescribing cannabis is new to UK doctors and so it may take a while before they begin doing so, says Dr David McDowell, the pain specialist who prescribed cannabis for the patients receiving their medicines this week. He described the current process as \"tortuous\".The prescriptions are valid for 28 days and, at the moment, doctors are advised to prescribe a month's worth at a time.   One of Dr McDowell's patients, who is set to receive his first supply of medical cannabis, suffers from Crohn's - a painful inflammatory bowel disease. He said he had been prescribed opiates in the past, which, he said, had made his condition worse. \"It's a hard thing to do to yourself to put up with becoming addicted to opioids or putting up with the vomiting and nausea that come with immune-suppressing drugs,\" he said.But, he says, the price for cannabis - \u00a3695 for one month's supply- \"takes the edge off the good news\", adding that he didn't believe it would be sustainable for him in the long term. All the patients receiving cannabis this week are doing so privately. NHS England said that cannabis-based products would be prescribed only where there was \"clear published evidence of benefit\" that couldn't be achieved by a licensed medicine.It said that where necessary, NHS Trusts could meet the cost but, \"the current position is that no cannabis-based products for medicinal use are routinely commissioned.\"In October 2019, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) plans to publish guidelines concerning the medication, and the NHS will then use this to decide whether it will eventually fund the drug routinely for some patients.At the beginning of December, Carly Barton is thought to have become the first person to be given a prescription for cannabis but wasn't able to actually receive the drug because none had been imported.She told the BBC last year that she had been buying cannabis \"on the black market\" instead of taking very strong opiates including fentanyl which she had been prescribed for pain. Last month, Charlotte Caldwell, whose son has a rare form of epilepsy and became the centre of a campaign to legalise the drug for medicinal purposes, told the Times she had been able to pick up a dose of cannabis.It's understood that an individual supply was flown in from Canada - but this week is the first time a stock of the drug has been imported. Other conditions cannabis might be prescribed for include multiple sclerosis and cancer.At every stage of the process, getting cannabis-based medicines to patients is very tightly regulated, adding to the delay.The first batch of legal cannabis has been shipped into the UK in the form of whole flowers, which contain more than one active pharmaceutical ingredient. This also makes it more complicated to get approval than importing a single compound like, say, morphine. While morphine is also a controlled substance, it has a well-established medical use, meaning processes are in place to import and regulate it. This batch coming from the Netherlands has been grown at a specially regulated site for cannabis for medical purposes and the export has to be approved by the Dutch government. Importers in the UK need to apply to the Home Office for a licence to bring in the cannabis from overseas.The whole process can take up to 28 days, so by the time it's completed, the prescription may have expired. These delays are why companies involved in the process of importing medical cannabis say its important to bring in a bulk amount.The bureaucratic hurdles are all there for patients' safety, says Mr Guliani at Grow Biotech.But bringing cannabis into the country in larger amounts can mitigate these delays, meaning when patients' supplies run out there's stock available and they don't have to have a gap in their treatment.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter","37":"Wintry weather has grounded flights, closed hundreds of schools, and caused travel chaos across the UK.But while commuters frantically clawed at the ice on their windscreens, many took to  the web to ask all manner of snow-related questions.Here are the answers to some of the most-searched.When it comes to de-icing your car, patience is a virtue.For starters, don't do what this driver did and leave only a tiny gap in their snow-covered windscreen before driving off.When you use the car's heater to defrost the windows, increase the heat gradually or it'll create extra mist.Brush off the snow from the car's exterior, including the front grille.Don't use boiling water to de-ice windscreens - hot water can crack the glass, and the water will only freeze again on the screen or on the ground where you are standing.Instead, spray the windscreen with plenty of de-icer and use a scraper to remove the frost from the entire screen.A squirt of WD-40 can also prevent door locks freezing up. If they do, heat your key with a lighter to melt the ice.But if you fancy a more extreme solution, you could take the approach Russians used to de-ice their airplanes: find leftover jet fighter engines and use them to blast hot air at the affected areas. (Results not guaranteed.)Sadly, rounding off your lunch of crisps and chocolate with a fizzy vitamin C tablet isn't a surefire way to stave off the office cold.It mainly comes down to - no surprises here - eating well, sleeping properly, and exercising enough.The NHS recommends eating plenty of fruit and veg, as well as a hearty breakfast to set you up for the day.Milk and dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt and fromage frais are also great sources of protein, vitamins and calcium.Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't have to be below zero to snow.You can start wishing for a snow day as soon as the temperature drops below 2\u00b0C.According to the Met Office, most of the UK's heaviest snowfalls tend to be when the temperature sits between 0\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C.Any hotter than that and the snowflakes will melt and fall as sleet or rain.Gritters may have been out in force - but the \"grit\" they've been laying is actually rock salt.Salt lowers the freezing point of water, so it stops ice forming and causes existing ice or snow to melt.In a word, carefully. Stopping distances are greater in snow and ice.Allow extra time, plan your journey, wear warm clothes, and make sure your phone is properly charged.Stock up on chocolate, biscuits and hot drinks, in case you get stuck.After de-icing your car, use second gear to pull away, lifting the clutch gently to avoid wheel spin.Stay in a higher gear for better control as you pick up speed.Maintain the right speed for the conditions - not too fast so that you risk losing control, but not so slow that you risk losing momentum when you need it.If your school has declared a snow day, you've got your head teacher to thank. They are usually the ones who decide whether to close the school.The decision is based on the welfare of children, taking into account whether:If the weather is fine in the morning, but scheduled to get worse later in the day, the school may decide to close for the whole day.Most people know it's white and cold and falls from the sky. But what actually is it?As the Met Office explains, snow forms when tiny ice crystals in clouds stick together, becoming snowflakes.If enough of these crystals stick together, they'll become heavy enough to fall to the ground.As the snowflakes drift down from the sky, those falling through moist air that is slightly warmer than 0\u00b0C will melt at the edges and stick together, producing big flakes.This type of snow is \"wet\" and makes for good snowmen.\"Dry snow\", which is ideal for snow sports, comes from snowflakes that fall through cold, dry air, producing small, powdery flakes.","38":"EU leaders have agreed on a plan to delay the Article 50 process, offering to postpone Brexit for at least two weeks beyond the original 29 March exit day.Theresa May says she still wants to leave the EU with a deal, but if she cannot win the support of MPs then the possibility of a no-deal Brexit remains.So with the clock still ticking, what is the government doing to prepare for a no-deal Brexit? The code name for the government's no-deal Brexit contingency plan is Operation Yellowhammer, named after a bird.First launched in June 2018, it covers 12 areas including transport, healthcare, energy, food and water. It is based on worst-case scenario assumptions - delays at the border over a six-month period, increased immigration checks at EU border posts, reduction in choice and availability of food, and potential price increases for utilities, food and fuel.Operation Yellowhammer isn't the government's only Brexit contingency plan, but sits alongside broader preparations.This is to \"reflect the fact that it would not be possible for departments to plan for every eventuality\", according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO), and that the government would need a way of taking control and quickly coordinating different agencies to handle any short-term disruption. Through Operation Yellowhammer, the government has been looking at what existing powers it could use to prioritise fuel to essential services or to relax rules limiting the working hours of HGV drivers, for example.As part the contingency plans, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has made 3,500 troops, including reserves, available to be deployed if necessary.It has also set up an operations room in a bunker at its main Whitehall building to coordinate efforts in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The MoD will not comment on exactly what role the troops could perform, only that they will \"support government planning\".In its report on Yellowhammer, earlier this month, the NAO said some no-deal preparations might not be ready in time. For example, the report said the government did not have enough time to put in place all of the infrastructure, systems and people required for fully effective border operations on day one.The cost of Yellowhammer is part of the \u00a31.5bn allocated by the Treasury to government departments for Brexit preparations.For Yellowhammer to be effective, the NAO says that the \"command, control and coordination\" structure needs to be in place ahead of the UK leaving the EU. So the government could decide to activate Operation Yellowhammer a few days ahead of any potential no-deal Brexit date.But what about the government's broader no-deal Brexit plans?The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says thousands of medicines have been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU. Suppliers are stockpiling an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual \"buffer\" stock. The same approach is being taken with vaccines as well as blood and transplant products.The DHSC has also agreed contracts for extra warehouse space with refrigeration capacity to store these supplies.  A plane has been chartered to fly in medicines which have short shelf-lives and cannot be stockpiled, like medical radioisotopes used in cancer treatment.The government has previously warned \"there could be some freight traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no-deal Brexit\".That's because under a no-deal scenario, lorries travelling between the UK and the EU will need to complete custom declarations. On top of this, certain goods from the UK, such as food and plant products, arriving into EU ports may also require physical checks, under EU single market rules.The Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day and the worry is that extra checks could lead to bottlenecks, leading to many miles of tailbacks.Independent modelling has estimated that two minutes of extra processing time for each lorry would lead to tailbacks of 17 miles.To avoid significant disruption, Operation Brock is the name of the plan to hold up to 2,000 lorries heading for mainland Europe in a queue while keeping other traffic flowing around it.A fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time.If further capacity was still required, a \"last resort\" would be to turn the M26 into a temporary lorry park. The M26 is a 10-mile motorway connecting the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20, near West Malling.Under this scenario, the M26 would be closed to normal road users and lorries would park on the carriageway. Kent County Council believes this option could accommodate an additional 2,000 lorries.Roadworks have been taking place to install a temporary steel barrier on the M20 that would be used for Operation Brock.Kent County Council has also issued advice to local schools suggesting pupils and staff cold be moved inside school buildings if extra lorry traffic causes air pollution to increase.The government has published a \"tariff schedule\" - a list of the taxes placed on different types of products when they are imported from other countries - which has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It will mean some goods from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper. And some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive.The British Retail Consortium has warned that there could be gaps on supermarket shelves if there is disruption at the border. The UK government published on 13 March its contingency plan to avoid a hard border (ie physical infrastructure) in Ireland in the event on a no-deal Brexit.Under the plans, the UK will not bring in new checks or controls or require customs declarations for any goods moving from across from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of no deal.But this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer term solutions. The UK government says its contingency plan recognises \"the unique social, political and economic circumstances of Northern Ireland\".To protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked. The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself. But it has not specified exactly where they will take place. It remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland. Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market (such as at the Irish land border). However, the Irish government says there are \"no plans for Border Inspection Posts on the border with Northern Ireland.\" Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter","39":"A no-deal Brexit threatens billions of pounds of chemical imports, the head of the Chemical Industries Association, Stephen Elliott, has warned.He says secondary legislation, needed to copy EU regulations into UK law, contains \"significant gaps\".The loophole could halt UK imports of chemicals by EU-registered companies from countries outside the EU, he says.\"Put simply, the drugs don't work, the cars don't run and the planes don't fly without chemicals and chemistry.\"Unless the law is changed, he says, the import of \"billions of pounds worth of chemicals,\" used across UK manufacturing, would have to come to a sudden halt if the UK left the EU with no deal on 29 March.In a statement, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the government was working closely with industry stakeholders to ensure they are prepared in the event of a no-deal Brexit:\"Our approach will maintain regulatory standards, provide continuity for business and reduce the risk of interruption in supply chains,\" it said.The UK imports roughly \u00a333bn of chemicals from the EU every year, and about \u00a327bn from the rest of the world. Part of the problem is the huge amount of work that needs to be done, and the speed with which legislation is being pushed through parliament as a result.\"I think the average politician is not one hundred per cent across all the details of where the gaps are, so it's left to business to pick up the pieces,\" says Allie Renison, who heads Europe and Trade Policy at the Institute of Directors.  There is plenty of expertise in the system, Ms Renison adds, but civil servants are trying to create entire regulatory systems that have not existed before. \"Taking the chemicals regulatory framework as an example, that's a big change that no-one has any experience of doing, and the government is in a rush to get it all passed before Brexit day.\" The uncertainty in the political process has percolated down through the industry. At Robinson Brothers, a 150-year-old chemicals company in West Bromwich, the managing director Adrian Hanrahan struggles to put a figure on the amount of money he has had to spend to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. \"But,\" he says, \"if you put a number on time, it's been hellishly expensive.\"An enormous of amount of time has been spent on the administration and paperwork of preparing for no deal. \"We could employ ten people to keep us on the straight and narrow,\" Mr Hanrahan says, \"but we're a small company, and it's quite difficult.\"Robinson Brothers has also spent hundreds of thousands of pounds stockpiling extra supplies of the odorant that gives gas its distinctive smell. The company normally holds six weeks stock, but it is increasing that to four months. \"You can't distribute gas without it,\" Mr Hanrahan says, and \"networks are panicking.\" \"We've got twitchy as well,\" he says, \"because we're under contract to supply, and we want to make sure we fulfil our obligations.\"Everyone in the industry is determined to provide continuity of supply of all the chemicals on which the UK depends, but the Chemicals Industry Association is worried about disruption if some imports can't take place. ","40":"A bronze statue of a defiant girl has been installed in London's financial district to highlight the importance of female leaders in business.Fearless Girl, by Kristen Visbal, will be outside the London Stock Exchange on Paternoster Square until June.It is a copy of a statue that became famous for \"staring down\" Wall Street's bull after it was unveiled in New York City in 2017.London companies said the girl stood for \"progress\" that must be made.State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the asset management business behind the campaign, said research showed companies with gender diversity in their leadership teams outperformed those without it.\"We are delighted to bring this impactful campaign to London and continue to take a stand for the important issues of gender diversity at the board and senior leadership level,\" SSGA's Lori Heinel said.Ironically, SSGA became embroiled in its own gender pay row the same year it launched the Fearless Girl campaign.London Stock Exchange said it was \"delighted\" to welcome the bronze to Paternoster Square.CEO David Schwimmer said the group \"fully supports her mission of raising awareness of the importance of diversity on boards and within senior corporate leadership\".Both the London and New York statues were produced to coincide with International Women's Day on 8 March.Fans of the artwork took to Twitter to push for it to become a permanent part of the City.While Hafi Rahman added: \"About time!\"However, the statue has not been welcomed in all corners, with some sceptics claiming it is a marketing ploy.Writing on Twitter, Ade Alabi said: \"How the heck does a statue promote leadership. This is absolute madness!\"Harold Jarche said it was \"a marketing stunt\" while Duncan Stuart said it was \"a piece of PR pandering\". ","41":"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Scott Farquhar, co-founder and co-chief executive of software company Atlassian.Scott Farquhar remembers his life-changing \"sliding doors\" moment.The Australian entrepreneur was on track to join one of the country's top military institutions after he finished high school. But the letter from the Australian Defence Force Academy offering him a place got lost in the post.By the time it arrived at Scott's family home some two months late, he had opted to go to university instead.That missing letter set him, and business partner Mike Cannon-Brookes, on a path to become Australia's first tech billionaires. \"If the letter had turned up earlier, history may be slightly different,\" says Scott, now 39.With a credit card and not much else, the pair founded business software company Atlassian in 2002.The Nasdaq-listed firm is now valued at $25bn (\u00a318.8bn) and the two men are worth an estimated $7bn each. Growing up in a working-class suburb of Sydney, Scott says he always had an interest in computers. \"I remember crying myself to sleep one night because my friend had a computer and I wanted one too,\" he says.His parents ended up buying him a second-hand machine and he spent about a year trying to make it work. Computer programming came later.Scott met Mike while both were doing a degree in computers and business at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. The two friends finished the course and wanted to work for themselves.Their goals were simple: don't wear suits, and earn more than 48,500 Australian dollars ($35,000; \u00a326,000) a year. That was roughly the salary other graduates had been offered by big banks and accounting firms. \"At that stage I was living in a shared house at university and eating ramen noodles every day,\" says Scott. \"We didn't have much to lose.\" A brief spell as a \"terrible\" tech support company was followed by a shift to business software.Orders were hard won at first, coming mainly from people they knew.Then one day in 2003, a fax arrived. It was a purchase order from American Airlines. That fax still hangs outside Scott's office at the company's headquarters in Sydney.It was the end of what he describes as \"hand-to-hand combat\" to find customers. Now they were coming straight to Atlassian. \"That was the turning point when we knew we'd make it,\" he says.Scott credits the company's growth in part to its sales model. By making its products available online, he says they took business software sales off the golf course and direct to customers. It meant that Atlassian, which last year topped $1bn in revenues, could access markets it couldn't afford to reach with a traditional sales force. Nowadays Coca-Cola, Twitter and Visa are among the thousands of firms using it products. As the business grew, it secured $60m of external investment in 2010. Atlassian, named after the Greek god Atlas, floated on the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York in 2015.Scott was there in person to ring the bell with Mike and other colleagues, when the surprise arrival of his wife and three kids left him \"wiping back the tears\".They all then celebrated in Times Square with greasy pizza and cheap champagne.\"We hadn't thought about the celebration part of it,\" he says. More The Boss features:It's a success story that seems relatively unblemished. A vague idea, pursued with little capital, that blew up into one of Australia's most prized tech exports. But Scott is adamant the ride hasn't always been smooth. \"It has taken 17 and a half years,\" he says, stressing the firm isn't an \"overnight success\".\"We've made mistakes along the way. We've launched products too late, recently we had to shut down a product that didn't make it in the market.\" But there is no doubting Scott's commitment to the business. While on his honeymoon in Africa he flew back to Sydney to deal with a problem at work.\"It did take me quite a few years to make it up to my wife,\" he says.Technology analyst Ray Wang of Constellation Research says that Scott and Mike's close friendship is a key factor behind Atlassian's success.\"People often look at Atlassian and say... this story is so good. It is because they have been friends for so long. They are stable, normal people.\"They're pragmatic, they know they got lucky.\" Scott says that he and Mike - who is also 39 and also has the co-chief executive job title - \"complement\" each other.As well as running the 3,000-employee company together, they are also neighbours in Australia's two most expensive homes. A hole in the fence between their Sydney harbourside mansions - Scott's cost more than A$70m - lets their kids crawl through to play together.Looking to the future, Mr Wang says that the pair's biggest battle will be fighting off unwanted advances. \"If someone made an offer for them at $50bn would they hold?\" he says, pointing to Microsoft, Oracle and IBM as possible suitors.Scott says his biggest challenge in the future is securing more employees with the skills that the company needs.To help do this he is working with the Australian government on how to best bring in more talent from overseas. He also wants to build a new technology precinct in Sydney, a hub he hopes will act as \"the lighthouse\" to attract people to Australia.","42":"About 120 jobs are to be lost after a rail maintenance company confirmed it is to close its Glasgow depot.The owners of Gemini Rail Services in Springburn, the former Knorr-Bremse depot, had been consulting on the closure since last December.The Springburn depot carries out service, maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrades on trains for ScotRail.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was \"extremely disappointed\" by the news.The company has blamed the closure on falling orders.Speaking at First Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I know this will be a very concerning time for workers and their families.\"However, and I want to stress this point, we believe consideration does still need to be given to potential options for keeping the site open.\"There will be a further meeting of stakeholders at the end of this month to discuss the way forward.\"Ms Sturgeon added that staff had worked to complete on vehicles leased to ScotRail until July this year and Gemini Rail had retained the lease until March next year.She said: \"That means there is time to work with industry with a view to repurposing the site for future rail use.\"And, to that end, Scottish Enterprise has already engaged independent financial advice in reviewing Gemini Rail's model for the site.\"Ms Sturgeon was replying to a question from SNP MSP Bob Doris, whose constituency covers the Springburn site.He described the announcement of 120 redundancies and the looming closure as \"a devastating blow for a skilled and dedicated workforce\".Mr Doris also accused Gemini Rail of being \"inflexible and uncooperative\".Last year, the company said the closure proposal was \"a result of increasingly changing and challenging market conditions which are outside of our control\".A spokesman added: \"It is very clear, as it has been for some time, that numbers of pre-privatisation rolling stock which have been the cornerstone of business for many years, are in severe decline. \"","43":"Control of one of Britain's biggest government contractors, Interserve, has moved to a new company after administrators were appointed.It comes after shareholders rejected a rescue deal for the company, which has 45,000 UK staff, and 68,000 globally.Under a pre-arranged agreement, administrators EY were installed and the assets moved immediately to a group controlled by Interserve's lenders.Interserve insisted that the deal would protect services and jobs.The company cleans schools and hospitals, runs catering and probation services, and manages construction projects.On Friday, shareholders voted 59.38% against a rescue plan to address Interserve's mounting debt pile.The plan would have seen their stake reduced to just 5%, with lenders being handed the lion's share of the business. But after the vote, Interserve said that \"in the absence of any viable alternative\" rescue plan it would formally apply to the High Court to go into administration. EY was appointed under a so-called pre-pack administration, an insolvency procedure in which a company arranges to move its assets to a another owner before administrators are officially appointed.It meant that Interserve could avoid a Carillion-style collapse. However, investors have seen the value of their shares wiped out under the financial restructuring.The lenders who are now in control of Interserve Group include banks RBS and HSBC, and investors Emerald Asset Management and Davidson Kempner Capital.In a statement, EY administrator Hunter Kelly said: \"This transaction secured the jobs of 68,000 employees, the majority of whom work in the UK, as well as ensuring there was no disruption to the vital public services that Interserve provides to the UK Government.\"Debbie White, chief executive of Interserve Group, said: \"Interserve is fundamentally a strong business and with a competitive financial platform in place we see significant opportunities ahead as a best-in-class partner to the public and private sector.\"A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: \"We welcome this announcement. It brings the company the stability required for it to compete for future business and continue to deliver good value public services for the taxpayer.\"Interserve accumulated debt after construction project delays and a failed energy-from-waste project in Derby and Glasgow. However, the GMB union said earlier on Friday that Interserve's problems, which come after the failure of Carillion last year, showed it was \"time to turn the tide on the disastrous experiment\" of outsourcing public services.Kevin Brandstatter, the union's national officer, said: \"Ministers have learnt absolutely nothing from the Carillion fiasco and are hell-bent on outsourcing public sector contracts.\"Shambolic mismanagement is putting jobs put on the line and services in jeopardy. Our public services can't go on like this.\"Although Interserve's contracts are expected to continue, there is still concern for jobs in the supply chain.The National Federation of Builders (NFB) said there would be thousands of workers wondering whether they still have a job, and called for changes in the way the government hands out contracts to big national companies. Richard Beresford, chief executive of the NFB, said it was time to reform \"the procurement process from its foundations to ensure that more regional contractors can compete and win work\".In addition to helping smaller companies, it would \"spread risk across fiscally responsible businesses who reinvest profits and are not bound by shareholders,\" he said.The outsourcing firm is one of the UK's largest public services providers.  The firm started in dredging and construction, and from there has diversified into a wide range of services, such as healthcare and catering, for clients in government and industry.It sells services, including probation, cleaning and healthcare, and is involved in construction projects.Interserve is the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 \"medium-low risk offenders\" for the Ministry of Justice.Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5's Junction 6 near Worcester, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water.Hospital contracts include a a \u00a335m contract at King George Hospital in east London for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance.","44":"Levi Strauss will be worth about $6.5bn (\u00a35bn) when the denim-maker rejoins the stock market after 34 years away.Shares in the inventor of the blue jean have been priced at $17 each, just above the target range of $14-16.Levi's has sold $623m worth of shares to institutional investors before allowing the public to buy stock in the 166-year old company on Thursday.The Haas family, descendants of the founder Levi Strauss, have sold shares worth around  $357m.The company will be listed under the symbol LEVI on the New York Stock Exchange and the stock has been priced at the top end of a $14 to $16 range.Levi's wants to continue to grow the company from men's jeans to more products for women as well as expanding its tops business.The firm also said: \"We believe we have a significant opportunity to deepen our presence in key emerging markets, such as China, India and Brazil, to drive long-term growth.\"Jeans have regained their popularity in recent years after the \"althleisure\" trend when people opted to wear jogging bottoms and leggings instead of denim.In 2017-18, global sales of jeans expanded by 4.3%, according to Euromonitor International, a market research provider.In the US, after four years of falling demand, sales rose by 2.2%. Founder Levi Strauss moved to San Francisco in 1853 during the California gold rush, opening a dry goods business. But he struck gold when in 1873 he and a partner received a patent on using rivets to make clothes - which increased their durability.","45":"London's trade guilds date back a thousand years and have billions of pounds in assets. But have they forgotten one of their original purposes - to spend money on the public good?Among the glass skyscrapers of London's financial district, and ancient centre, are nestled some very grand-looking low-rise halls, and a clue to the home of some of the city's more unlikely pockets of wealth.Livery companies, once a combination of lobbying organisations, regulators and trade unions, are now quite different organisations, focused also on fellowship, education and charity. They represented the old industries that used to dominate the city. Many have names which are easy to recognise, such as the Butchers, who can trace their beginnings back to the year 975, and the Fishmongers. Others bear the names of lost trades, like the Mercers and Bowyers, who traded cloth and made longbows. All would set standards for their goods and often held exclusive rights over their trade in the city, thus wielding political power. The other side of their work was welfare and charity: funerals for deceased members, hospitals, and homes for the poor.Today, they sit on billions of pounds of assets, donated by members over many centuries, including the fortune of Dick Whittington, the former lord mayor. They were ordered as long ago as 1884, after a Royal Commission's investigation, to spend more on the public good or risk their existence. But did they? And are they now?David Ferris is a member of the Vintners - or Worshipful Company of Vintners, to give it its full title - and very much a fan of the companies' history and potential. But he thinks they are not.\"What I like best about them is these are ancient institutions, well alive in our midst, with wonderful old traditions,\" he says. \"They are cultural gems.\"However, he says, many of the most ancient have forgotten one of their prime reasons for existence from medieval times: the public good.\"They became gentlemen's clubs generally from about 1700,\" he says, \"and they have a great deal of wealth.\"It's the older institutions that Mr Ferris feels may not be pulling their weight. Many have investments in companies listed on the stock market. Some have large land holdings. Among the richest are the Mercers, which owns a number of blocks in Covent Garden. In fact, the Mercers and Goldsmiths are the 55th and 73rd largest landlords in London respectively, according to Datscha, a commercial property data firm. Together, they are bigger landowners in the city than supermarket chain Sainsbury's or the National Grid.But the companies do not have to offer accounts for public inspection, and many older ones do not. Still, public records partially covering eight companies and their charities showed \u00a31.1bn of assets, BBC research found. Mr Ferris estimates the 110 livery companies in total might have assets worth at least \u00a35bn.His own livery, the Vintners, spent \u00a3210,000 of its 2017 expenditure of \u00a32.1m on charitable giving, according to its annual review. This is too low, says Mr Ferris.Although there are no rules the companies must follow when it comes to charitable spending, the Vintners told the BBC a better figure to look at was its income, of which it spent 20% on charity, and that it aimed to increase its charitable endowment over time. It said that it let out its hall to charities for free, and that doing so has raised \u00a32.5m in the last three years.Mr Ferris has raised his concerns before. He says he was suspended from events at his company for five years and was ordered to \"cease to question the company's governance and administration in any way\" in a letter seen by the BBC. He won't, he says. And so his suspension continues. The company declined to comment.Each company has different aims and varying relevance in industry, so it would be foolish to lump all livery companies together when it comes to their performance.The Haberdashers and Merchant Taylors, for instance, support schools that bear their names. The Gunmakers tests firearms for safety.The Goldsmiths still has a large role in London's jewellery trade, where its Assay Office hallmarks precious metals, and it supports apprentices.Castro Smith, a jeweller who hand-makes rings, says of the Goldsmiths' role in today's industry: \"It [plays] a massive part, especially in training new people. It takes a long time, this sort of skill.\"They help financially, and in training, and it's a hub, an umbrella, a network.\"For the newer livery companies, it's a different picture still. Tapping a long history and sense of permanence gives the company a base from which to attract donors for their charities, and a sense of credibility. They are transparent, chatty, and keen to show their works. And many, such as the Arts Scholars, are careful to keep company money - raised from members - separate from funds raised for charitable ends. \"We do encourage education. That's really [our] mainstay,\" says Georgina Gough, Upper Warden of the Arts Scholars, the youngest livery company. It brings together academics, experts and dealers.For David Ferris, though, the older guilds must reform themselves. Their secrecy may not be helping them. What goes on in meetings of their courts - a governing committee similar to a modern company's board - is kept confidential, Mr Ferris says. It is also usual to become a member through patrimony - literally, because your father was a member. Newer and more forward-thinking companies say they try to avoid this.\"We need to remember that the source of our assets is the benevolence of people in medieval times,\" says Mr Ferris. \"They would be deeply shocked if they found out only a paltry amount was going to the public good.\"","46":"Honda UK is closing its Swindon plant by 2021, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan are also cutting production and jobs. So what's going on?Honda's Swindon plant is the UK's fourth-largest car factory. Honda Civic hatchbacks are made there. The model was the third most widely produced car in the UK in 2017, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The Swindon plant was established in 1985. But in recent years, it has operated at less than full capacity, citing falling demand from Europe. That caused Honda to suspend a production line with a capacity of 100,000 units in 2014. Japanese car producers, including Nissan, have said that Brexit uncertainty is not helping them \"plan for the future\". Nissan recently opted to build the next X-Trail model in Japan, rather than in Sunderland. But, Honda said that the plant closure in Swindon wasn't related to the UK's decision to leave the European Union. It said that restructuring would bring it closer to key markets such as China or the US. In a statement, Business Secretary Greg Clark echoed that it was \"a commercial decision\" for the company. Manufacturing companies rely on complex supply chains across Europe, allowing them to trade parts and produce cars \"just in time\" for deliveries. Industry figures have suggested that any additional tariffs placed on car exports after Brexit could negatively affect business. A tariff is a tax paid on goods crossing borders. They have also called for clarity for EU automotive workers in the UK. The SMMT estimates that 10% of people employed in the car industry are from elsewhere in the EU. Another thing affecting car manufacturers is a new trade deal between the EU and Japan that came into force in February. It will see tariffs on cars exported from Japan to Europe reduced to zero over the next 10 years.In a recent report, consulting firm LMC Automotive estimated that more than 730,000 cars built in the UK in 2018 were for Nissan, Toyota and Honda - nearly half of all light vehicles produced. That could encourage Japanese companies, such as Honda, to redirect jobs and investment back home, leaving UK car manufacturing at risk. The director of global production forecast at LMC also said that if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal, cars made in Japan could, under the new EU-Japan trade deal, end up costing less to import into the EU than those produced in the UK. Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) confirmed in January that it would be cutting 4,500 jobs, with most coming from its UK workforce.It said that it was facing a different challenge in the Asian market: a sales slowdown in China.Passenger vehicle wholesales fell by 17.7% year-on-year to 2.02 million units, according to the latest figures from China's Association of Automobile Manufacturers. For 2018 as a whole, sales dropped by 4.1% - the first annual decrease since the early 1990s. Analysts have said US-China trade tensions could also make 2019 a challenging year for car companies.The two countries have been locked in an escalating trade war, imposing duties on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. In 2018, sales of new diesel cars in the UK fell by nearly 30%, according to the SMMT. The government had previously introduced tax breaks on diesel cars, when Gordon Brown was chancellor, but sales have been falling since 2016. Prof David Bailey, from Aston University, in Birmingham, said that fewer diesel cars were being purchased for two main reasons: the environment and consumer confusion.The Volkswagen \"diesel-gate\" scandal showed that many diesel cars were producing higher levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) on the road than in laboratory tests. Nitrogen oxides are associated with breathing difficulties. Diesel cars typically produce less CO2 than petrol vehicles. But with an increased focus on air quality in urban areas and on NOx as a contributor to pollution in cities, diesel is facing a backlash.In the UK, diesel cars that fail to meet the latest emissions standards now face an extra charge, while a number of European countries, including the UK, have announced bans on both new diesel and petrol vehicles in the future.With doubts over the resale value of diesel cars, taxation and where they might be able to be driven, Prof Bailey added, consumer confusion had dragged on sales.Honda said the decision to close its Swindon manufacturing plant was down to changes in the car industry and the need to launch electric and hybrid vehicles. The global stock of electric cars rose to more than three million in 2017, up from 14,260 in 2010, according to the International Energy Agency.Jim Holder, editorial director of What Car? magazine, told BBC News the UK played a \"relatively small part\" in their production. JLR builds the hybrid Range Rover at its factory in Solihull, West Midlands, while Toyota produces hybrid versions of the Corolla at its plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire.Nissan manufactures the Leaf electric car at its plant in Sunderland. It was the best selling electric vehicle in Europe in 2018, with 40,000 made in Sunderland and sold across the continent. But, relatively low sales of the vehicles in the UK, the fall in the value of the pound and cuts to government grants for buyers could make manufacturers build electric cars elsewhere, Mr Holder said.China is generally seen as the world leader in electric vehicle production, as well as the largest market for cars.The Chinese government has encouraged production. And rules introduced in 2019 banned setting up companies that make only combustion-engine cars. The new guidelines also mean major manufacturers could be punished for failing to meet quotas for zero-emission and low-emission cars.In September 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May pledged \u00a3106m for research and development in zero-emission vehicles, new batteries and low-carbon technology.But consumer take-up of plug-in cars is now falling behind the EU average, according to the latest figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The government has said it wants to make the UK \"the best place in the world\" to own an electric vehicle.However, in 2018, it ended grants for new plug-in hybrids and the subsidy for purely electric cars was reduced from \u00a34,500 to \u00a33,500.In a recent report, the chair of Parliament's Business Select Committee Rachel Reeves criticised the decision to remove subsidies for less polluting cars, as well as the lack of charging points in the UK.And with relatively high purchase costs and many unknown factors surrounding the UK's charging infrastructure, motorists may need more persuasion to make the switch.    ","47":"A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a man who was stabbed while trying to defuse a fight.Zakaria Bukar Sharif Ali, 26, was attacked outside the Rolling Stock bar in Hackney, east London, in November.A 35-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and violent disorder.A 18-year-old woman had previously been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender but was bailed pending further inquiries.There were 132 murders in London in 2018, the highest rate for a decade.","48":"Standard Chartered is putting aside $900m (\u00a3690m) for potential fines involving investigations in Britain and the US.The money will cover separate investigations into breaches of US sanctions and foreign exchange trading issues.It also covers a \u00a3102.2m fine from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority related to financial crime controls.The provision will be included in the bank's results due next week.The bank, which is listed in London and Hong Kong, warned last year that continuing investigations by the US and UK regulators could have a \"substantial financial impact\".\"Standard Chartered's 2018 fourth quarter results will include a provision totalling USD900 million for potential penalties relating to the... US investigation and FCA decision, and for previously disclosed investigations relating to FX trading issues,\" the bank said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.The Financial Times reported in October that the bank could face a $1.5bn fine from US regulators for alleged sanction breaches involving Iran-based clients of its Dubai branch.Standard Chartered shares listed in Hong Kong fell more than 1% earlier, according to Reuters.","49":"Senior Brazilian politicians have called for Vale SA to be held to account for last week's dam disaster, as anger grows towards the mining firm.Brazil's Vice-President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o said those to blame should be punished, and a top prosecutor said executives could be held personally responsible.Vale, which owns the complex, says safety procedures were followed. Firefighters say 60 people are now confirmed dead after a sea of mud engulfed a canteen and nearby houses.Some 192 people have been rescued near the south-eastern town of Brumadinho but nearly 300 are still missing. Rescuers say they are very unlikely to find more survivors.The cause of the dam burst remains unclear. Shares in Vale, the world's largest iron ore producer, fell by more than 20% on the Sao Paulo stock exchange on Monday.Search operations were suspended for hours on Sunday amid fears that a separate dam, also owned by Vale, was at risk of giving way in the area.Vice-President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, who is standing in for President Jair Bolsonaro as he undergoes surgery, said the government would need to investigate and punish those found responsible for the disaster.He added that the government would set up a working group to look at the company's management.\"If there was malpractice, recklessness or negligence on the part of someone inside the company, that person has to answer criminally,\" O Globo website quoted him as saying.Meanwhile top prosecutor Raquel Dodge said it was important to hold the company \"strongly responsible\".The mayor of the state capital Belo Horizonte, Alexandre Kalil, said \"Vale's board of directors should be in jail\".The comments came after state prosecutors said they had frozen a total of 11bn reais ($2.9bn; \u00a32.2bn) of assets belonging to Vale.Brumadinho Mayor Avimar de Melo Barcelos has also criticised authorities in the state of Minas Gerais, which he blamed for poor oversight.Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the company had followed safety recommendations by international experts.\"I followed the technicians' advice and you see what happened. It didn't work,\" he said in a TV interview. Mr Schvartsman promised \"to go above and beyond any national or international standards... We'll create a cushion of safety far superior to what we have today to guarantee this never happens again.\"A statement by the company on Sunday said the dam had passed stability tests in June and September of last year. It reiterated that safety at the site had been in accordance with international best practice.The company also says it has suspended payouts to shareholders and executive bonuses.Firefighters said 292 employees, contractors and residents were still missing. So far 19 of the 60 dead have been identified.The chances of pulling any survivors from the mud are now very low, said Lieutenant Pedro Aihara, the spokesman for the rescue operations in Brumadinho.\"It's very difficult for us to deal with the pain of the relatives and their anxiety,\" he said. \"But you may rest assured that we are doing all we can, as though we were looking for our own parents.\"The dam break caused a sea of muddy sludge to bury the site's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch, before engulfing nearby houses, vehicles and roads.Access to the areas is difficult - in some places, the mud is up to 15m (49ft) deep. Search teams have been using helicopters and earth-moving machinery. \"I still have hope,\" N\u00e9lia Mary Fonseca told the BBC as she waited for details about her husband, Adriano, who worked as a contractor at the site.An Israeli group of engineers, doctors and members of the navy's underwater missions unit has joined the efforts. Unlike dams used for water, tailings dams - like that in Brumadinho - are used to store by-products from mining operations. There have been a number of high-profile disasters involving tailings dams in recent years - and there have been calls, including from the UN, to institute better safety and building regulations around them. In November 2015, a dam owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton, burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais. It killed 19 people in what was considered Brazil's worst environmental disaster at the time. After a lengthy court case, the companies reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais ($1.8bn) with the Brazilian government.","50":"Human extinction may be the stuff of nightmares but there are many ways in which it could happen.Popular culture tends to focus on only the most spectacular possibilities: think of the hurtling asteroid of the film Armageddon or the alien invasion of Independence Day. While a dramatic end to humanity is possible, focusing on such scenarios may mean ignoring the most serious threats we face in today's world. And it could be that we are able to do something about these.  In 1815 an eruption of Mount Tambora, in Indonesia, killed more than 70,000 people, while hurling volcanic ash into the upper atmosphere. It reduced the amount of sunlight hitting the surface of the Earth, triggering what has become known as the \"year without a summer\".Lake Toba, at the other end of Sumatra, tells a still more sinister story. It was formed by a truly massive super-volcanic eruption 75,000 years ago, the impact of which was felt around the world. It has been suggested that the event led to dramatic population decline in early humans, although this has recently been questioned. But while the prospect of a super-volcanic eruption is terrifying, we should not worry too much. Super-volcanoes and other natural disasters, such as an asteroid striking Earth or a star exploding in our cosmic neighbourhood, are no more likely in 2019 than any other year. And that is not very likely.The same cannot be said for many global threats induced by people.For example, the World Health Organization and the World Economic Forum both listed climate change and its effects as one of their top risks for 2019. Recent UN talks heard climate change was already \"a matter of life and death\" for many regions. While many, including Sir David Attenborough, believe it could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of \"much of the natural world\".The threats are complex and diverse, from killer heatwaves and rising sea levels to widespread famines and migration on a truly immense scale.More stories like thisAlso increasing are the potential risks from novel technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). The scenarios range from increasingly sophisticated cyber-weapons that could hold an entire nation's data to ransom, to autonomous algorithms that could unwittingly cause a stock-market crash. Another threat is the possibility of a nuclear war. While many focus on rising tensions between global powers, new technologies may also be making us less safe. This is because of both the \"entanglement\" of nuclear and conventional weapons and the risk that AI could help unleash nuclear war.Another risk that may be increasing is that of global pandemics. Influenza, for example, is thought to kill an average of 700,000 people and cost the global economy $500bn (\u00a3391bn) per year.Increasingly dense and mobile human populations have the potential to see new influenza strains spread easily. And this raises concerns about a future outbreak like the 1918 Spanish Flu, which killed up to 50 million people. However, widespread vaccination programmes and other disease prevention measures help reduce this risk.How to calculate the chance of an existential riskWhile these threats are real, the greatest danger we face in 2019, when viewed from a global perspective, probably lies elsewhere. With almost eight billion people living on Earth, we are increasingly reliant upon global systems to sustain us. These range from the environment that provides us with food, water, clean air and energy, to the global economy that turns these into goods and services.Yet, from declining levels of biodiversity to overextended infrastructure and supply chains, many of these systems are already stressed to breaking point. And rapid climate change is only making things worse.Given this, it may be that global risks should not be defined by the size of the disaster that caused them, but by their potential to disrupt these vital systems. The potential is hinted at in recent examples of cascading effects.The 2010 eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano killed no-one but closed air traffic over Europe for six days. And, in 2017, the relatively unsophisticated WannaCry ransomware attack shut down parts of the NHS and other organisations around the world.Since almost everything we rely on also depends on a functioning electrical, computing and internet system, anything that would damage this - from a solar flare to a high atmosphere nuclear explosion - could cause very widespread harm. There may, however, be new ways to reduce this risk.There is an old story of King Canute of the Danes commanding the sea to retreat. He knew he would be unable to hold back the tide and a similar sense of powerlessness can easily overtake us when we consider potential future catastrophes. However, the truth is that the Danes have been pushing back their shoreline for generations: building dykes and draining marshes to protect themselves from the oncoming tide.Sometimes it is better to protect ourselves by thinking of ways to make humanity more resilient to disasters that are to come.And this could give us the best way of ensuring that 2019 - and beyond - are safe years for humanity.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.

I've been asked to work for two full weeks in exchange for the company sharing the work on social media.\" Stacey MacNaught is a self-employed online marketing consultant with over a decade of experience. Yet she's still inundated with requests to work for free \"for exposure\".\"One agency asked me to work for free two days a month to help them keep a client. \"And if they saved the client and got a new contract, they promised to outsource the work to me - as long as I cut my day rate by 50%.\"I went through my last 12 enquiries and two of them were asking for work for free, so that's one in six.\"She is not alone. As the number of people in self-employment working for themselves rises, there's also a growing concern that many are being pressured into unpaid work.Alisa Rosenbaum used to work as an architect and says she was constantly asked to do unpaid hours: \"[They] string you along, expecting work for free on the basis of 'the next big job will be yours'.\"I had a client phone up and suggest that I 'needed to do this work' for him because six months ago he paid me and didn't really need the drawing he paid me to do. So now I had to do more work for him... for free.\" There were 3.3 million people working for themselves in 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics. That rose to 4.8 million by 2017. Today, one in seven workers is self-employed.Research carried out by IPSE, the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed, shows that 43% of such workers had given away their time, rising to 86% of people in creative industries.\"We need to get to a point where that is just not seen as okay anymore,\" comments Jonathan Lima-Matthews, senior policy adviser at IPSE. He does not accept that unpaid work can be acceptable in order to build a portfolio or impress a potential new client. \"It needs to be called out for what it is - it's unfair. Everybody's work has value and it's right that they should be paid for that. Its common practice in certain sectors to ask for unpaid work but that doesn't mean it's okay.\"Also, it's not great for social mobility because those without family support can't afford to gain that experience by working for free.\"IPSE wants the Office of the Small Business Commissioner to be granted more powers to crack down on repeat offenders, including being able to ask businesses to state how often they ask for free work.The commissioner Paul Uppal told BBC 5 live's Wake Up To Money programme that he is aware of the issue and wants to do more. He's calling for self-employed people to report such requests to him so he can act.\"People are hesitant about coming forward for fear of losing future work but we really want people to come forward. \"That can be anonymously if they wish, but ideally we want them to have as much of a candid conversation about this issue as possible so that they can give us the ammunition to fire the bullets on this issue.\"The main statutory power we have is to name and shame.\"Of course people can always just say no to requests for freebies, but some workers say that a culture of free work makes it harder for everyone.Tracey MacNaught says: \"It absolutely devalues the work. If there are enough people prepared to work for free then other freelancers who need to earn a living are going to struggle to get work. \"If businesses believe they can choose to not pay for something and get the same then why would they pay for it?\"The Freelancer Club, a membership organisation for the self-employed, has asked both the self-employed and companies to sign a code of conduct promising never to work for free or ask people to do so.Rob Birnie, the animator behind DBM Motion Graphics, says he has the best response to the weekly requests he gets for freebies in exchange for 'exposure'.\"My stock answer now is 'just let me check if my mortgage provider will let me pay them with that exposure that you're giving me and if they will then I'll get straight back to you.'\"As the way people work continues to evolve and the Small Business Commissioner takes an interest, the fairness of unpaid gigs could soon come in for far greater scrutiny.","52":"Markets in the UK and US have tumbled with analysts attributing the drop to growing fears of a global slowdown. The FTSE 100 saw its worst day of trading this year, closing 2% lower. In the US, the three main indexes ended between 1.9% and 2.5% lower. The falls came after figures showed eurozone manufacturing growing at its weakest pace in five years in March.Combined with the Federal Reserve's cautious tone on interest rates earlier this week, investors took fright.On Wednesday, the US central bank said that it did not expect to raise interest rates for the rest of the year amid slower economic growth.The Dow Jones Index fell 1.8%, the S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq lost 2.5%, marking the worst performance for all three indexes in over three months.Diane Swonk, chief economist for Grant Thornton, said news that manufacturing in Germany - seen as the powerhouse of Europe - contracted last month, coupled with the continuing uncertainty over Brexit and the decision to put US interest rate rises on hold had combined to make investors nervous.\"There's a flurry of information which has raised risks to the downside. All that is finally hitting the market with a reality check,\" she said.She added financial markets were \"not as nuanced as people would like\", and tended to overreact to both good and bad news. Meanwhile, an unusual move in the US bond markets also made investors fearful. The bonds, known as Treasuries in the US, are issued as a form of borrowing by governments to fund spending.For the first time in over 10 years, the rate of return (yield) on three-month US bonds rose above 10-year yields, something which is seen as an indicator that a recession could be coming. \"Typically investors expect to be compensated more to wait longer to get their money back. So a ten-year US Treasury bond is likely to pay more than a three-month US Treasury bond. \"The problem right now is that investors are willing to be paid less to wait longer - an indication that they don't have much confidence in the long term outlook for the US economy,\" says BBC New York business correspondent Michelle Fleury.Uh oh. Gap between 3 month and 10 year US Treasury yield just inverted for the first time since 2007. An inversion is seen as a powerful signal of recession. Pretty much every recession has been preceded by an inverted yield curve per @sffedEnd of Twitter post  by @BizFleuryA central bank study in the US found that the bond markets had successfully foreshadowed all five US recessions since 1955.But Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, said she did not think a US recession was imminent.\"Globally there are more concerns. I don't think this is a cause for panic,\" she added. ","53":"As a wave of bankruptcies hits the retail sector, workers want to know why their bosses are coming out ahead.The fall of Sears, once an icon of American retail might, has hit Bruce Miller hard.The 56-year-old started at the department store out of high school, rising to be a senior auto technician.But since Sears closed his New Jersey location last April, he has lost his health insurance and his house. Now his pension is at risk.For Mr Miller's bosses, however, fortunes look brighter. Veteran journalist Michelle Celarier has estimated that longtime Sears chairman and former chief executive Eddie Lampert has made nearly $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) off his investment in the company, thanks to performance fees, dividends and other payments.Meanwhile, its top 340 executives were collectively granted a potential $25m in bonuses in December, just months after the firm declared bankruptcy.\"It's utterly ridiculous to me,\" says Mr Miller, who is now relying on odd jobs to help pay bills. \"How can you reward somebody for driving a business into the ground?\"Laments like Mr Miller's have surfaced repeatedly in recent years, amid a wave of bankruptcies in the US retail sector that has claimed household names such as Toys R Us, Payless Shoe Source and Nine West.Much of the blame has focused on the disruption caused by online shopping. But analysts say many of the firms have another feature in common: investors who took control of the retailers, loaded them with debt, and extracted fees, dividends and other assets for their own benefit.Sears, for example, spent millions purchasing its own stock - inflating prices in a win for shareholders such as Mr Lampert, who became chair of the firm in 2005, after arranging its merger with Kmart.Sears later borrowed more than $2bn from his hedge fund, ESL Investments, as it struggled to remain in operation. It also sold off parts of the business, including hundreds of properties and the mail-order catalogue Lands End, to companies affiliated with Mr Lampert.Sears is now a shadow of its former self, having closed almost 3,000 stores and cut more than 250,000 jobs since 2007. Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, says those deals limited Sears' ability to invest in the future - just as the need to compete with online shopping made those investments critical.That is a pattern seen repeatedly in the recent retail failings, she said.\"They want to blame everything that happens on Amazon,\" she says. \"The fact that they have starved these organisations of resources ... that's the real story.\"ESL has defended its actions, saying \"all transactions were done in good faith, on fair terms\"  in order to keep Sears in business.It said it was confident that its process for reviewing deals for conflicts of interest was \"unimpeachable\".The firm is now offering to buy Sears out of bankruptcy for $5.2bn.  The plan could keep 425 stores open and retain up to 45,000 jobs. But several groups owed money have asked the court to reject the proposal, which is funded in part by forgiving some debt owed to his hedge fund. They cite concerns like those of Ms Appelbaum and Mr Miller's.\"ESL's current bid to 'save' the company is nothing but the final fulfilment of a years-long scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's and ESL's own pockets,\" attorneys for a group of unsecured creditors wrote.Outside court, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, has weighed in with similar questions, as have Sears workers.At a rally in New York this month, they accused Mr Lampert of driving the firm to failure and asked the court to require that money be set aside for workers in the event of future layoffs, among other demands. \"We want to apply pressure in a big way,\" Mr Miller says. \"Somebody's going to have to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, we've got to fix this situation.'\"A similar campaign by Toys R Us workers last summer successfully shamed former private equity owners KKR and Bain Capital into creating a $20m severance fund.But that was an exception, contingent on those firms' largesse.Analysts said bankruptcy judges are often reluctant to challenge plans that would keep a business open - even in cases with as many potential conflicts of interest as Sears. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has taken a hands-off regulatory approach, even as issuance of loans to firms with weak credit soars to record levels, driven by strong investor demand for debt.Carrie Gleason, who helped organise the worker campaigns as a policy director for Organization United for Respect, says the Toys R Us bankruptcy marked a \"breaking point\" for broader awareness of the way business strategies contributed to retailer failings.But with retail's struggles expected to continue, more pressure is needed to bring change, Ms Gleason says.\"This is not going to be the last [bankruptcy],\" she says. \"They're going to keep coming and ultimately what we need are some new protections.\"","54":"Police in Brazil have arrested five people as part of an investigation into Friday's dam collapse in Brumadinho. At least 65 people died when sludge engulfed a company canteen and neighbouring residential buildings.  Prosecutors in Brazil say three of those arrested were officials from the mining company Vale, whose responsibilities included dealing with environmental impact licences.  Vale said it was co-operating with prosecutors.The company is the world's biggest producer of iron ore and nickel.Two engineers working for a subsidiary company were arrested in Sao Paulo. All five can be detained for 30 days and will be questioned by investigators in Belo Horizonte.Rescuers are continuing to search for survivors in Brumadinho.  Nearly 300 people are still missing and there is little hope they will be found alive.On Monday, protesters gathered outside Vale's corporate headquarters in Rio de Janeiro and daubed slogans including \"Murderers!\" on its walls.  In a statement following the arrests, Vale said: \"With regards to the warrants served this morning, Vale informs that it is fully co-operating with the authorities. \"Vale will continue to support the investigations in order to determine the facts, in addition to the unconditional support to the families.\"Vale's share price plunged by nearly 25% on Monday on the Brazilian stock market.  ","55":"Shares in Levi Strauss were flying off the shelves as the blue jeans company made its return to the stock market.The price shot higher immediately Wall Street opened, and closed up 31.8%, valuing the company at $8.7bn (\u00a36.7bn).The 166-year-old business, which struck gold when the founder patented the use of rivets in clothing, has about 5% of the global jeans market.Some money raised from the flotation will be used to broaden Levi's clothing range and expand into more countries.\"The IPO [initial public offering] is not a finish line, it's a new starting line for us,\" chief executive Chip Bergh told the BBC.\"I don't feel like my job is done. I came here to get this company turned around, to make the Levi's brand what it was when I was a kid, back the way I remembered it. There's still a lot of work ahead of us,\" he said.The flotation comes at a time when fashion experts say there is a new popularity in denim among consumers, driven by the resurgence of 1990s styles such as high-waist and pinstriped jeans.\"Denim continues to prove prevalent in streetwear and on the runway, so we're not expecting it to go anywhere any time soon,\" an analyst at retail analytics firm Edited said. \"That's why now is a great time for Levi's to capitalize on this momentum.\"Levi first went public in 1971. But after 14 years, it was taken private by the Haas family, the descendants of founder Levi Strauss, in a $1.6bn buyout. That saddled the company with big debts, something which Mr Bergh said weighed down the business for years.Shares for Thursday's IPO were priced at $17, above the expected range, in an offering that was heavily oversubscribed offering. At the close the price was $22.5.\"The company and the underwriters targeted a reasonable valuation and allowed the true investor demand to dictate price,\" said Jeff Zell, senior analyst at research firm IPO Boutique.The Haas family will retain 80% of voting control of the public company. Founder Levi Strauss moved to San Francisco in 1853 during the California gold rush, opening a dry goods business. In 1873 he and a partner received a patent on using rivets to make clothes more durable.Analysts said the success of the listing bodes well for investor appetite for other flotations planned this year, including Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, Airbnb and Slack.","56":"Ride-hailing firm Uber will list on the New York Stock Exchange, according to reports, in one of the most anticipated stock debuts of the year.The decision to opt for the Wall Street exchange over the tech-heavy Nasdaq was first reported by Bloomberg, citing sources.  It comes as smaller, ride-sharing rival Lyft prepares to list on the Nasdaq. Uber is expected to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in April and may be valued as high as $120bn (\u00a391.4bn). The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports it would list on the New York Stock Exchange.  Other major technology companies including Google, Apple and Facebook trade on the Nasdaq. But the New York Stock Exchange has secured some of world's biggest IPOs including Alibaba and General Motors. Uber's IPO come as investors have shown strong appetite for new stock listings. Shares in denim icon Levi Strauss surged on its return to the stock market after 34 years. The price shot higher immediately after Wall Street opened - and closed up 31.8% - valuing the company at $8.7bn. Analysts said the success of the listing bodes well for investor appetite for other flotations planned this year, including Pinterest, Airbnb, Slack and Uber. Uber has been controversial for disrupting the taxi industry in more than 60 countries.It continues to face opposition from both private hire drivers and regulators in several jurisdictions.The ride-hailing taxi app company has also faced legal action in the UK and US over its classification of drivers as self-employed contractors, rather than as workers.A series of scandals dogged Uber in 2017, including sexual harassment claims made by female employees, data breaches, the use of illicit software to thwart government regulators, and the forced resignation of its chief executive Travis Kalanick.","57":"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Jeff Lawson, co-founder and chief executive of US technology company Twilio.Jeff Lawson was all set to secure investment in his new start-up Twilio when suddenly people thought the world might be collapsing.Back on Monday, 15 September 2008, Jeff and his two co-founders walked into a meeting with potential investors in Silicon Valley.Getting the funding was supposed to be \"almost a formality\", remembers Jeff, who was 31 at the time.Unfortunately, US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed on the Sunday night, one of the most shocking moments of the then global financial crisis.\"We walk in, and it's like chequebooks closed,\" says Jeff. \"People were wondering: 'Is the world melting?!'\"My co-founders and I looked at each other and thought: 'Maybe this is a dumb idea. Maybe you know, maybe this is just stupid.'\"The idea that Jeff and colleagues Evan Cooke and John Wolthuis had was a software business that helps companies automate communications with their users, be it by text message, or telephone and video calls.Fast forward to today, and San Francisco-based Twilio is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and worth more than $14bn (\u00a310.5bn).With annual revenue of $650m in 2018, its thousands of customers include Uber, WhatsApp, Coca-Cola, AirBnB, Twitter, eBay, and UK retailer Marks & Spencer.So when you get a text message from your Uber driver, Twilio's technology probably handles that interaction. The same if you telephone M&S - Twilio's technology will route the call. Or if you get a notification via numerous firms' mobile phone apps.Back in September 2008 the success of Twilio was still a world away. After the funding had fallen though, Jeff says he felt as if the company - which they started work on in March of that year - was back at square one.But determined to carry on, he and his co-founders borrowed money from family and friends to get started on what techies refer to as the MVP - minimum viable product. As in, the most basic incarnation of their idea.When that first pot of money started to run out, Jeff - with the blessing of his wife Erica - sold their wedding presents.Twilio's first client was a man who had designed a website to help people find their missing mobile phone. You'd visit the site, input the number, pay a dollar, and it would ring your phone.Jeff and his colleagues made the process more automated. Hardly world-changing, but a client is a client.A big break came in November 2008 when Twilio decided to show off its technology by pranking the most influential tech blogger of that era, Michael Arrington, founder of tech news website TechCrunch.It did this by telephoning him a recording of the pop song Never Gonna Give You Up by UK singer Rick Astley. At the time there was a craze to play the song unexpectedly, a phenomenon that was given the term \"rickrolling\".The publicity Twilio gained caught the attention of record label Sony Music, which called Jeff the next day.\"There was a guy who was a manager of one of their bands,\" says Jeff, now 41.\"And he said: 'Look, we've been trying to have this little promotion where the band records a voicemail, and we blast it out to fans who opt into this. Can we build it?'\"I told him: 'Yeah sure, I've never heard of that idea.'\"With Sony Music on board as a client, Jeff was able to go back to the same investors who had previously turned him down. This time they said yes, and Twilio secured $1m of seed funding at the start of 2009.It went on to raise $261m in investment, and in 2016 it floated on the stock market. Today it has 16 offices in 10 countries, and 1,275 employees.Twilio's business model sees it charge companies for every communication with a customer. For a simple text message in the US the fee is $0.0075. That doesn't sound like much at all, but when a business is texting tens of millions of customers it can soon add up.Growing up in Detroit, Jeff's entrepreneurialism can be traced back to when, aged 13, he launched a video production company, despite knowing very little about it.\"My first event was a three-year-old's birthday party,\" he says. \"By the time I graduated high school I was doing full wedding videos, and I made $15,000 for that. So I graduated high school with a lot of money saved up.\"Also learning to code as a teenager, he wrote computer programs for his father's company, which provided the software for industrial printers.More The Boss features:Jeff then juggled doing a computer science and film and video course at the University of Michigan with business interests including running a company called Notes for Free. This offered college students a way to share notes and study material online.Senior jobs at ticketing firm StubHub and Amazon then followed, before the idea for Twilio was born.The company's success is down in part to its terrific timing - it emerged just as businesses were realising that customers, particularly the younger ones, would rather get a text message than have to make a phone call. Or if they did need to make a call, they were simply not prepared to sit on hold.However, it has not all been plain sailing for the business, with its shares slumping in 2016 and 2017 as it missed Wall Street's earnings targets.Alex Wilhelm, editor in chief of Crunchbase, a website that tracks tech investments, says: \"Starting in mid-2016 Twilio went into Wall Street purgatory, losing more than half its value and seeing its stock stagnate until early 2018.\"Since then the company has been on a tear, appreciating rapidly and drawing accolades from media and investors alike. Twilio now has to prove that its sky-high revenue multiple is not dangerously inflated and that it can increase profitability while growing into its $14bn valuation.\"On a day-to-day basis Jeff says that Twilio staff are encouraged to solve problems on their own, without the need for hand-holding by bosses.To counteract the possibility for reckless decision making, the company also tells employees that there should be \"no shenanigans\".It is more straightforward, Jeff argues, than a vague, loftier declaration like \"have integrity\".\"I know what the word integrity means,\" he says. \"But do I really know if what I'm doing right now has integrity? It can be hard to tell.\"But shenanigans you know, you know shenanigans.\"","58":"After surviving the Parkland school massacre in Florida in February 2018 Cameron Kasky helped lead a youth campaign for gun control. But the strain of his experiences - in the school, and in the media spotlight - left him anxious and depressed. A year later, writes the BBC's Tom Gillett, his focus is on dialogue with his former opponents.On 14 February 2018 a former pupil entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. After six minutes and 20 seconds of carnage, three teachers and 14 of Cameron Kasky's fellow students lay dead. The geography teacher Scott Biegel, whom Kasky had known well, died protecting his students from gunfire.When the shooting broke out, Kasky had been rushing to pick up his younger brother from a special needs class. Hustled into the nearest classroom, the brothers spent the remainder of the attack hiding in the dark, not knowing if the door would be opened by the shooter or a rescuer.There he stayed in touch with events outside via his mobile phone.\"I saw videos, when we were in the room, of people being killed. They were going round Snapchat,\" he says.\"It was very familiar to me. I grew up with these. I was born in 2000 - that was not long at all after Columbine,\" he says, referring to the Columbine school massacre the previous year, where 12 schoolchildren and a teacher were murdered by two teenage gunmen, who then killed themselves.As Kasky was to tweet after the attack: \"I am part of the Mass Shooting Generation, and it's an ugly club to be in.\"It was the reaction of the teenage Parkland pupils immediately after the events of that day that made the response to this attack unique.An outraged determination set in among Kasky and a small group of his friends.\"That day I said, 'We need to flip this narrative.' After all these shootings, you see such similar things. You see crying mothers talking about their children. You see people talking about how the shooter was just a nice boy - misunderstood. With only a few exceptions, so much of these shootings had the same exact response. A couple of lawmakers would get kids from the shooting to stand next to them, they'd sign some bill that did nothing and we'd be done. I said, 'We can't have Parkland be that city.'\"I wanted it to be that 20 years after the shooting when people thought of Parkland they didn't think of people crying, they thought of people in the worst possible situation standing up and standing for something that was bigger than them.\" Starting the night of the attack, Kasky and a handful of his classmates took to social media, demanding stricter gun control laws and the right to be able to go to school without the fear of being killed. As they typed and posted, the hashtag #NeverAgain went viral.\"I found myself frantically Facebook posting. It was what I knew how to do,\" he says. \"The next morning I was getting all these calls from reporters.\"The same thing happened to his friends.Cameron Kasky talks to Stephen Sackur on HARDtalk on BBC World Service radio on Wednesday 13 February and on BBC World News television on Thursday 14 February (click for transmission times)UK viewers can watch on the BBC News Channel or catch up later on the BBC iPlayerAs well as doing broadcast interviews, Kasky wrote online comment pieces and - a week after the attack - he took part in a televised town-hall event. Standing in front of a large crowd of his peers and neighbours, he confronted Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio over the money he had received from the National Rifle Association. \"Senator Rubio can you tell me right now that you would not accept a single NRA donation in the future?\" he demanded.The room exploded into chants and cheers. Kasky looked stunned and overwhelmed. He had just put one of the nation's most prominent politicians on the spot, live on national television.As momentum gathered behind the young campaigners, Kasky co-founded the group March For Our Lives and set about organising a demonstration in the nation's capital.Six weeks after the attack, on 24 March 2018, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Washington DC for the March For Our Lives protest. The Parkland students demanded a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and stricter background checks for those wishing to buy guns.The organisers estimated that 800,000 people attended the rally that day. Kasky's Twitter following rose to more than 400,000.But while the students succeeded in attracting popular support and media attention, the concrete legislative steps that they demanded have not materialised.In the month after the attack, Florida governor Rick Scott signed a bill that placed stricter age restrictions on gun purchases and provided funding for mental health services in the state. On a federal level, the so called \"bump stock\" which enables a rifle to be fired more rapidly has been banned. But their other demands have been resisted.As the first anniversary of the Parkland massacre approaches, Cameron is, despite this, sanguine about the movement's achievements.\"Whilst we haven't got all the legislative victories we want with gun control\u2026 at the end of the day, there is a victory in the sense that Parkland is not the city that you think of and you instantly think of people mourning and people running away from a problem,\" he says.\"I think when people hear of Parkland they think of something larger and stronger than the shooter.\"But he is also critical of himself, and the decisions he made in the immediate aftermath of the attack.Sitting in the living room of his suburban home near Miami, Cameron says he now feels that he was too confrontational.\"I think it showed that sometimes how we feel about things can get in the way of our objective thinking,\" he says.There is one statement he particularly regrets, a remark to Marco Rubio in the town hall debate:  \"Senator Rubio, it's hard to look at you and not look down the barrel on an AR-15 and not look at\u2026\" and here he named the shooter - something that the young campaigners quickly decided they would not do, to deny him the fame, or infamy, he may have sought. \"I regretted saying the name of the shooter to Senator Rubio and telling him I can't look at him without seeing the shooter. That's not true,\" he says.\"In many ways my confrontation with Senator Rubio was very positive, in a sense that it reminded a lot of people my age that politicians are just like anybody else - they are not these deities that you need to look up to as if they are our supreme leaders.\"But going about it\u2026 I did it in such a vitriolic way that I don't find it to have been very meaningful and productive.\"The activism that he and others threw themselves into in the days after the shooting was a way of dealing with the pain, he says, and the sense of helplessness. But the intense media spotlight also exacted a psychological toll.\"After the shooting, I found myself on television almost 24\/7 for a month or two and I found myself sky-rocketed to this position where so many people were looking at what I had to say and were listening to me,\" he says.\"I think the concept that I could make gun control happen was seductive. And I started to see myself as the person that could make gun control happen. As if it was me. Not as if it was a large push for legislative change in this country. I had this messiah-like concept that I could do this. And I got so high off of that.\"When all this was happening, Kasky was only 17, and he found it hard to deal with.\"I spent so long in front of cameras that I forgot how to be a person,\" he says.\"I spent so long feeling like I was an avatar. Feeling like my body was saying things and doing things - my mind was just cut off.\"And eventually, he says, everything caught up with him - and it was compounded, he says, by the mistakes he felt he made along the way. He struggles with depression and anxiety, he says.In the summer of 2018, Kasky embarked on a road trip to Texas where, in a change of direction, he actively sought the opinions of those who disagreed with him on gun control.\"I think the more you think about how right you are and how wrong everybody else is, the less you'll learn. A lot of people in this country get stuck in bubbles - especially because of social media.\"I'm very pro gun control\u2026 and when I'm with other people who are pro gun control I start to think, 'If you don't think this you must be a really bad person.' And then I met these people and I said, 'These people are not bad people.'\"If I vilify half the people in this country where is that going to bring me? I think there is so much that we can do if we all look at each other and say, 'Where can we agree?' Because that's normally where the most progress is made.\"Subsequently, last September, Kasky announced he was leaving the March For Our Lives group to focus on bipartisan dialogue.He is currently applying for college and plans to revive a podcast series, Cameron Kasky Knows Nothing - \"my journey towards understanding folks who disagree with me\" as he put it in the trailer.But what does he hope the legacy of the movement he co-founded will be?\"I think the thing that March For Our Lives did for this country was, we told a whole generation of kids, 'We need to start working together, we need to start thinking. And just because we are little, does not mean we are inadequate when it comes to being part of the conversation.'\" A photo of a student partying in blackface caused days of tension on the campus of Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, California.

Nick Newman, Chair of Cardiff Licensees Forum, said: \"The Wales-Ireland game is always special.\"Our Celtic cousins enjoy a party as much as us. So this will be five times bigger than a normal Saturday.\"We've been building to this obviously for some time. As soon as we beat England we kind of realised there was going to be an awful lot on this weekend.\"The kick off time really suits us tomorrow as people will be out early having some food and drink before the game and then they'll have the whole night to go.\"If I think back to 2005, I was running a big pub on St Mary Street and we actually had to have an emergency delivery at six in the morning.\"Some 50 additional flights have brought thousands of Ireland fans to south Wales on St Patrick's Day weekend meaning many hotels and guest houses in the capital are full.However with rain and strong wind expected on Saturday, Cardiff council have confirmed that they will not be facilitating a big screen this year.The council said the weather forecast \"creates too much risk\" for such an open-air event. A spokesperson added: \"Whatever the weather, the capital will afford every visitor a fantastic welcome on a day which will be a huge boost to local businesses.\"The Principality Stadium roof will be open for the match.Up to 275,000 people are expected in Cardiff on Saturday, when Wales take on Ireland with hopes of a Grand Slam victory.There will be a full city centre road closure between 11.15am and 5.45pm, with kick off taking place at 2.45pm.

Since its heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, denim has had a rocky ride. Robert Burke, a retail and fashion consultant, says: \"The jean industry in general had been heavily affected by how strong the athleisure and athletic market had become. \"Leggings, yoga pants, things like that had been chipping away and in many ways replaced the jean business as a category.\" That trend is turning around.In 2017-18, global sales of jeans grew by 4.3%, according to Euromonitor International, a market research provider.The change is most pronounced in the US where, after four years of falling demand, sales rose by 2.2%. And Levi's financials reflect that. In its US Securities and Exchange Commission filing regarding the upcoming flotation, Levi's turnover has grown from $4.4bn four years ago to $5.5bn.Alex Badia, style director at fashion industry magazine WWD, says that the 1980s, as well as the early 1990s, are eras that people are looking back to and says \"we have been seeing a sort of return to what we call the relaxed denim\".He says: \"In the fashion industry, after years of distressed, extremely tight-fitting jeans the relaxed jeans look really new.\"Eric Schiffer, chairman and chief executive at investment firm Patriarch Organisation, says the trend is \"being driven by millennials who want to touch history, people like you and me who want to step back in time and, you could argue, Generation Z, who are fascinated by that time and its music\". But, like the plot of a bad horror film, bringing something back from the dead has its consequences and in this case, it is the \"mom\" and the \"dad\" jean.Spotted on the likes of models Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Hailey Baldwin, the \"mom\" jean is typically high-waisted with a relax leg. The paternal version is also high-waisted and shapeless. Mr Burke says: \"It started really with models and influencers wearing them, particularly fashion models and then it started gaining more and more visibility.\"It fits into a whole kind of mum\/dad trend which also includes really big bulky, ugly sneakers. We say \"ugly\" tongue in cheek but it resonated because for the younger consumer it is new.\"While revisiting this style may not appeal to those who lived through it the first time around, Simeon Siegel, senior retail analyst at Nomura, says it is the duty of a new generation to annoy the one that came before. \"Fashion has to cause gut reaction,\" he says. \"And if a certain decade is not abhorred by a prior decade's fashion it means they did something wrong.\"The 501, however, is perhaps a cut above \"ugly\" denim rivals. The jean has been around for 146 years and has been left virtually unchanged Mr Burke says: \"There are few iconic brands whether it be a Hanes white t-shirt or a Levi 501. They may not be fashion at different times but they're iconic and staples and that's where the 501 fits in.\"Mr Badia says for the younger people who are discovering the 501, there are also different washes that are coming back.He explains: \"If you remember the show 'Friends' or even '90210' - if you see the 90210 posters, they are all posing in jeans and white shirts.\"If you think of Rachel or Monica or any of the characters in 'Friends', a lot of the times they were wearing jeans and a lot of the jeans they were wearing were basically these early 1990s washes that are a 501 but are a lighter blue, not the dark blue. \"That is the blue that is happening. That is the Levi's blue, that is the 501 blue.\"It seems, therefore, that now is the perfect time for Levi's to launch its shares again on the stock market.\"There is a lot of enthusiasm behind Levi's,\" says Mr Schiffer. \"And that is one of the rationales for delivering on the [share sale].\"However, he believes that Levi's is only a short or medium-term investment because, like everything in fashion, denim's popularity will eventually wane again.For now, Mr Burke reckons Levi's is in a good place.It is becoming more visible - last year it built 74 stores in 2018 including a 17,000 square foot store in New York's Times Square - and he says the company had the foresight to jump on the denim \"bandwagon\" that started with the \"mom\" jeans.\"They were the original,\" he says: \"So it just makes sense to monetise that and to grow the business simultaneously.\"For now, there is still more to come from this bygone fashion era. Actress Shailene Woodley recently caused a stir when she wore a pair of high-waisted acid wash jeans designed by Balmain. WWD's Mr Badia says that the trend on the catwalk hasn't become ubiquitous, yet: \"I haven't seen it trickle down at that level like it did back in the 1980s but it wouldn't surprise me.\"We have seen some designers going for it but we haven't seen it yet at the mass market.\"He reckons that \"we are going to see more acid washes\u2026 at the same time tie-dye is happening\".But if readers of a certain vintage are contemplating taking a sartorial trip down memory lane, Mr Badia has a word of warning.\"You need to remember always there is a rule of thumb in fashion when you see a trend coming back -  you've already worn it once, you cannot wear it twice.\" ","61":"Three HMV stores in Scotland will close after Canadian firm Sunrise Records bought the collapsed music chain. The firm will buy 100 stores across the UK out of administration, securing 1,487 jobs.But 27 stores will close, including outlets in Ayr and the Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow, and the Fopp store on Byres Road in Glasgow. HMV in Dundee, Aberdeen, East Kilbride, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Livingston and Stirling remain open. Fopp outlets in Edinburgh and Union Street in Glasgow are also unaffected by the closure programme. Sunrise Records chief executive Doug Putman said he was \"delighted to acquire the most iconic music and entertainment business in the UK.\" Canadian entrepreneur Mr Putman, 34, bought the retail chain Sunrise Records in 2014. He previously bought HMV's Canadian business in 2017, expanding his small chain into a national operation with 80 outlets.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that HMV was a \"fantastic, heritage brand\".He also said the chain would be looking to stock more vinyl records, in response to customer demand.HMV collapsed in December, its second administration in six years.HMV owner Hilco, which took the company out of its first administration in 2013, has blamed a \"tsunami\" of retail challenges for the latest collapse.These include business rate levels and the increasing use of streaming services to deliver music and movies.HMV sold 31% of all physical music in the UK in 2018 and 23% of all DVDs, with its market share growing month by month throughout the year.However, the music industry expects physical entertainment sales to shrink by another 17% this year.Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator said: \"We are pleased to confirm this sale which, after a complex process, secures the continued trading of the majority of the business.  \"Our immediate concern is now to support those employees that have unfortunately been made redundant.\"","62":"Unilever has said it is stockpiling Ben and Jerry's ice cream and Magnum bars ahead of the UK's departure from the European Union. Chief executive Alan Jope said the consumer goods giant was holding a few weeks' worth of extra stock in case of disruption to supply chains. It follows admissions of Brexit stockpiling from other firms. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but concern is mounting it will exit without a deal. Mr Jope said Unilever was also stockpiling deodorant in mainland Europe in case of Brexit-related delays. The firm's Leeds factory, which makes Sure, Lynx and Dove, supplies the whole of Europe, while its ice creams are produced on the continent. Mr Jope added that the firm was building up stocks of the materials used to package goods. \"We have built inventory on either side of the Channel,\" Mr Jope said. \"It's weeks of inventory - not months or days.\"If I was in the designer handbag business then I might have built further [inventory] cover but we're not, we are in fast-moving consumer goods and one of the things we have learned is, when you build inventory, it can end up being the wrong mix of product.\"A number of companies have been stockpiling goods ahead of Brexit, including car-parts maker Robert Bosch, luxury goods firm LVMH and French drugmaker Novartis. Earlier this week, Sainsbury's, Asda and McDonald's warned that stockpiling fresh food was impossible - and that a no-deal Brexit would leave them short of stock.But the government said it has \"well established\" ways of working with industry to prevent disruption.Mr Jope, who succeeded Paul Polman as Unilever's chief executive in November, said the company was preparing for various Brexit scenarios but that a no-deal outcome would be the hardest to manage.\"We desperately hope that we don't end up in a tariff-laden environment,\" he said.   ","63":"They are closely related to snails, taste like \"nan's toenails\" and, in Wales, you cannot give them away.But those fishing for whelks off the coast of Wales claim they are popular in Japan and South Korea.Each year 10,000 tonnes of them are caught in the Bristol Channel but virtually all end up in Asia.Gavin Davies has spent the last 20 years catching sea snails, but in that time he has not developed a love for the acquired taste of whelks.\"Goodness knows why they like them - they taste like nan's toenails -  but it's given me a living for the last two decades,\" he said.\"I'm not even sure how they developed a taste for whelks, as they're only native to waters around Britain and the Atlantic.\"Each night Mr Davies sets off from Saundersfoot and harvests one tonne of whelks from 1,000 pots suspended from 50 buoys in the bay around Carmarthenshire.They are driven to Milford Haven, where they are loaded on to a factory ship which cooks and freezes them en-route to Asia.But Mr Davies said he was lucky if he could give away a couple of carriers to Welsh customers.Hywel Griffith - the Michelin-starred head chef of The Beach House on Swansea's Oxwich Bay - believes whelks are misunderstood.\"There's two issues, really,\" he said.\"One is the traditional image of whelks being cheap food, served out of a barrow on East End back streets, and the other is the idea that they are chewy and rubbery, but it's all about how you cook them.\"The same people who turn their noses up at whelks will flock for scallops.\"In Asia they're usually served with chilli and soy sauce, but I think I'd give them a more European twist, maybe some deep-fried and others simmered in white wine, cream and garlic.\"Mr Davies said not only are they low in fat and high in vitamins, they are also good for the environment.\"You can't get more sustainable than whelks. There's an abundant stock of them in the Bristol Channel and the pots cause virtually no harm to the seabed.\"And when we're all wondering how we're going to trade after Brexit, well here's this amazing resource which we won't eat, but they can't get enough of on the other side of the world.\"Gavin Davies and his crew feature in Nightshifters on BBC One Wales on Friday at 19:30 GMT and on BBC iPlayer.","64":"Lyft, the ride-hailing company, has revealed that it is yet to make a profit ahead of an initial public offering (IPO) which could value the firm at between $20bn and $25bn.The company is racing its larger ride-sharing rival Uber to list its stock.In its prospectus, Lyft published detailed financials for the first time, showing that while revenue rose to $2.2bn in 2018, losses grew to $911.3m.It will join New York's Nasdaq and its stock market symbol will be Lyft.Lyft is currently valued at $15bn, just seven years after it was founded by technology entrepreneurs John Zimmer and Logan Green.Reuters reported Lyft will launch its road show around 18 March, where the company will meet with prospective investors to drum up demand for its shares.  Both the company and Uber confidentially filed for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in December but Lyft is the first to make the documents public.They show that Lyft generated sales of $343.3m in 2016 which grew to $1.1bn the following year before doubling in 2018.However, losses have widened from $682.8m in 2016 to $688.3m the year after and $911.3m in the last 12 months.","65":"An e-commerce company based in Nigeria is to become the first African start-up to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.Jumia could go public in the next month.The company, which was given a $1bn valuation in 2016, offers a range of online goods and has branched into food delivery, hotel and flight booking and mobile tariffs.It had four million active consumers at the end of 2018.The online retailer was founded in Lagos by two French entrepreneurs in 2012 and now offers services to most of the African population, in countries such as South Africa, Tanzania, Egypt and Ivory Coast.Its largest shareholder is MTN, Africa's biggest telecoms company.No share price or valuation has been given but there is speculation Jumia could be valued at $1.5bn, despite the fact that it reported a loss of 170m euros ($192m) in 2018.In documents filed in New York, Jumia warned it could not guarantee achieving or sustaining profitability in the future, citing challenges such as a robbery at its Kenyan warehouse, which saw merchandise worth $560,000 stolen. Senegalese businesswoman Marieme Jamme welcomed the fact that an African start-up had listed but said there were a lot of challenges ahead.\"There is a lot of work to do,\" she said.\"They need the technical infrastructure - because currently it is difficult to get a parcel from Senegal to Rwanda. \"There are also issues around distribution and the supply chain.\"Unless someone invested billions of dollars in it, then I don't know how they would beat Amazon or Alibaba.\"Neither of these online retail giants have yet made inroads in the African market, partly because of the lack of postal addresses on the continent, coupled with the lack of infrastructure and the fact that most Africans do not have bank accounts.\"Alibaba has more chance of succeeding in Africa because they are more used to building things from scratch,\" said Ms Jamme.BBC Africa Business Editor Larry Madowo says the inconsistent quality of the products Jumia sells and the delivery challenges it faces have often made the company a target of criticism on social media. Its biggest selling point, however, is the acceptance of mobile money payments across the continent where few people have credit or debit cards, he adds.Chief executive of African firm BRCK, Erik Hersman said the news was \"an important event in the evolution of the African tech scene.\"\"Jumia is showing that an IPO [initial public offering] on a major stock exchange is possible,\" he added.","66":"The boss of a high-end Scottish engineering firm has said colleagues working in its Poland facility are struggling to understand Brexit.Walker Precision Engineering managing director David Walker's comments came as he urged MPs to \"pull together to remove the uncertainty\" over the issue.Mr Walker also said some customers had moved stock from the UK to Poland to safeguard against potential delays.His comments came after MPs backed a delay in the 29 March Brexit departure.Glasgow-based Walker Precision Engineering makes parts for the defence and space industries, and has production facilities in Essex and Tychy in southern Poland.Mr Walker told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme : \"We've been working closely with our polish colleagues, and they struggle with understanding what's actually happening in the UK at the moment, as do a lot of people.\"He added: \"Some of our European strategic customers have moved stock from the UK to Poland to de-risk against any potential delays to their supply.\"Mr Walker also said his company had been stockpiling raw materials in case of delays at UK ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And he expressed concern about getting people to fill jobs, adding : \"We have noticed a significant reduction in European migrant workers applying for jobs.\"It's becoming more challenging to bridge some of the skills gaps that we're experiencing.\"Mr Walker added: \"We're all very optimistic and hoping all our MPs will pull together to remove this uncertainty and put the interests of British business first.\"Concern about Brexit has spread across Scotland's engineering industry.Chris Smith, boss of Livingston-based Almond Engineering, told BBC Scotland earlier that 80% of its turnover went to foreign-owned companies and that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit without a transition period was \"terrifying\".The UK government has said securing the rights of resident EU citizens had \"always been\" its priority, and that leaving the EU would allow Britain to \"put in place an immigration system which works in the best interests of the UK\".Meanwhile, the boss of pub chain J D Wetherspoon said it would be a \"plus\" if the UK left the EU without a trade deal.Referring to the UK's Brexit divorce bill, Tim Martin told Good Morning Scotland: \"We'll save \u00a339bn, we can regain control of fishing which is an important industry especially in Scotland and we can eliminate tariffs on a lot of things we import into the UK which aren't produced here.\"Speaking as JD Weatherspoon announced a 19% plunge in half-year profits - partly put down to rising labour costs - Mr Martin said: \"I agree with people who say, provided people have a job, they should be able to come and work here from the EU - a similar situation to the freedom of movement we've had from Ireland in the past.\"Provided immigration's controlled by our own government, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to recruit people from abroad.\"For more on this story and the latest business news as it happens, follow BBC presenter Andrew Black's updates each weekday morning on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme between 0600 and 0900.","67":"A self-confessed \"time enthusiast\" says getting young people to love sundials is an \"uphill struggle\".Dr Frank King, a Cambridge academic, is the mathematical brain behind some of the country's most striking timepieces.The 76-year-old, who is also chair of the British Sundial Society, calculates precise measurements which are then constructed in a workshop.He says the number of people who \"really understand\" the science behind them \"are few and far between\".A Fellow in Computer Science at Churchill College, Dr King has taught the likes of \u00a3100m donor David Harding and Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton, but also admits to having an \"obsession with time\".\"Anything from atomic clocks to the most ancient of sundials I can tell you about,\" he says. As Keeper of the Clock, he is responsible for Cambridge University's official timepiece on Great St Mary's Church.But it is the future of his passion that concerns him.\"Sundials are old hat,\" he says. \"Those few people who are making innovative sundials are making extensive use of computerised tools to design them - that's a good thing.\"To get young people interested in sundials is extraordinarily challenging.\"How do sundials work?A sundial uses a shadow cast by a thin rod called a gnomon on to a flat surface etched with different times. The latitude and gradient are taken into account to decide the precise location, ideally on a south-facing wall.Its accuracy varies according to the time of year, and the amount of sunlight in a day.Lida Kindersley has created more than 20 of his designs in her Cambridge workshop.\"His work is alchemy,\" she said. \"I am totally in awe of him.\"Sundials position us in the universe, in the vast unknown.\"I know when we make a sundial it's going to be right.\"Dr King strongly believes the sundial - \"the perfect collaboration of science and art\" - has a place in the digital age.But he is concerned that the skills needed to create them may dwindle, and believes education could play a greater role.\"There seems to be no teaching of spherical triangles, and very little teaching of solid geometry.\"How many school leavers have heard of Euclid?\"","68":"\"Big six\" energy giant SSE has seen a sharp drop in customer numbers and has cut its full-year earnings forecast.It said it had lost 160,000 customers in the final three months of last year, leaving it with 5.88 million accounts.SSE also cut its profit forecast for this year after a European court ruled out a UK industry-wide subsidy which had supported emergency fuel supplies.Last November, SSE suffered a blow when it called off its plan to merge its household supply arm with Npower's.The firm blamed \"challenging market conditions\" and the price cap on bills.That deal would have created the UK's second-biggest energy supplier, shrinking the \"big six\" to the \"big five\".SSE said it was assessing options for its domestic supply business. SSE said that the European court judgement would cut income by about \u00a360m this year.The company said it expects this to be \"a matter of timing only\" as the government is expected to make the payments in the future.But while it waited for that, the company said that earnings per share - the amount of profit divided by the number of shares in issue - would be 6p lower than previously expected, and in a range of 64-69p, compared with its November forecast of 70-75p.SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said the company was making \"good progress\" on deciding what to do with its retail business, SSE Energy Services.The options it has identified so far include: simply splitting it off and listing it on the stock market; a sale; or an alternative transaction.The shares were down slightly on the news. Donald Brown, from stockbrokers Brewin Dolphin, said the future of SSE Energy Services \"remains unclear\". \"However, it's difficult to see who might be interested in buying the business, which has been in decline for some time,\" he added. ","69":"Clothing brands and retailers should pay a penny on every garment they sell to fund a \u00a335m annual recycling scheme.That's the view of MPs, who say \"fast fashion\" is a major contributor to greenhouse gases, water pollution, air pollution and over-use of water.And they urge the government to force clothing manufacturers to pay more towards collecting and recycling the waste they create.Green campaigners argue the MPs' recommendations are really quite tame.They're calling for an end to what they regard as the over-consumption of clothes.The fashion industry creates jobs worldwide and is said to be worth \u00a328bn to the UK economy - but it is estimated to produce as many greenhouse gases as all the planes flying in the world.Libby Peake, from the think-tank Green Alliance, told BBC News: \"One of the areas in which you could make a big difference in terms of your personal climate change impact is by reducing the amount of clothes you buy and keeping them for longer, then donating them to charity shops to keep them in the national wardrobe.\"The clothing trade consumes vast volumes of fresh water and creates chemical and plastic pollution. Manmade fibres are found in the bellies of creatures in the deep ocean.The Environmental Audit Committee is also concerned about the use of child labour, prison labour, forced labour and bonded labour in the manufacture of clothes.Some progressive firms now offer vouchers to shoppers taking back used garments. Marks & Spencer is among the leaders with its \"Plan A\" (because there's no Plan B).The Global Recycling Council commends other firms, including Adidas, which will use only recycled polyester in all shoes and clothing by 2024; and Bottletop, which collaborated with Mulberry to launch a luxury bag made entirely from up-cycled materials (pre-used goods given extra value). But the MPs say they've received inadequate commitments from JD Sports, Sports Direct, Amazon UK and Boohoo.Spokespeople for some of these firms say they've taken other positive measures that haven't been properly registered by the MPs.The MPs' report says it is an open secret that some fast-fashion factories in places such as Leicester are not paying the minimum wage - and the same firms are selling clothes so cheaply that they are being treated as single-use items.The MPs say in the UK we buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe - and a glut of second-hand clothing is swamping the market and depressing prices for used textiles.Less than 1% of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new garments at the end of its life. The committee chair, Mary Creagh, said: \"Fashion retailers should be forced to pay for the impact of their clothes when they're thrown away.\"She said the government should end throwaway fashion by incentivising companies that offer sustainable designs and repair services.\"Children should be taught the joy of making and mending clothes in school,\" she told us.\"We've got to help teenagers get an emotional attachment to their clothes instead of just wearing them a couple of times, getting photographed for Instagram and then chucking them away.\"All consumers have got to accept they need to buy fewer clothes - then mend them if they're torn, or rent or share them.\"The MPs conclude that a voluntary approach to improving the sustainability of the fashion industry is failing - with just 11 fashion retailers signed up to an agreement to reduce their water, waste and carbon footprints.The committee says big retailers should be obliged by ministers to comply with high standards on the manufacture and recycling of clothing. Peter Andrews, from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), told us a growing number of stores were providing take-back schemes for unwanted clothes, and introducing stock made from recycled materials.He didn't immediately reject the idea of a penny levy on clothes, and said retailers were willing to discuss how much of a role they should take in dealing with garments where they're thrown away.He said: \"The sustainability of fashion is a high priority for BRC members - the transparency they have shown and the level of engagement with the inquiry reflects that.\"Sophie Gorton, an associate lecturer in textiles at Chelsea College, is a long-standing proponent of sustainable fashion.She told us there were signs of hope that the industry was starting to change.\"For years we have asked the people who make textiles and yarn about the sustainability of their products and they just haven't wanted to know,\" she said.\"Now, suddenly, they're interested in what makes sustainable hemp or linen - they really want to think about it. It's a very exciting time.\"Clare Farrell, a member of the climate group Extinction Rebellion and also a fashion lecturer, says the committee is aiming at the wrong target.She admits it's better to recycle clothing fibres than throw garments away, but she says the real problem is consumer capitalism: people are putting an intolerable strain on resources simply because they're buying too many clothes in the first place.\"We need a change in mindset,\" she told us. \"Kids buy clothes, wear them a few times and then get rid of them. How do we tackle that? It's the nature of consumer capitalism and it's a very, very big problem for us all.\"Fashion is a big part of the economy, but we can't tackle the problems unless we admit that economy is killing us the way it's currently run.\"Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin","70":"A statue of Michael Jackson has been removed from the National Football Museum in Manchester. Its removal comes as sexual abuse allegations against the singer are detailed in a new documentary film.The statue was commissioned by Fulham's then chairman Mohammed Al Fayed following Jackson's death in June 2009.The National Football Museum (NFM) said the statue had been taken off display as part of \"ongoing plans\" to \"better represent\" football's stories.Two men, James Safechuck and Wade Robson, allege in the Channel 4 documentary, Leaving Neverland, that they were sexually abused by the superstar. There have been reports of radio stations dropping Jackson's music from their playlists, while some fans on social media have said they are boycotting the star.An NFM spokesperson said: \"Plans have been under way for a number of months to remove the Michael Jackson statue from display as part of our ongoing plans to better represent the stories we want to tell about football.  \"As a result of this, the statue has now been removed.\"Mr Al Fayed installed the statue outside Craven Cottage in 2011 but new owner Shahid Khan had it taken down in September 2013.The artwork was originally due to be erected at Harrods before Mr Al Fayed sold the Knightsbridge store. His decision to place the Jackson statue outside Fulham's stadium was unpopular, with supporters saying it made the club a \"laughing stock\".Mr Al Fayed robustly defended the statue, saying: \"If some stupid fans don't understand and appreciate such a gift this guy gave to the world, they can go to hell.\"","71":"A top neurologist has warned patients are being \"left in the dark\" about access to medicines after Brexit. Prof John Paul Leach says patients are already reporting shortages in some vital epilepsy drugs.Specialists in palliative care also say they have concerns about the impact of Brexit. The UK government has said uninterrupted supply of medicines will be a priority in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Advice issued by Whitehall states that \"if everyone does what they need to do\" (including suppliers, hauliers and the NHS) then the UK government is confident medicine supplies will be uninterrupted.But Prof Leach, a neurologist at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, is among a number of medical experts demanding more clarity on arrangements. He said: \"There is not enough information and it is leaving patients somewhat in the dark.\"These are patients who depend on their treatment, and depend on the certainty of their treatment, and leaving them in the dark is not acceptable.\"In the last few months it has become apparent that there are some difficulties in obtaining different types of anti-epilepsy drugs.\"The epilepsy expert added: \"We need more information about what is happening, what the risks are and what is being done to mitigate those risks.\"In approaching the UK government we have asked for reassurance, we have been told that things will be fine and that measures are in place - but we have no idea what these measures are. \"The worst thing that can happen is to have patients uncertain and worried about where there next dose of medication is going to come from.\"The supply of medicines is reserved to Westminster but a string of health charities  -  Diabetes Scotland, Epilepsy Scotland, Marie Curie Scotland and the MS Society - have called for the Scottish government to reveal its own contingency plans about how the storage and distribution of medicines will work north of the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Kathryn Hamling, head of clinical services at Highland Hospice, which offers palliative care services throughout the Highlands, said the impact of Brexit was already being felt in the hospice sector.She said: \"We are aware that there may be some delay or some difficulty in getting some very necessary medication.\"This is a cohort of people who are often taking complex drug regimes and if there was a delay or an inability to access those drug regimes it would obviously affect the care we can give them. \"To have patients or families with that extra concern at a very distressing time is something we would want to avoid. So I think we would be looking for assurances about that access.\"She added: \"I think one of the main areas where we are going to see an impact, and maybe we already are, is in the workforce. \"The majority of people being cared for at the end of life are at home or in the care homes, and a significant proportion of people who work in those areas are non-UK EU nationals, and if that is going to reduce, then a service that is already stretched is going to be stretched even further.\"John Mitchell, a pharmacist at the Lochardil Pharmacy in Inverness, which supplies Highland Hospice, said he was experiencing supply issues but was not sure at this stage if it was attributable to Brexit.He said: \"Generally, we can put our hands on most things the day after they've been ordered. \"Unfortunately what's happening now is that things are coming in and out of stock on a random basis and all we can really do is take advice from other people, talk to manufacturers to see if there are any long lasting shortages, or when they might expect to have things back in stock.\"Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: \"It is unacceptable that the issue of medicine supply should arise.\"The concerns raised by Prof Leach outline the profound and lasting impact a 'no deal' Brexit would have on patient care as well as wider health services. \"We are working closely with health boards to ensure they are as prepared as possible for all Brexit scenarios, including ensuring supplies of medicines, devices and vaccines are protected.\"","72":"As Brazil is coming to grips with what may be the worst industrial accident in the country's history, the national mood is rapidly shifting from grief to outrage.So far all focus has been on retrieving bodies, but too much time has already passed since last Friday's breaking of the Feij\u00e3o dam, in the town of Brumadinho.Now investigators, politicians, business leaders and society are turning their attention to Vale - the company that runs the dam.They want answers to the following questions: Vale isn't just any company in Brazil.It is one of its most prized success stories in business, and along with Petrobras and Embraer remains one of the few national players to have achieved a truly competitive status on a global scale.Today, it is the world's fourth largest mining company, with revenues of $34bn (\u00a326bn; \u20ac30bn) in 2017 - the number one producer and exporter of iron ore.It is such an important player in commodities that global iron ore prices spiked 5.8% after the accident, as any glitch in Vale operations can cause disruptions of supply in the markets. Vale is also the second most-traded share in Brazil's stock exchange, behind Petrobras.Formerly known as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (the River Doce Valley Company), it was created by the government in the 1940s during a period of intense industrialisation of Brazil, that was coupled with the state's desire to seize control of strategic natural resources in the country.In the late 1990s, Vale was privatised and since then it has undergone a period of rapid expansion, often winning awards for its management, and even for sustainable initiatives.It is now owned by a diverse group of shareholders that include a private bank, Brazilian pension funds and the government.But the Vale that is emerging from the crisis now is a starkly different company.On Monday, it saw almost $20bn wiped off its stock market value as the share price plunged almost 20%.As investors were dumping the stock, protestors threw mud in Vale's headquarters in Rio and painted \"murderers\" and \"it was not an accident\" on its fa\u00e7ade.The company already had its image severely tarnished after the breaking of the Samarco dam - a joint venture with BHP Billiton - near the city of Mariana in 2015.A structural failure in the dam killed 19 people and polluted much of the River Doce.The disaster saw Samarco - the Vale and BHP Billiton joint venture - paying out billions in compensation and setting up Foundation Renova, a body supposed to help victims rebuild their lives and restore the river.But there was much controversy on both fronts.Families complain that the Foundation never found a proper compensation formula to establish how much each person should get.Some fishermen, affected by a fishing ban in the River Doce, complain that their pay packages are way below their old incomes. They say many people who never depended on the river are also claiming compensation and that the Foundation does a poor job in evaluating each case.The Foundation acknowledged the problems but said it had to rely on people's good faith.Although the Foundation is independently run from Samarco, with a separate board, the communities around the River Doce see it as a mere extension of the company.Three years on, the mood in the towns is of desolation, with unemployment and alcoholism plaguing families.The legal process also became bogged down.More than 20 people - including Samarco executives - were charged with various crimes, including homicide, but a trial date was never set.No one was convicted or jailed.In 2017, Samarco managed to get a court order suspending criminal proceedings, on the grounds that that investigators allegedly used illegal wire-tapping when gathering evidence.And Samarco is still contesting environmental fines imposed by government agencies.Despite all these problems, many communities in the Minas Gerais region of Brazil are supportive of mining. They rely on the industry for their livelihoods.Vale and BHP Billiton are still working on reopening the Samarco operation, which has remained closed since 2015.Vale managed to rebuild itself in the aftermath of the 2015 crisis, with robust profits and great prospects for the coming years.But after the recent Feij\u00e3o accident, the company is under greater pressure than ever before. This is shaping up to be the worst human tragedy in the history of Brazil's industry. Five people have been arrested already. Billions have been frozen in assets in Brazil and a class action has already been filed in the US by investors.Companies that work with Vale are also being targeted. Two workers from T\u00fcv S\u00fcd - a German company that assessed safety conditions in Feij\u00e3o - were amongst those arrested.Vale has announced that it will decommission all 10 remaining \"tailings\" dams of this type, which are often made from earth and used to store the often toxic mining by-products.It says it will investigate more expensive waste management options and significantly reduce its output.Jimena Blanco, an analyst for Verisk Maplecroft, says the Feij\u00e3o accident could mark severe changes in Brazil, the mining industry and Vale. Investors worldwide will have less appetite for high-environmental risk opportunities, she believes. And Brazil's new President Jair Bolsonaro - who wants to relax environmental restrictions on the mining industry - may have to review his stance.\"We expect community opposition to the industry stemming from concerns over water usage, pollution and soil contamination to increase, both against new and existing projects,\" says Ms Blanco,\"In addition, there will be greater scrutiny from civil society and international environmental activists.\"In recent years a large scale corporate scandal involving another formerly beloved company, Petrobras, prompted a long debate and regulatory changes in the way Brazil deals with corporate corruption and political financing.This second Vale tragedy could force Brazilians to hold a long-overdue debate about the environmental effect exploitation of its natural resources is having.","73":"For more than four decades Elliot Cuker has been selling classic cars from his garage in New York, but last year he hit a roadblock.\"I have been in business for 42 years, and 2018 stands out as one of the worst,\" he says.Now in his 70s, Mr Cuker remembers when his company, Cooper Classics Collection, could sell more than 100 cars a year.Lately, he says, people are buying far fewer.\"I don't know where things are going right now. I don't know if they'll ever be as strong as they were.\"While the global financial crisis of 2007-08 was a worrying time for most people, for Mr Cuker and the whole global classic car industry, it marked the start of a decade-long boom.As stock markets slumped, wealthy investors turned to putting their money into luxury assets, such as art, high-end property, expensive wines - and especially classic cars.\"That was my best year, 2008, believe it or not, when we had that stock market crash,\" says Mr Cuker. \"At least you know that if you invest in a car, a classic car, that you have it and it's [at least historically] consistently always gone up in value.\"Such was the rise in the price of classic cars that one report from insurance firm Axa Art said that the average value of vintage vehicles soared 192% between 2006-17, compared with growth of just 84% across the wider luxury goods sector.But last year, average classic car prices rose just 1%, according to a separate report by classic car index Hagerty Price Guide.While some slowdown is highly likely after such a strong decade of growth, most in the industry blame President Trump's threat to hit car and car parts imports to the US with tariffs of as much as 25%.The president first asked the US Commerce Department to investigate the issue in May last year. Then in November he tweeted that a 25% tariff on imported cars would mean that \"many more cars would be built here\".With no suggestion that older vehicles and parts will be given an exemption, the Commerce Department filed its confidential report on the issue to President Trump on 17 February.He now has until 18 May to decide whether to hit car imports with a tariff, as he has already done to imported vans.Many in the wider automotive industry expect some kind of import levies. Those in the classic car sector say it would have a substantially negative impact.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\"When you get to tariffs, right now the importation rate to the US on a classic car, or classic car parts is 2.5% [the same as for new cars and parts],\" says Rory Jurnecka, features editor at US publication Automobile Magazine.\"A tenfold increase, when we're talking about tariffs, to 25%, is really unsustainable. And I think will basically bring any global industry, as it pertains to the US, to a halt.\"But President Trump's tariff threat is not the only issue causing the classic car industry anxiety. The UK's continuing Brexit uncertainty is another factor said to be weighing heavily on the sector.Malcolm Barber, co-chairman of auction house Bonhams, which has its headquarters in London, says Brexit has led to \"caution\" among UK car collectors \"as it has in most industries in Britain\".Yet despite all this doom and gloom and the current twists in the road, others say that the classic car industry will remain strong. One such person is avid collector Rodger Dudding.\"I think at the last count I have something like about 430 classic motor vehicles,\" says the 81-year-old multimillionaire.\"To my mind, without being too dramatic, they are three-dimensional art.\"If you look at modern day cars, this model or that model, they're all so similar, and they're boring. They don't have personality.\"Mr Dudding, who made his fortune in the self-storage industry, owns nine Ferraris and 24 Aston Martins.  He hires out his cars to TV and film productions, such as The Crown and Mary Poppins Returns.\"We are still investing in cars,\" he says. \"We believe the market will be maintained.\"This confidence is shared by Kenneth Ahn, president of car auction firm RM Sotheby's.He points to the fact that last August RM Sotheby's sold a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO for $48.4m (\u00a336.8m), at an auction in California. This was the most expensive car ever sold at auction.\"We are optimistic about 2019,\" says Mr Ahn. \"Even though there are macro concerns, for truly rare and important cars the collector demand is still very healthy.\"","74":"The number of Snapchat users has stabilised after two quarters of decline according to its parent company's latest results. Snap said the platform had 186 million daily active users in the three months to 31 December.The number is unchanged from the previous quarter but analysts had expected users to fall.Revenues also rose by more than expected and Snap's losses narrowed for the period.

However, its shares are far below the $27 price they fetched after floating on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2017.Snap, which started in 2012, is known for its appeal to younger users.It was once viewed as one of the most promising names in technology, but investors had soured on its prospects after a series of company stumbles, including a redesign that alienated some users.Last year, the number of daily active users fell to 186 million from a peak of 191 million in the first quarter.On Tuesday, Snap said it was \"cautiously optimistic\" that its user count would hold steady in coming monthsSnap's chief executive Evan Spiegel also defended the redesign, saying it had positioned the company for future growth.He said it would allow the firm to expand the kind of content it offers users, while retaining its emphasis on communication between friends.For the full year, Snap's revenue rose by 43% to more than $1.1bn. Losses were $1.2bn, down from $3.4bn in the previous period. Mr Spiegel said the company was getting \"substantially closer\" to profitability.\"We are proud of the progress we have made as we enter 2019 focused on growing our business and driving towards profitability,\" he said. ","75":"Over the years, one financial crisis after another has ruined - or profited - those caught in the middle of it. The pay and benefits of UK residents is still being affected by the latest crisis of a decade ago.So when has financial advice eased, exacerbated, or even created these downturns? Researchers at the universities of Southampton, Edinburgh, Lancaster and Manchester - funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council - have explored the history of financial advice, and how it is represented in culture. The findings are part of a free, online course.Professor Nicky Marsh, principal investigator on the project, has picked out some examples from art and literature and explains what they tell us. The failure of the South Sea Company was the crisis that shaped our understanding of the dangers of speculative bubbles. Yet many of its satirical representations focus on the deceptions of those involved and speak of a deep mistrust toward the emerging financial profession. The cartoon The Bubblers bubbl'd or the Devil Take the Hindmost, for example, depicts stockjobbers passing stock certificates that flutter down from above in a crazed dance from which they cannot free themselves, and in which the only option is to try to pass the worthless paper to the greater fool beside them. Investors in the 1720s relied on stockjobbers, rumours and friends and relatives for their financial advice. Even when the genre of financial advice had appeared, in newspaper columns and guidebooks, it was not always trustworthy. The financial boom of the 1820s provided investors with a dizzying range of new investments, especially those with an appetite for imperial adventures. The financial advice manuals that now did exist conservatively warned against these investments so new writers filled the gap.A speculative genre of financial advice emerged, one that talked up the untold wealth to be made from new discoveries, innovations, and technologies. One of the most notorious examples was Thomas Strangeways' 1822 Sketch of the Mosquito Shore. The book was authored by the soldier and adventurer Gregor MacGregor but its glowing account of the resources and climate of the new nation of Poyais was entirely fraudulent. It was targeted chiefly at the settlers he hoped to lure to his utopia, but the book underpinned MacGregor's efforts to float a Poyais loan on the London market and he raised over \u00a350,000 before the scam was exposed.Britain went mad for railway shares in the 1840s. In their Haworth parsonage, the Bronte sisters - Charlotte, Emily, and Anne - inherited shares in the York and North Midland Railway. Charlotte's letters reveal how the sisters navigated the market. Emily took charge of their investments, \"carefully reading every paragraph and every advertisement in the newspapers that related to rail-roads\". But the press, full of hype for the railways, did not give the best advice. Charlotte wanted to sell out before it was too late, but could not persuade \"headstrong\" Emily, and eventually gave way. Her concerns were vindicated when the market collapsed. Charlotte learnt from the mistake. She took the advice of her publisher in 1849 and invested the royalties from her novel Shirley in Consols (perpetual government bonds).Thomas Lawson (1857-1925) was at one point the sixth richest man in America. He made his fortune as a stock promoter, organising large corporate mergers. However, he was soon sick of what he saw as the corrupt stranglehold that a clique of big businessmen had on the American economy. Instead he turned to muckraking journalism, and in 1906 published Frenzied Finance. It was a searing expos\u00e9 of the scandal surrounding the Amalgamated Copper deal.He soon realised that journalism does not pay as well as finance, so he returned to stock promotion. This time he tried to move the market not by insider dealing or an advice manual, but by writing a sensationalist novel, Friday the Thirteenth (1907). It predicted an apocalyptic crash of the stock market. His avid readers took his warnings at face value, and ended up creating the real world the financial panic that the fiction had imagined - and Lawson pocketed the profit.At the opening of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925), the narrator, Nick Carraway, recalls buying \"a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities\".In the 1920s, many Americans likewise devoured guides to Wall Street speculation in the hope of following in the footsteps of the legendary financier J.P. Morgan, and came to regret it when prices on the New York Stock Exchange collapsed in the Great Crash of 1929 and they lost anything they had invested. Fitzgerald would go on to write the definitive post-crash story, Babylon Revisited, in 1931. The \"luck in the market\" enjoyed by the protagonist in the 1920s boom allows him to live as \"a sort of royalty, almost infallible, with a sort of magic around [him]\", until the market cleans him out. Fitzgerald's protagonist ultimately suffers a breakdown - a fate sadly shared by the author himself and his wife Zelda in the depression years that followed what the author called \"the most expensive orgy in history\".As inflation steadily rose throughout the 1970s, financial advice often took a decidedly apocalyptic turn. Howard Ruff's How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years recommended buying gold, food and guns. The relationship between financial advice and disaster fiction also began to blur in this moment. Paul Erdman's The Billion Dollar Sure Thing, which turned President Nixon's recent closing of the gold window into a cold war thriller, was taken up by influential economists for offering the best explanation of how money worked in the new economy emerging from the 1970s. The stock price chart - with its upward and downward lines forming peaks and troughs that resemble the profile of a mountain range - is one of the most familiar ways of visualising the financial markets. Many investment advice authors believe that the movements of prices reflect underlying natural laws and form recurring patterns that can be \"charted\" and exploited for profit. In their digital work Black Narcissus (2014), the British artists Matthew Cornford and David Cross track along a computer-generated mountain skyline mapped onto the historical undulations of the stock market in the period 2003-2013. In this still from the work, the downward trend on the left, culminating in the vertiginous drop in the centre, corresponds to the global financial crisis of 2008. Here, the market quite literally falls off a cliff edge - one that very few people saw coming.","76":"Major suppliers to care homes and hospitals are stockpiling food to offset the potential disruption of a no-deal Brexit.Apetito and Bidfood, who between them supply thousands of care providers, said they were holding extra inventory in case of supply chain problems.Both said they were prepared but Apetito said it feared others were not. \"We are in a strong position,\" said Apetito UK boss Paul Freeston.\"But some firms would not be able to build up big stocks,\" like his firm, he said. \"Or if they are doing fresh produce they would have to stop. A Hard Brexit could cause them significant economic difficulties.\" Apetito provides pre-made meals to more than 400 hospitals and 450 care homes, as well as 100,000 vulnerable people in their homes. Mr Freeston said it was spending \u00a35m in building its inventory ahead of Brexit - doubling the raw materials it holds from four to eight weeks' of stock and pre-made meals from five to six weeks'. But if the disruption lasted much longer than 12 to 16 weeks, the firm would have \"very real difficulties\", because it supplies specialist food for elderly people and those with critical conditions. But if there are backlogs at UK ports in the event of a no-deal, \"the quality of food could suffer and our product range would really narrow\", Mr Freeston said. The other worry is that if the UK suddenly started trading on World Trade Organisation terms with the EU, the cost of raw materials could jump - and Britain imports about a third of its food from the bloc. The concerns are shared by Bidfood, which supplies the kitchens of 4,000 care homes and 950 hospitals across the UK, as well as schools and prisons.Jim Gouldie, its supply chain and technical services director, said the firm had \"looked carefully\" at products needed by sectors with a \"duty of care\" and invested in additional warehousing.Meanwhile Anglia Crown, which manufactures meals for 100 hospital sites, told the BBC it was worried about prices rising after Brexit. A spokeswoman said the company was agreeing prices for \"as many commodities as possible, especially any bought in from Europe\".Despite the warnings, the National Care Association said most of the care homes it represents are prepared for any no-deal disruption and have enough food stocks in place - even if that means relying on dried or canned food to carry them through. But boss Nadra Ahmed is worried that any price shocks to suppliers could end up being passed on to providers. \"Care providers are struggling with funding and recruitment issues already so any increases will increase the challenges they face.\"The Hospital Caterers Association (HCA), which represents hospital catering companies, says most of his members have been preparing for Brexit for some time. And while he is not overly worried about a no deal, he does expect some short term volatility after Brexit.  \"A number are making arrangements to increase their stock holding - either on site or by securing commitments from their long-established suppliers,\" he says. \"But this clearly is not possible for perishable goods. It is imperative that we ensure continuity of supply to minimise any potential disruption to patients' menus.\"A government spokesperson said: \"Our priority is to make sure that patients continue to receive the same high standard of care.\"We are working closely with the NHS, Defra and healthcare providers to ensure the uninterrupted supply of food and specialised nutritional products to patients, as part of our preparations for a no-deal EU Exit.\"","77":"You might never have heard of the Sackler family but you may well have enjoyed their money.The Anglo-American billionaire dynasty are prolific philanthropists and some of Britain's best-known art galleries, museums, theatres and universities have benefited from their generosity.But behind the money is a firm called Purdue Pharma, a US company owned by many of the Sacklers which makes opioids - a class of drugs linked to the deaths of thousands of Americans.Now some in the arts say they don't want the Sacklers' money anymore.This week alone, the Tate said it would no longer take funds from the family while the National Portrait Gallery and the Sackler Trust said they would not proceed with a \u00a31m donation.And in New York, the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, which has received a total of $9m (\u00a36.8m) from the Sacklers, said it did not plan to accept any more gifts from the family The family's fortune, estimated at $13bn by Forbes magazine, was started by three brothers from Brooklyn, New York. Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler were all doctors and in the early 1950s they bought a medicine company called Purdue Frederick which would become Purdue Pharma. Each of the brothers owned a third of the firm but when Arthur Sackler died in 1987, Mortimer and Raymond bought out his stake.Purdue Pharma went on to invent OxyContin, a prescription painkiller with a slow release formula which hit the US market in 1996.Much of the Sackler family's fortune comes from Purdue Pharma. Thanks to the billions generated by Purdue and donated by the Sacklers, the family name can be found adorning a wing of the Louvre in Paris, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as well as the V&A, the Serpentine and Shakespeare's Globe in London among many, many others.But Andrew Kolodny, co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University, describes the philanthropy as \"reputation laundering\".\"That's what they were doing with all of this money they were giving to museums and to universities,\" he says. \"Their wealth was earned through the sales of a drug similar to heroin.'\"  A spokesperson for Sackler family members said, \"For more than half a century, several generations of Sacklers have supported respected institutions that play crucial roles in health, research, education, the arts and the humanities. It has been a privilege to support the vital work of these organizations and we remain dedicated to doing so.\"While plaintiffs' court filings have created an erroneous picture and resulted in unwarranted criticism, we remain committed to playing a substantive role in addressing this complex public health crisis.\"Our hearts go out to those affected by drug abuse or addiction.\"Raymond Sackler died in 2017. His son Richard, who is known within Purdue as Dr Richard, was chairman and president of Purdue.Others involved or have been with Purdue are Raymond Sackler's wife Beverly, their other son Jonathan and Raymond Sackler's grandson David. Mortimer, who was awarded an honorary knighthood by the Queen, died in 2010.His wife Dame Theresa Sackler - a trustee of the V&A - has been a board member at Purdue as have Mortimer's daughters Ilene Sackler Lefcourt and Kathe Sackler and son Mortimer Sackler.Purdue Pharma is facing hundreds and hundreds of lawsuits because of OxyContin.The company is one of a number opioid manufacturers and distributors who are accused of using misleading marketing about the drug and downplaying concerns about abuse and addiction to encourage doctors to prescribe more of it.Purdue Pharma strongly denies the claims.Dr Kolodny says that opioids had mostly been used to treat people with cancer, for end of life care or after surgery for a limited time.He says: \"There wasn't very much money to be made if OxyContin had only been prescribed to people at the end of life with cancer because end of life cancer pain is not that common and people won't be on your drug for very long at the end of life.\"\"So the way you can do well with a pharmaceutical product is if doctors prescribe it for common problems like lower back pain or headaches. If you have a drug that is difficult to stop taking you've got a pretty good recipe for financial success.\"With prescription opiods in more bathroom cabinets across America, family members were becoming exposed.Dr Kolodny says that for people in their 20s, who may have tried a prescription opioid \"for fun\" and become hooked, it was difficult for them to get more off a doctor because they looked healthy. \"The pills on the street, even in 2001 were very expensive, he says. \"So young white people in the US in their 20s and 30s started switching from pills to heroin.\"With powerful opioids like Fentanyl entering the illegal drugs market, the risk of overdose increased. With Fentanyl, the opioid epidemic which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says began with prescription painkillers then heroin, is now in its third wave.Purdue says that OxyContin \"constitutes an exceedingly small per cent of the prescription opioids prescribed in the US\" which it says is less than 2%.Dr Kolodny says: \"Certainly there were other drug companies that saw how well this was working out for Purdue and got into it early on as well.\"But he claims: \"Purdue got the ball rolling.\" Among the lawsuits facing Purdue are some that name members of the Sackler family.In particular, the complaint by Massachusetts Attorney General, Maura Healey, recently released a number of potentially damning documents and alleges that \"they directed deceptive sales and marketing practices deep within Purdue\".It paints the Sacklers as forceful board members, intent on pushing Purdue Pharma's salesforce to persuade doctors to prescribe more and more OxyContin at higher doses to their patients.It also presents Richard Sackler as someone who does not view OxyContin as contributing to opioid addiction, instead blaming the individuals themselves.In an email included the Massachusetts complaint, Richard Sackler wrote: \"We have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.\"Purdue Pharma forcefully denies the claims made in the lawsuit and has filed a motion to have the lawsuit dismissed. It says it is \"is replete with sensational and inflammatory allegations\" and is \"oversimplified scapegoating based on a distorted account of the facts unsupported by applicable law\".This week in the US, the House Oversight Committee said it is seeking information from Purdue about which Sacklers sat on the board as well as documents detailing marketing strategies for selling OxyContin.There has also been speculation that Purdue Pharma may filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy which would  automatically stay all litigation against the company and allow the firm to be reorganised.For the some of the people who have been campaigning against the Sacklers, announcements by the Tate and the National Portrait Gallery are \"very welcome\". LA Kauffman, an activist and author who is a member of Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, a group started by US photographer. Nan Goldin who became dependent on OxyContin, says it is a sign \"the tide is really turning\".But she says while it is important to \"acknowledge that this was a bold step for institutions to take\", she asks; \"If museums don't stand for the basic value of human life what do they stand for?\"","78":"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has made a bid for cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, which collapsed into administration last month.A Sports Direct statement late on Friday confirmed an offer had been made, but gave no further details.Administrator KPMG closed 70 Patisserie Valerie outlets, but kept 121 open in the hope of finding a buyer.Mr Ashley, who owns House of Fraser and has a big stake in Debenhams, missed out this week on a bid for HMV.The cafe chain employed about 3,000 staff, but some 900 jobs were lost in the initial wave of closures after KPMG was appointed to run the business on 22 January.Last October, Patisserie Valerie, where entrepreneur Luke Johnson is the biggest shareholder, uncovered \"significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities\".The company said in a statement last month that it did not have enough money to meet its debts. Rescue talks with banks HSBC and Barclays to restructure the business broke down, leaving no option but administration.In addition to Patisserie Valerie, the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. Finance director Chris Marsh was arrested after having been suspended by the company when the financial irregularities were uncovered. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton.Mr Ashley, who also owns English Premier League football club Newcastle United, made his name building budget chain Sports Direct into Britain's biggest sporting goods retailer. At a time when retailers are struggling, he is frequently linked as a potential buyer of any that get into financial trouble. He bought House of Fraser last year, and also acquired Evans Cycles and Agent Provocateur. Sports Direct has shareholdings in French Connection and Game Digital, and last week emerged as front runner to buy Sofa.com.Earlier this week, Canada's Sunrise Records beat Mr Ashley in a battle to by the music retailer HMV. Mr Ashley is thought to be facing several competing bids for Patisserie Valerie, including, according to reports, from Costa, the coffee chain bought by Coca-Cola last year.Billionaire Mr Ashley has shown faith in the High Street at a time when many bricks-and-mortar stores are struggling due to a combination of rising rents and increasing online competition.He says that to support the High Street, there should be a tax on firms which generate 20% of revenues from the internet.Despite acquiring several struggling retailers, analysts say that Mr Ashley is more of a opportunist than a strategist.Richard Hyman, a adviser to a number of retailers, recently told the BBC: \"Is [Mr Ashley] following a strategic plan? I don't think he is. Is he positively opportunistic? Yes. Has got the resources to take advantage of opportunities that come his way? Yes.\"And, Mr Hyman adds: \"Has he got courage? Yes\".

She bought the blue plastic band after her original ring was ruined by the toxic water that has been pumping into her home for more than a decade.\"I just needed something there,\" she says, as she holds the replacement ring up to the light. \"I felt empty without it.\" She places her original wedding band, now discoloured and corroded, in her palm. Her skin, especially on her hands, has become coarse and sore.The taps in her house have been worn down, her washing machine frequently stops working, and her bathroom and kitchen have been stained a deep, bloody orange by the pollutants - iron, sulphur, even arsenic - that have seeped into her home's water supply.This is Appalachia - the heart of America's coal country. It is home to some of the poorest and most isolated communities in the US and the legacy of mining, be it the abandoned processing plants or the scarred landscape, can be seen dotted alongside its vast highways.Casey's home is a small, double-berth structure with a wooden porch in southern West Virginia, in a place with very patchy mobile phone reception.She pours a glass of water from her kitchen tap and lets it rest on a table. It has a strange smell and a sticky texture and within minutes begins to turn dark orange. A layer of black sediment soon sinks to the bottom of the glass.\"This is what we have to live with,\" Casey says. \"We don't bathe in the water and we don't cook with it. It stains our fingernails, our knuckles, and our clothes. It's really, really difficult living like this.\"Casey and her husband Jack (not his real name), have two young children and drive for more than an hour to stock up on bottled water to drink and cook with. So who do they hold responsible?\"I've been here all my life, but when the surface [coal] mine came in that's when the water started changing,\" says Jack, who, despite being a miner himself, believes the industry is accountable for his family's water problems.\"I think if they've done wrong they should have to fix it.\"At the sprawling mine in the neighbouring valley, millions of pounds of explosives are being detonated on the mountaintops so that coal, buried deep below the surface, can be excavated. This process is a type of surface mining known as mountaintop removal, and has drawn the ire not only of nearby residents but environmental groups who say it devastates the landscape and pollutes the waterways.One study estimates that an area the size of the state of Delaware has been flattened by this type of coal mining, which was first practised in the 1970s. Another report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that more than 2,000 miles of streams - a distance longer than the Mississippi river - have been buried by the excess rock and soil (known as overburden) that is dumped after the explosions.And in a part of the world where many people rely on their own wells to get water, rather than a conventional pipeline, any pollution from mining waste can have devastating consequences.These private wells are essentially unregulated, so it is up to people like Casey and Jack to determine whether their water has been contaminated. But the complex nature of water pollution means many people are completely unaware of what's coming out of their taps.\"When you dump a lot of overburden into the valley, and start covering up streams, you have water sources that end up travelling through the [waste] material,' says Professor Michael McCawley, an environmental engineer who has spent time researching the health impacts of mountaintop removal.\"It's kind of like dumping geological trash,\" he explains. \"It ends up increasing the concentration of acidic ions and metals [in the water], things like arsenic and nickel.\"This pollution, according to his research, has taken a major toll on the health of those whose water supply lies in its path.\"This population is under assault from both water and air,\" Professor McCawley says. \"What we're finding in the water is likely to cause inflammation in the body, which can set off a lot of other chronic diseases.\"The big [problems] we have found are certainly cancers. Name a cancer and they're seeing it here.\" When asked about cancer rates, Casey reels off a list of people living nearby who have been recently diagnosed.  \"Oh Lord everybody has been getting it,\" she says. \"It's scary.\"Dr Wesley Lafferty, who is based in nearby Boone County, believes a number of health problems are being exacerbated by mining waste.\"We get all kinds of symptoms,\" he told Human Rights Watch last year. \"Rashes, restrictive airway disease, dermatitis, generic skin disease.\"I definitely feel there is an environmental component to that.\"In a valley not far from the home of Casey and Jack, and sitting within earshot of the same mine they say has caused their water contamination, Jason Walker is describing many of the same problems.\"My water was drinkable and clear before the mountaintop removal started,\" he says. \"But then it got worse. It smelt like rotten eggs and the colour of my sinks, faucets [taps], all my laundry, turned orange.\"He then had his water tested and was warned that it was so toxic that, if he washed his clothes in it, there was a risk that direct sunlight could actually set them on fire.Jason now cooks with bottled water, but he has been collecting water from a nearby stream and treating it with swimming pool chemicals to supply his house.Last winter, after a spell of severe cold weather, he used an axe to cut through more than five inches (12.7cm) of ice to access the stream water. But when the pipes he was using to collect it froze over he had to go without.\"I'm getting a new well drilled for $4,000 [\u00a33,088] to keep myself from doing that again, even though I don't know how good the water will be,\" he says.  \"I took a loan out against our property to pay for it. It's a huge gamble.\"My grandfather was a coal miner, my dad was a coal miner, but if the mines tear something up I think they should replace it.\"I want more regulations that actually help the little person and not the big person.\"In a telephone interview with the BBC, a spokesman for the company that owns the surface mine in Wyoming County said that it operated under state regulations and with a valid permit.\"We view ourselves as pretty good neighbours and if somebody has an issue then we would address it,\" said the spokesman for CM Energy, which took over the mine in 2017.When presented with the complaints of nearby residents, the spokesman declined to take responsibility and said the water contamination could have been caused by a number of different issues.\"If we thought we were responsible then we would step up and try and do something about it,\" the spokesman said. \"If there's something that our company can do to facilitate working with politicians and the local community then we would participate.\"The mine's previous owner, Dynamic Energy, did not respond to a request for comment.That company is facing a lawsuit from a number of residents - including Casey and Jack - who are seeking compensation for the costs of dealing with their water issues.It won a similar lawsuit a few years ago, and Jason, who was part of that legal battle, said it left the entire community divided between those who supported the coal industry and those who wanted to fight back.\"There's a lady down the street here who wouldn't join the lawsuit,\" he says. \"She hasn't spoken to me in almost two years because of it. They were scared it would mean losing jobs.\"Casey understands their concerns. \"It's how people make their living and support their families,\" she says. \"If you don't work in the coal mines you either flip burgers or you have to move out of state and do something else.\"But her husband Jack says it wasn't a difficult decision to join the latest legal action - even if he is a coal miner.\"The only thing I really care about is getting fresh water the way it was when I was growing up around here,\" he says. \"I ain't worried about the money. I just want clean water.\"All images subject to copyright.","81":"Hannah Powell had been throwing up and felt exhausted after a night out on a bar crawl with two friends in Zante, Greece, in August 2016.But it wasn't a hangover. The 23-year-old had drunk vodka that - unknown to her - had been mixed with deadly methanol.It made her kidneys shut down and she went blind. Hannah only realised there was something wrong when she woke up in her hotel room and thought the lights were off.\"I suggested we open the curtains and my friends said they were already open but I didn't realise what was going on,\" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\"I just thought they were joking so I got up to turn the light on. \"That's when I started to panic because that's when I realised it was on and I just couldn't see anything.\"Hannah, from Middlesbrough, was taken to a hospital on the island before being transferred to a larger one on the mainland of Greece.She was so confused and delirious she thought she was being kidnapped.\"I didn't know why I couldn't see. I thought there was something around my eyes, my head. I remember slyly answering the phone to my dad. \"He was telling me not to worry and he was on his way but it kept cutting out.\"I remember hiding my phone under my armpit thinking they were going to take it off me.\"Hospital tests confirmed that Hannah had methanol poisoning. She'd been served unregulated vodka which had been mixed with the toxic substance in a bar.Her friends - who had also drunk the same - were ill with stomach cramps and sickness but had no lasting effects. \"Apparently mafia gangs make it in the woods and sell it to the bars for cheap - and the bars fill up their stock with it,\" Hannah explains.\"So if you're a customer you think you're buying a legitimate Smirnoff vodka but it's not. \"They put it in Smirnoff bottles, real bottles, so you've no reason to think it's not what it is.\"It just makes it go further for the bars. They don't have to give you the normal quantity, they can give you much less because it's much stronger. \"But it's just so dangerous.\"Hannah returned home weeks later and had to adjust to life without her eyesight.Her kidneys also stopped working so she spent nearly 18 months on dialysis until her mum was able to donate one of her kidneys to her daughter.Hannah says over time her eyesight has gone from being \"completely black\" to \"very foggy\" and she struggles to do a lot of things on her own.She's hoping to get a guide dog to give her more independence.\"I used to get up and kind of forget I'd lost my sight,\" she tells Newsbeat. \"I'd go and get ready and realise I couldn't find my make up, couldn't find my straighteners. \"I'd open an eye shadow pallet and it would just be one black box when really it's full of all different colours.\"It's little things like going to make a cup of tea, I wouldn't be able to find anything. Also tripping on stairs a lot. \"I'd be fine all day and then you have one fall on the stairs and it would just put me back.\"It's been nearly three years since the holiday, but no-one has ever taken responsibility for what happened.Hannah says she believes unsafe alcohol is still being sold in holiday resorts like Zante.\"The fact that no-one wants to take responsibility, I didn't expect them to, but I think someone should.\"Either the bar knew they had dodgy alcohol or someone made the dodgy alcohol. Either way, it was nothing to do with me and I wouldn't have drank it if I knew.\"Hannah says she's always been determined to lead a normal life since losing her sight.She goes to the gym, the cinema. She goes shopping and celebrates friends' birthdays just like anyone else.The sight loss charity RNIB also supported Hannah in going back to work and she has special equipment for her job as a receptionist in a doctors' surgery.\"My sister was brilliant.

The government's annual celebration of apprenticeships, National Apprenticeship Week, starts on Monday, but, behind the fanfare, some of the statistics on gender make depressing reading. The latest available official figures, for 2016-17, show that only 620 females started apprenticeships in construction and the built environment, compared with more than 20,000 males.  Emily Burridge, 22, climbs the ladder at the back of a concrete tanker, parked at Weeford Quarry in Staffordshire and peers down inside. Just by looking inside a concrete mixer, she has learned to tell by the way the liquid moves over its turning blades, whether a batch of specialist concrete has the properties it needs.\"It's going to sound sad, but it's my passion, my newly-developed passion, I do love it,\" she says. She has been in her post for less than a year as technical production manager for a string of 25 quarries, concrete and asphalt plants with aggregates giant Hanson.  The person she replaced, after completing a higher level apprenticeship, was a man of retirement age.Her staff are overwhelmingly male and much, much older - but she says it has not been a problem.\"As long as you're honest about what you know and what you don't, you show that you actually want to grow your knowledge, and that you appreciate their side of things, then they're perfectly respectful and they acknowledge any feedback you give them,\" she says. Quality control and complaint handling are a key part of the job but when, as a very young woman, she turns up on construction sites, she admits, people can be \"taken aback\".  \"Some try and avoid me. Others are very up front...\"They always ask the question, 'why are you doing this?'.\"Four years ago, graphic design was Emily's favourite A-level subject but now, instead of palettes and pixels, she has her own set of personal protective equipment in hi-viz orange, including hard hat, goggles and steel toecap boots. The regulation kit does not come in women's sizes, but she says that the first time she put it on: \"I actually thought I looked quite cool. I stood out.\"In sixth form, she had realised a conventional university course was not for her and, while her friends were busily applying through admissions service Ucas, she was working in a pub near her home in Somerset.Some of Emily's friends wondered if she would be there for ever. It was her grandad who suggested trying for a degree apprenticeship, where the employer pays your tuition fees and you earn a salary. But graphic design apprenticeships were hard to find, so she decided to widen her search.\"This one grabbed my attention because it offered working outdoors, which I hadn't considered before. But seeing as my family were all very hands on as well, my dad's a mechanic, my grandparents were farmers, it appealed to me.\" Applying was \"a punt\", she admits: \"I'd never visited a quarry.\" She says the recruitment process focused on resilience, resourcefulness and people skills. She was the first girl ever hired on the scheme and, two weeks after starting, she and a fellow apprentice were thrown into the deep end.They were asked to research and create a roller-compacted concrete for a customer - it is a drier mix than conventional concrete and something Hanson had never made before. \"I like a challenge... It's a brilliant management technique.\" Emily started her management job last year on a salary of \u00a330,000, shortly before graduating from University of Derby with a foundation degree in mineral extractives, and she is currently working towards honours. It was a distance learning degree and so, apart from occasional short courses at the university, she spent four days a week in her job, with the fifth day studying on her own in an office. She likes to tease her boyfriend, a student on a conventional degree course, about the fact that, unlike him, she has no student debt.  The Young Women's Trust, which campaigns for disadvantaged young women, says many feel \"locked out\" of better-paid apprenticeships and funnelled down a narrow range of career paths, with gender stereotyping and fears of workplace bullying major deterrents against jobs in male-dominated industries. In contrast, Emily says her experiences have been positive and that, despite being one of only four females out of about 40 apprentices since the scheme began seven years ago, she has felt incredibly well-supported. She wants more young women to come forward: \"I think they're very put off by the fact that it's working outside and you can get dirty... but mostly I think it's that they don't consider it an option, I didn't consider it an option.\"Hanson's head of recruitment, Helen Johnson, says hiring female apprentices is \"a no brainer\". \"Historically females were not told about opportunities in the construction and building materials industry as it was assumed only males would go into it.  We need to change this. There is no reason why females cannot enter our industry,\" says Ms Johnson. Deborah Edmondson, early talent and apprenticeships director with recruitment company Cohesion, believes things are slowly changing, and that \"women are seeing increasing opportunities and challenges in a diverse and fast-paced sector\". Ms Edmondson believes hiring a more diverse workforce of people from varying economic and cultural backgrounds can only benefit employers. \"Diversity within the workforce increases employee morale and teamwork, and increases innovation and innovative thinking, through alternative perspectives and ideas on the same issues,\" she says. At 22, Emily feels there are no barriers to her future progress and can already list some career highlights.\"I flew a drone to assess the size of stock piles of aggregates and I also drove a train, which was a big tick on the bucket list, and I loved it,\" she says.   ","83":"Ever since the world wide web went public in 1993, we have traded our personal data in return for free services from the tech giants. Now a growing number of start-ups think it's about time we took control of our own data and even started making money from it. But do we care enough to bother? Julian Ranger, founder of Digi.me, says working on a turkey farm in his teens was \"the making of me\". Other odd jobs included being a cleaner and a head barman at a nightclub. But an aeronautical engineering degree and a flair for coding eventually saw him working on Tornado F3 fighter jets and developing \"the aeronautical internet\" - a way for weapons systems to communicate securely.This led to a start-up which he and his partners sold for \u00a340m in 2005. Fast-forward more than a decade and the ebullient Mr Ranger finds himself as the champion for citizen data privacy and control through his app Digi.me, founded with \u00a3500,000 of his own money. \"The current dialogue is about sharing less data, but that's worrying. We're not going to get personalised medicine unless we share more data,\" he says. The Digi.me app enables people \"to build a private, highly secure, complete searchable library of your data\".Companies then pay for a digital certificate to gain access to your data with your permission, explains Mr Ranger.\"The data never leaves your device and we never see it. Businesses just access the information it contains. This could be a life insurance company offering health advice and lower premiums because it knows your medical history, for example,\" he says.The more data we share the more targeted and bespoke services can become, argues Mr Ranger, with users receiving financial advice, restaurant recommendations or loyalty rewards as incentives.Digi.me, which took six years and \u00a318m to develop, has more than 100,000 users so far and recently signed an agreement with the UK's National Health Service to allow health data within the app. \"The initial release will cover about 45% of the population,\" says Mr Ranger. Users can then decide who they want to share their health data with. The biggest technical challenge has been making sure data from a wide range of international sources is put into a common format, he says.\"We're industrialising the collection, storage and encryption of all your data on your device. We're changing the world,\" he says. \"This is a social good. I could fail, but this idea will not fail.\"Fighting talk. But the recent revelation that Facebook plans to integrate its Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram messaging services emphasises just how much power the social media giant has accrued - power it has abused by giving app developers access to our data without our explicit consent. \"Facebook says you own your data, but that's like saying you own your body when you're a slave,\" says  Irene Ng, founder of Hub of All Things (HAT) and a professor of marketing and service systems at Warwick University.HAT, a collaboration between seven British universities, has created a cloud-based \"microserver\" it calls a HAT, that acts like a mini fortress for all your personal data. You can decide how to \"spend\" your data because you own the database. \"We really believe in the data economy, we want more data sharing,\" explains Ms Ng, \"but you should have legal rights to share your data with whoever you want in the way you want.\"HAT will operate as the legal and technological infrastructure for personal data exchange in a similar way that Visa and Mastercard function in the payments industry, says Ms Ng. Businesses and non-profit organisations will issue HATs in the same way a bank issues credit cards to its customers.It is an ambitious scheme facing huge challenges around public understanding - only 1,800 HATs have been issued so far - but Ms Ng is convinced the system has the potential to go global.Other players in the \"citizen data\" space, such as People.io and Citizen.me, are giving users the chance to earn small amounts of money in return for willingly participating in quizzes and questionnaires whose answers are useful to marketers.But as it can take \"six to eight weeks to earn around \u00a310\", admits People.io chief executive Nicholas Oliver, \"the challenge is getting a person to care enough about their data to want to control it and spend the effort doing it\".Young people engage with the Tinder-style app - which has been downloaded more than 150,000 times - primarily because they find it fun, he says.Apps that integrate with the People.io system will be able to offer personalised services, whether that's bespoke Spotify playlists or curated news headlines based on what you're currently doing, says Mr Oliver. \"We're trying to create a democratised set of the data Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Apple have on you.\" Web creator Tim Berners-Lee has set up a project called Solid in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is a way of giving users \"the freedom to choose where their data resides and who is allowed to access it\".This is an open-source platform that separates the app program from the data it generates, enabling users to create their own \"personal online data store\" (POD) they control.But the formidable challenge for all these services aiming to give citizens control over their own data is that developers need strong incentives to build apps on their platforms and we need to be persuaded that it's worth participating.More Technology of Business\"There is real potential for third-party mechanisms to give individuals more control over their data,\" says Roger Taylor, chair of the UK government's new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, \"and perhaps also to act on behalf of groups of customers to check that they are being treated fairly. But these intermediaries need to secure the trust of people, while also establishing a sustainable business model.\"And there's the rub. Despite the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018, which led to $120bn (\u00a392bn) being wiped off the firm's stock market value, global user growth continues, albeit at a slower pace. It now has more than 2.2 billion monthly active users. Instagram has grown to more than a billion users.People have short memories it seems, or perhaps we just don't care enough about the privacy and security of our data.But the fightback is beginning.","84":"The claim: The arguments for rent control are overwhelming.Reality Check verdict: It has been helpful for existing tenants in areas with particularly fast-rising rent, but it can be at the expense of new renters. In some places, it has also led to a shortage of supply.  While the arguments for rent control are not overwhelming, it is possible that a well-designed policy combined with significant new homebuilding could be effective.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for a range of measures to help renters in the capital, including rent control.He conceded that as mayor he does not have powers to regulate the rental sector, but said that he would lobby the government to implement rent control.Rent control refers to a variety of ways in which the amount that landlords are allowed to charge may be limited.Deputy Mayor James Murray told Reality Check that he and Westminster North MP Karen Buck would be taking time to look at a package of measures and said, that in addition to rent control, London needs to build a lot of affordable housing.He added that there are already plans to build 11,000 council homes at social rent over the next four years. Standard economic theory is that rent control does not work, because if you force rents down, landlords may decide not to rent out their properties, which reduces the amount of rental property available. So, what has happened in cities that have introduced it?Research conducted at Stanford University looked at the impact of the expansion of rent controls in San Francisco in 1994. The city had originally introduced controls in 1979, which covered buildings with five or more apartments but excluded new-build properties.In 1994, this was expanded to cover any building with more than one household, but still excluded new-builds.The researchers, led by Prof Rebecca Diamond, found that between 1994 and 2010, people who were living in rent-controlled properties had benefited from lower rents by about $2.9bn (\u00a32.2bn) between them.But they found that, coincidentally, renters who came to the city later paid an extra $2.9bn in higher rent over the same period, largely  because of a shortage of available housing.So the expansion of rent control had, in effect, been a transfer of money from newer (generally younger) renters to ones who had been living in the city for longer (and were generally older). Researchers also found that the controls helped accelerate gentrification, because some landlords demolished their older properties in favour of new-builds, which were exempt from the limits. Prof Diamond concluded that what is needed is a form of rent control that means the landlords do not have to pay for all of it, such as government subsidies or tax credits, to help renters absorb price increases. Another example of rent control often cited is Germany, which has one of the lowest home ownership rates in Europe at 51%.In Berlin there are about 1.9 million homes, of which about 1.6 million or 85% are rented.Under the rules introduced in 2015, landlords in 313 of the 11,000 towns and cities in Germany (home to about one-quarter of the population including Berlin and Munich) cannot set rent for new tenants any higher than 10% above the local average from the previous four years. Existing tenants benefit from similar limits. But, again, there are exemptions for newly-refurbished properties and those being rented out for the first time.Research from the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) found that the measure had worked in areas of Germany, such as parts of Berlin, that had experienced the biggest increases in rental prices, with rises of at least 4% in each of the previous four years. But, in other areas subject to rent controls, it had not had the same effect.Susanne Marquardt, from the Berlin Social Science Centre, told the BBC that rent control and stronger rights for tenants had balanced the needs of landlords and tenants for decades and helped encourage long-term thinking by both landlords and renters. But she warned that \"things have changed now as international investors come to the country and see real estate investment opportunities\". This problem involved the loopholes in the system. For example, a landlord may decide to do renovation work on a property and require the existing tenant to pay increased rent of up to 11% of the total cost of the work each year. This can be done without the consent of the renter and has been used to get rid of tenants who could not afford it. The researchers from DIW suggested that the solution would be only to impose rent controls in the areas with the fastest-growing rents.So what does this tell us about London?Rent is high in London, although it has not been rising as fast as house prices and average private rent has barely changed in the last two years.The chart above shows how much rent and house prices in London have risen from a starting point in 2005.Gemma Burgess from Cambridge University's Centre for Housing & Planning Research, points out that the example of cities such as Berlin, where landlords tend to be institutions that own lots of properties, may not be applicable to London. \"The overwhelming majority of landlords in England own one property,\" she says. Her department conducted research for the London Assembly in 2015, which found that minor rent control measures such as a three-year freeze on existing private rents, would not make much difference to affordability.However, it said that more radical measures, such as a cap on private rents set at two-thirds of their current market value, could lead many landlords to sell their properties. She concludes that it will be difficult to find a policy that works. \"I'm very dubious that rent control could help tenants and not reduce the stock of rental properties,\" she says.\"You need to significantly increase supply before you look at rent control.\"What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Tens of thousands of people have come out on to the streets to cheer them on.  They were accompanied by Jyotiraditya Scindia, the general secretary for Uttar Pradesh West, and were surrounded by special security forces. Congress was routed by Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the last general election in 2014 and has found it hard to recover.Many Indians, including those at the Lucknow event, are excited about what her entry into politics will mean for Congress. \"The party workers and supporters are charged up. They are talking about the party winning the elections and ousting Mr Modi to form the next government,\" our correspondent added.  Ms Gandhi has always been considered the more popular of the Gandhi siblings, with many blaming the \"lacklustre leadership\" of her brother for a string of Congress state election defeats between 2014 and 2018.Although she has campaigned extensively for her brother and mother, Sonia Gandhi, in earlier elections, Priyanka had refused a formal political role for herself.But she was appointed the party general secretary for the eastern part of the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh on 23 January.The party has gained some ground in recent state elections and Mr Gandhi's stock has risen, but Congress still faces a tough challenge to beat the BJP and regain power.","86":"Ride-hailing taxi app firm Uber is to launch its initial public offering in April, the Reuters news agency reports.Uber will register securities with US regulator the SEC in April, as well as launching an investor roadshow, Reuters said.Rival Lyft went through the same process on 1 March, and will complete its offering by the end of this month.Both Uber and Lyft confidentially told the regulator they wanted to float on the stock market in 2018.Uber, which started in 2009, was most recently valued at $76bn in the private market. It is seeking a valuation as high as $120bn. Uber has been controversial for disrupting the taxi industry in more than 60 countries. It continues to face opposition from both private hire drivers and regulators in several jurisdictions.The ride-hailing taxi app firm has also faced legal action in the UK and US over its classification of drivers as self-employed contractors, rather than as workers. A series of scandals dogged Uber in 2017, including sexual harassment claims made by female employees, data breaches, the use of illicit software to thwart government regulators, and the forced resignation of its chief executive Travis Kalanick.The controversy is believed to have helped boost Lyft's profile as an alternative service. Lyft started in 2012, and was initially designed as a \"safe\" ride-sharing service in cities that used Facebook profile information to authenticate drivers and users.Ranked as the number two ride-hailing company in the US, it was recently valued at $15bn, and is seeking a valuation of between $20bn and $25bn. Unlike Uber, Lyft - which also offers bike and electric scooter-sharing - is only available in the US and Canada.Drivers in multiple US cities including Connecticut, Chicago, New York and Santa Monica have also protested against Lyft over pay and benefits.Although Lyft has some high profile investors, including Google owner Alphabet and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, some analysts have said the firm may not be a good bet.Both Uber and Lyft are still losing money, despite their rate of growth, and both are investing heavily into autonomous cars.In 2018, Uber saw a 24% increase in revenues and a 37% rise in gross bookings, but its adjusted loss - following a tax benefit - still hit $1.8bn.As for Lyft, as a private firm it did not disclose many financial details, but now that its SEC filing has been made public, some analysts are concerned.Bloomberg columnist Shira Ovide says investors should note that while Lyft's revenues per ride have increased over time, so have the costs per ride.\"None of this may matter to potential IPO investors. [Lyft] has devoted itself to growing fast, and it has.\"That's what new stock buyers seem to want. The company's losses are getting less ugly. And it's good that investors are willing to roll the dice on fresh approaches to transportation and other fields that could use new ways of thinking,\" she wrote.\"Still, Lyft and Uber are aiming for large valuations, so investors should look every which way at revenue and cost economics, and ask the companies when these numbers will materially improve.\"","87":"Fashion retailers JD Sports, Sports Direct and Boohoo, are \"failing to commit\" to reducing their environmental and social impact, MPs say. Amazon, TK Maxx and Missguided were also described by the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) as being among the \"least engaged\" in sustainable fashion and labour market initiatives.The EAC said it was \"shocking\" the firms were \"failing to take action\". Boohoo said the report did not reflect its commitment to sustainability. The findings are part of the EAC's inquiry into the sustainability of the fashion industry.The inquiry was prompted by the popularity of \"fast fashion... cheap clothing, with quick turnover that encourages repurchasing\".Disposable fashion has come under fire, not only for the amount that ends up in landfill, but also because it can release toxic chemicals in production and plastic fibres when it is washed. Last summer the committee wrote to 16 fashion retailers asking what they were doing to cut the environmental and social impact of the clothes and shoes they sell.Specific questions included what the brands were doing about using organic or sustainable cotton; limiting the discharge of hazardous chemicals and the re-use or recycling of unsold stock.The interim report ranks brands according to how \"engaged\" they are in their commitment to sustainable fashion and labour market initiatives. The \"most engaged\" were named as Asos, Marks & Spencer Tesco, Primark and Burberry.All of them use organic or sustainable cotton and old materials and encourage customers to return old clothing.  The \"moderately engaged\" retailers were Next, Debenhams, Arcadia Group and Asda. The EAC said each of them had taken \"some steps\" to address environmental sustainability issues. All of them except Next run a return scheme for discarded clothes and all of them except Asda use organic cotton in some clothes. Kurt Geiger was also approached but did not respond to requests for written evidence, the EAC said. The retailers were also asked if they were members of the ACT (Action, Collaboration, Transformation) labour rights and living wage agreement and the SCAP (Sustainable Clothing Action Plan) to reduce their carbon, water and waste footprint.With the exception of Burberry all the other \"moderately engaged\" and \"most engaged\" retailers participated in one or other or both of these schemes. Of the six \"least engaged\" retailers none was a member of either of these initiatives,In a statement, Boohoo said it wanted to \"re-iterate its commitment to being involved in the ongoing discussion on the sustainability of fashion. \"This initial report does not fully reflect the policies and procedures and independent initiatives that we have in place, or the extent of our ongoing commitment in the area of sustainability.\" JD Sports said \"As a business, we participate in a number of ethical initiatives which fall outside the narrow list referred to in the Committee's report.\" It added that most of the group's sales came from third party brands, including \"two [Nike and Adidas] internationally recognised as industry leaders with regards to driving sustainability\". \"Private label sales make up the rest of the Group's sales and there is an ongoing project to review options on improving the sustainability of our manufactured garments,\" it added.Amazon declined to comment.EAC chair Mary Creagh said: \"It's shocking to see that a group of major retailers are failing to take action to promote environmental sustainability and protect their workers. \"By publishing this information, customers can choose whether they want to spend money with a company that is doing little to protect the environment or promote proper wages for garment workers. \"We hope this motivates underperforming retailers to start taking responsibility for their workers and their environmental impact.\" The committee concluded that the UK fashion industry's current business model was \"clearly unsustainable, especially with a growing middle-class population and rising levels of consumption across the globe\". \"Least engaged\": JD Sports, Sports Direct, Boohoo, Amazon, TK Maxx, Missguided \"Moderately engaged\": Next, Debenhams, Arcadia Group, Asda. \"Most engaged\": Asos, Marks & Spencer Tesco, Primark and Burberry.Kurt Geiger did not respond to the EAC's requestsThe committee said it intended to publish its final report in the coming weeks in which it will outline recommendations for government policies to \"encourage a more transparent, fair and sustainable fashion system\".Francois Souchet of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation said the committee was right that the \"fashion industry's current business model cannot work in the long term\".He said worldwide one truckload of clothing was landfilled or incinerated every second, while less than 1% of old clothing goes on to be used to make new clothes. \"We need a redesign for the fashion industry, so business models increase clothing's use, clothing is made from safe and renewable materials and old clothing is used to make new clothes.\" ","88":"Streaming service Netflix has said it will remove footage of a real-life rail disaster from the film Bird Box.The company confirmed in January that the popular thriller contained a brief clip from Canada's deadly Lac-M\u00e9gantic tragedy. The excerpt was used early in the film to depict a fictional news story about an apocalyptic scenario. Netflix had initially said it would not substitute the footage in question. In a brief emailed statement to the BBC on Thursday, the company confirmed that, along with the filmmakers of Bird Box, it has decided to replace the clip. \"We're sorry for any pain caused to the Lac-M\u00e9gantic community,\" the statement said, without giving a reason for changing its decision. Over 45 people were killed in 2013 when a train carrying crude oil derailed in the Quebec town of Lac-M\u00e9gantic. Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed.The process to replace the clip worldwide with an outtake from a TV series will take several weeks, the company said. In January, Quebec's culture minister wrote to the CEO of Netflix urging the company to have the clips removed. On Twitter on Thursday she wrote that the streaming service's change of heart \"demonstrates that by staying united and working together, anything is possible\". Bird Box was not the only Netflix production containing images of the deadly runaway train disaster. Similar footage was found to have been used in the Canadian-American science-fiction drama Travelers.In the show's third season, images of Lac-M\u00e9gantic's blazing downtown core could be briefly seen illustrating fictional news coverage of a nuclear attack in London. Those clips were later removed. At the time, the stock footage vendor that provided the production company behind the show Travelers said it deeply regretted the footage being \"taken out of context and used in entertainment programming\".It said would contact customers who had purchased any related clips to make them aware \"of the sensitive nature of this footage\".","89":"The propulsion of senator and lawyer Kamala Harris to front-runner status among the Democrats hoping to take on President Donald Trump in 2020 has underlined the resurgent political power of her home state.A California senator is one of the front-runners for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. A California congresswoman is Speaker of the House of Representatives. California's new governor is a young, progressive champion promising to offer an alternative to the \"corruption and incompetence\" of Donald Trump's White House.The so-called Golden State has become solidly Democrat blue, and its politicians are flexing their muscles on the national stage. But this golden opportunity doesn't come without risk for the progressive cause.A campaign kick-off is a political show of force. It's a chance to demonstrate that a candidate's appeal exists beyond op-ed think-pieces, lines on a fund-raising report or clicks on a social media post. Nothing drives home the potential of ballot-box success quite like a throng of faces in a cheering crowd.On a warm Sunday afternoon at a public square in Oakland, California, Kamala Harris made just such a statement, packing in an estimated 20,000 people as she officially launched her presidential bid.\"These are not ordinary times, and this is not an ordinary election, but this is our America,\" the California senator said. \"At stake is not the leadership of our party and our country. It is the right to moral leadership of this planet.\" Her speech, carried live on US cable news networks, was geared towards a national audience, including promises of universal healthcare and pre-kindergarten childcare, debt-free college, a working- and middle-class tax cut, and an immigration system that welcomes refugees and provides some undocumented migrants a pathway to citizenship. The choice of this northern California city across the bay from San Francisco to launch her campaign, however, was no accident for the woman just two years into her first term in Washington. It's where Ms Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, was born. It's also where she first held public office, as a deputy district attorney. Oakland, she notes, is where she stood before a judge as a prosecutor for the first time and said \"five words that would guide my life\" - \"Kamala Harris, for the people\". It's a line she has now adopted as her campaign slogan.Ms Harris would go on to rise through the ranks, first as San Francisco district attorney and then California attorney general, before making the leap to the Senate. \"It's exciting to see someone from California, from the Bay area, run for president,\" says Danny Marquis, a dentist from San Francisco who brought her 11-year-old son, Gabe, to the event.\"She represents some of my values, somebody who's hardy, who has been out there and who has walked the walk that I'm on right now, who will fight for and represent people like me.\"Ajay Bhutoria, a Fremont, California, business consultant who served on the national finance committee for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, says the turnout on Sunday shows just how desperate people are for change.\"California is the leader in innovation, and they're sending a message today,\" he says. Bhutoria adds that while he's still keeping an open mind over whom he will support, Ms Harris is a \"great candidate\". The senator's potential was being heralded on the national level even before Sunday's choreographed launch in front of her hometown fans.Liberal cable news host Rachel Maddow recently said Ms Harris had a \"good chance\" of being the 2020 Democratic nominee. An analysis on the election forecasting site fivethirtyeight.com said she \"comes out looking stronger than any other potential candidate\". New York Times columnist David Leonhardt wrote a piece titled, simply, \"Kamala Harris, a front-runner\".Given the size of the field - and the fact that the first nominating contest is more than a year away - these kinds of predictions are risky. At this point in 2015, many Republicans were busy fitting Jeb Bush with their party's crown, after all.The conventional consensus, however, is that Ms Harris is at the head of the pack - and California is a big reason why.The state is a fund-raising power base with little parallel. In the 24 hours after Ms Harris announced, she reported $1.5m (\u00a31.1m) in donations, breaking a record set by Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016. Last year her campaign committee and related fund-raising organisations brought in more than $23m, with six-figure contributions from individuals associated with entertainment giant WarnerMedia, the University of California, Los Angeles based Creative Artists Agency and the parent company of Bay area tech giant Google.California's primary also has an influential spot in the 2020 calendar, having moved from June in 2016 to early March. If Ms Harris can stay in the race that long - and it certainly seems she will have the money to do it - the senator could be poised to reap the mother lode of Democratic convention delegates in her home state.Of course, being near the top will also make her a lightning-rod for attacks from opponents. While she emphasised her prosecutorial background in her opening speech, she's drawn fire for her handling of crime-lab misconduct while the San Francisco district attorney. She has also been criticised from the left for what some see as an insufficient support of criminal justice reform while she was California attorney general.Her relationship in the mid-1990s with then-speaker of the state assembly Willie Brown, who was married and 30 years her elder, may also become a target. Mr Brown went on to become mayor of San Francisco and has said his influence may have helped Ms Harris win her district attorney job and get her appointments to state commissions.A longtime Harris aide was recently forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations after reports that California paid a $400,000 legal settlement dating back to Ms Harris's time as attorney general. In the era of #MeToo, how much Ms Harris knew of his behaviour will surely be questioned.With only two years on the national stage, Ms Harris's campaigning abilities - and record - will be tested in a white-hot crucible. Surviving politics in California as a Democrat is one thing; making it on a national playing field is a challenge only a handful can survive.Ms Harris may be seeking the top prize, but her presidential announcement was only the capstone on a month that thrust the state of California firmly onto the national stage. It began with San Francisco Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi returning as Speaker of the House of Representatives after eight years in the political wilderness.It wouldn't take long to demonstrate just how much power the San Franciscan now wields, as she faced down the president in the 35-day battle over border-wall funding and the resulting government shutdown.In November Democrats picked up 40 seats in the chamber - seven from California alone, primarily in what was long thought to be the solidly conservative Los Angeles suburbs of Orange County. Mr Trump's unpopularity in California essentially eviscerated the state's pro-business, socially moderate Republican Party in the land that once helped vault Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan to presidential success.\"There was an old Reagan quote that 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help' were the scariest words,\" says Bill Whalen, a fellow at Stanford University's conservative-leaning Hoover Institution. \"Those words don't scare people in California anymore.\"For the first time the largest state in the US both in terms of people and economic muscle speaks almost entirely with one political voice. And the message it's sending stands in stark contrast to the Trump-style conservatism that has dominated the national conversation for the past two years.A few days after Ms Pelosi used her gavel to usher in a Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives, she flew back west to have a front-row seat at the inauguration of California's newly elected governor, Gavin Newsom.Under tents erected to ward off the rain at the state capitol in Sacramento - just over an hour's drive north of the Oakland square where Ms Harris formally started her presidential bid three weeks later - the 51-year-old former California lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco had his moment in the spotlight. He used his inaugural address to lash out at the \"corruption and incompetence\" of the White House and position his state as the liberal counterweight to Donald Trump's America.\"The country is watching us,\" he said. \"The world is waiting on us. The future depends on us. And we will seize this moment.\"Outside the tents, Mr Newsom's spirit was contagious.\"California is the resistance to the Trump administration,\" says San Jose schoolteacher Andrea Reyna. \"We're the fifth-largest economy in the world by having strong leaders who are voices for equality, who are voices for freedom. It gives us a privilege and thus a responsibility to take a lead.\"This idea of California's special obligation as a progressive beacon permeated the inaugural proceedings in the state capitol.\"As everybody has been saying, California has been the place where policy experimentation has created amazing results,\" says Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor who now teaches at the University of California - Berkeley and served as master of ceremonies for the inauguration of the state's lieutenant governor. \"This is California's moment to shine.\"It's hard to dispute those claims right now, as California - and the Democrats in power - are riding high. The state has been the engine fuelling the record-breaking US economic expansion, accounting for a fifth of the nation's economic growth since 2010. In 2017 its gross domestic product expanded by 4.7% - more than twice the rate of the US as a whole. Per-capita income is rising faster than any other state, and its government budget is running a multi-billion dollar surplus, giving Mr Newsom flexibility to enact sweeping new social programmes.\"Think of everything Democrats want to do in Washington but can't - universal healthcare, more entitlements, more rules, more regulations - without backlash from an opposition party or the public,\" says Whalen. \"California is really the Democratic dream in that regard, and the Newsom administration is putting that dream to the test.\"In his inaugural address, the newly sworn-in governor did, in fact, talk about dreams, although he styled his progressive priorities as the \"California dream\" - of good jobs, quality education and a comfortable retirement.\"Not to get rich quick or star on the big screen, but to work hard and share in the rewards,\" Mr Newsom said. \"To leave a better future for our kids.\"After the speech, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti - who is contemplating his own presidential campaign - expanded on the governor's thoughts.\"Certainly people dream in other states, but nobody talks about the Missouri dream or the Alabama dream,\" he says. \"This is a unique place that almost the whole world knows, even if they've never been here. They feel California as at once an idea and a place.\"As if to drive home the point that California politics and the Trump administration are headed on an ideological collision course, just a few days after Mr Newsom's inaugural salvo, the president lashed out at the state via Twitter, threatening to withhold disaster relief funds for victims of the state's recent spate of fatal forest fires \"unless they get their act together\".California Democrats dreaming big - and holding their state up as an example to the rest of the US and even the rest of the world - could seem in some ways inevitable. The most formidable state in the US, run by progressives under progressive policies, would appear destined to produce ambitious politicians intent on translating the success of their state into national prominence.This sense of inevitability, however, is a relatively recent development.\"California is a funny place,\" says UCLA lecturer and former Los Angeles Times reporter Jim Newton. \"You don't have to look back very far for it to be fairly reliably Republican. This notion of it being an absolutely rock solid Democratic bastion is a relatively new phenomenon.\"Mr Newsom's inauguration, in fact, marked the first time since the 1870s that two Democrats in a row have occupied the California governor's mansion. Ms Harris is the first California politician to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in a quarter century.Part of the reason for this is generational. Jerry Brown, California's governor for the last eight years, was in his 70s during his second stint in office, after serving two terms in the 1970s and early '80s. He had already run for president three times, in 1976, 1980 and 1992, and his national ambitions were long since dimmed.Dianne Feinstein, the state's senior senator, is in her 80s, and Ms Harris predecessor, Barbara Boxer, never showed interest in a White House bid.With a new cadre of Democrats taking the reins comes new ambitions.It's more than that, however. For long stretches over the past three decades, California has been an economic basket case. The state was devastated by the recession of the early 1990s, the tech bubble collapse of 2002 and the Great Recession in 2008.\"In 2010, the conventional wisdom was that California was headed the way of Greece; that it was ungovernable\" says Newton. \"People were openly debating the question of what would happen if a state the size of California declared bankruptcy. It was called, quite literally, a failed state.\"Part of the reason California suffers so grievously in times of economic downturn is because the state is heavily dependent on income and corporate taxes as a revenue stream. When people and corporations make less money, once bursting government coffers quickly go empty.And so while California Democrats are touting the opportunities that California can present as a model of progressive success, the flip side of this opportunity is danger. If California fails - if it slips back into an economic morass - it will quickly become a conservative cautionary tale instead of a liberal beacon. In a front row at Mr Newsom's inauguration, like a ghost of presidential ambitions past, was a man who provides a telling example of just how quickly California fortunes can change.Democrat Gray Davis was elected governor of California in 1998, breaking a Republican hold on the job that stretched back to the end of Mr Brown's first stint in 1982. The Golden State was booming, and government spending shot up. The milquetoast Davis was even being bandied about as a future presidential contender. Shortly after Mr Davis's 2002 re-election, however, the dotcom collapse eviscerated California's economy. Revenues plummeted, and Mr Davis' attempts to raise state fees to compensate led to a voter rebellion that ended in his 2003 recall election and replacement by actor-turned-Republican-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.After Mr Newsom gave his speech, Mr Davis reflected on his experience.\"Recessions can take a $15 or $20bn surplus and make it a $15 or $20bn deficit,\" he says. \"I think [Mr Newsom] appreciates all the hard work and tough decisions that led to this phenomenal surplus, and I don't think he wants to be the person who squanders that.\"Already there are some dark linings to the silver clouds of Californian prosperity. Profits - and stock valuations - for high-profile Silicon Valley companies like Apple, Facebook and Tesla are down. Property values, which have been skyrocketing, are starting to soften. And in major metropolitan areas where they aren't, working-class families have long since been priced out of desirable homes and neighbourhoods. While the state leads the way in economic growth, it is also tied with Louisiana and Florida for the highest poverty rate in the US, at 19%. More than 130,000 Californians are homeless, with Los Angeles second only to New York City among US cities.\"It's a complicated story,\" says Whalen. \"I can take you to parts of California, and you will fall in love with it. But there are problems with the blue paradise, as well.\"If the economy falters, the problems that Whalen suggests - homelessness, a lack of adequate healthcare, overcrowding and traffic in the cities, and an uneven quality of public education - will get worse as the money dries up.  The progressive challenge over the coming months will be to find a way to enact their priorities on healthcare, the environment, education and immigration while insulating the state from the business cycle's inevitable downturn.Their success or failure will clearly impact upon the national ambitions of men like Mr Newsom and Mr Garcetti, but even Ms Harris - whose presidential campaign will try to cast a broader net - could be tarnished.Already the senator is taking heat for her time as the state's attorney general and a San Francisco city prosecutor, during which critics say was she was not sufficiently supportive of criminal justice reform. If the Democratic regime in California, of which she was recently a part, oversees a budgetary train wreck in the coming year, it will be difficult for her campaign to emerge unscathed.Whalen doesn't think Democrats are up to the task. UCLA's Newton, on the other hand, sees this as the party's biggest challenge - and opportunity.\"There's going to be a downturn, and how Newsom handles that really will help send the message of whether this state is something different or just better than most at riding an upward business cycle,\" he says.And even if the things stay stable, the cadres of ambitious California Democrats - including Ms Harris, Mr Garcetti, Mr Newsom, and others - will have to prove that their state really is a model that can be applied to the nation as a whole.\"For this state to be meaningful beyond electing liberal leaders,\" Newton says, \"it has to show that there is something qualitatively different about what it's like to live under this government than it is under a Trump government. \"If this is a state that can manage wealth, that can handle downturns, it can balance economic growth and environmental protection, that can be welcoming to immigrants at a time when the rest of the country is unsure of that, that's a genuine counterproposal.\"In the days and months ahead, this progressive counterproposal will be put to the test - in California and among Democratic primary voters across the US.Follow Anthony on Twitter.","90":"When Claire Bell became pregnant she paid for a test that would indicate whether the baby had Down's Syndrome - and agreed to be screened for some other rare conditions at the same time. Not long afterwards, writes the BBC's Charlotte Hayward, she received what appeared to be terrible news.For five years, Claire Bell's husband was treated for two types of cancer. When it finally came to an end the couple decided to try having a baby through IVF, using some sperm her husband had had frozen and stored before he had chemotherapy. On the first round, at the age of 41, she became pregnant - and felt incredibly lucky.\"It was this miraculous pregnancy,\" she says. \"It had worked with the first embryo.\"The couple decided that they wanted to know if there was a chance that the baby had Down's Syndrome and privately paid for a blood test known as NIPT - a non-invasive prenatal test - which examines the DNA of tiny particles of the placenta circulating in the mother's blood.\"My husband and I were very conscious that we weren't able to look after a baby with Down's Syndrome,\" says Claire, a South African investigative journalist, who was living in Scotland at the time.\"We just felt we didn't have the emotional reserves, after dealing with five years of cancer treatment.\"She signed up for the test at a private IVF clinic. As she did so, the clinician asked her if she wanted to tick a box which meant that the placenta DNA would also be tested for other rare chromosomal conditions.\"They said to me, 'Well if you don't tick it then we can't tell you the gender of the child.' I didn't want to know the gender but my husband did, so I thought, 'All right then.'\"At that point I thought, 'Is the onus on me to ask more questions about that box?' But I was a pregnant mum in a vulnerable state - I wasn't acting like I normally would. Really, they should have told me what that box was about.\" (In a statement, the clinic Claire went to says its patients are \"explicitly counselled on the use of the test and possible outcomes\" and that they are given a full explanation of the conditions NIPT may detect - as well as an explanation of the test's limitations.)The clinic told Claire that she'd get an email if everything was OK, but they'd ring if there was something to discuss.Just over a week later, while Claire and her husband were on holiday in France, the phone rang. Claire was in the shower at the time, and hurried out to answer the call.\"I ran towards this phone\u2026 and while I was standing there, shivering in a towel, the doctor told me that my baby had a chance of having Turner Syndrome.\"Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition that only affects girls. There are a number of potential symptoms, including being short and having fertility problems.But the information Claire was sent by the clinic painted a very grim picture of life for people with Turner Syndrome. It also talked about the test's reliability. \"I just remember thinking this is science, this is fact\u2026 I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't walk more than 200m at a time, I just felt hopeless.\"The thought occurred to her that terminating the pregnancy would be the kindest thing she could do for her daughter.But later in the day, Claire spoke to a friend who encouraged her to find out more about the test. And when she did, she found that her result might not be as troubling as it seemed.Listen to Charlotte Hayward's report into NIPT on the Today programme on Friday 8 February, or catch up later on iPlayerNIPT has been available privately in the UK since 2012 and is available to any woman or couple who want to pay the bill of up to \u00a3500. It's mainly used to screen for Down's Syndrome and two other chromosomal anomalies, Edwards Syndrome and Patau Syndrome. Medical professionals agree that, when used correctly, it is pretty reliable as a test for these conditions.NIPT for Down's, Edwards and Patau syndromes has recently become available to pregnant women on the NHS in Wales who are considered to be in the higher chance category, and it has been promised to women in England in the same category in the near future.But when testing for other rarer conditions NIPT hasn't been subjected to rigorous clinical analysis. An article in the medical journal Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynaecology argues that when NIPT is used to screen for these conditions, including Turner syndrome (when a girl has only one copy of the X chromosome) or Klinefelter syndrome (when a boy has two copies of the X chromosome and one Y chromosome) it has \"a high failure rate\" - a low detection rate and a high false positive rate. One of the authors of that report, Kypros Nicolaides, professor of foetal medicine at King's College Hospital, says that women who have received a disturbing NIPT result in a private clinic often fall back on the NHS for help.\"There is an ideology in the private sector that the more the better,\" he says.\"In the NIPT test they offer a whole range of conditions that they test for, for which we have no data about how effective and how worthwhile the method of screening is. There are many women that are having expanded tests, they come, they are extremely worried, they have an the invasive test which is what they wanted to avoid, and it shows that the result of the NIPT test is wrong.\"Want help?Contact the Turner Syndrome Support SocietySee also: NHS information on Turner SyndromeThe invasive test Kypros Nicolaides is referring to either involves a placenta biopsy, or amniocentesis - sampling of the fluid in the amniotic sac - both of which carry a small risk of miscarriage.Claire Bell did not have an invasive test, because the more she read about the NIPT test as a method of screening for Turner Syndrome the more sceptical she became.She read on the internet about women whose babies had been judged to be at high risk of Turner Syndrome but who had turned out not to have it. She also read about one woman whose doctor had told her the test was so unreliable you might as well flip a coin.Then she read that the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test for Turner Syndrome - the proportion of positive and negative results that are indeed true positives and true negatives - could be as low as 40% for a 41-year-old woman.She called back the doctor who had told her about her result on the phone and asked if this could be correct.\"Yes, but we don't know,\" he said. Still at a loss about what to do for the best, Claire called her aunt. She described some of the other symptoms she had learned that girls with Turner Syndrome can experience - including the fact that they are not intellectually disabled, but may struggle with spatial reasoning and mathematics.\"You can't terminate a baby because she might be short, flat-chested and can't do maths,\" her aunt said. \"And besides, we are from strong Yorkshire stock. You know that. Don't let them stick a needle into you.\"Slipping into journalist mode, Claire talked to the laboratory that tested her blood and asked how often they followed up to find out whether a baby given a test result indicating a high risk of Turner Syndrome actually turned out to have it. The answer was, they didn't do this.The scientist she spoke to at the lab noted that she didn't seem to have been given the recommended pre-test counselling, so she rang her clinic to ask why this was.Her doctor replied that in the US she would have been given four hours of counselling before the test but that in the UK there weren't enough genetic counsellors. (The clinic Claire attended says patients are given advice and counselling on the false positive statistics for the test. It adds that it \"informs patients of all test results in a secure, sensitive and supportive manner\" and that while it does not provide specific genetic counselling, it supports patients in collaboration with a consultant obstetrician on aftercare and referral pathways.)Continuing to dig, and reading articles in medical journals, she was astonished to find that the very company that invented the test had itself suggested that it may not be appropriate for general prenatal screening for conditions such as Turner Syndrome. Instead, it said, it \"may be best utilised\" in cases where there was a  family history of a similar chromosomal anomaly, or where an ultrasound scan had given reason to suppose that such an anomaly could be present.\"The thought that I could have terminated this pregnancy, that it crossed my mind to terminate, that is\u2026\" she says, pausing to find the right words. \"It's just so important that women know that this test has too many false positives.\"In June 2018 Claire's daughter, Fintry, was born. She is small, but there are short genes in the family. She shows no symptoms of Turner Syndrome.Claire will take Fintry for a blood test after her first birthday to find out if she does have the condition, but not before.\"I wanted her to be a whole person in my mind, for me to know her totally before she gets a condition attached to her,\" Claire says.\"She is healthy, beautiful and full of smiles.\"In its statement, the clinic says it \"supports best evidence-based practice for all patients, and believes that it continues to operate ethically, professionally and in the best interest of the patient\".It adds: \"We will continue to work to professional standards while enabling men and women the right to choose.\"Analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC News head of statisticsIf a condition is very rare, the majority of positive screening tests are health scares, and so the technical accuracy rates are misleading.A test result can sound like a near certain diagnosis when the test says it's 95% accurate. But in many cases, it is still most likely that your child is perfectly fine. \"Ninety-five per cent accurate\" means something to regulators and statisticians, but doesn't tell you the chance that your positive result will lead to a diagnosis.It means, for example, that five out of every 100 healthy people tested will get a health scare: a false positive. But if it's a rare condition - say less than one-in-100 - then most of the positive test results will be health scares. Medical professionals agree that for Down's Syndrome and some other conditions, the technical accuracy of the test is the right level to give helpful guidance. But that isn't the case for rarer conditions like Turner Syndrome. So ask your doctor before making any big decisions and, if you are tempted to ask Dr Google, look for how common the condition is before jumping to any conclusions.

The firm, which helps business clients to procure gas and electricity, said it had been unable to raise enough cash to cover its debts. It also said a plan to sell the business had fallen through.The collapse of Utilitywise (UTW) comes after a last-ditch rescue bid by the Newcastle-based company's founder, Geoffrey Thompson.Last month, it emerged it needed \u00a310m to keep its business afloat, after coming up against \"unexpected challenges and legacy issues\". After failing to clinch the investment from shareholders, the company put itself up for sale at the end of January. But in a statement on its website on Wednesday, it said the formal sale process for the group announced by the board \"did not result in any offers\". \"Consequently, the directors of UTW sought the appointment of administrators.\"The firm has appointed FTI Consulting to handle the administration process and said its energy brokerage business would stop trading immediately.However, its other subsidiary companies will continue trading while buyers for those parts of the group are sought.Mr Thompson, who stepped down from the board two years ago, built UTW from a bedroom in South Shields into a multi-million-pound business listed on the AIM stock exchange.According to a report in the Sunday Telegraph, the firm had recently warned staff it could not guarantee it could pay them in March.","92":"Just months after the end of World War One, a strike over working hours led to huge crowds in Glasgow's George Square and fears it could be the start of a full-scale socialist revolution.The ensuing violence became known as Bloody Friday, with the crowds being beaten by police batons and the Riot Act being read for one of the last times. It led the government in London to take desperate measures to help bring the city under control.They deployed more than 10,000 troops to restore order and six tanks were sent north along with 100 motor-lorries.By the following morning machine-gun posts had been set up on top of high buildings in Glasgow centre and thousands of troops were billeted across the city.The catalyst for the events of 31 January 1919 was a strike, called as part of a campaign for shorter working hours.According to military historian Gordon Barclay: \"The strike had an overtly political aim: to force the government to step in to regulate industry.\"Many in government believed that it had a more profoundly political, or even revolutionary, aim.\"During WW1, Glasgow had played a vital role in the munitions industry and there was a 54-hour working week in factories and shipyards.The Clyde Workers Committee (CWC) - an informal body made up of shop stewards from different trade unions - was leading a campaign to cut that to 40 hours.This was partly an altruistic move designed to help create jobs for the thousands of soldiers returning from the war. The committee leaders called a general strike, which began on 27 January.Two days later, a CWC deputation went to Glasgow's City Chambers to ask the lord provost to put their demands to the government.They left him in no doubt that \"drastic action\" would be taken if their demand was not met.One of the strike leaders, Manny Shinwell, said that if it was not settled by the end of the week they would not hesitate to \"stop every tramcar, shut off every light and generally paralyse the business of the city\". It was clear the organisers intended to bring employees of the city-owned power stations and tram system out on strike, but the government were concerned they could go even further.The revolution in Russia was just over a year old and Germany had recently undergone an uprising that saw the monarchy overthrown, so the cabinet in London was rattled by the unrest in Glasgow.It was just 82 days since the Armistice had ended the fighting in WW1, but the war cabinet was still sitting and the first item on its agenda on 30 January was the situation in Scotland's largest city.Mr Barclay makes the point that the cabinet wanted to send troops to prevent disorder and keep services going.However, he says the civil authorities were responsible for law and order and the military could not step in unless martial law was declared.  The war cabinet's plans involved deploying troops from across Scotland and England and sending six tanks north by train to assist the civil authorities if they were requested.On the morning of Friday 31 January, tens of thousands of people marched to George Square.A large red flag, the symbol of Marxist socialism, was carried into the square as the crowd gathered to hear the lord provost deliver the government's response.However, the government had already rejected the 40-hour working week demand, preferring instead to talk to the official trade unions nationally.A deputation from the CWC, including Davie Kirkwood and Manny Shinwell, went into the City Chambers to meet the provost, while Willie Gallacher addressed the crowd outside in the square.A BBC documentary made in the 1970s heard eyewitness accounts of how a tram car had tried to get into the square but found it impossible to get through.They said some people tried to overturn the tram, hammering at the glass and pushing at the car.Estimates from the time say there were 20,000 to 25,000 people in the square, although some claim many more.There were originally about 70 police who were later joined by another 70 officers. However, they were drastically outnumbered and unable to cope with the crowd.According to the documentary, the police charged at the crowd, beating them indiscriminately with batons.Suddenly the Sheriff of Lanarkshire Mr A Mackenzie appeared at a corner of George Square and started to read the Riot Act, declaring the gathering unlawful and ordering the crowds to disperse.The paper was snatched out of the sheriff's hand and the city's superintendent had to finish reading it.Writing years later, Willie Gallacher said: \"Men were sprawling all around, and just beneath where I was standing a woman was lying on her side and on her face was the mark of a muddy boot.\"According to eyewitnesses, Gallacher dived at the police chief constable and he was beaten with a baton and arrested.Davie Kirkwood ran out of the City Chambers to plead for a stop to the violence and was also beaten.The fighting raged all over the square and in adjacent streets.In North Frederick Street, the police were driven back when the strikers seized a lorry full of empty bottles and used them as missiles.The strikers withdrew to Glasgow Green where fighting continued with police.Sporadic fighting went on late into the night in some neighbourhoods, with tramcars smashed and shop windows broken and their stock looted.Gallacher, Kirkwood, Shinwell and other leaders were arrested.In London, the war cabinet met as the riot raged in Glasgow.Scottish Secretary Robert Munro is said to have called the protest \"a Bolshevist uprising\".Pre-prepared orders for troops to be sent to the city, as well as the tanks and lorries, were put in motion.According to Mr Barclay, the first troops arrived about 22:00 and continued to reach the city throughout the night.The historian says it is unclear exactly where all the troops came from, although it seems likely that most were Scottish regiments and many were based near Edinburgh.Mr Barclay says troops from Glasgow were removed from the units so they did not find themselves facing friends and family.Troops from the Royal Scots Fusiliers, who were based at Maryhill Barracks in Glasgow, were also not used.There appears to have been two English regiments among the troops - The East Surrey Regiment, who had probably been based near Bridge of Allan at the time, and the Durham Light Infantry from the north east of England.The morning after the riot, Glasgow woke up to find armed troops patrolling George Square and machine guns on the roof of the Post Office and North British Hotel.By Monday, there were six tanks parked in the Cattle Market.Mr Barclay says the military stayed in the city until 17 February but there is little indication that they were required to do anything noteworthy.Just over a week after the Battle of George Square, the strike was over and a settlement was reached on the basis of a 47-hour working week. This was a victory for the workers in the short term but it did not seriously challenge the role of the bosses.Six CWC leaders and six others were put on trial.Only Shinwell, who went on to become a Labour MP, and Gallacher were convicted.There is little evidence that the leaders of the strikes and demonstrations ever considered challenging the authority of the British government. For most of the strikers and demonstrators the protests on Clydeside were about wages, working conditions and unfair rents. Speaking more than 40 years later, Willie Gallacher regretted the missed opportunity.\"We should have been staging a workers' revolution but we hadn't sufficient political understanding.\"In his memoir, Revolt on the Clyde, he said: \"A rising was expected. A rising should have taken place. \"The workers were ready to effect it; the leadership had never thought of it.\"","93":"\"From the Netherlands with love\" is how Chayenne Wiskerke promotes her onions. The fourth-generation farmer has grown the family company into the Netherlands' largest onion producer.But still, Brexit makes her feel helpless.\"There isn't much we can do,\" she says. \"We have to wait for the UK.\"\"If things stay as they are now we would all be stuck in transit and that's not good for business or customers.\"The current border-free frictionless trade zone means British supermarkets can order crates of onions from the Netherlands in the morning and sell them within 24 hours.Approximately \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a31bn; $1.4bn) worth of Dutch fruit and vegetables are exported to the UK annually \u2013 that's 50,000 trucks crossing the channel every year.An Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study found that Dutch exports to the UK could drop by 17% in the event of a no-deal Brexit.While the UK's customs authority HMRC says it has \"well-developed plans\" for a functioning system from day one, fruit and vegetables are the Dutch exports most vulnerable to disruption. Exporters operate on a \"just-in-time\" principle to ensure customers receive the freshest possible produce. Additional checks for plant health, food safety and marketing standards could create tailbacks at customs.Some officials predict a 30% increase in import inspections and a 100% increase in export inspections. Deliveries currently made within a day could take two to three days. German cars can afford to wait. Dutch tomatoes cannot, and delays reduce shelf-life.  \"The nightmare is our tomatoes and cucumbers rotting at the border,\" says Gert Mulder, director of GroentenFruit Huis, the national fruit and vegetable growers' body. \"British supermarkets have stock for around three days. They don't have any storage capacity,\" he points out.\"So it would have to be built. But there isn't time. The orders have already been placed. The plants are already growing. \"Of course we read about the British who are stockpiling food. If the supply chain fails the shelves will be empty. It is our job as producers to find a solution.\" The Dutch have come with an idea designed to fast-track perishable products - and they call it \"green lanes\":For Mart Valstar, a typical Dutch exporter who sends vegetables to the UK, the innovation makes sense.\"We'll prepare the documents for export and for our clients to import in the UK and then our trucks will get a certificate on a green lane that they roll on the boat, roll off the boat, direct to our customers,\" he says.The alternative, he fears, is three or four days' delay at UK harbours, with knock-on congestion on the Dutch side too.The technology is ready to roll out. But there is a catch \u2013 it must be agreed by the UK.\"The British cabinet members I've spoken to push it away,\" Gert Mulder explains in frustration. \"Within days after Article 50 was triggered, we were already talking to (the UK ministry) Defra. The problem is we need the British to make decisions and we can't have bilateral talks until after the Brexit negotiations.\"The UK's customs authority told the BBC that keeping goods flowing across the border was of vital importance, but it would not compromise on UK border security.A no-deal Brexit will cost the Netherlands an estimated \u20ac2.3bn by 2023, according to the Dutch Court of Audit. Some 35,000 Dutch companies only export to the current customs union. When the UK leaves, they'll have to deal with customs for the first time. In an effort to smooth the transition, the Dutch government is hiring more than 900 customs, agricultural and veterinary inspectors. Many of the new recruits have come from Eastern Europe, due to an absence of qualified vets at home. But they are still struggling to fill all the positions.\"We only have about 350 trained officials,\" said Pieter Omtzigt, the Dutch parliament's Brexit rapporteur.\"The day you need them most is Brexit day, because you'll have lots of businesses that are unprepared. If we need hundreds of new inspectors, the British are going to need thousands.\"And then there's Rotterdam \u2013 the biggest harbour in the EU. If the British export system gets clogged up it will have an impact on global trade. The United States, China, Russia, and Brazil could all feel the ripple-effect. Dutch producers fear the dominant trade routes will become congested and traffic will be diverted from French ports to depart from Belgium and the Netherlands. \"We are looking at alternative markets inside the EU: Bulgaria, Romania,\" Gert Mulder says. \"The market in eastern Europe is not as lucrative as the UK, but we're looking at options.\"","94":"The founder of cash-strapped Indian airline Jet Airways has stepped down as chairman of the company. Naresh Goyal's resignation is likely to pave the way for potential investors to save India's oldest private carrier. They were held back by Mr Goyal's reluctance to give up control of the company, reports say. Jet's debt exceeds $1bn (\u00a3750m) and the airline has grounded some flights as it is struggling to pay employees, suppliers and leasing companies.Within minutes of Monday's announcement, the company's stock jumped 12%. In a stock market filing which also announced the resignation, the company said that banks would lend around $210m to keep it afloat until it starts to sell shares to new investors. It also said that the banks would convert the debt they are owed to equity, reducing Mr Goyal's controlling stake in the company. Mr Goyal and his family currently own 52% of the airline. It's unclear how much they will eventually retain but they will lose their majority stake to the banks.  In recent weeks, it had grounded more than two-thirds of the 119 aircraft in its fleet. Thousands of flights were cancelled, affecting passengers flying on both international and domestic routes.A pilots' organisation had also warned that its members would stop flying for the carrier if their salaries were not paid by the end of March.Mr Goyal was at the \"heart of the crisis\", according to the BBC's Sameer Hashmi, who says his refusal to step down had prevented investors from pumping money into the airline. It even ended a potential deal with Etihad Airways, which owns a 24% stake in Jet, and agreed to invest more and take control of the airline, our correspondent adds.It happened again when India's largest conglomerate the Tata group showed interest in buying the airline, but stepped back when Mr Goyal refused to resign from the board.There were also news reports that the Indian government had urged state-run banks to save the carrier as it wanted to avoid job losses ahead of a general election. ","95":"Shares in Ted Baker have tumbled over 12% after the fashion chain warned profits would be lower-than-expected.The retailer blamed currency movements, product costs and a writedown on unsold stock for the disappointment. It said full-year profit for the year ending on 26 January would be around \u00a363m, compared to forecasts of \u00a373.8m.The firm's shares were hit late last year amid a hugging controversy after staff alleged they suffered unwanted embraces from founder Ray Kelvin. The company has appointed a law firm to conduct an independent external investigation into the hugging allegations, which it disputes.Mr Kelvin announced in December that he would take a voluntary leave of absence. Investors had feared that negative publicity surrounding harassment allegations against Mr Kelvin would affect the brand's popularity.But the retailer's Christmas trading update last month showed a 12.2% rise in sales.In December, an online petition launched by employees accused 62-year-old Mr Kelvin of inappropriate comments and behaviour, including \"forced hugging\". The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence about at least \"50 recorded incidents of harassment\" at the fashion group.Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears.At the time, Mr Kelvin said that it was \"only right\" Ted Baker's committee and board should investigate. \"I love this company and I care deeply for all my colleagues. It's for that reason that I have decided to take a temporary leave of absence,\" he said.","96":"The boss of Aston Martin Lagonda has delivered a passionate defence of the company's strategy amid signs some city investors are losing faith.Andy Palmer said the company will prove the sceptics wrong, as he stressed the luxury carmaker's long-term plans and importance to UK manufacturing.Aston Martin's shares slumped last week as the UK's only quoted carmaker posted its first results since going public.It comes as Aston rolled out its latest products at the Geneva Motor Show.These include models to take on the likes of Ferrari, Rolls-Royce and Bentley, meaning that James Bond's favourite carmaker will soon be able to compete in all segments of the luxury car market, from hypercars to sports utility vehicles.But Mr Palmer fears that Aston Martin's \"good news message\" is being drowned out.Last month, the shares sank about 20% after the carmaker delivered its maiden set of profit figures. The share price went below \u00a311, having debuted on the London Stock Market last October at \u00a319.One long-time city observer said Aston Martin's very brief life as a public company was so far the worst he had seen in almost 30 years.But Mr Palmer blamed the share price slide and criticism on people who don't understand the long-term investment case. And because the actual number of shares listed is relatively small, this increases the price volatility. \"My disappointment with last week's reaction is because the results were, in fact, really, really strong,\" he insisted.Mr Palmer wants people to understand Aston Martin's importance to British manufacturing. \"Everything else has been sold. When everything is sold overseas, when you come to economic downturns it is much easier to switch off a plant if it's not in your home backyard. \"It's much easier for Honda to close their plant or for Nissan to turn off the X-Trail... because [the HQs] are a long way from home.\"We need to create engineers in the UK; we need to create intellectual property; we need to create apprentices. When you don't own your own industry, you can't guarantee that you can do that.\"The UK car industry \"messed up in the 1970s and '80s\", says Mr Palmer, an executive at Nissan before taking the top job at Aston Martin. \"It's a legacy time bomb that has been sitting with us for some time.\"The motor show launch included the first car to be produced under the company's revival of the legendary Lagonda marque.Lagonda is being re-launched as an all-electric brand, with the All-Terrain Concept unveiled at the show set to go into production at Aston Martin's new factory at St Athan, Wales, in 2022.The car will line up against the Rolls-Royce Cullinan and Bentley's Bentayga, although Mr Palmer expects his product to be more appealing to millionaire tech entrepreneurs.The car will have a range of about 400 miles, and wireless rapid-charge technology - and cost about \u00a3300,000. The Lagonda brand was born in 1899 and \"we need to invigorate it,\" Mr Palmer said. \"It will be the first all-electric vehicle luxury car brand.\"Aston Martin also unveiled its Vanquish Vision, a 200-mph supercar to challenge Ferrari's new F8 Tributo and latest Lamborghinis. The Vision's price tag is at least \u00a3250,000.Completing the line-up of launches was a \u00a31m hypercar, called the AM-RB 003. It will be put into production in late 2021.Mr Palmer described the unveilings as \"a show of force\u2026 It shows our long term story remains strong and on track,\" he told the BBC. The Geneva displays are part of the company's Second Century strategy to launch one new model a year for seven years. With the launch of a planned new Lagonda sedan, in production from 2023, that strategy will be complete. After that, \"it's copy-repeat, copy-repeat\", he said.He described Second Century as a defensive plan to protect Aston Martin, loss-making for decades, against downturns in the global economic cycle and changing markets.\"We'll have a company more capable of dealing with these things,\" he said. \"My job is to make sure the company is prepared for these events.\"Mr Palmer has been a vocal critic of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, putting his head above the parapet long before many other executives. \"The worry is that you get contaminated with the Brexit story.\"But he is hopeful an agreement will be done before 29 March because he \"finds it inconceivable that sensible people in Brussels and UK can't find a deal\".There is, of course, the rest of the world to worry about, although Aston Martin's key China and US markets are doing well.He is particularly pleased with the continuing growth in China, where 50% of customers are now female.So-called rich empowered females are an important growth market, including in Saudi Arabia, where driving restrictions on women have been lifted. The company has opened more dealerships in the country.Mr Palmer accepts that Aston Martin still has a macho, perhaps intimidating reputation - a legacy of the 007 connection.But that's more the case in the West, he believes. \"The preconception does not exist in China, which is why we've been able to get to 50%\".But the company still needs to do more to attract women buyers and get them into the showrooms for a test drive, he says. There will be no \"pinking and shrinking\" of the cars, but much more emphasis on marketing and approach. \"We don't want to alienate any potential customer, male or female.\"He has set up a female advisory board, made up of the sort of rich empowered females he wants to buy his cars. They meet about once a quarter to advise on everything from car design to car advertising. \"When men talk about female customers they can sound condescending, even though that's not the intention. The advisory board helps us to get the tone and manner right.\"If only setting the right tone and manner among city investors was as easy.","97":"It was 10 years ago, on the bus on my way to work, that I first I saw a man using Grindr. I had heard friends describe a free iPhone app that could show you where the nearest gay guy was. And sat in front of me was an early adopter, tapping his way through a grid of topless torsos and replying to a flurry of messages. The concept was extraordinary. When Grindr launched in March 2009, the iPhone was still in its infancy. Back then, the BlackBerry was king. Apple's app store was less than a year old and there was no Instagram or Snapchat. There was also no Tinder or Scruff or Bumble, or any of the countless other location-based dating apps that Grindr paved the way for. The app was created by Israeli entrepreneur Joel Simkhai as a way for gay men to make friends. Gay hook-up websites such as Gaydar were already used by millions. But Grindr changed the game by using the iPhone's satellite location data to let people discover other men nearby. Grindr quickly toppled Gaydar, which was slow to adapt its own app. Online dating and the future of the gay scene changed forever. Today, Grindr says it has about four million daily users in about 200 countries.\"It's an Argos catalogue of gay men, in stock, ready for collection,\" says comedian Jack Rooke, who tells stories of his Grindr experiences as part of his stand-up.As a young man, coming to terms with his sexuality, it also helped him connect with his peers.\"It was just good to speak to another gay human being,\" he says, describing the time he went to a man's house for a hook-up but ended up discussing life over homemade pitta bread and dips instead.\"Grindr was for me the place where I learned so much about gay culture and queer culture and what it means to be a gay person.\"The app has its fair share of success stories. Great hook-ups, happy marriages. But something about Grindr also drew out the worst in people. Stories about receiving unsolicited abusive messages, or arranging dates with men who did not show up, or sharing intimate photos with a fake profile soon spread online.For most of its history, racist bios were common on Grindr dating profiles.\"You would see profiles saying no Asians, no blacks, no fat people,\" says Jack. \"There's been a huge space for prejudice on that app, I think since day one.\"Dating no-shows and racist messages spurred blogger Andrew Londyn to write a book describing how to \"survive\" Grindr.He recalls chatting several times with a \"very handsome Greek guy\". Eventually the man asked why the pair had not met for a drink. \"You haven't asked me out yet,\" Andrew replied in jest. But the response was bleak: a tirade of racist abuse.\"That was infuriating. You just asked me out, and now that?\" says Andrew.On his blog, Andrew describes the loss of \"community\" he feels apps such as Grindr have contributed to. Previously men of all ages, backgrounds and body types would meet in bars and spend time together. But today, people can select their friends from the online catalogue instead.\"We're dehumanising each other,\" says Andrew.\"We don't think of it as an individual who is reaching out to me. They have a mother and a father, they probably have siblings, they work, they want to be happy. But we just view them as a picture. If you view them only as a picture, they're easily disposed of.\"The arrival of Grindr and the rival apps it inspired brought a fresh challenge for LGBT venues, many of which have seen visitor numbers decline.\"Grindr was the next evolution along from the internet, as to how gay men started to meet each other and hook-up,\" says Mark Oakley, owner of the Eagle bar in London.Ten years ago, his venue was renowned for its late night sex parties. A black curtain separated the bar from the \"dark room\", where anything could happen. On a Saturday you could \"hear the spanking down at Vauxhall station\".But demand for that type of night out declined as Grindr's popularity grew. \"Grindr came along offering a much more direct route to sex with no real barriers. Why would people want to go to a club, pay a door entry fee, pay for drinks, when there might not even be anyone there they like?\"Mark accepts it was a natural progression for sex to move online, comparing it to the entertainment industry shift from CDs and DVDs to downloads and streaming.\"Businesses have had to shape up, or ship out.\"For us to survive in today's market we had to evolve and change in to what we've become now. We had a considerable refit, brought in a new look and feel. Now it's all about the music and entertainment.\"The black curtain, he says, was ceremoniously discharged and recycled.Grindr has at times been used for the worst imaginable crimes. In 2016, serial killer Stephen Port was jailed for killing four young men and raping four others. He used Grindr to set up his killings. And in 2018, Daryll Rowe was jailed for deliberately passing HIV on to several other men he met on Grindr.Any new technology can be used for terrible purposes. But Mark fears Grindr has left a \"wreckage\" in its wake, by making it easier for lonely or isolated men to meet people offering drugs and chem-sex parties. Officially, Grindr's community guidelines prohibit \"mentions or photos of drugs and drug paraphernalia, including emoji\" but that does not deter everyone.Some profiles openly advertise HNH (high and horny) meet-ups. The diamond emoji is often used by people offering crystal meth. Grindr is not to blame for gay and bi men taking drugs, but it may have made it more accessible.\"Grindr has a social responsibility and it should take that seriously,\" says Mark.\"They put up messages, but they could do a lot more. The licensed trade has to control what happens on our premises. Why don't they?\"In January 2018, Grindr was fully  acquired by China's Kunlun Group. It paid a total of $245m (\u00a3185m) for the platform, and creator Joel Simkhai left the company. Since the publication of this article, the company told the BBC that privacy remained its \"top priority\" and all user data was stored in the United States.One of the first changes after the acquisition was the launch of the Kindr Grindr campaign, designed to \"address issues such as sexual racism, transphobia, and body shaming\".\"Kindr is built on education, awareness, and specific policy changes in the Grindr app to promote healthier interactions among our users,\" the company told the BBC.The app also changed its community guidelines. Now, anybody using racist or dehumanising language on their profiles can be banned if reported.\"We are also actively working to update our new user on-boarding experience, which will guide new members through their first steps of using Grindr, highlighting the importance of positive behaviour when communicating with others in our platform,\" the company said.Looking ahead, Jack hopes Grindr will continue to evolve and tackle toxic behaviour.\"I hope Grindr becomes a tool for more good,\" he says, especially as some groups in the UK are \"discussing whether or not we should teach LGBT education to young people\".Grindr told the BBC its priority would always be to help the LGBT community \"connect and thrive\".\"As part of our ten-year anniversary, we are placing a strong focus on authenticity. We want our users to have meaningful and authentic experiences. In the coming year, we will be rolling out new features, showcasing real stories of real users, getting involved in community events, and finding more ways to give back to the LGBT community,\" a spokeswoman said.In the fast-paced world of apps and websites, market leaders can be quickly toppled. If Kunlun wants Grindr to stay ahead, it will need to do all it can to make its app a welcoming and desirable place for men to meet.You can hear more from Jack and Andrew on the BBC's Beyond Today podcast later this week.If you've been affected by issues explored in this article, BBC Action Line has links to helpful resources including information about drugs and sexual orientation."}}
