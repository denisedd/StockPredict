{"Headline": "Trump Moves to Regulate \u2018Bump Stock\u2019 Devices", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Mr. Trump\u2019s first embrace as president of any gun control measures was dismissed by gun control supporters as minor. The National Rifle Association supports the background check legislation and also backs bump stock regulation, although not an outright ban.\u201cWe cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a ceremony as he conferred the medal of valor on public safety officials. \u201cWe must actually make a difference.\u201dThe party-line vote was on an unusual procedural motion offered by a Democrat, and Republican leaders were critical of the effort to force a vote. They said they would consider other gun control bills before the session ends in March, but none of those measures is expected to go as far as banning assault rifles.\u201cBump stocks\u201d are attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster, almost like machine guns. Twelve of the rifles found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas gunman were fitted with the devices.At the White House, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president\u2019s spokeswoman, said the president was determined to find ways to protect Americans, and especially children, from gunmen. Asked about a broader ban on assault weapons, Ms. Sanders said the White House has not \u201cclosed the door on any front.\u201dDespite the day\u2019s developments, there was deep skepticism in Washington that anything would change because of the long history of inaction by state and federal politicians after similar mass shootings. Gun control activists said they were braced for another disappointing battle with lawmakers.The president, they noted, promised unwavering fealty last year to the National Rifle Association, drawing thunderous applause at its annual convention by declaring, \u201cTo the N.R.A., I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.\u201d The group in turn enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Trump and spent $30 million on his campaign.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who sponsored the latest background check measure with Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said he was unimpressed by Mr. Trump\u2019s openness to it. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend this is some huge concession on his part,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this is all the White House is willing to do to address gun violence, it\u2019s wholly insufficient.\u201dThe background check bill, which seeks to improve the existing database used to prevent gun purchases by criminals and the mentally ill, is a small nod in the direction of gun control that does nothing to close loopholes that allow millions of gun sales without a background check. Last year, N.R.A. officials said they were fine with it.It is also unclear whether Mr. Trump\u2019s statement of support for the measure, which included a desire for some \u201crevisions,\u201d might be linked to other legislation that the N.R.A. backs. In the House, a similar background check measure was combined with legislation that would effectively allow people to legally carry concealed weapons in all 50 states.That legislation is the top priority for the N.R.A., and gun control activists have promised to fight it aggressively.\u201cThat normalizes the carrying of guns on all American streets,\u201d said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that advocates gun control measures. He said joining the two measures would be a \u201ccraven\u201d bait-and-switch and \u201cdisrespectful for all the families\u201d of the Florida school that suffered through last week\u2019s shooting.The president\u2019s bump stock announcement surprised the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which did not appear to have been informed of the pending remarks from Mr. Trump. The Justice Department announced a review of the devices in early December. Led by the A.T.F., the review sought to determine whether the bureau \u2014 which is responsible for policing firearms \u2014 was able to regulate the devices without action from Congress.Under the Obama administration, the bureau had determined it could not regulate them. Given that prior position, A.T.F. officials had indicated privately in the months after the Las Vegas massacre that any ban of bump stocks would require new legislation.Bump stocks were not used on the rifle in the shooting last week in Florida, the authorities said.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on Tuesday appeared to short-circuit the agency\u2019s review. The A.T.F. had not yet determined whether it had the authority to ban the devices when Mr. Trump directed Mr. Sessions to draft a regulation doing so.In a statement, an A.T.F. official said she was \u201cnot authorized to comment on pending legislation, legislative proposals or the possibility of executive action.\u201d A Justice Department spokesman said that the department \u201cunderstands this is a priority for the president.\u201dThe shooting in Florida prompted the White House to highlight the administration\u2019s actions as students from the school included Mr. Trump among the politicians they criticized for failing to keep them safe.In an impassioned speech on Saturday, Emma Gonzalez, a senior at the school, assailed the president\u2019s N.R.A. ties and accused him of setting a crass monetary value on the lives of gunshot victims by taking so much money from the gun-rights group.\u201cIf you don\u2019t do anything to prevent this from continuing to occur, that number of gunshot victims will go up and the number that they are worth will go down,\u201d Ms. Gonzalez said on Saturday at a rally for gun control. \u201cAnd we will be worthless to you.\u201dWith funerals underway for those who died at the Florida high school, Mr. Trump said that he plans to host a \u201clistening session\u201d on Wednesday with high school students and teachers at the White House. He is scheduled to meet on Thursday with state and local officials to discuss school safety.Ms. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that the session on Wednesday will include students and parents from the Florida school as well as people affected by school shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. She did not say whether any of the student activists who have been critical of Mr. Trump were invited to the White House.Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting from New York, and Ali Watkins from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bad Parent Caucus", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s a thought: The next politician to express sorrow over the slaughter of students at a school without offering any specific remedy should be run out of office, for cowardice and failure to protect American children.Here\u2019s a prayer: Let us remember to hold that thought for at least seven months, to the next election.The president did order the flag lowered to half-staff. He should have run up a white flag of surrender. Along with a gutless majority in Congress, Trump is hiding behind the shield of \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d while showing himself derelict of duty in failing to defend the lives of school children.\u201cYou have people who care about you, who love you, and who will do anything at all to protect you,\u201d said Trump, in addressing the children of America. That is a flat-out lie, which is chewing gum to Trump. If the adults were really willing to take any measure to protect them, Trump wouldn\u2019t have signed a bill last year making it easier for mentally ill people to get guns.If the \u201cpeople who care about you\u201d really wanted to ensure your safety, they wouldn\u2019t have led a filibuster in the Senate, as Mitch McConnell did in 2013, to prevent an expansion of simple background checks for purchasers of firearms.If those \u201cwho love you\u201d wanted to show that love, they would say something more than the platitudinous mush that came out of the mouth of the do-nothing House speaker, Paul Ryan, whose response to the latest mass killing was, \u201cI think we need to pray.\u201dTrump, McConnell, Ryan \u2014 they all have children of their own. But in their roles as protectors of many other children, who should be free to attend school without fear of being shot, this trio that controls the federal government is leading a bad parent caucus.The kids know it \u2014 they get that people who should be looking after them are looking the other way. After Trump spoke, a sophomore at the Parkland school stated the obvious in an interview with CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that a kid 19 years old that\u2019s been investigated already, and not even a year ago, being able to purchase an AR-15,\u201d said Isabella Gomez.The gun used in Florida is similar to the kind of rapid-firing weapons used to mow down first graders in Newtown, club-goers in Orlando, civil servants in San Bernardino, and music-lovers in Las Vegas. In our country, a nation with a gun homicide rate 49 times higher than other wealthy countries, lunatics have easy and legal access to these guns.The cops know the politicians are failing the kids as well. \u201cWhat about the rights of these students?\u201d said the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, in relaying the grim news of the latest massacre. \u201cDon\u2019t they have the right to be protected by the United States government, to the best of our ability?\u201dOf course they do. But the government will not protect them. The invertebrates in Congress and the soulless blowhard in the White House will not take even the most common-sensical measures to limit the use of militarized weapons by deeply troubled people.Remember the outrage over bump stocks, the modification used by the man who killed 58 people in Las Vegas last fall? If you don\u2019t, please remember it next November, at the ballot box. Congress has done nothing on this issue, but many states are moving on it, pressed by popular movements unafraid of the gun lobby.Let me try another take for you bad parents in office. Pretend you live in a pleasant, well-protected community of like-minded people, and you\u2019re in charge. O.K., you don\u2019t have to pretend. And let\u2019s say there was a natural gas leak every three days in one of the homes in that community, a leak that killed entire families.Your response would be to pray and do nothing. Or to pray and talk about everything except the gas leak. Or to pray and say you\u2019re powerless to act because the gas company owns you. The response of those suffering would be to take control and kick you out. That\u2019s what we have to do, and will, next November.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says He Would Have Rushed in Unarmed to Stop School Shooting", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump asserted Monday that he would have rushed in to save the students and teachers of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School from a gunman with an assault weapon, even if he was unarmed at the time of the massacre.Speaking to a meeting of the country\u2019s governors at the White House, Mr. Trump conceded that \u201cyou don\u2019t know until you test it.\u201d But he said he believed he would have exhibited bravery \u201ceven if I didn\u2019t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too.\u201dThe president\u2019s remarks came during an hourlong televised conversation with the governors in the State Dining Room, during which Mr. Trump continued to grapple publicly with how best to respond to the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., discussing such things as arming teachers and reopening mental institutions.Mr. Trump echoed that sentiment, saying that the performance of Mr. Peterson and three other deputies whose actions have been questioned \u201cwas, frankly, disgusting.\u201dLater, he added that \u201cthe way they performed was really a disgrace.\u201dAs lawmakers returned to Washington after a weeklong break, the president used the White House forum on Monday to insist that politicians do something quickly to ensure that shootings like the one in Florida will never happen again.The politics of guns for Republicans continue to be difficult.Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, a conservative Republican, said on Monday that he would block any tax break for his state\u2019s largest employer, Delta Air Lines, if the company does not reinstate discounts for N.R.A. members that it suspended after the shooting. And Mr. Trump \u2014 who said he had lunch Sunday with N.R.A. leaders \u2014 publicly clashed with Washington State\u2019s Democratic governor about the benefits of giving guns to some teachers.But the two top Republicans in Congress \u2014 Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader \u2014 have largely been silent on the broader debate about possible changes to gun laws after the Florida shooting.Mr. Trump tried to take the lead.\u201cWe have to have action. We don\u2019t have any action,\u201d Mr. Trump complained. \u201cA week goes by, \u2018Let\u2019s keep talking.\u2019 Another week goes by, we keep talking. Two months go by \u2014 all of the sudden, everybody is off to the next subject. Then, when it happens again, everybody is angry and, \u2018Let\u2019s start talking again.\u2019 We got to stop.\u201dMr. Trump said that was his message during his lunch on Sunday with Wayne LaPierre, the head of the N.R.A., and Chris W. Cox, the group\u2019s top lobbyist. He called the pair \u201cgreat patriots\u201d and \u201cgreat people\u201d who want to \u201cdo something\u201d quickly to prevent more school shootings.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the N.R.A. They\u2019re on our side,\u201d the president told the governors. \u201cYou guys \u2014 half of you are so afraid of the N.R.A. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. And you know what? If they\u2019re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That\u2019s O.K.\u201dBut even as he chided his predecessors in Washington for their delays and inaction, Mr. Trump\u2019s own preferred solutions remained elusive Monday as he continued what administration officials described as a \u201clistening\u201d phase of the response.Mr. Trump lamented a period in history when he said mentally unstable people who had not yet committed a crime could be committed to a mental hospital if it were clear they were acting like a \u201cboiler ready to explode.\u201d\u201cWe have no halfway. We have nothing between a prison and leaving him at his house, which we can\u2019t do anymore,\u201d Mr. Trump told the governors. \u201cSo I think you folks have to start thinking about that.\u201dGov. Jay Inslee of Washington State appeared to annoy Mr. Trump during a testy exchange about the president\u2019s proposal to protect students by allowing trained teachers to carry concealed weapons in schools.\u201cIt would just be a very small group of people that are very gun adept,\u201d Mr. Trump told the governor.Mr. Inslee responded that giving guns to any number of teachers, coaches or administrators in the schools would be wrong, and he urged the president to abandon the idea.\u201cI\u2019ve listened to the first-grade teachers that don\u2019t want to be pistol-packing first-grade teachers,\u201d Mr. Inslee said as the president frowned and folded his arms across his chest. \u201cI just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let\u2019s just take that off the table and move forward.\u201dMr. Trump did not acknowledge the criticism and moved quickly to remarks from Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican.In a separate meeting with the spouses of the governors, the first lady, Melania Trump, gave brief remarks that also touched on the shooting at the Florida high school. She praised the students from the school who have been demanding action from politicians.\u201cI have been heartened to see children across this country using their voices to speak out and try to create change,\u201d Mrs. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re our future and they deserve a voice.\u201dMs. Sanders said later that the president also supported the students who had been protesting, even though he opposes the ban on assault weapons that many of them have been calling for.\u201cThat\u2019s the reason why he had a number of them here at the White House just last week,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cIt is one that is very important and should be listened to. We want to continue that dialogue as well as continue the conversations with state, local and federal officials.\u201dThe governors came away impressed by Mr. Trump\u2019s resolve to address the issue, according to Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, a Republican and chairman of the National Governors Association.Noting that he leads the state that last year endured the deadliest mass shooting in American history, Mr. Sandoval added that the governors shared the urgency. \u201cThere\u2019s a consensus that something needs to be done.\u201dBut there was no consensus about Mr. Trump\u2019s idea of arming trained teachers or other school personnel. \u201cI have three kids,\u201d said Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat and the vice chairman of the association. \u201cI don\u2019t want my teachers armed. I don\u2019t think most Americans do.\u201dReporting was contributed by Eileen Sullivan, Peter Baker and Katie Rogers from Washington, and Patricia Mazzei from Miami.videoAdvertisement"}

Mr. Bush said that with Mr. Immelt, the answer is yes.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing less marriage counseling with 12 adults,\u201d Mr. Bush said of his board, adding that Mr. Immelt would be a partner to take advice from (and occasionally whine to).An outside perspective\u201cWhat Jeff brings is an understanding of scale on a couple of dimensions, not only in terms of people and processes but also how you think about scaling with your partners.\u201d\u2014 Henry Ellenbogen of T. Rowe Price, one of Athenahealth\u2019s biggest shareholders, said in a phone interview.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe deal would:\u2022 raise the spending caps by about $300 billion over two years, according to a congressional aide.\u2022 increase the limit on military spending by $80 billion in the current fiscal year and $85 billion in the next year, which begins Oct. 1, the aide said.\u2022 increase the limit on nondefense spending by $63 billion this year and $68 billion next year.The bigger picture\u201cThe deal will cause federal budget deficits to grow even larger, on top of the effects of the sweeping tax overhaul that lawmakers approved in December. But because the agreement gives both parties what they wanted most, the deficit impact appears to be of little concern. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Speaker Paul D. Ryan all quickly embraced it.\u201dCritics corner\u2022 Hard-line conservatives were unsparing in their assessment of the deal.\u2022 Representative Nancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats, said she could not agree to any budget deal that was not accompanied by a debate over legislation to protect the fate of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers.\u201cRevenue was $286 million, up 72 percent from a year earlier and about $30 million more than analysts had expected. Daily users rose nine million to 187 million, the best growth in over a year. The retention rate of new Android users, a special focus for Snap, jumped nearly 20 percent over the previous year.\u201d\u201cThe company lost $350 million in the quarter, or 13 cents a share, which was narrower than the loss of 16 cents that was expected by analysts. And it also contrasted with the carnage of the prior quarter, when Snap recorded a net loss that was twice the forecast.\u201dThe bigger pictureThe results have helped quell some of the concerns about the company\u2019s slowing revenue and user growth in the face of increased competition from the likes of Facebook.Critics cornerIn the early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump lamented that in the \u201cold days,\u201d stocks would rise on good economic news, saying \u201cToday, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake.\u201d The tweet did not elaborate on what he meant by the \u201cold days\u201d or explain further his analysis of why stocks plummeted on Friday and Monday.Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the fall was pegged to good economic news stems from Friday\u2019s job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment.\u2014 Michael D. Shear and Alan RappeportIn recent months, many powerful men have had to step down from senior positions as they have faced accusations of sexual harassment, but none were the head of a public company like Mr. Wynn. How would the board, shareholders, regulators, customers and unions react?We now know something about the shareholder perspective: Shares in Wynn Resorts were up 7 percent in early-morning trading today. Regulators in Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau are still conducting their own investigations.But the biggest unresolved question remains the board and its conduct.The board set up a committee of independent directors to carry out an investigation after the WSJ article, but it was not clear how rigorous it would be. The board did not have a track record for holding Mr. Wynn accountable.In an email exchange with me, Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard law professor and an expert in corporate governance, asked why the board did not suspend Mr. Wynn from his position pending the investigation, or demand that he not interact with Wynn Resorts employees, a step that would have limited his ability to influence the board investigation.One remaining way to assess the board\u2019s resolve will be Mr. Wynn\u2019s separation agreement, which is not yet finalized.When the WSJ article was published, Mr. Wynn denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, calling them \u201cpreposterous.\u201d On Tuesday he said, \u201cI have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity.\u201dIt is not clear why Mr. Wynn decided to step down. It may have been pressure from gaming regulators. Customers might have been pulling back.Mr. Wynn may have wanted to preserve the value of his own stake in Wynn Resorts. But as it stands, it does not look like the board was a strong force.\u2014 Peter EavisSteve Wynn has stepped down from his $17 billion casino empire, a little over a week after allegations of forced sex and other sexual misconduct claims emerged in a WSJ investigation.Top executives spent hours with Mr. Wynn going over plans for a new casino he would like to build in Las Vegas, according to a person familiar with the matter, while the company\u2019s general counsel hopped on a call with other executives to discuss the Vegas Strong Fund, a nonprofit formed in the aftermath of last year\u2019s mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, according to a person familiar with the call.He also attended the company\u2019s 1,500-guest Super Bowl party on Sunday, the WSJ says.In a statement, Mr. Wynn blamed his exit on \u201ca rush to judgment\u201d that took \u201cprecedence over everything, including the facts.\u201dThe big questions\u2022 Do other S. & P. 500 C.E.O.s now have something to fear?\u2022 And is the Wynn empire \u2014 from Las Vegas to Macau to, soon, Massachusetts \u2014 now ripe for a takeover or breakup?Critics\u2019 cornerLAT staff have chafed at the decisions of Tronc and its chairman, Michael Ferro. More from Sydney Ember of the NYT:Many employees at The Times have of late adopted the mantra \u201canyone but Ferro,\u201d but it is also not clear what decisions Dr. Soon-Shiong, who largely made his fortune selling generic drugs and developing a new type of cancer drug, will make as the paper\u2019s owner.The deals flyaroundAs the stocks calmly glided higher in 2017, investors from hedge fund titans to day traders poured billions in to bets that volatility would continue to fall.Those wagers blew up this week.Now investors are selling the exchange company behind the trading in volatility.Shares of the C.B.O.E. Global Markets, whose volatility index facilitated those wagers, are down 17 percent since the start of the sell-off. Thursday they are off 3 percent.Critics cornerBlame the VIX/machines/debt?\u2022 Steven Mnuchin suggested yesterday that algorithms might be behind the whipsawing: \u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions.\u201dOn one side: Brian Chesky, the home rental giant\u2019s co-founder and C.E.O., who wants it kept private a while yet.More from Olivia Zaleski:Despite pledging support for Chesky\u2019s desire to keep Airbnb private, Sequoia Capital partner Alfred Lin, along with Jeff Jordan of Andreessen Horowitz, wanted to explore the possibility. In December, they asked Michael Grimes, the head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, to present options for going public, said people close to the bank.Ultimately, Mr. Tosi \u2014 who didn\u2019t see eye to eye with Mr. Chesky on other issues and generally did not fit in at Airbnb \u2014 resigned.An Airbnb spokesman denied there was ever any intent to pursue an I.P.O. this year.The tech flyaroundMr. Carstens also argued that cryptocurrencies were freeloading on existing financial infrastructure and the legitimacy that came from being linked to it.Most digital currencies are unlikely to survive in their current form, and investors should prepare for coins to lose all their value as they\u2019re replaced by a small set of future competitors, Goldman\u2019s Steve Strongin said in a report dated Feb. 5.\u201cCrazy things can come true.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Slack\u2019s C.F.O.

{"Headline": "Volatility Rattles Stocks, and Investors Who Bet on a Continuing Calm", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs stocks maintained their smooth and steady climb in recent years, few trades were as alluring, or as profitable, as a bet that volatility as measured by Wall Street\u2019s so-called fear gauge had vanished.Hedge fund titans in their Manhattan offices and day traders in their living rooms have poured billions of dollars into opaque, debt-fueled funds known as exchange-traded notes, racier versions of the exchange-traded funds that track every variety of index or investment and can be bought and sold just like a stock.Now stocks are swinging wildly and volatility is soaring \u2014 and investors who piled into these funds, confident that the calm would continue, are getting rattled. On Tuesday, Credit Suisse, the sponsor of the most popular fund for making such bets, said it was closing down the fund.Credit Suisse closed the fund \u2014 informally called XIV, which moves in the opposite direction of the fear gauge, known as VIX \u2014 after it experienced a fall of greater than 80 percent, a price drop that left XIV trading at a deep discount relative to the value of its assets.It had been an extraordinary ride for XIV, formally known as the Velocity Shares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN. It was one of a number of funds tied to VIX, known officially as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, some of which move in the same direction, tracking the index up or down.VIX, which measures investor expectations that stocks will rise or fall sharply in the future, has been at extreme lows in recent years, making XIV very attractive to investors and pushing it to $1.8 billion in size. Just last Wednesday, it took in a record $500 million, as investors stuck even more firmly to their belief that volatility was not a concern.In the two years from January 2016 to the middle of last month, XIV\u2019s value shot up more than 500 percent, reaching a recent peak of $134.After VIX surged on Monday, XIV dropped like a rock, falling from $99 to $7 in after-hours trading.In just two days, investors in XIV and a similar fund, ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures (SVXY), saw their assets shrink dramatically, from a combined total of $3 billion to about $150 million.\u201cPeople are scared out of their minds \u2014 they are in really rough shape,\u201d said Seth Golden, who left his job as a manager at a Target store to take up shorting VIX as a full-time business from his living room in Ocala, Fla.He has been able to do so because investment banks have created more than 30 high-risk, high-return securities that allow any investor to bet against VIX. Some of the products require large amounts of leverage, debt that can amplify gains and losses.Mr. Golden\u2019s preferred vehicles are the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures and ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures, which he has been betting against for years in trades that have been lucrative \u2014 until now.After VIX shot up 100 percent, the largest move in its history, to 35.73 on Monday, Mr. Golden acknowledged that he was feeling some pain. On Tuesday, the index spiked again, reaching 50 before falling back to just below 30.\u201cIt is really stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cI was up until the wee hours, checking my phone to see where VIX futures were trading.\u201dNonetheless, he said on Tuesday that he was still wagering 21 percent of his portfolio, or $600,000, that volatility would fall as it had in the past.That Mr. Golden and others like him are getting hurt on these risky, niche trades should not, in theory, have a wider effect on the market. While investments in these funds have been substantial recently, their combined value is just $4 billion, a blip in a market worth trillions of dollars.But volatility specialists have warned for years that the popularity of the investments has skewed the broader VIX index, keeping it artificially low in good times and pushing it higher than it should go in times of stress.That was the case on Monday, bankers and traders said, when XIV collapsed as VIX soared in late-afternoon trading. That was because as XIV and SVXY plummeted, traders were forced to scoop up hundreds of millions of dollars in VIX futures to cover the short positions they had on the index. That drove it higher and prompted computerized trading systems to sell stocks and bonds by the truckload.\u201cThese products definitely had an impact on the VIX,\u201d said Pravit Chintawongvanich, the head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors. \u201cAnd that exacerbated the decline in stocks. It was a vicious circle.\u201d\u201cThis is just an appetizer for what has yet to come,\u201d said Chris Cole of Artemis Capital, a hedge fund for investors who believe in such an outcome. \u201cThe world won\u2019t end tomorrow, but there has been such a massive bet on stability and low volatility that this could lead to a multiyear unwind.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is great news for Americans\u2019 401(k), retirement, pension and college savings accounts.\u201dAnd then, well, you know. Stocks plunged Friday, and on Monday the market continued to plummet. The Dow fell almost 1,600 points at one point before finishing down more than 1,100 points, or 4.6 percent.Fingers, of course, are pointing.The president\u2019s critics have said his decision to tether his success or failure to the stock market was ludicrous.Yes, it was a mistake, but not for the reason you might think.The reason for the market\u2019s downward turn isn\u2019t that investors believe his stimulus measures, like tax cuts and deregulation, are failing, or might fail.It is quite the opposite: Investors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down by raising interest rates faster than expected.Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. Don\u2019t forget what set off the plunge on Friday: better-than-expected job growth numbers.It is very possible that by the time election season comes around for 2020, even if this market dip is simply a blip, the economy will be, or will have been, in a recession.Before all the pundits pass out from hyperventilating over the market \u201ccorrection\u201d \u2014 and quick fact-check: technically a correction is defined as a drop of 10 percent or more \u2014 let\u2019s take a deep breath: The market\u2019s fall may seem precipitous, but it has dipped only 8.5 percent from the top.That\u2019s certainly significant, especially if you jumped into the market in the last several weeks for the first time. But, in truth, it\u2019s as if we had turned back the clock to where the stock market was in the middle of December, when investors \u2014 and, yes, the president \u2014 were proudly cheering its success.The market was always bound to turn downward after a record run. Early last week, Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, predicted as much, saying, \u201cWhatever the trigger, a correction of some kind seems a high probability in the coming months.\u201d He probably didn\u2019t appreciate how quickly he would be proved right.Despite a steady drumbeat of optimism about the economy from top business executives \u2014 and rightly so, given the record results they\u2019ve been producing and expect to produce over the next year \u2014 some investors have been quietly suggesting that the market was starting to look expensive when factoring in the likelihood of inflation.For now, that fever may be breaking, but it is likely to be only temporary. \u201cThese big declines are just minor corrections in the scope of things, there is a lot of cash on the side to buy on the break, and what comes next will be most important,\u201d Mr. Dalio wrote in a note to his clients Monday.How long this bull run will continue is anyone\u2019s guess, but the betting line is that while it may have another a year or two, it will end.\u201cOur analysis of these metrics suggests that the current expansion will end as soon as late 2019,\u201d Guggenheim wrote.Just in time for the next presidential election.An earlier version of this article misstated the context of a comment from Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners.

{"Headline": "Force Overtime? Or Go for the Win?", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterOn Jan. 16, 2016, with time expiring in the fourth quarter of a playoff game between the Green Bay Packers and the Arizona Cardinals, the Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed an improbable Hail Mary touchdown pass to bring the Packers within 1 point of the Cardinals.The Packers then had a choice to make. They could kick an extra point, which would send the game into overtime. Or they could go for a 2-point conversion, which though more difficult would win the game.Ultimately, the Packers chose to tie the game with an extra point. Then their fans watched in dismay as the Cardinals promptly scored a touchdown in overtime and won the game.The Packers had fallen prey to a common fallacy: When facing decisions like this, people are often myopic, focusing too much on the possibility of an immediate loss. They avoid the risk of instant defeat, even when taking that risk offers the best path to victory.This bias can be costly. Teams that chose to avoid the 2-point conversion won the game only 40 percent of the time, which is well below the average rate of successful 2-point conversions (about 50 percent). Surely some of those teams should have known they were underdogs if the game went into overtime, and mistakenly avoided a risk they should have taken.This error is not limited to the N.F.L. We also looked at all instances in the past five years in which teams in the National Basketball Association trailed by 2 points with less than 24 seconds to play. In this situation, a team can attempt a 2-point shot that would send the game to overtime or try a (more difficult) 3-point shot that would win the game immediately.Again, a clear bias emerged: Of the 772 instances in which teams faced this situation, they avoided the 3-point shot 71.1 percent of the time.This bias appears to be costly in the N.B.A. as well. The teams that attempted the 3-point shot won the game more often (17.3 percent) than those that attempted the 2-point shot (14.5 percent).Basketball fans in a laboratory environment make this same mistake. In one study, we asked participants to imagine that they were the coach of an N.B.A. team that was down by 2 points in the final seconds. Just as N.B.A. teams did, our participants avoided the superior strategy, opting for the 2-point shot 81 percent of the time.Why do people make this error? Part of the explanation lies in our tendency to treat problems in isolation rather than as part of a larger whole. Just as investors often mistakenly evaluate stocks individually rather than as part of a portfolio, coaches and fans often evaluate decisions in terms of their immediate impact and give less consideration to how those decisions fit in the larger context of the game.In our laboratory study, we found that whether participants opted for the 2-point or 3-point shot was unrelated to their beliefs about how the team would perform in overtime. They made their decision by focusing almost entirely on the prospect of losing immediately, neglecting how the future was likely to play out.But there is more to the story than myopia. People also seem to be unnecessarily wary of risks that they feel they are choosing to take (as opposed to risks they feel they are forced to take).In a study that highlights this point, we asked football fans to imagine that a team had scored a touchdown in the final seconds of a game. Then we told half the fans that the team trailed by 1 point and the other half that the team trailed by 2 points. We then told all the fans that the team was going to attempt a 2-point conversion.Those who were told the team was down by 1 point (and thus had the viable option of kicking the extra point to force overtime) thought the 2-point conversion was more likely to fail than did those whose team had to attempt a 2-point conversion just to force a tie. That is, the same decision was thought to be riskier when it was seen as optional than when it was seen as unavoidable.\u201cLive to fight another day\u201d is often a good rule of thumb, but it is not always the best strategy to pursue. Good judgment, in sports and elsewhere, sometimes requires the presence of mind to take the risk of an immediate setback to achieve lasting success.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dow Jones and S.&P. Slide Again, Dropping by More Than 4%", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the global financial crisis a decade ago, a few simple guidelines have helped investors make sense of the markets.Global growth and inflation will be perpetually weak. Central banks will help by keeping interest rates low. And stocks will almost invariably rise.The rule book is now changing, a shift that is sending tremors through the financial markets. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell by more than 4 percent on Monday, deepening its losses from the previous week and erasing its gains for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average sank by 4.6 percent. Bond yields, the basis for key borrowing costs such as mortgage rates, have risen fast in recent weeks.In trading in Asia on Tuesday morning, markets signaled another tough day. Major stock markets in the region plunged after the drop in the United States on Monday, suggesting the pain could continue. In Japan, stocks were down more than 5 percent in morning trading, while shares in Hong Kong were down more than 4 percent.Those sharp moves come as investors digest the growth prospects for the world \u2014 and rebalance their views on the relative merits of stashing their cash in risky assets like stocks, safer spots such as government bonds and the myriad investment opportunities offered by a global economy moving in sync.The world\u2019s largest economies are all expanding, as the most important central bank, the United States Federal Reserve, is draining billions of dollars from the financial system and raising interest rates. And investors are concerned that tenuous signs of inflation could mean central banks around the world will start to remove their support even faster.It\u2019s an interesting complexity for investors to assess. What\u2019s good for the economy isn\u2019t always good for the markets. The strong job report last week fueled hopes that wage growth would follow. But higher wages could lead to higher inflation, creating new challenges for the central bank to manage.New leadership at the Fed is adding a degree of uncertainty. Jerome H. Powell was sworn in as the 16th chairman of the Federal Reserve on Monday, after the departure of his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. The markets do not have a clear understanding of exactly how, if at all, Mr. Powell\u2019s views on unemployment and inflation will differ from that of Ms. Yellen.Stocks surged broadly during the president\u2019s first year in office. By late January the S.&P. 500 was up 27 percent since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. But the last few days of trading cut those gains to just 17 percent.\u201cWhen you get this kind of sell-off, it kind of feeds on itself,\u201d said Michael P. Ryan, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Wealth Management.Although the market opened lower on Monday, it actually had climbed into positive territory in the morning. But the declines snowballed throughout the afternoon. The 4.1 percent drop was the worst for the S.&P. since August 2011.Back then, the sell-off followed growing concern about a chaotic budgeting process in the United States. A showdown between Congress and the Obama administration over the debt ceiling brought the country to the brink of default. In response, credit rating firm Standard & Poor\u2019s stripped the United States of its triple-A rating, spooking markets.The economy today is in tricky territory from a markets perspective. Investors have been excited about the prospects of the tax cuts, but they are also fretting that the government may be spending too much to pay for them.Economists often advise governments to run large deficits during recessions to stimulate growth. But the United States economy is already solid.It grew at an annual pace of 2.6 percent last quarter. Unemployment was 4.1 percent January.In essence, the $1.5 trillion tax cut may be stimulus that the economy does not need. The extra money raises the prospect that the economy could overheat, stoking inflation.\u201cWe\u2019re pouring a tremendous amount of fuel on the fire,\u201d said Rick Rieder, who oversees roughly $1.7 trillion in assets as global chief investment officer for fixed income at the asset manager BlackRock.Global investors are also trying to navigate a changing economic backdrop.Against the strength, investors are wondering whether those central banks will tamp down on their efforts to help growth, which could send interest rates higher. Investors are anticipating that the European Central Bank could pull back, depending on the economic conditions.The weakness on display in the United States set the tone for foreign markets. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dropped by 2.6 percent on Monday. Benchmark equity indexes in France, Italy and Spain all fell by more than 1 percent.In the United States, financial stocks endured some of the steepest drops, led by Wells Fargo. After the close of trading Friday, the large lender was the subject of an extraordinary regulatory action when the Fed barred it from growing until it improved corporate controls.Industrial stocks tumbled 4.5 percent. The aluminum maker Arconic fell 8.9 percent after its earnings failed to impress investors. The company also said it would bolster capital spending to ramp up production.Likewise, ExxonMobil fell 5.7 percent Monday. The energy giant disappointed investors with its quarterly earnings report last week. The energy sector was one of the worst-performing parts of the S.&P. 500, falling by 4.4 percent.The corporate environment reflects forces, along with the changing course of global central banks, that could further add to the choppiness of markets.For example, oil prices have risen as global growth has picked up steam. That encourages energy companies like ExxonMobil to increase investment, as does provisions in the tax overhaul that make capital spending more advantageous. ExxonMobil has said it plans to spend $50 billion on investments in the United States over the next five years.Those investments could be good business moves and help feed into the broader economy. But they could also send share prices lower in the short term, as investors have become accustomed to companies using investment dollars to buy back their own stock, a popular move for corporations in recent years. Goldman Sachs analysts recently noted that corporations themselves represent the single largest source of demand for stocks in the United States.Now, the combination of global growth and tax incentives to make capital investments \u201cactually completely changed the paradigm to just borrow to buy back your stock,\u201d said Mr. Rieder of BlackRock.Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

CBS and Viacom Are Talking About It", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new chapter opened Thursday in the drama over the future of the $37 billion Redstone media empire, with CBS Corporation and Viacom announcing plans to explore a reunion, reigniting a plan that fizzled a little more than a year ago.In simultaneously released statements, CBS and Viacom \u2014 which were part of the same company from 2000 to 2006 \u2014 said that their boards had created special committees of independent directors to \u201cevaluate a potential combination.\u201d Yet the companies cautioned that there could be \u201cno assurance that this process will result in a transaction or on what terms any transaction may occur.\u201dIn rekindling the possibility, though, both companies are acknowledging that they must get bigger to remain competitive in a media industry that now prioritizes scale.In the past year, The Walt Disney Company has agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox in a deal that would form an entertainment colossus for the age of streaming. AT&T is still pursuing an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. At the same time, traditional media companies are contending with technology companies like Apple and Facebook that have moved into the entertainment business.\u201cWhile it never was the case that you need scale to have a successful business, it becomes a more credible proposition to investors to say that you need it,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cInvestors believe that scale equals clout and clout equals pricing power with both suppliers and customers.\u201dThe ailing 94-year-old media mogul Sumner M. Redstone took control of Viacom in 1987, through National Amusements, the private theater chain started by his father. He then went on to acquire CBS in 2000 in a nearly $40 billion deal. Mr. Redstone split the two companies apart in 2006 amid uncertainty about the future of both businesses.Yet those plans relied largely on winning over Leslie Moonves, the chairman and chief executive of CBS, whom Ms. Redstone wanted to lead the combined company. Mr. Moonves expressed skepticism about how such a deal would benefit both Viacom, which had been struggling, and CBS, which had been delivering strong results. In addition, Mr. Moonves was seeking strategic and operational freedom over the combined companies.But both companies face challenges keeping pace in an increasingly digital world, especially amid the merger frenzy that has swept across the media industry. \u201cAs the world around CBS and Viacom will soon be inhabited by giant companies with endless balance sheets, the reality of the current arms race has recently weighed on these two stocks,\u201d Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research said in a recent research note.In a statement on Thursday, National Amusements said that it supported \u201cthe processes announced by CBS and Viacom to evaluate a combination of the two companies, which we believe has the potential to drive significant, long-term shareholder value.\u201dMr. Wieser, the media analyst, noted that a deal could also be aimed at more firmly establishing a successor to Mr. Moonves, 68. \u201cShari Redstone is more firmly in control,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has her person in place at Viacom and potentially a successor she\u2019d like to see to Les Moonves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A closer look at potential privatization targets under the White House\u2019s infrastructure plan.\u2022 What investors should be watching to discern where the markets are headed.\u2022 Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason urge shareholders not to \u201clet Fuji steal\u201d Xerox.\u2022 General Dynamics\u2019s big deal shows that military spending is set to go up.\u2022 Where Dina Powell is going next.Stocks on Wall Street endured their worst week in two years last week.Monday they capped their biggest two-day advance since 2016.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 percent and turned positive for the year.Correction factoidsRay Dalio thinks so.\u2022 Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport\u2022 Dulles International Airport\u2022 The George Washington and Baltimore Washington parkways\u2022 The Washington AqueductHere\u2019s what the plan says:The vast majority of the Nation\u2019s electricity needs are met through for-profit investor-owned utilities. Federal ownership of these assets can result in sub-optimal investment decisions and create risk for taxpayers.While the Blackstone Group is raising $40 billion for its own infrastructure fund (half of which is coming from Saudi Arabia), it\u2019s hard to see private investors filling in the $1.3 trillion required to fulfill the Trump administration\u2019s vision.To break it down numerically:\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe recent, complacency-shaking declines in stock prices will have forced investors to take more seriously the yardsticks used to assess whether stocks are worth buying. None of the metrics on their own reliably can predict the direction of stocks, but when markets are freaking out and much is a blur, well-chosen indicators can steady the nerves and clarify the mind.The most important indicator right nowIt\u2019s the 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price. A higher yield reflects greater inflation fears among investors \u2014 and a higher likelihood of that interest rates are going up.Stock investors fear higher interest rates for two main reasons:\u2022 Most immediately, they make stock valuations look less attractive\u2022 In the longer term, they can eventually slow economic growth.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has retreated to 2.83 percent Monday, while United States stocks are trading higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all up more than 0.5 percent.Adding to the funThe government inflation figures come out on Wednesday.The valuation questionThe recent volatility in the stock market has stirred up the valuation debate. Put more directly, did the declines take stock prices down to level where they no longer look expensive?Still, history shows why that might not be the case. In 1997, the rule of 20 gave roughly the same answer as we have now, but stocks kept zooming higher. (Of course, that bull run did not end well. By 2001, the stock market was down below 1997 levels.)If you find the debate over valuation unsatisfactory ...There are also technical indicators, which look at how traders react to a wide selection of market measurements. One of the most interesting right now is the 200-day moving average on the S.&P. 500.But at one point Friday, it looked like that was where things were heading. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, or 2539, before recovering and closing the week above 2619, up 1.5% on the day.The 200-day moving average\u2014the continually updated average price of the past 200 days\u2014is considered a strong measure of investor sentiment. If the S&P 500 had continued to fall below the average, it would have conveyed real bearishness. The S&P 500 hasn\u2019t closed below that moving average in 408 trading sessions, going back to around the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, according to LPL Financial.\u2014 Peter EavisIt really is a remarkable achievement by Fuji. Without putting up any cash, they will acquire majority control and ownership of a venerable American icon. In exchange, we \u2013 the existing Xerox shareholders \u2013 will receive (1) an additional, indirect 25% interest in a Fuji subsidiary that just last year disclosed a $360 million accounting scandal caused by a \u201cculture of concealment\u201d and Fuji\u2019s failure to have adequate management systems and (2) a one-time special dividend financed with our own assets.The backstoryAt the end of last year, Mr. Icahn launched a campaign to unseat the Xerox\u2019s board, and late last month, he and Mr. Deason pressured the company to explore a deal \u2014 including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture.Xerox said it \u201cconsidered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the \u2018best path to create value\u2019 for the company.\u201d\u2014 Stephen GrocerHere are some of Mr. Tan\u2019s comments:On concerns the deal won\u2019t win regulatory approval and Broadcom\u2019s offer of an $8 billion breakup fee if it doesn\u2019t:\u201cYou know, I\u2019m kind of a frugal guy. You think I would sign up to pay $8 billion if there\u2019s even a second thought?\u201dOn if Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders don\u2019t vote for a majority of Broadcom\u2019s slate on March 6:\u201cThis is a binary proposal. If at least a majority of our slate does not get in on March 6, then I guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen. We will walk.\u201dOn Qualcomm\u2019s $110 a share offer for NXP Semiconductors, which has gotten pushback from NXP investors:\u201cNXPI will not solve Qualcomm\u2019s problems.\u201dOn the possibility that Qualcomm increases its bid for NXP Semiconductors:\u201cIf Qualcomm raises the price on NXPI, we have made it very clear, it\u2019s a clear transfer of value from Qualcomm shareholders to NXPI shareholders.\u201d\u201c$110 is a full and fair price for NXPI.\u201dHere\u2019s what the media banker Reed Phillips told Joe Pompeo of Vanity Fair:Time, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, and Entertainment Weekly are the hot properties, he said, noting that suitors are most likely to be rich trophy buyers, former media executives, and possibly other publishers. Private equity, not so much, \u201cexcept maybe for some firms that would do distress deals,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cStrategic buyers or wealthy individuals are gonna win out.\u201cWho could be a buyer? Some of the names that Mr. Pompeo identified:\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe numbers\u2014 Stephen GrocerGeneral Dynamics will pay $40.75 a share in cash, up 32 percent from CSRA\u2019s Friday closing price.Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics\u2019 chairman and C.E.O., said of the deal:CSRA\u2019s management team has created an outstanding provider of innovative, next-generation IT solutions with industry-leading margins. We see substantial opportunities to provide cost-effective IT solutions and services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.The contextThe deal came as President Trump has pushed for higher defense spending since taking office. Last week\u2019s budget deal added billions for military programs.The advisers\u2014 Chad BrayAfter leaving the White House as deputy national security adviser for strategy, Ms. Powell is going to academia. She will become a non-resident senior fellow for the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School.Nicholas Burns, the faculty director of the Belfer Center\u2019s Future of Diplomacy Project, said in a statement:\u201cDina Powell is one of our country\u2019s finest public servants. ... Combined with her deep private sector background, Dina will be a source of ideas and inspiration for our students.\u201dMany had been wondering where Ms. Powell would go after her tenure in the Trump administration. Before joining the White House, she had been a fast-rising executive at Goldman Sachs, where she oversaw the firm\u2019s impact investment business.Before that, she had been an official in the George W. Bush administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe markets flyaround\u201cWe cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain \u2014 one that delivers over a quarter of our advertising to our consumers \u2014 which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency.\u201dOn infrastructureDon\u2019t look for more specifics from the Trump administration, including on how its initiative will be funded. Republican lawmakers are wary of more spending: The government funding bill that Mr. Trump signed last week will push the budget deficit toward $1 trillion.On the budget proposalMore on the lawsuit by Brooks Barnes and Willie Neuman of the NYT:Eric Soufer, director of communications and senior counsel to Mr. Schneiderman, said the attorney general\u2019s office considered asking a judge for a temporary restraining order that could block the sale but opted not to and filed the civil rights lawsuit instead. He added that the office reviewed the proposed terms of the sale and that they did not include a victims compensation fund.The misconduct flyaroundMore from Conor Dougherty of the NYT:\u201cAs a businessperson in San Diego, if you\u2019re not following this you\u2019re living in a cave,\u201d said Jason Hughes, chief executive of Hughes Marino, a commercial real estate brokerage.And Mr. Hughes added, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re our flag.\u201dThe deals flyaround\u201cMy job as Uber\u2019s C.E.O. is to set the course for the future of the company: innovating and growing responsibly, as well as acknowledging and correcting mistakes of the past.\u201dUber ended a legal fight with a $245 million stock payout to Alphabet, less than it originally offered as a settlement. And its latest valuation is $72 billion. And Alphabet got pledges that its competitor would not wrongfully use its autonomous driving tech.The tech flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "College Endowments Opt for Alternative, and Less Lucrative, Route", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIt\u2019s official: Returns for college and university endowments for the 2017 fiscal year are in, and while they averaged a respectable 12.2 percent for the year, over the last decade they have underperformed funds offering a simple 60-40 or 70-30 stock-fixed income allocation.With their average returns dragged down by the weak performance of hedge funds, venture capital and private equity, you would think endowments would be fleeing these so-called alternative investments, which are costly and mostly illiquid, as some large pension funds have done.On the contrary, endowments are holding firm, or even adding to these holdings. Last year, alternative investments accounted for an average of 52 percent of endowment assets \u2014 over 60 percent in the largest endowments \u2014 the same percentage as two years ago, according to the annual Nacubo-Commonfund study of endowments.Yet over the last 10 years, the average endowment earned a 4.6 percent annualized return, lower than the 5.3 percent return for a low-cost 60-40 stock-bond index fund portfolio and 5.4 percent for a 70-30 mix.For endowments greater than $1 billion, the average return was 5 percent. Had they realized that extra three-tenths of a percent, or 30 basis points, that the 60-40 portfolio delivered, they\u2019d have on average an additional $47 million in their endowments.The trend is likely to be even more pronounced next year, when the financial crisis results of the 2009 fiscal year drop out of the 10-year calculations. That\u2019s because alternatives did provide something of a buffer during that severe bear market, but have mostly underperformed since.Five-year averages suggest the magnitude of the gap: The average endowment had annualized five-year returns of 5.9 percent. A 60-40 mix returned 8.2 percent, and a 70-30 mix returned 9.2.\u201cThat\u2019s tens of millions of dollars that could have otherwise funded scholarships, built a new museum wing or bolster the corpus of the endowment to help future generations,\u201d said Christopher Philips, head of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services. (He\u2019s not a disinterested observer: Vanguard is a major purveyor of \u2014 and advocate for \u2014 low-cost index and mutual funds.)\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because these institutions do so much good work, and most of them could be doing so much better,\u201d Mr. Philips said.Even Yale University, which pioneered the so-called Yale Model now slavishly followed by many other endowments, and has a target allocation of nearly 90 percent of its assets in alternative assets, has seen its outperformance shrink in recent years. Yale delivered an 11.3 percent return for 2017, but that was below the average return for all endowments of 12.2 percent, according to the study by Nacubo, the National Association of College and University Business Officers.Yale still boasts a stellar 20-year annualized return of 12.1 percent, far above the endowment 20-year average of 7.4 percent, according to the university. But its 10-year annualized return has slipped to just 6.6 percent. (That still puts it in the top 5 percent of all endowment returns.) Still, Yale told me that its chief investment officer, David Swensen, is bullish on the school\u2019s portfolio relative to stocks and bonds for the next 10 years.The endowments\u2019 persistent devotion to high-cost alternative assets in the face of such poor performance, now documented across a decade-long span, baffles many. \u201cWe keep scratching our heads,\u201d Mr. Philips of Vanguard said.\u201cAmong the schools we survey, there\u2019s a strong belief in the endowment model pioneered 30 years or so ago by Yale and a few other schools,\u201d said Kenneth E. Redd, senior director of research and policy analysis for Nacubo. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any changes in portfolio alignment or investment philosophy even though the indexes have clearly outperformed both managed funds and hedge funds. There\u2019s still this belief that alternatives will provide some measure of outperformance.\u201dHe noted that endowments of more than $1 billion, which tend to have high allocations to alternatives, did on average outperform the 60-40 mix (but not the 70-30 mix) over the most recent five-year period.Jeff Schwartz, Markov\u2019s president, agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about true believers in the value of alternatives,\u201d he said. Many endowment managers, he added, \u201caren\u2019t completely objective.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve seen it work in the past, sometimes in a spectacular way,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to take an embedded belief system like that and say, just because we\u2019ve had an outstanding bull market, that you should move to 60-40. That\u2019s a tall order.\u201dGiven the need to cover increased costs, not to mention the recent tax legislation that seeks to tax the wealthiest endowments, asset managers at colleges are under increasing pressure to generate higher returns, even as lofty stock valuations and rising interest rates \u201csuggest it will be hard to get 7.5 percent with a traditional asset mix going forward,\u201d Mr. Philips said.\u201cSo there\u2019s a strong inclination to turn to something that promises higher returns,\u201d he said, even if they haven\u2019t delivered in the recent past.He also pointed to the \u201cmassive marketing machine in the alternative space,\u201d which is \u201ccausing investment managers to turn a blind eye to what\u2019s really happening in financial markets.\u201dUniversities depend heavily on draws from their endowments \u2014 typically 5 percent or more per year \u2014 to meet spending needs, and are still haunted by memories of the financial crisis. This month\u2019s stock market volatility was a painful reminder.So the promise of alternative investments to mitigate risk and protect against market downturns has been powerful, even if they haven\u2019t delivered.But with long-term \u2014 even infinite \u2014 time horizons, university endowments should be able to withstand market volatility.\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the need to support current spending,\u201d Mr. Philips said, \u201cbut if growing the corpus to support future spending is a primary objective, there should be more traditional equity exposure, not less. Adding nontraditional assets would be O.K. if they were compensating for illiquidity and higher risk, but they\u2019re not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: How Monday\u2019s Stock Plunge Ranks?", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 There have been far blacker Mondays.\u2022 Kenneth C. Griffin is growing concerned about inflation.\u2022 The Fed\u2019s regulatory action against Wells may have some bite.\u2022 Broadcom puts more pressure on Qualcomm\u2022 How worried should JPMorgan clients be about health care?\u2022 How much more will Wells Fargo have to do?Measured by points, those are steep drops \u2014 the biggest on record for the indexes. The previous largest point declines for each benchmark came in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.But Monday\u2019s plunge was far less impressive on a percentage basis. The Dow\u2019s fall ranked as its 100th biggest, while the S. & P. 500\u2019s slide was the 127th biggest in the index\u2019s history, according to S & P Dow Jones Indices.Here is how Monday\u2019s sell-off stacks up against two other major tumbles.But points are not the best way to compare the magnitude of a stock index\u2019s declines across eras. As the stock market has risen, big point moves have translated into increasingly smaller percentage changes. The Dow and the S. & P. 500 have more than doubled from their closes on Sept. 29, 2008.\u201cBlack Monday\u201d was a petrifying moment \u2014 an even bigger decline in both points and percentage than the stock market crash of 1929. But unlike the 1929 crash, the slide in 1987 did not contribute to a wider economic slump. The stock market recovered its losses by early 1989.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Peter EavisAs the U.S. stock markets look wobbly for the first time in nearly two years, at least one major investor is sounding a bearish tone.In a Jan. 31 letter to investors, Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago hedge-fund firm Citadel, wrote that even though the broader economic backdrop continues to be positive, he sees several warning signs that could turn stock prices downward.The end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy is one factor, Mr. Griffin wrote, that could pressure stocks. But the prospect of inflation, or a rapid rise in the prices of goods and services, is making him especially nervous.\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the nascent signs\u201d of rising inflation in a variety of countries, he wrote. As a result, he added, money managers at Citadel, which runs a variety of hedge funds, are \u201ccarefully positioning\u201d for a surprise, sharp upturn in inflation.Mr. Griffin added that he is also concerned about geopolitical risks, writing that his money managers need to be able to handle negative events if they do occur, \u201cincluding a trade policy misstep or a military conflict.\u201d He did not elaborate.In an interview with CNBC in November, Mr. Griffin said the stock market was in the \u201cseventh inning\u201d of a rally. He said through a spokesman on Monday that he still thinks there are several innings to go before a downturn begins and that he is more bearish on bond prices than stocks at the moment.\u2014 Kate KellyWith 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.The numbers\u202275 percent of companies are reporting earnings above estimates, above the five-year average.\u2022 Companies that are beating estimates are doing so by a 4 percent margin, below the five year average.\u202280 percent of companies have reported revenue above estimates, a record high.\u2022 All 11 sectors are reporting earnings growth.Wells Fargo\u2019s stock is down more than 7 percent Monday, suggesting that investors believe the growth cap will have some bite. With the economy strengthening and interest rates rising, banks can expect to earn higher profits as they make more loans and suffer fewer losses from defaults. Indeed, this optimistic scenario has helped send bank stocks on a tear in recent months. Now, the question is to what degree Wells Fargo will have to sit out the good times.Wells Fargo executives on Friday suggested that the cap would have limited financial impact, saying it would reduce this year\u2019s net profits by $300 million to $400 million, which works out at less than 2 percent of 2017\u2019s earnings. One reason the earnings hit might be small is that the bank can stay within the cap by selling short-term, lower-risk investments that don\u2019t earn much. Another way the bank intends to limit the negative impact is by reducing the amount of deposits on which the bank pays out a relatively high interest rate.Crucially, Wells Fargo said that it hopes to increase the size of its loan book. The hope is that, by shedding the low-risk investments, the bank will create the room to make more mortgages, credit card loans and loans to businesses, while staying within the limit.But it may not turn out to be as straightforward as that.The growth cap comes after a lackluster year for Wells, which reduced its loans 1 percent last year, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent at Bank of America. Investors waiting for catch-up growth at Wells may have to wait still longer. Also, much depends on whether Wells Fargo can now satisfy the Fed\u2019s concerns. Any indication that the bank is struggling to comply with the regulator\u2019s demands could set off more turmoil at the bank. There is also a possibility that the tactic of shedding of low-risk investments while making more loans could increase the overall risk of Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet.Brian Kleinhanzl, a banks analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote on Sunday that the Fed\u2019s action will \u201cmean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,\u201d adding, \u201cWells will also have to maintain the balance sheet while other banks are growing, and we view this as defensive versus peers.\u201d\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 A takeover price of $82 a share, up from its original offer of $70\u2022 A \u201csignificant\u201d breakup fee if a deal were to be halted for antitrust reasons\u2022 A \u201cticking fee\u201d that Broadcom would pay in cash if a deal took more than a year to closeIt said the new \u201cbest and final\u201d offer would be withdrawn if Qualcomm either pushed its annual shareholder meeting back from March 6 (when Broadcom hopes to unseat the entire board) or if it paid more than $110 a share for NXP Semiconductor.Other cryptocurrencies are falling as well. Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin are all down Monday.How far can Bitcoin fall?Simon Tobler, a trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told Bloomberg: \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold the $8,000 level, Bitcoin may fall to $5,000, where the next big support is. The market is lacking big buyers.\u201dMore from Anna Wilde Mathews, Dana Cimilluca and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:In a reflection of the sensitivity of the subject, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon hit the phones Tuesday to assuage clients\u2019 concerns, people familiar with the matter said. So did some of the firm\u2019s health care bankers, who get paid handsomely to help clients with mergers and other deals and worry the move could cost them business.More from Emily Flitter, Binyamin Appelbaum and David Enrich:The settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.From her interview with Judy Woodruff:\u201cI don\u2019t want to label what we\u2019re seeing a bubble \u2014 as a bubble.\u201cBut I would say that asset valuations generally are elevated, and this is a characterization that we have offered up, for example, last summer in our monetary policy report.\u201d\u2022 Getting bigger by merging with another media company doesn\u2019t solve CBS\u2019s problems.

{"Headline": "Defying N.R.A., Florida Lawmakers Back Raising Age Limits on Assault Rifles", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFaced with massive protests, the Republican governor announced a plan to raise the minimum age to buy any firearm, including semiautomatic rifles, from 18 to 21. Mr. Scott also vowed to strengthen rules to keep weapons away from people who have mental health problems or injunctions against them for stalking or domestic violence.\u201cI want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who has mental issues to use a gun,\u201d said Mr. Scott, who is widely expected to run for a United States Senate seat this year. \u201cI want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who is a danger to themselves or others to use a gun.\u201dStudent protesters who rallied at the State Capitol on Wednesday had demanded a complete ban on military-style assault rifles. On Friday, students said they were disappointed, if unsurprised, that Mr. Scott had stopped short of a ban, but vowed to keep pushing for one.Sofie Whitney, 18, who survived last week\u2019s shooting in Parkland, Fla., and traveled to Tallahassee to lobby lawmakers for stricter gun laws, watched Mr. Scott\u2019s news conference and started texting other survivors as it ended.\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is at least a start,\u201d Ms. Whitney said. \u201cWe\u2019re glad that we\u2019ve made progress in such a short time, which is obviously an accomplishment, and we\u2019re more determined to talk to more people to get more things done.\u201dThe move from Republicans demonstrated how quickly the politics around guns had shifted in Tallahassee, where the N.R.A. has wielded enormous influence for years. After mass shootings at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016 and in Fort Lauderdale last year, the state\u2019s leaders resisted demands to respond with stricter gun laws.Over seven years as governor, Mr. Scott has earned an \u201cA+\u201d rating from the N.R.A. He has opposed stricter background checks and pushed for lowering the cost to get a concealed weapon license. The N.R.A., in turn, flooded voters\u2019 inboxes with pro-Scott mailers during his re-election campaign four years ago.\u201cI\u2019m an N.R.A. member, I\u2019m a supporter of the Second Amendment, and the First Amendment, and the entire Bill of Rights for that matter,\u201d Mr. Scott said on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m also a father, and a grandfather, and a governor. We all have a difficult task in front of us: balancing our individual rights with our obvious need for public safety.\u201dSenator Bill Nelson, the Democrat the governor might challenge in November, denounced Mr. Scott\u2019s proposals, saying they failed to ensure comprehensive criminal background checks or ban assault rifles.\u201cStudents, parents and teachers across our state are demanding action \u2014 but instead of listening to them, it\u2019s clear the governor is once again choosing to listen only to the N.R.A.,\u201d Mr. Nelson said in a statement. \u201cHis leadership is weak and by recommending raising the age to 21 he is doing the bare minimum.\u201dRepublicans faced mounting pressure this week to act, as student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead, emerged as powerful voices in the national gun control debate.Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old shooting suspect, was able to legally purchase an AR-15 under Florida\u2019s law allowing 18-year-olds to purchase semiautomatic rifles. By comparison, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun. Mr. Scott\u2019s proposed rule, which Senator Marco Rubio also supports, would make 21 the minimum age across the board for all gun purchases.President Trump and the N.R.A. have endorsed putting more armed educators in schools, but Mr. Scott and state Republican legislators did not follow their lead.Instead, Mr. Scott\u2019s plan, which has largely been endorsed by Florida House and Senate leaders, would mandate at least one armed police officer for every 1,000 students at public schools.\u201cI disagree with arming teachers,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement. I think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201dMr. Scott, House Speaker Richard Corcoran and Senate President Joe Negron said they would also push to ban \u201cbump stocks,\u201d which enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster. Bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas mass shooting last year, but not in Parkland.Passage of any legislation would require Republican lawmakers to buck the N.R.A., which says the focus after the shooting should be on keeping \u201cviolent criminals and the dangerously mentally ill\u201d from acquiring guns.\u201cLegislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them from purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection,\u201d Jennifer Baker, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, said in a statement on Thursday.On Friday, Mr. Scott proposed spending $50 million to bolster the state\u2019s mental health resources. He said he wanted to expand access to counseling for young adults with serious mental illnesses and hire dedicated mental health counselors at schools.Going further than the governor\u2019s plan, lawmakers said they would seek to impose a three-day waiting period on all firearms purchases, which now exists only for handguns. They also would create a statewide commission to investigate the school shooting in Parkland, including a number of failures by the authorities.\u201cGovernment has failed on multiple levels,\u201d said Mr. Corcoran, a likely candidate for governor. \u201cThat can never happen again.\u201dSince the shooting, Sheriff Israel has ordered deputies to carry rifles on school grounds.A joint legislative announcement on Friday by Mr. Corcoran and Mr. Negron, about an hour after Mr. Scott\u2019s, indicated that a gun control package has a good chance of passing, even though the annual lawmaking session ends soon, on March 9. It would normally take lawmakers much longer than two weeks to vet and approve major legislation.Senate Democrats have vowed to attach an assault-weapons ban as an amendment to any Republican gun bill, but they are comfortably outnumbered in both chambers. A procedural maneuver by House Democrats on Tuesday to bring a ban to the floor for consideration failed by a party-line vote.The student protesters, who had returned to South Florida early Thursday morning after their trip to Tallahassee, parsed Mr. Scott\u2019s proposals, looking for signs of a shift in the political winds and hints that their activism had swayed the state\u2019s Republican lawmakers.Melanie Weber, 16, said she was not impressed by the governor\u2019s proposal to raise the age to buy firearms from 18 to 21. \u201cThe shooter in Las Vegas was in his 50s and the Pulse shooter was 29,\u201d she said, rattling off a grim list of previous mass shootings. But she said Mr. Scott\u2019s mental health proposals were a small step in the right direction.\u201cIf we had laws like that before everything happened,\u201d Ms. Weber said, \u201cit probably would never have happened in the first place.\u201dThe students said they were looking to the midterm elections, when they hope voters will elect more lawmakers who support a ban on assault weapons and other gun control measures.\u201cIt just makes me want to keep fighting even more,\u201d Julia Bishop, 18, said. \u201cI really don\u2019t want my classmates to die in vain, that\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But just one piece of respectful advice: If your generation and mine want to get serious about a gun control crusade, we all need to get out of Facebook and into someone\u2019s face: the N.R.A.\u2019s.This fight can\u2019t be won on Twitter or Instagram. They do get people into the streets. But social media have created a world of faux activism \u2014 \u201cHey, I tweeted about it\u201d \u2014 that the bad guys take advantage of. The N.R.A. is not just in the chat rooms. It\u2019s in the cloakrooms of Congress and state legislatures. And it\u2019s there with bags of money and votes it uses to reward lawmakers who do its bidding and hurt those who don\u2019t.I loved seeing the 100 students from your high school taking buses Tuesday to Florida\u2019s capital to directly press lawmakers. That\u2019s a great start. I hope every high school follows.But, ultimately, nothing will change unless young and old who oppose the N.R.A. run for office, vote, help someone vote, register someone to vote or help fund someone\u2019s campaign \u2014 so we can threaten the same electoral pain as the National Rifle Association, which, according to PolitiFact, spent $203.2 million between 1998 and 2017 funding its candidates, defeating gun control advocates and lobbying. This is not about persuading people with better ideas. We tried that. It\u2019s about generating raw electoral power and pain.Because most of the G.O.P. members of Congress who do the N.R.A.\u2019s bidding care about only one thing: their jobs. The pay of a typical congressman is $174,000 \u2014 and free parking at Reagan National Airport \u2014 and they will sell themselves to whoever can generate the votes to enable them to keep both.Are some Democratic lawmakers cowards, too? You bet. But I can show you plenty who have bucked their party\u2019s orthodoxies on education and trade and who insisted that their much-admired colleague Senator Al Franken had to resign over sexual harassment allegations. And most of them have long dared to lose elections to oppose the N.R.A. This is primarily a G.O.P. problem today.How do we know that? Read the paper or the web. The G.O.P., which claimed to stand for conservative family values, has prostrated itself before the most indecent person to ever occupy the White House \u2014 a man who lies as he breathes, smears poor, nonwhite nations and reportedly had sex with a porn star shortly after his wife delivered their son. But G.O.P. lawmakers are mute on this because President Trump energizes their base and ensures their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport.This is a party whose evangelicals have been telling us for decades that life is so sacred the G.O.P. must oppose abortion \u2014 even in the case of rape, incest or risk to the mother\u2019s life. But Republicans won\u2019t back common-sense gun laws that would protect fully developed human beings \u2014 because the N.R.A. energizes their base and funds their campaigns and ensures their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport.This is a party whose \u201cFreedom Caucus\u201d was so obsessed with our rising national debt that it tried to prevent Barack Obama from spending a dime to stimulate our economy after it went deep into recession \u2014 but just voted to add $1 trillion to the debt for a corporate tax cut without regard for the burden put on our kids. Republicans did so because Trump energizes their base and ensures that they keep their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport.Trying to embarrass them to act on principle is wasted breath. I suspect they\u2019re already embarrassed. When these G.O.P. lawmakers are alone at home contemplating the pictures of all these kids gunned down in Florida \u2014 thinking about what it\u2019d be like to be one of their parents \u2014 plenty of them probably feel filthy for doing the N.R.A.\u2019s bidding.They know full well that most voters are not asking to scrap the Second Amendment, but for common-sense gun laws that could prevent or reduce more school shootings and would not interfere with any decent Americans\u2019 right to own guns for hunting, sports or self-protection.They know full well that a common-sense banning of all military assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, or mandating universal background checks for gun buyers or to prevent terrorists and the mentally ill from buying guns, would not curb the constitutional right to bear arms.They know full well that they\u2019re in the grip of an N.R.A. cult, whose heart is so frozen, it\u2019s content to watch innocent children and adults get gunned down weekly \u2014 rather than impose common-sense gun limits. They know all of this \u2014 but they suppress it, because they also know if they vote for common-sense gun laws, the N.R.A. will fund their next opponent. Like I said, this is just about raw naked power, and that is what sensible gun control advocates have to generate more of now \u2014 in the form of votes and campaign funding. Otherwise nothing changes.Keep speaking out, Cameron \u2014 but never underestimate what some people will do for a $174,000 job and free parking at Reagan National Airport.Frank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Come the Recession, Don\u2019t Count on That Safety Net", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWhat will President Trump\u2019s first recession look like?While the economy is hardly booming, trundling along at an annual growth rate of about 2.5 percent, investors are getting jittery.It is hardly premature to ask, in this light, how the Trump administration might manage the fallout from the economic downturn that everybody knows will happen. Unfortunately, the United States could hardly be less prepared.Not only does the government have precious few tools at its disposal to combat a downturn. By slashing taxes while increasing spending, President Trump and his allies in Congress have further boxed the economy into a corner, reducing the space for emergency government action were it to be needed.Global inequality, after widening for decades, has stabilized. The share of the world\u2019s income captured by the top 1 percent has shrunk since its peak on the eve of the financial crisis.The economists Hilary Hoynes of the University of California, Berkeley, and Marianne Bitler of the University of California, Davis, pointed out in a recent paper that \u201cthe safety net for low-income families with children has transformed from one subsidizing out-of-work families into one subsidizing in-work families.\u201dAnd yet, as many unemployed Americans discovered the last time recession hit, government benefits that require recipients to hold a job become worthless when there is no work to be had.Consider what happened the last time around, when the bursting of the housing bubble pushed millions of workers out of their jobs. The Fed quickly slashed interest rates to zero. Months later it started buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds from financial institutions to lower long-term interest rates and encourage borrowing.The Obama administration hurried to cobble together an economic stimulus package of more than $1 trillion to get money to families that needed it most. It expanded the eligibility for unemployment insurance to its longest duration ever, 99 weeks. It raised the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers. It more than doubled the budget for food stamps \u2014 the poor\u2019s last line of defense.The economy failed to snap back as the administration hoped. Unemployment remained at 9 percent or more for over two years. But the administration\u2019s intervention to bolster the nation\u2019s welfare programs made a decisive difference for millions who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks of the nation\u2019s threadbare safety net.Had food stamps not been available, they estimated, the share of Americans under 65 living below the poverty line would have exceeded 11 percent in 2010, almost 1.5 percentage points more than was the case. The share of Americans in extreme poverty \u2014 with less than half the resources of the simply poor \u2014 would have exceeded 4 percent, about a third more than it turned out to be. Unemployment insurance had a roughly similar impact on poverty levels.What is critical to note is that each of the two programs did more to relieve extreme poverty during the depths of the Great Recession than even the earned-income tax credit, the main source of government support for low-income Americans.This is a problem for vulnerable Americans bracing for the next economic shock, because if Mr. Trump and his colleagues in Congress have their way, the only surviving bit of the social safety net when the next recession hits will probably require beneficiaries to work. The earned-income tax credit is likely to survive unscathed. Food stamps are not.Assiduously looking for places to cut spending to temper a growing budget deficit, the White House seems more than willing to pare the safety net. The budget it unveiled this month called for a 27 percent cut to the food stamp budget and a 20 percent cut to Section 8 housing assistance by 2028.Policy could change in the face of a new economic downturn, to be sure. There are plenty of places where the social safety net could be improved. The Russell Sage proposals include everything from a universal child allowance to a renter\u2019s tax credit; from subsidizing employment to a public works program paying a living wage.Yet somehow I can\u2019t see Mr. Trump and Republican allies like the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, allowing able-bodied Americans off the hook. They may not quite endorse the infamous words attributed by President Herbert Hoover to his Treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon, as the Great Depression bore down on the economy \u2014 \u201cLiquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate\u201d \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if all they have to say when the next recession liquidates work is \u201cGet a job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Well-Heeled Investors Reap the Republican Tax Cut Bonanza", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialNow corporate announcements and analyst reports confirm what honest observers always said \u2014 this claim is pure fantasy. As executives tell investors what they intend to do with their tax savings and their spending plans are tabulated into neat charts and graphs, the reports jibe with what most experts said would happen: Companies are rewarding their stockholders.Businesses are buying back shares, which creates demand for the stocks, boosts share prices and benefits investors. Some of the cash is going to increase dividends. And a chunk will go to acquiring other businesses, creating larger corporations that face less competition.Those crumbs, by the way, disappear after a few years. Further, many taxpayers in states like California, New Jersey and New York will be hit with higher tax bills when they file their 2018 tax returns and realize that they can now only deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes.There was a legitimate argument for reforming the tax code in a way that reduced the corporate tax rate, closed loopholes and made the economy fairer and more productive. But Republicans chose a plan that rewards the rich at the expense of workers. They had to lie to make this scheme seem legitimate. Now the true effects are coming to fruition.Advertisement"}

President Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner\u2019s news network, CNN, and said before the election that the deal should be stopped.The bigger pictureCecilia Kang of the NYT: For the first time, and after much protest, public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of the chief executive. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed nearly eight years ago, required the disclosure, and firms are now disclosing it in proxy reports for 2017.Companies, lobbyists and some compensation experts spent years criticizing the rule, arguing that it revealed little about pay trends and was of little use to shareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning think tank, on Tuesday noted that Honeywell was the first United States corporation to release the ratio. The company\u2019s C.E.O., Darius Adamczyk, had a total pay package of $16.8 million in 2017, which was 333 times the pay of the median employee.The rule allows certain companies to exclude some foreign employees from the calculation of the ratio. Honeywell excluded workers from several countries where pay is most likely lower than in the United States. \u201cThe 333:1 ratio that Honeywell is reporting most likely would be even wider if Honeywell took all its workers into account,\u201d the Institute said.\u2014 Peter EavisA federal judge in Manhattan, in a brief order, rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Mr. Cohen and his firm, Point72 Asset Management, to temporarily seal a complaint filed last week by Lauren Bonner, an employee of the firm. Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer had asked the judge to seal the lawsuit, which alleges the firm underpays female employees and fosters a hostile workplace for women, pending the resolution of another motion to push the matter into arbitration.Judge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the request to seal the entire complaint was \u201cnot narrowly tailored\u201d and was inconsistent with the \u201cpresumption of public access\u201d to court records.Lawyers for Mr. Cohen had sought to seal the order because it contained details of other employees\u2019 compensation packages. The lawsuit also detailed a testosterone-fueled \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d atmosphere in which men commented frequently on women\u2019s bodies and belittled their abilities.\u2014 Matthew GoldsteinAndrew writes:More from the column:There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products. Just this month, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America banned the use of their cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.To be clear: Those three banks won\u2019t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle \u2014 the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex.The United States Treasury Department is flooding the market with debt. On Tuesday, the government sold $179 billion worth of debt.Bloomberg reports:\u201cConcerns about the U.S. borrowing cap had forced the Treasury to trim the total amount of bills it had outstanding, but that\u2019s no longer a problem and the government is now busy ramping up issuance. Financing estimates from January show that the Treasury expects to issue $441 billion in net marketable debt in the current quarter and the bulk of that is likely to be in the short-term market.\u201dThat\u2019s been a regular question since the tax overhaul was signed into law last year. Analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note over the weekend shed some light on the answer.\u2022 \u201cCompanies have pointed to a modest increase in investment as one destination for the incremental cash flow from tax reform. Consensus estimates for 2018 capex have increased by $17 billion (3 percent) since the passage of tax reform.\u201d\u2022 Last month 39 S.&P. 500 companies increased their dividend, while for the first since 2012 no companies cut their payments.\u2022 Buying back shares remains a priority of companies, Goldman writes. Over the past 2 \u00bd months, S.&P. 500 firms have announced $171 billion of buybacks, $67 billion of which has come this year, a 22% increase from the same period in 2017.In the same note, Goldman also took a closer look at this earnings season.By many measures, corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in the past decade. Goldman points out:\u2022 Companies in the S.&P. 500 are set to report that profit grew 15 percent last quarter. That\u2019s the fastest pace since 2011.\u2022 The percentage of companies beating estimates is at its highest level since 2010. The percentage beating sales forecast is at its highest since 2004.But the stock reaction to S.&P. 500 companies either beating or missing expectations \u201chas been muted relative to history.\u201dThe reason? Investors are more focused on tax reform and earnings forecasts for 2018, Goldman writes.

{"Headline": "Highlights: Students Call for Action Across Nation; Florida Lawmakers Fail to Take Up Assault Rifle Bill", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCORAL SPRINGS, Fla. \u2014 Driven by rage and grief over one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history, students from across the country were taking action in hopes of pushing their lawmakers to rethink their positions on gun control, even as the Florida State House rejected a move on Tuesday to consider a bill that would ban assault rifles.From California to Florida, teenagers walked out of classes, stopped traffic and made stirring speeches calling out their elders for inaction.\u2022 Assault rifles have become a particular target of the latest gun-control campaign. The police say the suspect in last week\u2019s massacre, Nikolas Cruz, was able to kill 17 people in just six minutes by wielding a semiautomatic weapon, an AR-15 rifle.State Representative Kionne McGhee, a Democrat from Miami, asked for an unusual procedural move to consider his legislation, which had been filed earlier in the session but was never scheduled for a hearing.\u201cThe shooting in Parkland demands extraordinary action,\u201d Mr. McGhee said Tuesday on the House floor, as a different group of Stoneman Douglas High students, who had previously arrived, peered down from the gallery.The motion failed, 36 to 71, in a vote along party lines. At least one student burst into tears, Mr. McGhee said. One girl covered her mouth in despair, as a woman patted her arm to comfort her. The episode lasted 2 minutes and 38 seconds.As the news began to spread aboard a bus of students headed to the capital, Anthony Lopez, 16, a junior, slammed his head back on the bus seat. He placed a hand on his forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s infuriating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re acting inhuman.\u201d\u201cThe one fear we have is that nothing will change,\u201d he added.A similar proposal filed last year in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando also went nowhere.\u201cThe House looks forward to working with the Governor and Senate to find solutions to fulfill government\u2019s primary mission \u2014 to keep its citizens \u2014 its children safe,\u201d said Richard Corcoran, the Republican speaker of the House, in a statement. \u201cAnd it is our goal to give these collective solutions the serious review and consideration they deserve.\u201dIn session later on Tuesday, the House did approve a resolution declaring pornography a public health risk. Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, questioned why the pornography proposal was given priority. Implicit in his question was why the assault weapons ban was not.\u201cHas anyone ever been killed as a result of the health implications of pornography?\u201d he asked.On Tuesday, teenagers from the school, gripping pillows and sleeping bags and carrying doughnuts and candy, packed a grocery store parking lot in Coral Springs, Fla., to begin the more than 400-mile journey to Tallahassee.Their goal: convincing lawmakers to pass a slate of gun control bills in a state that has been among the friendliest to firearm owners in the nation.Many had come straight from the funeral of one of the dead. They hugged their parents goodbye and loaded backpacks into the bellies of three buses. Dozens climbed aboard.In a telephone interview from the bus, Sarah Chadwick, 16, a junior, said the social media response to the students had been overwhelming, but she wanted everyone to know: \u201cWe see your support, we see what you\u2019re doing.\u201dThe students felt they had the \u201cbest voices to listen to right now,\u201d along with other survivors of shootings, and that Twitter had allowed them to reach more people than they would have thought possible, she said.\u201cWe have stuff to say, and we won\u2019t be silenced after a matter of days, or even weeks,\u201d she said.By the seventh hour of the trip, students on the bus had become aware of Mr. Clooney\u2019s donation and the supportive remarks made by other celebrities.But as they strategized in the back of the bus, some worried that Mr. Clooney\u2019s star power and liberal activism would swallow their voices and push conservatives away.\u201cThe minute they don\u2019t see our faces anymore, and they just see the Hollywood elite, they\u2019re going to stop taking it seriously,\u201d said Chris Grady, 18, a senior with a mop of curly hair.Mr. Grady said he had enlisted in the Army a few months back, but that the attack at his school had made him think hard about whether that was the path he wanted to take.\u201cAs it stands right now, the real danger is at home, not abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is where I want to be \u2014 right at the heart of the movement.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to study,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd now for sure I\u2019ll be getting my degree in political science.\u201dFinally, around 10 p.m., the three buses of students from Stoneman Douglas High rolled into the parking lot of a Tallahassee high school. They had arrived.\u201cOh. My. God,\u201d said one teenager, peering out the bus window. \u201cIt\u2019s so many people.\u201dA crowd of people from Leon High had gathered in front of the red brick building to support and cheer the Stoneman Douglas group.In the morning, the students will break into groups and meet with some 70 elected officials. Gov. Rick Scott is expected to give them two hours.Mallory Muller, a Stoneman Douglas High student, hugged a teddy bear to her chest.\u201cThe whole bus ride here I was very anxious,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have the nervousness about \u2014 what happens? And kind of scared for your own safety.\u201d\u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing tomorrow is big,\u201d she went on, \u201cso I think there is that buildup tomorrow, too. That pressure.\u201d\u201cEverybody started walking,\u201d one student told the news channel. \u201cIt felt like half the school was walking.\u201dAs the students walked south on U.S. Highway 441, sheriff\u2019s deputies lined the road to direct traffic and keep them safe, but did not interfere. The distance between the two schools is about 10 miles.The march from Boca Raton surprised Broward County officials, who said they had heard nothing about the protest. Todd DeAngelis, a spokesman for the city of Parkland, said the authorities abruptly assembled an escort by law enforcement and organized water stations on a day when the temperature was in the low 80s.In a rare honor, the United States Military Academy offered the member, Peter Wang, 15, the realization of a lifelong dream: admission to West Point, posthumously. The academy said it was extending the offer in recognition of his \u201cheroic actions\u201d during the shooting.Relatives of Mr. Wang, a cadet in the school\u2019s Junior Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps program, described him as modest and not interested in status, but eager to serve and help others.At his funeral on Tuesday, the military mourners acknowledged him as one of them. They came in echoes of the uniform that he had once proudly worn: Marine and Navy dress blues, high school R.O.T.C. members in their dress uniforms, others wearing camouflage fatigues. Veterans were in attendance, as well.\u201cWe came down to represent,\u201d said Jeff Colopy, vice commander of American Legion Post 157 in Margate, Fla., to \u201cpay tribute to one of our fallen comrades. In our eyes, he was military.\u201dLying in an open coffin in the small chapel at Kraeer Funeral Home and Cremation Center in Coral Springs, with a military honor guard at either end, Mr. Wang wore his uniform. A line of mourners stretched out of the chapel, with scores more waiting under a tent outside.Mr. Wang was one of three Junior R.O.T.C. cadets who were killed in the shooting; the others were Martin Duque, 14, and Alaina Petty, also 14.At rallies across the country on Monday and Tuesday, students made pleas for gun control and declared that while they might not be old enough to vote, they were old enough to change society.\u201cFrequently, when there are mass shootings, we see stories about how the shooter made threats, posted on social media, and did all kinds of things showing that he was a danger to the community, yet nothing was done,\u201d said Mr. Leach, a Democrat, in a statement. \u201cMy new bill would allow a judge to separate dangerous people from their guns until they get the help they need.\u201dIn Vermont, a progressive but rural state with largely permissive gun laws, Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, initially told reporters the state\u2019s gun laws did not need to be updated after the Florida shooting, according to news reports. But Mr. Scott changed his tone a day later, after the authorities accused an 18-year-old student of planning an attack at his school in Fair Haven, Vt.In Ohio, Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who has previously touted support from the N.R.A., made an impassioned plea for Congress to consider restrictions on assault weapons.\u201cWould you feel as though your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn\u2019t buy a God darn AR-15?\u201d Mr. Kasich, who voted for an assault weapons ban in 1994 while in Congress, asked on CNN. \u201cThese are the things that have to be looked at.\u201dIn Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, repeated a position he took in late January after a 15-year-old shot and killed two fellow students at a high school in Benton, Ky. Mr. Bevin suggested in an interview with The Cincinnati Enquirer that it was violent video games and culture, rather than guns, that should be restricted.In Rhode Island, Gina Raimondo, the Democratic governor, reiterated calls for stronger state and federal measures.Julie Turkewitz reported from Coral Springs, Fla., and Anemona Hartocolis from New York.

One of my most important responsibilities is succession, and I am blessed to have a spectacular leader and investor like Jon Gray to whom I can hand the reins,\u201d Mr. James said.The Federal Reserve chairman took his position this year facing plenty of economic factors that could stoke inflation, including:\u2022 Resurgent global economies\u2022 Years of cheap and plentiful credit\u2022 Joblessness falling to multiyear lows, making it easier for workers to get a raise or a bonus, which could push up companies\u2019 costsThen the Fed\u2019s job got harder. Congress passed a large tax cut that will add a jolt of stimulus to an economy that no longer needs extra juice. The stock market loved it and kept zooming higher.But turbulence hit. On Feb. 5, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted over 1,100 points, or 4.6 percent.That brought some much-needed caution\u2022 Investors in the stock market, down 7.6 percent from its high, now know the party can\u2019t go on uninterrupted.\u2022 People are having a real debate about inflation.In other words, nose-diving stocks did Mr. Powell a favor: They threw some cold water on the animal spirits that Congress whipped up.The notes of cautionThe best scenario for the Fed is that the rate hikes forecast for this year are enough to also limit the stimulus from the tax overhaul.Meanwhile, to finance the deficit, the Treasury Department now has to sell more billions of dollars of extra bonds. The huge new government demand for credit could push up interest rates in the markets. The Fed may be fine with that, given that it is expected to raise interest rates this year. But if interest rates in the bond market spike higher than investors expect, or the Fed is happy with, Mr. Powell would face his first big challenge as Fed chairman.\u2014 Peter EavisIn its prime, Chipotle Mexican Grill positioned itself as the paragon of clean, casual, cool dining, a darling of Wall Street, a restaurant industry innovator.Basically, nothing like Taco Bell.How the tables have turned.

{"Headline": "The G.O.P. Is Flirting With Fiscal Disaster", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn August 2015, the leading Washington budget watchdog predicted that the federal deficit would total about $600 billion the next year.Now, just about two and a half years later, the projected gap for 2019 has grown to $1.2 trillion, in large part because of a boisterous round of tax cuts and spending increases. And if history is any guide, when the books close, the final number will be higher.That amounts to a shortfall that will rival the deficits of a decade ago, when the economy was struggling to recover from the financial crisis and ensuing recession.But while fiscal stimulus to restore economic growth has merit, staggering deficits in the ninth year of a recovery, with unemployment down to 4.1 percent, make no sense.In addition to piling more debt onto the current $20 trillion of outstanding obligations, today\u2019s mounting gap between revenues and expenses is already contributing to higher interest rates and the shakiness in the stock market.Leading the charge into rising amounts of red ink have been the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.Yes, blame for what is likely to be $15 trillion of added debt over the next 10 years should be placed squarely on the self-proclaimed party of fiscal responsibility.\u201cThe level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable,\u201d the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said in 2016. Referring to President Obama\u2019s stimulus program, he added, \u201cWe borrowed $1 trillion and nobody could find that it did much of anything.\u201dThat was then and this is now.On top of insisting that the nation needed tax cuts that could total $2.1 trillion over the next decade, the Republicans clamored for large increases in military spending. As the price for their cooperation, the Democrats won an equal increase in domestic spending.Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, but that\u2019s just not responsible governing. While I\u2019m all for meeting pressing needs, as part of doing so, both the White House and the Congress have an obligation to find other savings or sources of revenues. Just like every household and business must.I recognize that those of us who have warned of the ominous consequences of deficit and debt have yet to be proven right by a market crisis or the like. And the current gyrations in both stocks and bonds may not turn out to constitute that proof.However, never in the 35 years since Ronald Reagan managed to eradicate fear of deficits from the national psyche have we flirted so aggressively with potential fiscal disaster.For one thing, on present course and speed, deficits of more than $1 trillion will persist indefinitely. Indeed, if current policies are maintained, the gap would exceed $2 trillion by 2027, according to calculations by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.That would mean that the amount of debt relative to the size of our economy (the ratio of debt to gross domestic product) could reach a record 109 percent by 2027, exceeding even post-World War II levels.For another, for the first time since at least the 1960s, we have thrown a deficit log onto a fire that was already burning briskly. That Vietnam War era decision \u2014 that we could have both guns and butter \u2014 contributed meaningfully to the raging inflation that erupted a few years later.Although inflation has been quiescent so far in this recovery, potential pressure from rising wages has begun to appear, particularly in last week\u2019s unemployment report.While we all want to see pay go up, particularly for working-class Americans, excessive wage increases can become excessive price increases, which would in turn force the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates faster than it would otherwise.The bond market, which can serve as a kind of early warning signal of overheating, has been signaling concerns for several weeks. The yield on 10 year Treasury notes, which had been loitering around 2.35 percent, has jumped to 2.8 percent.That may not sound like much, but in the world of bonds, rates generally don\u2019t move that far that fast. Importantly, higher interest rates are the enemy of stock prices. As yields rise, investors begin to shift money from equities to debt, depressing valuations of the former. That may well be a part of what is now occurring.Having lived for nearly 15 years with high deficits and low inflation, Americans may have become inured to the risks of bad budget policy.As unattractive as the policy options are (essentially, raising taxes or finding spending that we are willing to cut), we would all be well advised to take on the challenge before it is too late.Steven Rattner, who was a counselor in the Obama Treasury Department, is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts in Hand, Companies Spend More on Themselves Than on Wages", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump promised that his tax cut would encourage companies to invest in factories, workers and wages, setting off a spending spree that would reinvigorate the American economy.Companies have announced plans for some of those investments. But so far, companies are using much of the money for something with a more narrow benefit: buying their own shares.Those so-called buybacks are good for shareholders, including the senior executives who tend to be big owners of their companies\u2019 stock. A company purchasing its own shares is a time-tested way to bolster its stock price.But the purchases can come at the expense of investments in things like hiring, research and development and building new plants \u2014 the sort of investments that directly help the overall economy. The buybacks are also most likely to worsen economic inequality because the benefits of stocks purchases flow disproportionately to the richest Americans.What companies do with the trillions of dollars they\u2019re bringing back to the United States, and the money they will save each year on their tax bills, will in large part determine whether the plan is a success or a failure.As the tax cuts kick in, companies have laid out a variety of uses for the money. Some are paying out one-time bonuses to employees. Others are raising salaries. Others plan to open new factories.In the fourth quarter, American companies\u2019 investments in things like factories and business equipment grew by 6.8 percent. That was the fastest growth rate since 2014, but far from the giant surge in capital spending that was promised ahead of the tax overhaul.But the buying back of shares is also at record levels.Almost 100 American corporations have trumpeted such plans in the past month. American companies have announced more than $178 billion in planned buybacks \u2014 the largest amount unveiled in a single quarter, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm.Such purchases reduce a company\u2019s total number of outstanding shares, giving each remaining share a slightly bigger piece of the profit pie.On Monday, Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire might be open to buy some of its shares. The remarks helped send Berkshire\u2019s stock \u2014 and the broader market \u2014 higher.\u201cI\u2019m expecting buybacks to get to a record for 2018,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m disappointed, there\u2019s a lot of people with me.\u201dThe flurry of planned buybacks has been good for the stock market. Early this month, stocks were down more than 10 percent from their January peak. The prospect of companies flooding markets with \u201cbuy\u201d orders helped the market recoup some of its losses.The broader impact on the economy is less clear. Economists believe a rising stock market benefits the economy, helping support consumer and business confidence. But the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of American households, who own 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40 percent of all stocks.Ultimately, the effect of the rising stock market depends on how those wealthy investors use their windfall. It helps the economy more, for example, if they put the money toward productive new companies than if they invest in government bonds.Companies typically decide to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories based on whether they will make the company more profitable \u2014 not merely because the companies are sitting on a pile of money that they otherwise would have paid in taxes.At a news conference Thursday, the head of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, acknowledged that many companies were spending their money on buying their own shares.\u201cRight now we\u2019re going to have an adjustment where you see probably more dividends and share buybacks than wage increases,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cBut going forward we\u2019re going to see a lot of capital formation and wage growth.\u201dThat is not what happened in 2005, when a one-time tax holiday allowed companies to repatriate money on the cheap. That plan, championed by President George W. Bush, was sold as a way to get American companies to invest more in the domestic economy.Studies have shown that the tax change lifted companies\u2019 stock prices but did not expand their American work forces.Until the early 1980s, the practice of buying shares with corporate money was considered borderline illegal because it was thought to potentially open the company up to charges of manipulating share prices.But in 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that gave the green light to most share repurchases, as long as they followed certain rules.Historically, American companies had paid out profits with a quarterly check, known as a dividend. But after the S.E.C.\u2019s rule change, companies started using more of their profits to buy their own shares, in the process giving their shareholders a bigger piece of the company.Buybacks soon soared. By 2016, the most recent year for which there is complete data, companies spent $536 billion on purchasing their own shares, according to data from S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.That was about 5 percent less than those companies spent on new plants, research and development and other investments. By contrast, 20 years ago, companies spent four times as much on such investments as they did on buybacks.\u201cWe have some causal evidence that because of short-termism companies are doing some stock repurchases that maybe they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Heitor Almeida, a professor of corporate finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s causing them to reduce investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Frustration Grows as Congress Shows Inability to Pass Even Modest Gun Measures", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After a gunman in Las Vegas slaughtered country-music fans with assault weapons that mimicked a machine gun, lawmakers from both parties said they would move quickly to ban so-called bump stocks.After a mass shooter massacred churchgoers in Sutherland Springs, Tex., the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn of Texas, was stirred to action, pledging legislation to bolster the nation\u2019s instant background check system for would-be gun buyers.Congress has effectively done neither.That inaction sank in on Thursday, as lawmakers confronted yet another mass shooting, this time with some of the survivors imploring Congress to finally take action. Republicans called for prayers, but argued that no single fix to the nation\u2019s gun laws would deter a shooting like the one on Wednesday in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead, many of them children.\u201cThis is one of those moments where we just need to step back and count our blessings,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said. \u201cWe need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together.\u201dDemocrats, who have put forward a spate of gun safety bills only to see them left unaddressed by Republicans, who control the House and Senate, seethed with frustration.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to stop, members, it\u2019s going to continue,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, a leading gun control advocate, told her colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cAnd we become culpable when we do nothing to stop it.\u201dBut the failure to act on the instant background check and bump-stock bills underscored that even on the most modest of gun measures, Congress is simply incapable of a response.What was striking in the aftermath of the carnage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is that, now, even the victims and survivors are willing to call their leaders out.\u201cMy message to lawmakers in Congress is please, take action,\u201d David Hogg, a student at the school, said as he looked directly into CNN\u2019s camera on Thursday.\u201cAny action at this point instead of just complete stagnancy and blaming the other side of the political aisle would be a step in the right direction,\u201d he added.Melissa Falkowski, a teacher at the school, told CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional because I feel today like our government, our country, has failed us and failed our kids and didn\u2019t keep us safe.\u201dAs attention faded, that influential organization and Republican leaders changed course, arguing that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be best positioned to deal with the problem through existing regulation.Senators once again coalesced around another modest bipartisan fix in December, after discovering a lapse that allowed the gunman in Sutherland Springs to buy his weapons despite a domestic violence conviction. Their proposal incentivizes state and federal agencies to report criminal offenses and other information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.Mr. Cornyn, one of the bill\u2019s lead authors, took to the Senate floor on Thursday to urge its consideration.\u201cI personally am unwilling to face another family member who\u2019s lost a loved one as a result of one of these mass shootings that could be prevented by making sure the background check system works as Congress intended,\u201d he said.Neither Mr. Ryan nor Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said anything on Thursday that suggested that would soon change.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, I have not heard anyone explain how an improved background check system would necessarily have prevented a particular incident,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who helped write a bill mandating near-universal background checks after the slaughter at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. \u201cAnd so to the extent to which we really don\u2019t have a solution for these appalling massacres, I think that makes it harder to get traction for some ideas that I think are constructive ideas.\u201dIn Parkland, where students, teachers and parents gathered again on Thursday to mourn, there was little patience for such thinking. Lyliah Skinner, a student who survived the shooting, rejected politicians\u2019 thoughts and prayers and called for action.\u201cIf they\u2019re not able to purchase their first drink of alcohol, then how are we allowed to buy guns at the age of 18 or 19?\u201d she asked, adding, \u201cObviously whatever we have going on, it\u2019s not working.\u201dGov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, spoke of the importance of keeping guns from the dangerously mentally ill. A law enforcement official said they needed more police.Robert W. Runcie, the Broward County superintendent, took on lawmakers more directly.\u201cStudents have been reaching out to me, reaching out to staff, probably board members and others saying that now \u2014 now is the time for this country to have a real conversation on sensible gun control laws,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "10 Things We Learned About Teenagers and the News: The Results of Our Student \u2018News Diet\u2019 Challenge", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContests1. Do a personal 24- to 48-hour news audit in which you record all the news you get now, where it comes from and how well it meets your needs and interests.2. Change your \u201cnews diet\u201d to make it better meet your needs. Tinker with sources, content and platforms to address what you discovered in your news audit.3. In a personal essay (500 words or fewer) or video (one minute or shorter), reflect on your experiences before and after you experimented with your news diet, and sum up how you see the role of news in your life now.We heard from 358 teenagers, most clustered in high schools where their teachers obviously took days, if not a week or more, to guide the process. (Teachers, we can\u2019t thank you enough. In fact, since the challenge was a new one for us, we\u2019d love to hear how it felt on your end, and if you are seeing any continuing effects on your students. Please feel free to post a comment here, or write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com.)Below we list our winners, runners-up and honorable mentions, and showcase the essays of our top students. Throughout, we\u2019ve also embedded the five videos we liked best.But as we wrote when we introduced the challenge, navigating information in a connected world is a problem not just for students, but for all of us \u2014 which is why we want to detail some of what we learned. Though these are lessons from teenagers, we\u2019re pretty sure anyone of any age who takes our three-step challenge in 2018 will discover very much the same._________For many, the 24-hour news audit revealed that though \u201cnews\u201d came to them constantly, it was mostly in the form of headlines they\u2019d breeze over and not really understand, or updates about sports or celebrities.Every day my routine was the same: sink into my bed and pull out my phone to catch up on what\u2019s happening in the world. Khloe Kardashian pregnant with Tristan Thompson\u2019s baby, Rapper Lil Peep died from a powerful drug overdose, Melanie Martinez, former \u2018Voice\u2019 contestant, accused of rape. It was an endless stream of celebrity news that I briefly examined but never read in depth. Still, I felt confident that I was caught up on all the news.My generation is the future and that leaves me genuinely terrified. This feeling came over me in class when my classmates and I shared the results of our initial news audit for The New York Times Media Challenge. Who cares that CVS is buying Aetna, or that the Republicans are moving a new tax bill through Congress? We thought the real news was that there is an ugly sweater party on Friday, or that Lululemon is having a Black Friday sale.My peers and I were essentially saying, \u201cI will worry about that when I am an adult.\u201dStudent after student talked about how \u201cdumb\u201d they felt in conversations in class, at the dinner table, and among friends when they couldn\u2019t contribute.In my journalism class, we read articles and discuss current news. In order to write, you need to read, and I realized that I never paid attention. Last year during the election cycle, I told myself that because I had no interest in politics, I didn\u2019t need to bother myself by reading articles about the presidential candidates and what was happening in the White House. At school, that was what everyone was talking about. I was lost and could not participate in any discussions, due to my lack of knowledge. Students and teachers were invested in the news, while I was sitting to the side, unable to contribute anything in conversations.Again and again we heard that the process of getting started was daunting.Obviously this transition was not smooth and simple. It is hard to go from reading an immature 250-word tweet to reading a well-written, somewhat boring professional article, and there were still problems with these platforms: Could I trust them after watching and reading about the president of the United States, the man that the Electoral College elected, publicly denounce CNN, NBC, and The New York Times?Another teenage participant wrote that after following the news for a week, I \u201cstarted to feel like a citizen of the world.\u201d____________________This came through loud and clear as our participants\u2019 primary excuse for not being more informed.I found that there is a horrific famine in Saudi Arabia and many innocent people and children are dying because the Saudi government is not letting any help in. I learned more about the Iraq wars and how the U.S. is sending soldiers overseas to fight and fix Iraq\u2019s problems with their corrupt government and invading terrorist groups. If we pull out our troops we can save our money and lives.I felt helpless and upset since it felt like I was worlds away from the problems and couldn\u2019t do anything about them.The news scares me; it makes me feel unsafe, uncertain, bored, sad, and most of all, anxious.\u2026 I have read, watched and listened to news about fires, Donald Trump, technology business that I still do not understand even after reading an article about it, sexual harassment, celebrity news, North Korea, pollution, and everything in between since I started this project, and the effect all of this has had on me is literally sickening. I have felt nauseous after finding out wordly information on more than one occasion, in addition to either an anxious feeling or pure sadness. These feelings that I\u2019ve been experiencing lately have made me wonder \u2014 Is my anxiety is normal? The other people in my class, along with my teacher, seem to have such an easy time discussing issue after issue, while I am silently hiding my scared thoughts.I heard about the Rohingya people, refugees trying to escape violence in Myanmar for a safer Bangladesh. I had never heard of them before, but, afterward, I researched everything I could about their plight. Luckily the media was shedding light on their stories, which the Myanmar\u2019s government was desperately trying to hide \u2026 Ignorance is not bliss, it just means more suffering for people who need us.Suddenly, like a gust of wind, it hit me. News was connected to me. This little boy was no longer a stranger tome, but someone close. His death suddenly became personal because my mom had reacted to his original story. The story inspired her to take action, and do something kind, which made an impact on his life. This completely changed my view on the media. When we read and respond to news, as my mom did, we experience a deep connection to humanity.Via their 24-hour news audit, many students realized that their sources leaned heavily in one political direction or another, and set out to fix that by adding new ones.But once they began comparing the treatment of the same story across publications, some felt angry or defeated.A Fox News headline states, \u201cRoy Moore, battered by the media and the establishment, loses in huge Alabama upset\u201d while a headline from CNN stated, \u201cMeasuring the \u2018Alabama earthquake\u2019: How Doug Jones won\u201d Comparing the two titles, the first, by Fox News seems to victimize Roy Moore, an accused pedophile, by using hyperbolic language, while the second headline is more of a factual statement, by CNN.In A.P. Government and Politics I\u2019ve been learning about parts of government, public participation, and the inside and out of political parties. This information gives me a false sense of confidence in my knowledge about the American government. Through reading I\u2019ve discovered that each little action that the politicians make is scrutinized and bashed by one side and praised by the other. Because of this pattern it\u2019s very difficult to understand what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.This exercise leaves me wondering if this mix-up would benefit our country and if it would help the states become more unified, like a country should be. As previously stated, it does help me understand people who are on the opposite side of the political spectrum. If everyone tried the mix-up, we would have a better understanding of one another and even though we would disagree with each other, we might comprehend each others POV\u2019s more clearly.Just starting to understand the world of news, and exposing themselves to a wide range of sources, seemed to open students\u2019 eyes.I Googled \u201cunbiased news\u201d, and came across www.allsides.com. This website offers a liberal, conservative, and centrist point of view for every article. I read all three points of view for most articles and I got to see why liberals feel the way they do about things, and why conservatives disagree and their feelings. I really enjoyed seeing their reasoning and arguments. What really stood out to me was that sometimes the two sides would make emphasis of some evidence that proved their claim, while the other side wouldn\u2019t make as big of a deal out of it because it wasn\u2019t useful to their cause.Why did I never consider what the liberal news outlets had to say? I realized that I rejected liberal news because I didn\u2019t want to know their narrative. I was grounded in my own views, and stubbornly rejected whatever the left- wing had to say.When I took I step back and looked at the news a really consume, I was dismayed. I was being flooded by Twitter news, CNN, and Syracuse.com. Twitter was the worse. Most of the people I follow on Twitter are very, very, very liberal. I think the only non liberal person I follow is President Trump. Actually \u2026 I don\u2019t even follow President Trump; Twitter just floods my phone with his tweets.On an average day, I\u2019ll spend 45 minutes scrolling through my seemingly endless Twitter feed about the day\u2019s current uproar. I paradoxically felt inundated by the constant flood of news updates, yet still oblivious to the world\u2019s affairs. The tweets, though expansive in quantity, lacked breadth in the details. Twitter is great in that news outlets can send updates out to users instantaneously, but the platform\u2019s tragic flaw renders it useless. Tweets all seems to dumb down our news into an easy-to-read, 140 character blurb. But the problem is that our news just isn\u2019t that simple. The GOP tax plan and the Trump-Russia probe are highly complex issues. And watering the facts down into a quick tweet does a disservice to Americans, who have the right to be informed.I decided to have a \u201cjuice cleanse.\u201d For a full 24 hours, I ignored every article sent my way on social media; instead, I pored through the headlines of the day on traditional news sites such as The New York Times and BBC. For a full day, I was irrevocably freed from the endless wars on social media comment sections, and the nagging need to constantly fact-check my sources.Though this experience was certainly refreshing, I realized something important: to have a well-balanced news diet doesn\u2019t necessarily entail removing social media completely. In fact, social media offers various unique advantages to consumers. For instance, we can actively engage in conversations about current affairs with people from all over the world.I found that the news provided by Snapchat was aimed toward my age demographic. Rather than sharing news about the serious problems in the world (poverty, global warming, world hunger, etc.), I was reading about why Walmart was changing its name from \u201cWal-Mart Stores Inc.\u201d to just \u201cWalmart Inc.\u201d. I also noticed that I wasn\u2019t actually reading the articles. I would see the heading and then quickly skim over it. To my surprise, I wasn\u2019t actually learning the news with as much depth as I thought I was.__________________I\u2019ve been noticing myself going to CNN 10 first instead of The New York Times. I really did not understand at first but then I realize that I would rather watch a 10 minute video with Carl Azuz talking about trivial events rather than read a gigantic essay that goes back and forth, using rhetorical devices, counterarguments, analysis, etc. That is the beauty of having a news outlet that promotes videos, the information comes quick and is easily gathered turning a chore of reading into a fast paced interesting session of knowledge.When I learned about the Pulse Nightclub shooting or Roy Moore\u2019s beliefs from traditional news, I felt vulnerable. When seeing the same stories on social media, I don\u2019t feel alone.I sat with my Uncle John, the whole time. Usually I talk to him for a minute about politics and I\u2019m bored out of my mind, but this time I felt something different. This conversation that, at one time, would put me to sleep, was appealing to me now. I knew this was a product of the news diet.I talked with Uncle John about things I didn\u2019t know about. One of which as was his career as a NYPD Police Officer. I connected with his stories now after listening to countless stories about his experiences. One such story caught my attention. It was 1974 and my uncle was working with the 7th Precinct. He was on a burglary call and he found the suspect going out the fire escape. He chased him across the roof, and while running it gave way and he fell off the building. He told me how he was feeling as he felt the roof give out from under his feet and how he felt while falling to the ground. It gave me a more in depth look at how an officer thinks and a different perspective to all the news stories concerning police officers, and a chance to see how they feel in a situation that the media makes them out to be the bad guys.Now, we invite you to read the essays of our seven top winners._________Katie Golden, 14, River Dell Regional High School:Shocking stories change us. Almost six years ago, my grandpa first introduced me to the horrors of the Holocaust and World War II. Drafted at the age of 17, a warrior in the famous Battle of the Bulge where he suffered frost bite in his toes to this day from interminable days without shoes, he was one of the last American soldiers to be stationed in Germany when war concluded. Why did he tell me these gruesome stories I knew hewished to forget?So that I wouldn\u2019t forget. So that it would never happen again.I\u2019m sure my grandfather wanted me to be informed about the world \u2026 and I thought I was. I knew all about the teen world: Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber\u2019s on-and-off romance, what fashion was especially trending in November, and what color dress matches my personality (thank you, People magazine!) I even read the sports section of the Daily News, and usually directed the basketball conversations in my friend group.The deficiencies in my media diet became clear when I was at a Global Connections Club meeting. We were discussing ways to help the Rohingya Refugees, a group of people being targeted for \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d The presenter said they were the \u201cleast wanted group in the world.\u201d She shared news stories about villages being burned and women being raped. I was shocked when the presenter compared the events in Myanmar to the Holocaust. Their situation sure sounded like the people my grandfather once told me about. Hadn\u2019t we all sworn it would never happen again? At this moment, I experienced a new revelation about myself: my eyes were on all the wrong stories. Terror was continuing to dominate our world, even in today\u2019s world.As part of the New York Times Media Challenge, I needed to alter my media intake, and as a result of my club meeting, I decided to look for news about the forgotten people of the world: poor people affected by new tax laws, immigrants facing deportation, women silenced by sexual harassment, and Beijing workers forced out of their homes. Like my grandpa, these reporters were exposing atrocities. They were telling stories of human suffering that they would probably like to forget too.News is the microphone for the forgotten, powerless voices of the world. The media is the shield in the current war our world wages on Human Rights. It speaks for victims of persecution, harassment, deportation, and ethnic cleansing. We can\u2019t limit ourselves to the fun news, but consider the heavy and sometimes gruesome stories the news may cover. The news exists simplistically to help and investigate when anyone is suffering. If we don\u2019t acknowledge the media, these barbarities will happen, again, and again, and again.Helen, 14, River Dell Regional High School:The day had just started and I was sitting in a classroom with two uneven pigtails, one untied lace, half of my best friend necklace, and zero English skills. Already, I felt lost. Having just moved from Germany, I was attempting to participate in a geography game. As my classmates kept putting up correct answers, I didn\u2019t have even one. Unless I could master the new language, I would have no power.I had a flashback to those times six years ago when my teacher asked me to participate in the New York Time Media Challenge. My writing class was talking about the news, and a wave of opinions drowned me. Like my former self, I was lost again. It wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the news, but none of it was about the government. I read about Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s $400 million dollar painting and Europe\u2019s first underwater restaurant, but I didn\u2019t know how the tax bill was going to affect my family or how the Russian investigation tainted our election. I realized I had no idea what was going on in politics.It appeared I had a new language to master. Because I am a busy high school student, I didn\u2019t have much extra time, so I decided I would watch ABC Nightly News and hope for some better results. I began following the Congressional tax bill, Michael Flynn\u2019s guilty plea, and even the Alabama senate race. I began to form so many different opinions. Politics is a topic no family wants to talk about over Thanksgiving dinner, but after this experiment, I had couldn\u2019t wait to share my thoughts. (Surprisingly, I still have relatives talking to me.)There are many people who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening in politics and rather than reading the news they decide to tune it out. Not paying attention to the news isn\u2019t going to make you understand it. The more you immerse yourself in the news, like a language, the more you will understand it. For those out there who believe that following the tax bill is too complicated, they are becoming submissive. They are willing to sit back and accept whatever the government is handing them. If you engage yourself in the media and follow that tax bill, you can write letters, fight for what you believe, and possibly change the direction of laws. Rather than believing the government will do the right thing, you will know, and can hold them accountable.Knowledge is power.Isabella Jimenez, 17, Canterbury School:It\u2019s overwhelming, really. My phone chimes at least 100 times a day, my push notifications filled with news headlines. Facts, opinions, controversies, and current events are constantly hurled at me a million miles an hour, and in the of age of technology, it\u2019s impossible to hide. It all becomes white noise, and it is hard to differentiate what is fact from fiction. Although I routinely read the news and stay up-to-date on what\u2019s going on in the world, I sometimes feel trapped. The news, despite its ability to empower, inspire, and educate many, has also acted as the carrier of anger, burden, and tragedy.My father had just picked up my sister and I from school. The second he turned on the car, he immediately shut off the radio, afraid of what my sister and I might overhear. I wasn\u2019t na\u00efve: my whole school had been in lockdown for the last five hours. I asked my dad what was wrong and he answered with silence, leaving me with an empty feeling in my stomach. On our way home, we stopped by Dunkin\u2019 Donuts/Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, because even at 13 years old, I already was a coffee dependent life-form. I remember walking in, hand and hand with my younger sister, and seeing \u201cBreaking News: Mass Shooting in Newtown Connecticut at local elementary school. \u201d flashing in big red letters on the screen and people on the floor helplessly crying. That whole afternoon, my eyes were glued to the TV as the number began to rise, finally stopping at 26. For the next couple of weeks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to go to school, turn on the TV, or even leave my house to go have breakfast at the local diner as information hungry news reporters infiltrated my town. I was trapped. Everywhere I went, the news followed.Living in Connecticut, the news is my means to escape to the world beyond my small high school and rural hometown. It has brought me face to face with President Trump, climate change, the refugee crisis, and with the victims of other mass shootings. Before experimenting with my news diet, I regularly pressured myself to read the news, reminding myself the importance of a globalized perspective and having this information as \u201csocial currency.\u201d I never took into consideration the toll it would all have on me and never realized the power I had to chose the news I wanted to consume. Participating in the news audit and reading almost every article that popped up into my notification feed and watching the TV, left me tired and frustrated. It made me feel as I did in the following weeks after the Sandy Hook tragedy: trapped. I realized through this project the importance of having a balanced news diet: an ideal combination of all perspectives from all news realms. Butmost of all, I recognized that sometimes, you need to take a step back in order to process, reflect, and breathe.While a teen sits and plays Call of Duty, a North Korean missile sails toward our country. The teen is oblivious as he strives to reach level 3 on the game. This seems like a scene out of Ray Bradbury\u2019s Fahrenheit 451. In thatnovel, citizens watch their full wall TVs, unaware of the warplanes flying above them.Participating in the New York Times Media Challenge, I found that I might be the teen described above and could star in a modern-day version of this book.Step one of this experiment required completing a review of my news diet. After monitoring my main sources of news, I discovered a blatant flaw in my news intake: I only read the headlines. Not only was it just the headlines, but I would only look at the five recommended articles that were displayed as widgets on my phone.If I found an article that was interesting, I might read some of it, or tell someone else about it. But if they asked me a question about a specific detail, I would answer, \u201cI don\u2019t know; I only read the headline.\u201dEmbarrassed by my lack of depth, I challenged myself to dive into entire articles, as opposed to the five ones displayed in a preview. What I got from this experience was a deeper understanding of the content. I took away more information than I would have from just reading the headlines, and I felt more content with myself after this experience. One article that stood out to me was from BuzzFeed. The headline stated that immigration officers continued to arrest illegal immigrants in Florida during Irma, even though they promised not to. The headline made the officers seem like villains, but when I read the whole article I saw both sides of the accusation. Headlines can show one-sided arguments, while reading the article in detail gives you all the information needed to comprehend a topic.Ray Bradbury warned us back in 1953 about what our society was becoming. Captain Beatty is one of the men in charge of keeping books out of peoples\u2019 hands. He describes why the world came to be the way that it is, and we are quickly becoming that society. Beatty says that all people want are, \u201csnap endings.\u201d I think this describes our world today perfectly. People don\u2019t read the whole book; they skip to the last page. They don\u2019t want to take the time to digest what they\u2019ve been given. I realized this after my experiment. I am becoming what Bradbury feared. We all are. It\u2019s time for our society to get out of the express lane.Wynn Maloney, 18, Canterbury School:Unconsciously, as it must be for many other eighteen year olds, my news diet was bland, lazy, and lacking effort. The only time I would ever discover news would be when I was tapping through my snap stories on Snapchat until I reached the discover section of the screen, or scrolling through my Instagram feed when I would come across a Barstool sports post. Occasionally, I would click on an alert from the news app on my iPhone when I was trying to clear my notifications, but I would find myself lost in the article I had just entered.I was absent and blind to what was going on around me in the world, I admit it.Once I realized the isolation I had put myself through that had prevented me from not only becoming an educated citizen of society, but also becoming aware of my surroundings, I decided it was time to change up my news diet. My first step was to turn on my brain and open my eyes in order to become more aware whenever I would come across a piece of news so I didn\u2019t just scroll or tap away to something more interesting to my tastes. Slowly, I noticed myself wanting to read the whole article or post whenever I would come across news, no matter the topic. Then, my second step was to turn on all my notifications in my news app in order to spark more news action in my day to day life. Once the news started to come to me, I would click on every notification and read up on the article. If I found myself lost, I would simply search the background of the topic through other news sources. The chase through my news app to catch the next update on particular stories I was following had become like gambling at a casino, every time I won, or found an amazing or interesting news piece, I was left hungry for more.Ever since I have implemented these two simple steps into my life I have found that I feel like I can contribute to society through participating in intriguing conversations pertaining to up-to-date news. I also feel as if I am able to make personal connections to many day to day issues through the feelings that arise within me once I read many articles that address national and even international issues. I was once an 18-year-old girl who unhealthily and lazily consumed my news, but now I am still that eighteen year old girl who now looks forward to educating myself and consuming every ounce of knowledge I can obtain through news, and for that I am grateful for my news diet project.Olivia McCormack, 14, The Franklin School Of Innovation:This project was an eye-opener, revealing several things including the substantial amount of news I got daily. The latter part of the project inspired me to learn what I could about our current world. I started with a 24 hour period where I recorded all the news taken in. I found the news I got was mainly background noise with no focused time, and with news taken in all at once, so for my news diet mix up, I chose to change this. My planwas to do two things: listen to NPR news podcasts and read CNN articles on my phone. The first week I quickly found that the mornings were not the time for focused news, so I changed my intake time to in the car or ondeck before swim practice.During this experience, I found myself inspired and powerless with many issues. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing about all the sexual harassment allegations and denials. People denying these brave women who are speaking out while knowing they will be pushed around. For a month I listen to coverage of people giving brave testimonies, while men in power were denying and bashing on these women. I was left heartbroken and questioning; what kind of world is this where there is no equality? I don\u2019t mean just in this matter, I see it everywhere, people not making something as simple as a cake for the lone reason the clients were gay, it\u2019s just so unconstitutional. I found that another time I had to stop listening to the news was during coverage of the terrorist attack in Egypt. I just couldn\u2019t bear to hear any more about the horrific things people do to each other.Still, there were times the news I heard excited me, these were times where things like advancements in Muller\u2019s investigation where people were finally paying for their crimes, or when the transgender woman was elected in Virginia an example of how we are coming closer to true equality.This project left me knowing that the news is a very valuable part of life in this country. I also realized that without the news, I would be as innocent as a kindergartner, so I the news is needed in order to be a valuable member of society. Throughout my experience in the new diet mix up, I know that if I ever want to be a valuable member of society I will need to be as informed as I can be. I hope to do so by finding the right news diet and to be able to find places where I can speak up and stand out. One needs a healthy amount of news in life to a point that you are informed but not overwhelmed. Overall, I learned that there are multiple issues that we as a society need to fix and that our news intake should be enough that we are informed, but not to the point that we\u2018re overwhelmed.Jocelyn Savard, 16, Hoggard High School:Each day, I attend a swim practice for about three hours. As soon as it ends, us, being teenagers go straight to our phones. My friends phones are filled with text messages, Snapchats, and missed calls. Of course, mine has all those things too but thrown in are news article headlines. If I have time, I will immediately read the articles.If I don\u2019t have time then, I make sure I get to them relatively soon. Many people in my community are not receiving any sources of news. Physical deliver-to-your-doorstep newspapers are rare in households now because of the internet. But how many of the people not receiving newspapers read them online daily? If the generation above us is not informed, how can we be expected to be? Most teenagers\u2019s only source of news are the gossip articles at the grocery store checkout lines. What sort of condition will our country be in twenty years when it\u2019s run by a generation who only knows about their individual lives performed until that point?Possibly more concerning than the lack of knowledge is the lack of consistency. I read everything from the \u00fcber conservative Washington Times to the extremely liberal New York Times. Each article the story changes; in one I\u2019m reading about the bill President Trump passed that will save the country\u2019s economy by saving x amount of money each year. Then, I go to the next article on my list and I\u2019m reading about the bill President Trump passed that is dooming the country\u2019s economy by losing x amount of money each year. As I\u2019m more left leaning, I tend to believe the more liberal sources which would be great except I have right leaning friends who believe the conservative sources. We are truly a divided country. If I weren\u2019t reading a wide range of news sources would I realize the biases? And despite reading several news sources, some such as USA Today (notoriously neutral), often times I don\u2019t know what the full truth is. Again, how can we be expected to lead a country where we only know a biased history of it, if any? During my audit, possibly the only new thing I realized was how negative all the news intake I was receiving constantly was. I read about poisonous cities, Trump\u2019s mistakes, and falling stocks. I didn\u2019t have articles on people beating cancer, communities coming together or good political choices. It seems that news has always been this way but it can still be linked to the lack of consumption of news from everyone of all ages in our country.Someday, I hope to leave swim practice with articles written by opposite political affiliations having consistent facts and possibly one story that would make anyone smile. I have hope that we can change the way we perceive the news, possibly by changing the news first, so that my generation will be able to grow to our full potential and lead well in coming years._________Shreya Aggarwal, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolAlexis, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolChristopher Burmaster, 15, River Dell Regional High SchoolMelissa Canales, 17, TERRA Environmental Research InstituteOlivia Chislett, 16, the American School in EnglandEllyn Fritz, 17, Canterbury SchoolMlawson19, 17, Exeter High SchoolOlivia, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolSpencer Schultz, 17, Jamesville-DeWitt High SchoolJulia Bialek, 17, Horace Greeley High SchoolAndrew Caslin, 14, River Dell High SchoolLeah Fishman, 14, River Dell High SchoolGabriel, 13, Franklin School of InnovationQuinn Hagerman, 16, Merced High Schooljhamburger, 16Isabella Kahn, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolAlex Main, 17, Landstown High SchoolMary, 16, Merced High SchoolOlivia, 18, Cresskill High SchoolSamantha, 17, Merced High SchoolClara Tomann, 17, Canterbury SchoolMegan Tracy, 17, Canterbury SchoolJosh Wiesenfeld, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolMichelle Yu, 17, Cresskill High SchoolJoanne Yang, 14, Seoul International SchoolSherry Zhu, 14, River Dell Regional High School_________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Plunge as Market Enters \u2018Correction\u2019 Territory", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter watching stocks march higher for nearly nine years, investors are suddenly confronting a new reality: The long, smooth ride is over. And it doesn\u2019t feel good.Major stock indexes suffered a steep drop in late trading on Thursday, the second-straight day that stocks dived shortly before the markets closed. The 3.75 percent decline pushed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down more than 10 percent from its peak in late January. That means the market is technically in correction territory \u2014 a term used to indicate that a downward trend is more severe than simply a few days of bearish trading.\u201cWe\u2019ve been trained that the market does nothing but go up,\u201d Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said of investors. \u201cAnd then suddenly, they\u2019re anxious, they\u2019re sitting nervously on the sidelines, and then they can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dTrying to pinpoint the exact reasons for the last week\u2019s tumble is a fool\u2019s errand. But the most likely culprit appears to be fear that central banks will increase interest rates in an effort to fend off inflation and ensure that fast-growing economies don\u2019t overheat. Those fears were stoked Thursday when the Bank of England warned that it might raise interest rates faster than investors had expected.The past week has offered a vivid illustration of how, in a market dominated by fast-moving, computerized trading strategies, things can go from good to bad in the blink of an eye. Last Thursday, markets were on an epic winning streak. But a bad day last Friday was followed by more selling, which begot more and more selling.In addition to the S.&P. 500\u2019s drop on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.15 percent. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index \u2014 a measure of the choppiness of markets \u2014 surged by 21 percent.The S.&P. 500 crested at 2,872.87 on Jan. 26. Since then, it has fallen almost 10.2 percent, or 292 points, to close at 2,581 Thursday.The sell-off continued in Asia on Friday. Shanghai\u2019s stock market was down about 4 percent midday, while shares in Hong Kong and Tokyo had fallen more than 3 percent. Futures contracts that track stocks in the United States traded erratically, suggesting that the markets on Friday could be in for another day of uncertainty.The market correction does not mean that the bull market in stocks \u2014 which have been roaring since March 2009 \u2014 is over. Markets also experienced a correction in early 2016 before shaking off their jitters and continuing to climb.Indeed, such ups and downs are routine in most market environments. What makes the past week feel different is that an eerie calm had blanketed markets for the previous year.Noah Weisberger, a managing director at AB Bernstein, said that over the past few decades, a 10 percent drop would normally happen every 18 months or so.\u201cIt\u2019s disquieting, it feels terrible, it\u2019s eye-popping when you look at the screen, but it doesn\u2019t yet tell you that something is broken,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a change in behavior relative to 2017, but then again, 2017 is an anomalous period with incredibly low volatility in the market, a very smooth glide-path higher.\u201dVolatility is back \u2014 with a vengeance. Among the reasons for that is the rise of computer-driven trading, which can accelerate the pace of upward or downward price movements. When algorithms pick up \u201csell\u201d signals, they can instantly shift trading strategies and move billions of dollars.\u201cThat\u2019s probably partly why you\u2019re seeing these big swings in the market,\u201d said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush, an investment firm. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s being driven by human hands.\u201dThe long bull market \u2014 stocks were up more than 300 percent at their peak in late January \u2014 has been underpinned, in part, by the extraordinary efforts of the world\u2019s central bankers to re-energize growth in the aftermath of the American financial crisis and the deep global recession that followed.Those efforts helped push interest rates to the lowest levels since World War II, making the safest investments unappetizing and prodding investors toward the stock market.In the face of broad global growth, some think the central banks will raise interest rates faster than previously expected, eroding a crucial source of confidence that the stock market climb would continue.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.Earlier Thursday, the Bank of England said as much, strengthening its forecasts for economic growth and stating that it may have to raise interest rates \u201csomewhat earlier and to a somewhat greater extent than we thought in November.\u201dThat statement sent up interest rates \u2014 or yields \u2014 on British government bonds, known as gilts.Yields on Treasuries followed suit, rising as high as 2.88 percent before retreating slightly. The sight of yields on United States government bonds approaching 3 percent seemed to give the markets pause.Higher government bond yields can make it more expensive for individuals, companies and governments to borrow money. They serve, for example, as the foundation for the interest rates that banks charge on fixed-rate mortgages.Investors are trying to figure out whether the global economy can keep growing at its current pace if rates rise \u2014 a concern that is contributing to the recent swings in stock prices.But there\u2019s reason to be optimistic about the economy\u2019s resilience.Government data released on Thursday showed that claims for unemployment insurance in the United States remained low, near levels not seen since the early 1970s. That suggests unemployment \u2014 which was 4.1 percent in January \u2014 is likely to remain low in the near future.Corporate profits also appear solid.But some of the biggest losers in Thursday\u2019s rout were stocks that had done well this year. Canada Goose, for example, which had been up more than 20 percent this year, sank 16.6 percent. Tesla, which had climbed 10.8 percent this year, fell 8.6 percent.Other hard-hit stocks belonged to companies that could be vulnerable to inflation because rising prices could pinch their profits.On Thursday, the underwear and sock behemoth Hanesbrands saw its shares tumble nearly 11 percent, making it the worst-performing stock in the S.&P. 500. Early in the day, the company offered a weaker than expected forecast for the year because of rising prices for commodities \u2014 although the company\u2019s chief executive noted that Hanesbrands would try to pass on some of those costs to customers.Even the most successful companies could not dodge Thursday\u2019s carnage. Shares of Apple fell 2.75 percent, knocking more than $22 billion off its market value.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Get to Know the New Tax Code While Filling Out This Year's 1040", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "Advertisement\nFilling out tax forms may not be your idea of a great time. But if you want to learn how the new tax law will affect your personal finances, this year\u2019s dreaded Form 1040 is a good place to start.Thanks to lower rates and a doubled standard deduction and other breaks, 2018 taxes will fall for many people. That appears to be true for this hypothetical couple in suburban New York, Samuel and Felicity Taxpayer.Dual IncomeBoth Samuel and Felicity earn income, she as an employee of a design firm and he as a self-employed engineering consultant.5 Personal ExemptionsThey have three dependents: two children and an elderly parent who lives with them. Including the two of them, they have five personal exemptions.25% Bracket Now, 22% in 2018Their total income for 2017 was $183,911, but after deductions, their taxable income is $88,293. In 2018, it probably would be $116,097, minus a big deduction for consulting income and other breaks that reduce it to $98,206.Invested in Stocks, BondsThey have a small portfolio that generated less than $1,500 in interest and dividends so they don\u2019t have to file Schedule B. But they sold some stock and used Schedule D. These \u201cschedules\u201d are supplements to the 1040.College TuitionTheir son goes to college, qualifying them for a tax credit.Mortgage and Local TaxesThey pay a mortgage because they own a house and their local and state taxes are high. That gives them big deductions in 2017. Under rules for 2018 returns, those deductions will be curtailed.While many people are eligible for the EZ filing method, the process can be more arduous for those with more complicated finances. Here is a guide to the current 1040 \u2014 with clues about the changes next year \u2014 using the Taxpayer family as an example.First, gather your records and the official documents related to your income and deductions, because Form 1040 asks a taxpayer to list income. Then it factors in adjustments, deductions and personal exemptions to determine how much of the income is taxable.The Internal Revenue Service encourages taxpayers to file electronically, but people who prepare their own returns may mail in paper forms. Either way, the preparation is the same.Produced by Keith CollinsAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described the probable effect of the new tax law on a hypothetical couple\u2019s 2018 tax bill. The TurboTax \u201cWhat-If Worksheet\u201d that generated the projection for their 2018 taxes failed to indicate that the couple would probably be entitled to claim a sizable deduction for income earned from consulting. As a result of that deduction, the amount they would likely owe on taxes would decline by $43, not rise by $3,896.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steven Cohen\u2019s Investment Firm Accused of Hostility to Women", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA female executive at the investment firm run by Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire investor, said in a lawsuit that the company was a testosterone-fueled \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d in which men commented on women\u2019s bodies, belittled their abilities and paid them less than their male peers.The lawsuit, filed in federal court Monday by a current employee of Mr. Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management, describes a toxic working environment for women. Those with years of experience were often referred to as \u201cgirls\u201d or \u201csweethearts.\u201d Some were excluded from meetings that were deemed for men only, the lawsuit said.In a statement on Monday, Point72 said, \u201cThe firm emphatically denies these allegations and will defend itself in a more appropriate venue than the media.\u201dIt added: \u201cWe stand by our record of hiring and developing women. In an industry where women are historically underrepresented, the hundreds of women at Point72 are vital members of every part of our organization.\u201dMr. Cohen\u2019s former firm, SAC Capital Advisors, shut down in early 2014 after it pleaded guilty in an insider trading investigation.Mr. Cohen wasn\u2019t charged by the authorities. But he agreed to a two-year ban from the securities industry for failing to properly supervise some of his staff. He created Point72, which currently has more than 1,000 employees, to manage his personal fortune.The ban from the securities industry expired at the end of last year. Mr. Cohen, 61, is preparing to relaunch Point72 as a hedge fund that will manage money for outside investors.While traditional Wall Street firms have overhauled their cultures in recent years and elevated women to positions of authority, the $3 trillion hedge fund industry has been far slower in breaking away from its male-dominated roots.At Point72, women make up fewer than 3 percent of the managing directors, according to the discrimination lawsuit, which was brought on behalf of Lauren Bonner, an associate director. Of the firm\u2019s 125 portfolio managers \u2014 top traders who decide which stocks to buy and sell \u2014 one is a woman. There are no women on the firm\u2019s hiring or executive committee.For several weeks last year, a whiteboard in the office of a top executive had the word \u201cpussy\u201d written on it, leaving the firm\u2019s few senior women feeling uneasy, according to the lawsuit. A person who worked at the firm confirmed the incident.Many of the allegations in the complaint could not be independently verified. But four people who worked at the firm, and who declined to be identified for fear of retribution, said Point72 could be a difficult work environment for women. They said, for example, that male colleagues regularly made comments on women\u2019s physical appearances.Ms. Bonner, who did not comment for this article, is represented by lawyers with Wigdor L.L.P., which has represented women in a number of notable sexual harassment lawsuits, including several against Fox News and 21st Century Fox. Two years ago, the firm represented a male employee in a sexual harassment complaint against Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund.\u201cThis lawsuit proves that #MeToo is just getting started, and Wall Street will not be spared,\u201d one of Ms. Bonner\u2019s lawyers, Jeanne M. Christensen, said.Such lawsuits are rare on Wall Street because, women say, there is little to gain by challenging employers and they risk tarnishing their reputations and upending their careers.It is even more uncommon for a current employee of a firm to file such a complaint.Ms. Bonner is part of a recruitment analytics team at Point72 and supervises 14 people. She previously worked at Bridgewater.Her suit contends that she was passed over for several promotions, with jobs going to less experienced men who joined Point72 after she began working there in July 2016. This year, she is slated to earn a base salary of $300,000 with a potential bonus of $225,000. The lawsuit alleges that similarly situated men earn at least twice as much.The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and an injunction against Point72\u2019s violating state anti-discrimination laws.As Point72 prepares to start trading as a hedge fund, the firm has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion from outside investors, although some institutional investors have balked at its high fees, people familiar with the matter previously told The New York Times.Kevin O\u2019Connor, a former United States attorney for Connecticut, was hired as general counsel. Douglas Haynes, once a top executive at the consulting firm McKinsey, was brought in as Point72\u2019s president.Both men are responsible for overseeing the firm\u2019s cultural cleanup \u2014 and both figure in Ms. Bonner\u2019s lawsuit.Mr. Haynes is named as a defendant. The lawsuit said he had once ridiculed a female executive as a \u201cdumb blond.\u201d The whiteboard mentioned in the suit was in Mr. Haynes\u2019s office.And the suit quoted Mr. O\u2019Connor as having said to colleagues that \u201cthe reality is that this is just a really tough place for women, and that\u2019s not going to change.\u201dMr. Haynes and Mr. O\u2019Connor didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.Ms. Bonner also said that a supervisor belittled her and that she had complained to the head of human resources. Nothing happened: The supervisor remained on a powerful internal committee that decides which employees get promotions, the suit said.The lawsuit also accused Mark Herr, the firm\u2019s head of corporate communications, of making degrading comments about women. He didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.In one example of the firm\u2019s allegedly inhospitable culture, the lawsuit described a women\u2019s leadership forum that Mr. Cohen hosted in October 2016 at his 35,000-square-foot mansion in Greenwich, Conn. One of the main speakers was a psychiatrist and Fox News contributor who, according to the lawsuit, described Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, as \u201can accomplished man\u2019s wife.\u201dA person who attended the event confirmed that account.The lawsuit said Ms. Bonner intended to file discrimination complaints against Point72 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and New York City\u2019s Commission on Human Rights.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of Point72 Asset Management\u2019s offices in Connecticut. It is Stamford, not Greenwich.Advertisement"}

He ate, drank, boarded his flight and got home. And that\u2019s when the trouble started.\u201cI wanted to let people know to stop eating at Starbucks,\u201d he told me.This is the era of internet-assisted consumer revenge, and as scorned customers in industries from dentistry to dog-walking have used digital platforms to broadcast their displeasure, the balance of power has tipped considerably in the buyer\u2019s favor.This is especially true of IWasPoisoned, which has collected about 89,000 reports since it opened in 2009. Consumers use the site to decide which restaurants to avoid, and public health departments and food industry groups routinely monitor its submissions, hoping to identify outbreaks before they spread. The site has even begun to tilt stocks, as traders on Wall Street see the value of knowing which national restaurant chain might soon have a food-safety crisis on its hands.Not everyone is happy about the added transparency. Restaurant executives have criticized IWasPoisoned for allowing anonymous and unverified submissions, which they say leads to false reports and irresponsible fear-mongering. Some public health officials have objected on the grounds that food poisoning victims can\u2019t be trusted to correctly identify what made them sick.\u201cIt\u2019s not helping food safety,\u201d said Martin Wiedmann, a professor of food safety at Cornell University. \u201cIf you want to trace food-borne illness, it needs to be done by public health departments, and it needs to include food history.\u201dRating your Uber driver or Airbnb host is one thing. But when it comes to matters of public health, is there such a thing as giving too much power to the people?Patrick Quade, IWasPoisoned\u2019s founder, told me that he started the site after, he said, he got food poisoning from a B.L.T. wrap he bought at a Manhattan deli. At the time, Mr. Quade, now 46, was working as an interest rates trader at Morgan Stanley. He figured that other people might want a place to report food-borne illnesses quickly and anonymously, without the ordeal of filing a complaint with the local health department.\u201cI could tell that Chipotle was a problem brand,\u201d Mr. Quade said. \u201cThe rate of reporting was averaging nine or 10 times higher than other brands. It was a really powerful leading indicator.\u201d\u201cReports made to these third-party reporting sites have no clinical validation, are made anonymously, and are unreliable,\u201d Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe constantly monitor all available sources of information \u2014 including social media platforms and third-party reporting websites \u2014 to ensure we are aware of any allegation of illness, and we have robust procedures in place to look into any claims that are made.\u201dAfter the 2015 Chipotle incident drew attention to the site, Mr. Quade realized that IWasPoisoned could become a real business. He quit his job at Morgan Stanley, and began to work on the site full time. He now has three employees, a handful of remote contractors and a makeshift office at a co-working space in Manhattan. The company makes less than $20,000 per month in revenue, but Mr. Quade expects that to grow. Soon, he plans to release a mobile app, which will alert a user when walking near a restaurant with an active food poisoning complaint.As it has matured, IWasPoisoned has developed an unusual business model that reflects Mr. Quade\u2019s Wall Street roots. Power users \u2014 like, say, a hedge fund that can profit from knowing about an E. coli outbreak at a major restaurant chain ahead of the rest of the market \u2014 pay up to $5,000 a month for real-time alerts whenever a new report is posted to the site. (Free alerts are also available, but they come only once a day.) Only a handful of clients pay for the premium service, but more have expressed interest in signing up, Mr. Quade said.\u201cThe investment community is more attuned to food safety than ever before,\u201d he said.Health officials and restaurant executives are also using the site to spot early signs of trouble. According to Mr. Quade, public health agencies in 46 states and representatives from more than half of the top 50 restaurant chains in America subscribe to the site\u2019s daily email alerts. More than 25,000 consumers subscribe to the emails as well.On average, the site now receives 150 complaints a day, and every new report is manually reviewed by a staff member before posting to make sure it is at least plausible. The site weeds out obvious hoaxes and joke submissions, and uses technology like IP tracking to help stop users from submitting multiple reviews of the same restaurant.\u201cWith every report, our promise is to make sure it\u2019s a real person who believes they have food poisoning,\u201d Mr. Quade said.One of those words \u2014 \u201cbelieves\u201d \u2014 is perhaps the food industry\u2019s biggest problem with IWasPoisoned. Food safety experts told me that food poisoning victims are prone to what epidemiologists call \u201crecall bias.\u201d A person who gets a violent stomach bug will naturally attribute it to the last thing he or she ate, especially if it came from a restaurant with a history of food-safety issues. But often, given the slow-developing nature of many food-borne illnesses, the culprit is something eaten days earlier, or something entirely unrelated.\u201cA web page like this doesn\u2019t ask what disease you got, or the timing of it,\u201d Professor Wiedmann of Cornell said. \u201cAll of that gets lost.\u201dMr. Quade conceded that point, saying that \u201cwe don\u2019t go out and conduct medical tests\u201d on submissions, and that users\u2019 accounts might not always be reliable. The site allows restaurants to appeal a report, he said, if it has evidence that a customer is lying or mistaken, and it pulls reports off its website after 30 days to limit their reputational damage.But he said that the site\u2019s reports were still valuable as data points to consider in context. And, he added, users want a place to complain.\u201cThey\u2019ll do it, whether we exist or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not there, they\u2019ll just go to Twitter or Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Times Answers Your Questions About the Market Turmoil", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs now the time to invest? What should I do with my 401(k)? I\u2019m about to retire \u2014 what does this mean for me?Below, we answered several of the most common questions from our readers. The questions have been edited and condensed for clarity. If you\u2019d like us to address any others, please write to us using the form at the bottom of the piece.Not even the billionaire investor Warren Buffett could tell us with any sort of precision whether this was the right time to buy. But market dips can be a good time to start investing, as long as you are allocating your money in a prudent way that will help you achieve your long-term goals.To start, it helps to define those goals.Are you investing money that you want to grow to pay for your child\u2019s college \u2014 five years from now? Eighteen years from now? Or for your retirement?The time frame makes a difference because many financial planners don\u2019t recommend investing money in stocks if you will need that money imminently, or generally within five years.If you aren\u2019t comfortable plunking all of your money in the stock market at once, consider investing on a consistent schedule over time. Investing at regular intervals allows you to automatically take advantage of dips in the market.There are no right answers here \u2014 but there is probably a strategy that is right for you and your unique circumstances. Generally speaking, how you choose to allocate your investments among stock, bonds and cash should be in keeping with your overall goals, age, time horizon and stomach for risk. A diversified portfolio of inexpensive stock and bond funds, both domestic and international, is typically a good place to start.Precisely how you divvy it all up is a highly personal decision. Consider this thought exercise when thinking about how much you want to invest in stocks.If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d you may be invested too aggressively.On the other hand, if you expect to live another quarter-century in retirement, you want your money to grow enough to at least keep pace with inflation.If you want to see how your current allocation compares with what a professional might choose, you can also look under the hood of a target-date fund \u2014 a mutual fund whose mix of stock and bond investments gets more conservative as it approaches a target retirement date.The stock market\u2019s gyrations are not likely to have a tangible effect on the housing market \u2014 at least not right now, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics.If the market\u2019s overall slump is limited to the roughly 10 percent decline from its peak, Mr. Zandi doesn\u2019t expect any changes. Stock prices are just back to where they were at the start of 2018. But a more significant stock market drop could change the sentiment toward the housing market. As people\u2019s savings and investments decline, they often become less willing to buy a home.\u201cIf stock prices keep dropping, say 20 percent, and stay down, then it will sap the energy from the housing market, particularly at the higher end of the market,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. He added that shoppers for higher-end homes are already trying to digest the changes that came with the new tax legislation, which, for example, limits the deduction on mortgage interest. A meaningful market dive could also dampen enthusiasm within the vacation home market.\u201cSo no big deal so far,\u201d he added, \u201cbut the script is still being written.\u201dTrying to time the market is a bad idea because you have to get two things right.First, you need to know the right time to sell your stock investments, ideally when they\u2019re flying high. Then, you need to divine the best time to reinvest your money.Look at what happened on Monday. If investors sold their stock funds when the market was dropping, that may have felt like the right thing to do in the moment. But if those investors regretted their decision and tried to reinvest on Tuesday \u2014 when stocks started to stage a recovery \u2014 they would have locked in their losses.It\u2019s hard to make any sort of prediction for the bond market over all. But investors tend to get nervous when interest rates tick higher and bond prices usually fall in response. Existing bonds become less valuable because investors can buy a new one with a higher coupon.To get a sense of how your own bond funds may react to rising rates, take a look at their duration. The duration generally measures how long it will take to receive all of your money back, on average, from interest and your original investment.For this reason, some investors tend to favor shorter-duration bond investments when rates are on the rise. Such investments are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.Regardless of where rates are headed, bonds serve as an important ballast to stocks in investors\u2019 portfolios. And high-quality bonds \u2014 including those issued by federal, state or local governments, government agencies or healthy companies \u2014 tend to perform better than lower-quality bonds during times of stock market turmoil.\u201cHigher-quality bonds have tended to hold up better in equity market sell-offs,\u201d said Fran Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard\u2019s Investment Strategy Group. \u201cThis was true again yesterday, with high-quality outperforming low-quality bonds.\u201d On Monday, he said, those bond prices rose 0.20 percent to 0.60 percent.\u201cA stay-the-course message on bonds,\u201d Mr. Kinniry added, \u201cis extremely prudent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Wants to Give Half a Billion People Free Health Care", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 India announced on Thursday a sweeping plan to give half a billion poor Indians free access to health care, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to address rising demands for greater economic and social protections before national elections next year.The move is sure to be popular in a country where most people have no health insurance and the per capita income is a few dollars a day. Although India\u2019s overall economy is growing, Mr. Modi and his governing Bharatiya Janata Party have been trying to find ways to court the population left behind.The health care plan, part of the government\u2019s 2018-19 budget presented on Thursday, would offer 100 million families up to 500,000 rupees, or about $7,860, of coverage each year. That sum, while small by Western standards, would be enough to cover the equivalent of five heart surgeries in India. Officials did not outline eligibility requirements, and many details of the program have yet to be finalized.India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said in a speech to Parliament that the plan would cover more people than any other government-funded health care program in the world. In addition to the direct health benefits, he said, the program would create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\u201cThis is huge. It\u2019s the biggest step the government has taken in 20 years in health care,\u201d said Dr. Ajay Bakshi, the former chief executive of Manipal Hospitals, a chain of 16 private hospitals based in the southern city of Bangalore.The average Indian\u2019s life expectancy is about 68 years, significantly lower than other large developing countries like China or Brazil. In large part, that\u2019s because of poor health care.\u201cThe biggest disease burden sits on the bottom 500 million people. They don\u2019t have access to diagnosis. If they get diagnosed, they don\u2019t have a way to get treatment,\u201d Dr. Bakshi said.\u201cWhat are the poor people dying from? Diarrhea, pneumonia, under-nutrition, malaria, tuberculosis,\u201d said Rama Baru, a professor at the Center of Social Medicine and Community Health at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. \u201cPrevention and curative services need to go together.\u201dThe government offered no details on how it would pay for the health care program. The Finance Ministry said it had allocated $314 million for the proposal, but the program could easily cost billions of dollars per year.A prior plan announced by the Modi government in 2016 to provide 100,000 rupees of health coverage per family was never funded. But Dr. Bakshi said funding was more likely this time because the economy is stronger \u2014 and, more important, elections are looming.\u201cThey will make sure this will be implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cIndian voters have favored governments that have given them wide-scale health coverage.\u201dAs part of the budget proposal, Mr. Jaitley said the government would levy a surtax that would raise about $1.7 billion a year specifically for health care programs.The government is also proposing a new tax on capital gains to capture some of the wealth being created as India\u2019s stock market rises to new highs.Investors in Indian medical stocks clearly expected a windfall from the insurance program: Shares rose in Thursday\u2019s trading.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The heads of Citi and Goldman took home healthy pay raises last year.\u2022 Qualcomm didn\u2019t categorically say no to Broadcom\u2019s latest offer.\u2022 What financial regulation could look like post-Brexit.\u2022 Look who bet big on a pick-up in volatility...Peter Thiel.\u2022 R.I.P., BTFD?\u2022 Kraft Heinz is due for a big deal.\u2022 U.S. Bancorp\u2019s big fine.The good times that returned to Wall Street after President Donald Trump got elected are now flowing into the pockets of the big banks\u2019 C.E.Os:Are those paydays justified?Let\u2019s take Mr. Corbat.Citigroup\u2019s stock rose 25 percent in 2017, a lot more than the 16 percent posted by the KBW Bank Index. Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations.Citi\u2019s underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years.The message from Citi\u2019s board seems to be that, since the bank\u2019s performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbat\u2019s pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street.But on other yardsticks, the awards can seem highCiti may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bank\u2019s return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of America\u2019s was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan.And the makeup of the compensation mattersC.E.O.s\u2019 compensation is made up of different types of pay:\u2022 Cash salaries and cash bonuses\u2022 Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future.The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is.Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 The decision starts a maximum 75-day clock for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to decide whether to approve or oppose the deal, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Chinese investors have faced heightened scrutiny from Cfius. Since president Trump took office, a half a dozen Chinese deals have fallen apart because of concerns raised by CFIUS, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Raising the breakup fee for antitrust reasons beyond $8 billion. That amount, which represents an already high 6.6 percent of the total deal price, still isn\u2019t high enough for Qualcomm. \u201cA breakup fee in the range proposed by Broadcom does not come close to compensating for those risks,\u201d Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm\u2019s chairman, writes in a letter to Broadcom\u2019s chief, Hock Tan.\u2022 Make unspecified other commitments meant to assuage antitrust regulators.\u2022 Clarify what Broadcom\u2019s intentions are for Qualcomm\u2019s big licensing business.More from Mr. Jacobs\u2019s letter:Our board is open to further discussions with Broadcom to see if a proposal that appropriately reflects the true value of Qualcomm shares, and ensures an appropriate level of deal certainty, can be obtained.If the two sides can\u2019t reach an agreement, then matters may come down to a vote on Qualcomm\u2019s board on March 6. Remember that Broadcom is seeking six of 11 board seats, down from its initial target of unseating all directors.\u2014 Michael de la MercedBritain\u2019s government is often criticized for not clearly communicating the type of deal it wants to strike with the European Union as it prepares to leave the bloc.The dilemma Britain faces.Post-Brexit, Britain\u2019s banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them to operate in any E.U. country with few restrictions. Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.Hence the new plan.The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems. It would allow both sides leeway to strike their own rules once they\u2019ve agreed on their main objectives. And it suggests that a monitoring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set up.Will the E.U. agree to the plan?The bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation. Certain politicians in the E.U. may argue Britain is trying to retain the privileges of the single market while discarding the duties that come with it. Still, some of Europe\u2019s leaders, banks and businesses may support the plan, in the belief that it will minimize disruption and allow the City of London to continue to play a big role in financing the strong economic expansion taking place in Europe.\u2014Peter EavisPeter Thiel.Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Thiel Macro, which invests Mr. Thiel\u2019s fortune, held put options on 1.9 million shares of ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures as of Dec. 31. The investment is designed to pay off if the VIX rises.It\u2019s unclear whether the fund had maintained those positions through last week. But if it had, he would have reaped a big windfall.Investors piled into bets that volatility would continue to decline last year. And those wagers paid off as the VIX spent 2017 trading at historically low levels. But volatility has picked up this year. After trading below 10 to start the year, the VIX spiked to above 37 during the selloff last week. It finished Friday at 19.The law firm Royds Withy King says it has seen a flurry of cases recently involving disputes over cryptocurrency holdings, one of which was recently valued at $1.4 million.The firm said it is currently working on three separate high-value divorce cases where spouses are seeking the disclosure and a potential share of cryptocurrency assets.Off the top of our heads, we\u2019d think that issues would include a) the reporting, or lack thereof, of holdings and b) the value of any digital money portfolios.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Julie Edde, Bei Hu and Suzanne Woolley of Bloomberg:\u201cThere\u2019s sort of, \u2018Everybody should buy a dip,\u2019 which has become folklore in the markets now.

{"Headline": "How Banks Could Control Gun Sales if Washington Won\u2019t", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookFor the past year, chief executives have often talked about the new sense of moral responsibility that corporations have to help their communities and confront social challenges even when Washington won\u2019t.Here\u2019s an idea.What if the finance industry \u2014 credit card companies like Visa, Mastercard and American Express; credit card processors like First Data; and banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo \u2014 were to effectively set new rules for the sales of guns in America?Collectively, they have more leverage over the gun industry than any lawmaker. And it wouldn\u2019t be hard for them to take a stand.PayPal, Square, Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms.\u201cWe do not believe permitting the sale of firearms on our platform is consistent with our values or in the best interests of our customers,\u201d a spokesman for Square told me.The big financial firms don\u2019t even have to go that far.If Mastercard were to do the same, assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card system.To be clear: Those three banks won\u2019t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle \u2014 the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex.Visa spokesmen did not reply to several emails seeking comment. A spokesman for Mastercard sent a boilerplate statement that expressed \u201cdisgust with recent events, including last week in Florida.\u201d\u201cOur payments network is governed by standards that have been established over time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cChief among these is that we do not and will not permit merchants to engage in unlawful activity on our network.\u201d He said the company would continue to talk to customers and lawmakers about its policies.If Visa and Mastercard are unwilling to act on this issue, the credit card processors and banks that issue credit cards could try. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which issues credit cards and owns a payment processor, has talked about how he and his bank have \u201ca moral obligation but also a deeply vested interest\u201d in helping \u201csolve pressing societal challenges.\u201d This is your chance, Mr. Dimon.And here\u2019s a variation on the same theme: What if the payment processing industry\u2019s biggest customers \u2014 companies like McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Apple, Amazon, AT&T, CVS and others that regularly talk about \u201csocial responsibility\u201d \u2014 collectively pressured the industry to do it? There\u2019s a chance that some of the payment processors would stop handling gun sales. Perhaps their voices would help push one of the banks to step out and lead?Is all of this a pipe dream? Maybe, but I spent the last 72 hours calling and emailing a handful of chief executives to discuss these ideas. None wanted to speak on the record, because it\u2019s a hot-button topic. But all applauded the idea and some said they had already been thinking about it. A few, I discovered later, called their peers to begin a conversation.At least two executives said a reason that they haven\u2019t been more outspoken yet is that they fear reprisals from the N.R.A. and other gun supporters \u2014 not just in the form of boycotts that could affect their bottom line, but also actions that could imperil the safety of their employees.Perhaps the biggest stumbling block to an approach like this are companies like Walmart, which has huge sway over the financial industry. While Walmart stopped selling assault rifles in 2015, it might look askance at any policy by a bank issuer or credit card company to limit the kinds of products it sells.Critics of using the finance industry to influence gun sales might argue that such a move would be discriminatory against gun retailers. But gun sellers are not a protected class, like age, race, gender, religion or even political affiliation. This would be a strictly commercial decision.Another critique is that it is impossible to prevent every shooting, no matter how guns are restricted. And the banks\u2019 actions would affect millions of their own law-abiding customers, effectively dictating what they can and cannot buy.The most troubling aspect of having the finance industry try to restrict gun sales is that it would push the most dangerous guns into an untraceable world where sales would depend on cash. That\u2019s true. All things considered, though, it would make it considerably harder to even find such guns.There are other sectors of the finance industry that could step up. For example, Lloyd\u2019s of London is the favored insurance company for gun shows. It could pull out.None of this is a panacea. But it\u2019s a start. It takes leadership and courage \u2014 exactly what these executives say they have. If they don\u2019t want to back up their words with actions, the next time there\u2019s a school shooting that prompts a conversation about gun companies, it should also include the financial complex that supports them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Are States Doing About Gun Violence After the Florida Shooting?", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is not just in Florida where the mass shooting at a high school is prompting lawmakers to take up gun control legislation. The same thing is happening across the country, from Washington to Vermont.What was one of the deadliest school shootings in modern American history prompted Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island to sign an executive order on Monday to establish a policy to take guns away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others.\u201cIf the federal government won\u2019t act, states need to do more to prevent the gun violence that has become far too common,\u201d Ms. Raimondo, a Democrat, said in signing the measure.Still, not all states are moving to toughen gun laws. Some states are considering action to loosen regulations. Here is a roundup of what states are considering doing or have already done.Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, proposed raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles to 21 and called for a raft of measures he said could keep mentally ill or violent people from purchasing weapons and keep schools safer. Republicans in the House and Senate, who appear supportive of Mr. Scott\u2019s proposals, also called for a three-day waiting period on the purchase of those weapons, which already exists for those who wish to buy handguns.Mr. Scott proposed $450 million in new funding for school security and $50 million in mental health funding and called for a law enforcement officer to be posted in every public school.\u201cThe reality of how close we came to a devastating tragedy underscores the threat of violence that faces the entire country,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, I\u2019ve been asking myself, \u2018Are we doing everything we can to protect our kids?\u2019\u201dNow, he said, \u201cEverything should be on the table at this point.\u201dThe day after the shooting, Oregon\u2019s House passed a bill making it illegal for people convicted of domestic violence or those with restraining orders against them to possess weapons, even if they are not married to, do not live with, or do not have children with their victims.Lawmakers in Washington are also working on a ban on bump stocks, which accelerate the rate of fire on semiautomatic firearms. The legislation passed the Senate in January and the House on Friday, with a final Senate vote remaining.Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, has appointed a committee to propose concrete actions and urged it to make its recommendations quickly.Meanwhile, several bills, some restricting access to guns and some expanding it, are pending in the Statehouse.Mr. Madigan said lawmakers this week would also introduce legislation to raise the minimum age to purchase military-style assault rifles to 21.In the House, a committee passed a bill last week allowing people to carry weapons at churches that share property with schools, as long as they are working for or attending the church, and the church does not prohibit weapons. This month, before the shooting, the measure was passed by the full Senate.The House has passed a measure that the N.R.A. calls \u201cself-defense\u201d legislation. It would let people carry guns on the grounds of schools or churches. The Senate is considering a bill to repeal the permitting process to allow law-abiding citizens to carry a weapon without having to get a concealed-carry permit.After the shooting, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, sent a letter to Mike Morath, the Texas Education Agency commissioner, ordering safety information to be distributed to all schools, and asking him to take steps to ensure that all schools have completed safety audits and that all have a multihazard emergency plan in place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "PepsiCo Dips Its Toes Into the Sparkling Water Market", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the 1980s, the big brands battled for dominance in the cola wars.Now, a new fight is emerging: The fizzy water wars.On Thursday PepsiCo is introducing Bubly, a new brand of sparkling water that comes in eight flavors, including apple, strawberry and mango, in brightly colored cans with lowercase lettering and greetings on the pull tabs. (\u201cHey u!\u201d \u201cyo!\u201d)Bubly marks the most direct attack yet on LaCroix, a brand of flavored sparkling waters that has, in recent years, seen sales soar as it developed a near cultlike devotion among millennials.For PepsiCo, Bubly is a big bet. The beverage and snacks giant will put its formidable marketing and distribution machine behind the rollout. Bubly will land on shelves this month, and two ads will appear during the Oscars broadcast on March 4.PepsiCo executives say Bubly, with no artificial flavors, sweeteners or calories, fits into its broader corporate initiative to offer consumers healthier snack and beverage products.But it is also an acknowledgment that sales of carbonated soda are falling as consumers increasingly shun sugary drinks in favor of healthier options, including water. In 2016, bottled water sales by volume surpassed carbonated soda for the first time, according to Beverage Marketing Corporation\u2019s DrinkTell database. And volume sales for carbonated soft drinks declined for the 13th consecutive year in 2017.While Europeans have consumed sparkling water for years, the product has only recently started to catch on in the United States. Sales of domestic sparkling bottled water \u2014 not including imports like San Pellegrino \u2014 doubled between 2015 and 2017 to $8.5 billion, according to the DrinkTell database.One of the biggest beneficiaries of the surge in interest in fizzy water has been LaCroix. With its vivid, neon-colored cans and unique flavors like apricot, peach pear and pamplemousse (French for grapefruit), LaCroix has generated an avid following on Instagram and Twitter. Some websites have created cocktails, mixing various flavors of LaCroix with alcohol.LaCroix, which has been around for about 35 years, was acquired in bankruptcy proceedings in the mid-1990s by National Beverage, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. It has muddled along for years, and in regulatory filings by National Beverage, LaCroix was often mentioned far behind two other brands, Shasta and Faygo.But in recent years, sales of LaCroix have ballooned. National Beverage stock has more than doubled in the past two years.\u201cLaCroix is a fascinating story because it has been around for so long,\u201d said Gary Hemphill, the managing director of research at Beverage Marketing. \u201cIt just happened to be the right product for the right time.\u201dLaCroix\u2019s growth surge hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed on Wall Street, where some analysts predicted that National Beverage could be an acquisition target for PepsiCo, Coca-Cola or another manufacturer looking to enter the market quickly with a well-established brand. But other analysts say Nick Caporella, the 82-year-old founder and chief executive of National Beverage, who once ran a telecom and cable company and who owns 74 percent of the company\u2019s stock, has not signaled any interest in selling.National Beverage did not return a call seeking comment.Even though consumers continue to turn away from sugary, syrupy sodas, the stocks of PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are trading near historic highs, in part because they have been able to maintain or even increase pricing on soda. For PepsiCo, whose popular brands include Gatorade, Tropicana, Doritos, Lay\u2019s and Aquafina, North American beverages made up a significant amount of the company\u2019s $63 billion in revenues in 2016.Recently, PepsiCo has shown a preference toward developing new products and brands in-house. Last year, the company debuted Lifewtr, a purified water with electrolytes that was a response to the success Coca-Cola has had with its Smartwater brand.Coca-Cola acquired Smartwater as part of its acquisition of Glaceau, the maker of Vitaminwater, in 2007 for $4.1 billion. Coca-Cola also owns Dasani water, and has introduced some flavors of sparkling water.\u201cWe\u2019re confident in our ability to innovate from within,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, the vice president of the water portfolio for PepsiCo North America Beverages, who oversaw the launch of Lifewtr and, now, Bubly.While many analysts see continued strong growth for flavored sparkling water, they also note the segment will most likely get more crowded as other beverage makers and store labels fill the space.\u201cThere is going to be a lot of competition in the space from private label,\u201d said Duane Stanford, the executive editor of Beverage Digest. \u201cEvery store brand will have its version of LaCroix.\u201dThe risk is that flavored fizzy waters could eventually face the same fate as their flat bottled siblings. There, a market that became saturated with competitors selling the same thing \u2014 water \u2014 resulted in sharply lower prices and profit margins.But with Bubly, PepsiCo executives are betting consumers won\u2019t tire of flavored sparkling water anytime soon.\u201cThe category really has the wind at its back right now,\u201d Mr. Hemphill of Beverage Marketing said. \u201cThere is room for at least two key players, maybe three. The fact that LaCroix has been so successful doesn\u2019t mean there can\u2019t be room for another brand.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Context Matters. The Stock Market Drop Is Less Scary Than It Seems. ", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt can be easy to be misled by big point swings after a long period of quiet in global markets.If measured by news headlines, you might assume these are dire times in the financial markets.There is an important idea to keep in mind at a time like this: Take the long view.This market decline so far has returned the market roughly to its level in mid-December, less than two months ago. The 7.8 percent drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 over the last six trading days is similar in scale and speed to drops in January 2016 and August 2015, neither of which left lasting scars, and is short of the 10 percent drop that would qualify as a market correction.But some common cognitive errors are making this sell-off seem more dramatic than it is. And the reasons behind it may be more benign than it seems at first glance.Media coverage frequently emphasizes moves in the Dow Jones industrial average. But you probably developed your intuition for how to interpret those numbers at a time when the index was much lower.The Dow fell by 1,175 points Monday, which represents a quite large 4.6 percent decline. But while it was the biggest single-day point decline, there were steeper percentage declines on several occasions during the global financial crisis and its aftermath, not to mention the 508- point drop in the Dow in 1987 that represented a 22.6 percent market crash.At a minimum, update your mental calculus of what constitutes a \u201cbig\u201d market swing. Even better, focus on percent changes rather than point swings in an arbitrarily constructed index.The S.&P. 500 did not decline by more than 2 percent on a single trading day in all of 2017, which helps explain why Friday\u2019s 2.1 percent drop seemed so startling. (The percentage drop on Monday was a much rarer event, one that last occurred in 2011.)But 2017 was weird. There were five such days in 2016, six in 2015 and four in 2014. In 2011, there were 21 trading days in which the S.&P. fell by more than 2 percent, nearly two per month. A bit of overreaction is as natural as people in normally dry Los Angeles having trouble driving in the rain.There\u2019s no doubt that the 7.8 percent drop since Jan. 26 is substantial; it represents nearly $2 trillion of paper wealth. But you find some better news underneath that unpleasant fact when you look at what has happened in the bond market while stocks have been falling.Frequently when investors become more pessimistic about the economy, stocks fall and the yield on bonds falls as well. That pattern happens because a weaker economy implies not just lower corporate profits (hence the falling stock indexes) but lower inflation and continued low interest rates from the Federal Reserve (which implies bonds are more valuable and their yield should fall).But that hasn\u2019t been the pattern in this downturn. During the stock market swoon on Friday, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds rose sharply. Bond market measures of future inflation rose. Even after that trend reversed during the Monday sell-off, interest rates are still higher after this drop in markets (2.7 percent at Monday\u2019s close) than they were before (2.66 percent on Jan. 26).Instead of reflecting economic pessimism, this stock market sell-off seems rooted in a form of optimism \u2014 that employers will have to pay higher wages, cutting into profits, and that higher inflation will cause the Fed to raise rates faster than had been assumed. Throw in some worry that markets were getting a little overheated and you have a recipe for the downturn we\u2019ve just witnessed.In other words, this bad news for stock investors seems to be driven in part by good news for workers. And since most people earn more money from their jobs than from their investment portfolios, that\u2019s a trade a lot of people would be happy to take.This downward swing in markets may be the kind of occasional stumble that every bull market experiences, or could be the beginning of the end of a market rally that has been going on for an awful long time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inflation and Stocks Are Both Up, and That\u2019s Stirring Some Worries", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseTwo weeks ago, fears of higher-than-expected inflation and interest rates sent stocks into a historic and nerve-rattling plunge. This week, those fears were borne out: Consumer prices rose more than expected in January, and interest rates jumped.The stock market rallied.It\u2019s long been a truism that higher inflation and its close cousin, higher interest rates, are deadly for stock prices. But in the wake of this month\u2019s correction, and the ensuing recovery in stock prices, some market experts are saying that stocks can continue to rally even if interest rates and inflation rise, as they did Wednesday.The bulls are backed by data showing that, during the six periods of rising 10-year Treasury rates since 1988, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has gained an average of 23 percent. Stocks declined in only one of those periods, and then only modestly.\u201cFor the past 20 years, we\u2019ve had a period of strong correlation between stocks and interest rates,\u201d said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist for Nuveen, a TIAA subsidiary.But \u201cthat wasn\u2019t the case for the 30 years before that,\u201d he added. And looking only at the start and end points of periods of rising rates masks considerable volatility in between, not to mention what lies just outside those periods. As rates were rising from 1998 into 2000, for instance, stocks were in one of the biggest bull markets ever, only to plunge after the technology bubble burst.Nearly all mainstream economists agree that at some point, higher interest rates and inflation hurt stock prices. \u201cInvestors are right to be concerned,\u201d said Alan Blinder, professor of economics at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.Nuveen\u2019s Mr. Nick said it\u2019s important for investors to look beyond the headlines about rising interest rates to ask why they\u2019re going up. Rising rates can be a sign of a healthy, growing economy, and if the Fed can keep it from overheating, it may well be good for stocks. But if the Fed is forced to raise rates to ward off inflation, the risks of a recession \u2014 and lower earnings and stock prices \u2014 are much greater.Mr. Nick said the current situation \u201clooks like a little bit of both,\u201d which leaves him cautiously optimistic, but in no rush to add to stock positions. He hasn\u2019t made any changes to Nuveen\u2019s model portfolio allocations.\u201cUnlike the last few corrections, we don\u2019t see this as a V-shape recovery, where investors might blink and miss it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think stocks can rise by the end of the year, but it will be a slower grind back.\u201dEven after the recent pullback, he expects more declines. \u201cWhen interest rates rise back to normal levels, share prices are also likely to revert to previous norms,\u201d Mr. Feldstein told me this week.That could be a long decline. Even after the recent 10 percent correction, stocks remain richly valued by historical norms. James Stack, a market historian and president of InvesTech Research, pointed out that a common valuation measure \u2014 the price-to-earnings multiple for the S.&P. 500 \u2014 recently went from 26 times earnings to 23.4 after the correction, which is a level reached less than 10 percent of the time since 1928. (The long-term average price-to-earnings ratio for the stock market, excluding extreme periods, is about 14.) \u201cThis is a very richly priced market no matter how you slice it,\u201d he said.Mr. Stack recently lowered the stock portion of his model portfolio to 72 percent from 82 percent out of concern over high valuations and rising rates. He noted that during 11 periods since 1955 when the Federal Reserve was tightening credit, a so-called soft landing was achieved only twice \u2014 in the mid-1960s and mid-1990s \u2014 and that a recession followed in every other instance.\u201cOnce the Fed starts a tightening cycle, it is very difficult to avoid a recession before it is over,\u201d he said. He hasn\u2019t increased the allocation since the sell-off.Mr. Blinder told me that stock valuations reached such extreme levels that he started reducing his equity holdings several months ago. \u201cI sold too early,\u201d he said with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cI missed the last 15 percent gain, and I missed the 7 percent drop.\u201d He hasn\u2019t resumed buying at current levels.The Fed is now two full years into its current cycle of rate increases, which is already longer than most tightening periods. But the benchmark interest rate for 10-year Treasuries, which has recently risen to just over 2.9 percent, still has a long way to go before reaching its long-term average of 6.24 percent. The Fed has forecast three more quarter-point rate increases this year, but that would bring the Federal funds rate only to 2.25 percent.\u201cHistorically it\u2019s impossible to name any threshold at which rising rates might trigger a rush for the exit or a bear market,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cIn most cases, stock prices can weather rising interest rates until they reach 5 to 6 percent, which was the case in 2000 and 2007.\u201dBut after years of such low interest rates, and with stock valuations extremely high, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re dealing with what might be the most interest rate-sensitive stock market in our lifetime.\u201dIf this is, indeed, the last stage of the long-running bull market, and interest rates continue to rise, as the Fed has suggested, some sectors typically perform better than others. According to InvesTech, the best performing sectors during periods of rising rates since 1972 have been health care, energy, consumer staples and telecommunications. During the last year of a bull market, the best performing sectors have been energy, health care and technology. Health care and energy show up in both categories.Of course no one knows for sure when the bull market will end \u2014 or whether it already has. But investors are clearly on edge, and the last few weeks may be a preview of what the end looks like.\u201cThere are a lot of very bright people on Wall Street who are all counting on being the first out the door when the party ends,\u201d Mr. Stack said. The recent plunge, added, \u201cshowed just how small that door may get.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Might Be Giving Gun Companies Money, Even if You Don\u2019t Own a Gun", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou probably are a gun owner.You might not actually possess a gun. But if you have a pension or a 401(k) or an investment in index funds, there\u2019s a good chance that, directly or indirectly, you own shares of one or more gun manufacturers.Like it or not, that means that your financial incentives are at least partly aligned with those of gunmakers. And in general, the more guns they sell, the more money their shareholders \u2014 in other words, you \u2014 make.Here is how individual investors, including people whose only investments are through their retirement plans, are financially connected to the gun industry \u2014 even if they don\u2019t realize it.A number of state pension funds own shares in the gun makers. For example, pension funds for public employees in Florida, Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio all have stakes of less than 1 percent in American Outdoor Brands, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, which is the manufacturer of the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle that has been used in a number of recent mass shootings.TIAA, which oversees retirement investments for educators and teachers, has small stakes in American Outdoor Brands and two other publicly traded gun companies. The pension fund for teachers in New York State also has very small positions in the gun companies Sturm Ruger and Vista Outdoor.The investments represent slivers of the pension funds\u2019 overall assets, but they nonetheless are generating debate. New Jersey lawmakers last week moved to cut off investments in gunmakers by the state pension plan.Exchange-traded index funds, which are designed to track the performance of various market indexes, are all the rage these days. They hold the shares of every company in whatever index they\u2019re tracking. These indexes include the Russell 2000 index for small companies and the Standard & Poor\u2019s Aerospace & Defense Select Industry index.That means these investment firms own the stocks, not because they see investment value in them, but because they are part of a broad stock index.Two of the world\u2019s biggest asset managers, the index giants BlackRock and Vanguard, are now among the top shareholders of three publicly traded gun companies: Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor.BlackRock has an 11 percent stake in American Outdoor Brands, while Vanguard\u2019s stake is 8 percent. For Sturm Ruger, BlackRock owns 17 percent while Vanguard has 9.5 percent.BlackRock said it would be contacting officials at the three publicly traded firearms companies, asking them about how they were responding to the shootings.Vanguard has taken a more cautious stance. With 20 million clients, the firm said it was unrealistic to cater to such a wide variety of views on pressing social topics. \u201cWe believe mutual funds are not optimal agents of social change,\u201d a spokesman said.While index funds are prominent shareholders of these gun companies, some large mutual funds \u2014 in which portfolio managers individually pick stocks \u2014 are also substantial owners.One of the world\u2019s biggest fund companies, Capital Group, which oversees $1.6 trillion in assets, has an 8 percent stake in Sturm Ruger.A spokesman for Capital said on Monday that the investment firm \u201cwas engaging with gun manufacturers to understand their plans to ensure the safe use of these products.\u201dAnd the mutual fund giant Fidelity is the top shareholder of Vista Outdoor, with 15 percent of the company. The stake is held largely through Fidelity\u2019s actively managed funds.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the gun that Smith & Wesson manufactures. It makes AR-15-style rifles, not the AR-15.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Fall to End a Bad Week, and a Boom Begins to Look Shaky", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe optimism helped lift stock markets ever higher, extending the boom into its ninth year.Now, investors are suddenly skittish.On Friday, stocks tumbled by more than 2 percent, propelling the market to its worst week in two years.In recent weeks, the shift in sentiment has played out across the world\u2019s largest financial markets. As stocks have sold off, Treasury yields have surged. The dollar has slumped.\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate concern, when inflation spikes up a little bit, that people should evaluate how is this going to affect profits and how is this going to affect the Fed,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe market is becoming more vigilant around these concerns, and that\u2019s good and that\u2019s healthy.\u201dSince stocks began climbing during the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, their rise has been supported by some of the lowest global interest rates seen since World War II. To jump-start growth, central bankers around the world slashed interest rates and took other steps to push down yields on safe government bonds.Their goal was to incentivize investors to put their cash to work in the economy \u2014 for example, by buying corporate stocks and bonds \u2014 rather than stashing it in the relative safety of government bonds. The theory is that the fresh flood of capital would make it easier for companies to raise money, invest in their businesses and hire workers. Central banks wanted to heal their economies.They have healed.For the first time since the financial crisis of 2008, the world\u2019s largest economies are growing in unison. The United States and China led the way, but the expansion now includes Europe, long mired in a debt crisis, and perennially laggard Japan.Given the strength of the global economy, central banks, led by the United States Federal Reserve, have started to remove some of the supports that helped supercharge stock and bond prices over the last decade. The Fed started raising rates two years ago. And with the robust jobs report on Friday showing the fastest wage growth in years, some think the pace of rate increases could quicken.Average hourly earnings for United States workers were 2.9 percent higher in January than the previous year, the fastest annual increase in years. Although a welcome development for workers, economists often view rising wages as an early indication of inflationary pressure. If faster price increases do begin to emerge, the Fed could try to head them off with more aggressive rate action.Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve\u2019s departing chairwoman who had her last working day on Friday, was viewed by some as being more concerned about measures of weakness in the job market than by the risk of rising inflation, and therefore more willing to keep rates low. Her successor, Jerome H. Powell, will face different challenges as the Fed charts a new course in raising interest rates.Interest rates that are set every day in the global bond markets are already leaping higher, in anticipation of central bank rate increases later this year. On Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 a widely used gauge for overall interest rates \u2014 rose to more than 2.8 percent, the highest level since early 2014.Rising rates have myriad consequences, including making it more expensive for companies and individuals to borrow money, like for buying a home or a car. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.2 percent, up from less than 4 percent at the end of 2017.The stock markets this week have reflected the jitters.The energy sector was especially hard hit, with energy giants ExxonMobil dropping 5.1 percent and Chevron falling 5.6 percent on Friday after reporting lackluster earnings. The energy sector of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 6.4 percent during the week, the biggest drop of all industrial sectors in the benchmark.Health care stocks did not fare much better. Express Scripts, Cigna and UnitedHealth Group, among others, were battered Tuesday after Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway announced they were teaming up to create a health care company for their employees.Tech stocks, which have been a crucial driver of the broader market rise, also slipped. Apple reported record-breaking profit late Thursday, but the company disappointed investors with a weaker-than-expected sales forecast. Its shares sank roughly 4.3 percent on Friday, worse than the broader market.That is not to say the market is collapsing. The S.&P. 500 fell 3.9 percent this week. Still, it remains close to historic highs and 21 percent above where it stood a year ago, after another year of solid economic growth.The United States economy expanded by a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2017. That is below the pace of some past expansions \u2014 the economy grew at around 4 percent annually in the late 1990s. But it is enough to keep creating significant numbers of jobs, including 200,000 in January.The economic expansion should be a comfort to investors. Higher revenue allows companies to offset rising costs, such as workers\u2019 pay, if inflation picks up. The tax cuts are also expected to help bolster growth.\u201cIf we start to see growth slowing and inflation acceleration, that\u2019s when I get concerned,\u201d said Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. \u201cAs long as growth continues to improve, a little bit more inflation that we\u2019re seeing now is fine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone X shows.\u2014 Peter EavisWith the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation.They may want to keep fretting, though.Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday.

{"Headline": "5 Tips to Weather a Turbulent Stock Market", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersThe stock market has been shaken by turbulence in the last few weeks, something it hasn\u2019t experienced in a few years.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index plunged more than 10 percent from Jan. 26 to Feb. 8, a sell-off that pushed the market into a correction. The S.&P. has since rebounded, regaining much of those losses. That type of volatility is a normal occurrence, but theories abound to explain what caused it.Adam I. Taback, deputy chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank, said the volatility was the result of the economic expansion\u2019s being in the seventh or eighth inning of a baseball game.\u201cWe may have extra innings in this cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people are more cognizant that the equity markets have more risk in them. They\u2019re happy that their portfolios are diversified but worried where they are in the economic cycle.\u201dSome try to take a more historical view. Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, said volatility typically arose for three reasons: a technical correction where stocks pause but continue rising because company fundamentals are sound; a correction that reflects a change in the business cycle; or a systemic correction, like the 1929 stock market crash or 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe one we experienced last week was the mildest,\u201d Mr. Ablin said. In other words, just a technical correction.Others think it was a return to the normal function of a stock market: Some days, investors sell more stock than they buy.\u201cWhen the Dow drops 1,000 points, that\u2019s more a testament to the growth of the Dow,\u201d said Francis M. Kinniry, head of portfolio construction at Vanguard. \u201cThat\u2019s still just a 4 percent move, because the Dow is at 25,000. Dropping 100 points on the S.&P. 500 doesn\u2019t get people upset, but it\u2019s the same thing.\u201dDon\u2019t fret. Here are five tips from professionals that could help ensure that a volatile ride doesn\u2019t derail your financial planning.They argue that stocks are going to begin to show differences and that their skills at stock selection will keep investors\u2019 portfolios from being dragged down with an entire index. In other words, in a market where everything isn\u2019t going up, selecting the best individual companies makes more sense.Francisco Bido, the head of quantitative research and a portfolio manager at Cognios Capital, said he had reduced the number of stocks he invested in after the recent volatility. The move came out of conviction, not fear, he said.\u201cA lot of those big passive vehicles out there buy so many stocks because they have a mandate to track an index,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it helps to be a bit more concentrated. It allows investors to find a different avenue.\u201dHis strategy is also an argument to know what you own. That\u2019s good advice in any market.But an indexing behemoth like Vanguard says that is an overused argument. Nearly 90 percent of active managers have underperformed the indexes they track, Mr. Kinniry said.\u201cIt\u2019s not an active versus index story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s high cost versus low cost. They underperform because they\u2019re charging too much for the \u2018alpha\u2019 they generate,\u201d he added, referring to the return in excess of the market return.Mr. Kinniry is correct that fees eat into any return, regardless of how volatile the market is.But rising interest rates could eat away returns for individual investors. Driving this worry is a new chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, who took charge on Feb. 5, as the stock market dipped.An alternative to bonds for affluent investors is private debt, which provides loans to small and medium-size companies. The loans are generally just a few years in duration and pay an annual yield of about 10 percent. The risk is in the credit quality of the borrower.Mr. Taback of Wells Fargo Private Bank said that although there was credit risk in the loans, private debt does not feel the same impact that bond portfolios do when interest rates rise. \u201cNow that you\u2019re seeing losses in bond portfolios, clients are more receptive to this,\u201d he said.Hedge funds, in particular, earned a bad reputation for the high fees they charge to manage money on top of taking a share of any profits. Some sophisticated institutional managers, like the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, announced in 2014 that it was getting out of hedge funds because they were too expense and complex.But financial advisers and money managers are arguing that in a volatile investing environment, investors should reconsider hedge funds and other alternative assets like private equity, private debt and real estate. Their returns, they say, are less correlated to the fluctuations of the stock and bond markets and thus provide a steadying force.\u201cLast year, you could ignore risk and focus on return,\u201d said Jae Yoon, chief investment officer of New York Life Investment Management. \u201cThis year, we\u2019re getting more normal volatility, and most clients will find they don\u2019t have enough alternative strategies.\u201dHe said the strong rally in the United States markets had many investors with overweight investments in American stocks, a phenomenon known as home-country bias.But since last year, many developed and emerging markets have begun to perform strongly. \u201cThe more explosive growth is happening in the younger economies around the world,\u201d said Rick Pitcairn, chief investment officer of Pitcairn, an investment adviser to wealthy families.\u201cThere\u2019s persistence in volatility,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said.But volatility is not necessary a bad thing when you have a plan. Mr. Cronk pointed out that even big corrections were a normal part of an economic cycle.The last two economic recovery cycles, in the 1990s and the 2000s, had three corrections apiece toward the end, he said.

Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, heard about the Florida shooting while he was on his way to the Senate floor and ripped up his speech to declare that through inaction, \u201cwe are responsible\u201d for a mass atrocity. Again.Within hours of the blood bath in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and adults were killed on Feb. 14, the machinery of the American gun debate began grinding into motion.By evening, one anti-gun group had mobilized and already sent out its first email: \u201cRESOURCES + EXPERTS AVAILABLE: Florida High School Shooting.\u201d Another group, Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and financed by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, activated the 1,500 members of its \u201csurvivors network,\u201d and soon paid $230,000 for an advertisement in The New York Times shaming pro-gun lawmakers.But this time, a few things are different: The gun control side has developed a well-financed infrastructure that did not exist when Mr. Barden\u2019s son Daniel and other schoolchildren were fatally shot at Sandy Hook. Within days of the Parkland shooting, one anti-gun group flooded Florida lawmakers with 2,500 calls and 1,700 emails opposing a bill allowing guns in schools.And perhaps most dramatically, the We-Call-B.S. teenagers of Florida have injected a passionate new energy into a stale debate, organizing demonstrations, flooding the Statehouse in Tallahassee, composing songs, creating protest signs, confronting politicians and taking to TV airwaves with an intensity and composure and power rarely seen in recent years.\u201cThe initial reaction was the same kind of sickened resignation \u2014 this is one of the worst ever, and this probably won\u2019t be enough either,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a founder of Third Way, a center-left advocacy group in Washington.\u201cWhat has changed since then is the kids and the extraordinary, galvanizing force they have become,\u201d he added, interrupting an interview to take a call from his 17-year-old son, whose class was leaving school to march to the White House. \u201cNo one knows when we are going to hit a tipping point on this issue. We may have hit it \u2014 we don\u2019t know. But if we did, it\u2019s because of them.\u201d\u201cWe have seen breakdowns in existing laws,\u201d Mr. Scalise said. \u201cBefore people talk about putting new laws on the books, when we find out that multiple laws on the books were not followed, that should be the first thing we figure out.\u201dThe rapid mobilization of the anti-gun movement is a phenomenon that has evolved with the emergence of lobbying groups filled with veteran political operatives and growing lists of supporters. By now they are used to it.But the response has been an outpouring of support. Moms Demand Action, the grass-roots arm of Everytown, has 100,000 volunteers in every state, with an email list of four million. Since the Parkland shooting, the group has added 75,000 members. In Georgia, 1,500 people turned up Wednesday at the State Capitol to lobby for gun laws, compared with 160 last year. In Minnesota, the group had 16 RSVPs before the shooting for a meeting on Tuesday; 300 people attended.\u201cWhen Sandy Hook happened, the gun lobby was ready for us. They had been preparing for 20 years to take down those parents,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, recalling that few Democratic lawmakers were willing to appear on television criticizing the N.R.A. \u201cThere was no anti-gun movement. It just didn\u2019t exist.\u201dNow, he said, \u201cthere is an increasingly mature political movement that can combine with the unique moral authority of the kids.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said each episode cracks the wall of resistance to new gun laws. \u201cEach time you do think it\u2019s a little different and people will move,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to believe it\u2019s cumulative and you win more support. You win a vote here and there.\u201dBy last weekend, gun control groups were sending out fund-raising appeals. In recent days, some groups have begun quietly helping the students organize future activities, including a march on Washington on March 24 with hopes of drawing 500,000 people.In the days after the shooting, Mr. Trump consulted advisers as well as Chris W. Cox, the N.R.A.\u2019s chief lobbyist. The president called Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip, who was traveling in the Middle East, to discuss his bill with Mr. Murphy requiring states and federal agencies to report more often to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System offenses that would bar gun purchases.\u201cThese kids, they\u2019re organizing, they want action,\u201d an aide told Mr. Trump.\u201cI want action, too,\u201d he replied, according to another aide. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ran for president.\u201dAt the request of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, Mr. Trump called a girl wounded in the attack, and afterward, the call seemed to remain on his mind, as he kept bringing it up with aides. Last Friday, he visited a Florida hospital and met victims, a visit still on his mind when he had dinner Saturday night at his Mar-a-Lago estate with his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, his daughter-in-law Lara and the Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera.The president noted that the injuries he saw were more grisly than those portrayed in the movies. \u201cHe was definitely horrified by the severity, the savagery of those wounds that the children suffered,\u201d Mr. Rivera recalled. \u201cAnd he kept saying, \u2018How do you recover from that?\u2019\u201dMr. Trump mentioned tightening background checks. \u201cHe brought up how absurd it is that someone can buy a gun even though they\u2019re on the no-fly list,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. Asked for his opinion, Mr. Rivera suggested raising the minimum age to buy an assault rifle to 21 from 18.Eric Trump, who like his brother is a big-game hunter, seemed to push back, noting that there are already more than 300 million guns in circulation in the United States, implying that new restrictions might be pointless.But the president, in defiance of the N.R.A., has since publicly embraced the age increase and ordered the Justice Department to develop regulations to ban bump stocks.By Thursday, Mr. Trump seemed to be following the lead of the N.R.A. again, talking enthusiastically of its proposal to arm highly trained teachers to fortify schools. Still, he has taken different views of gun laws before. In \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d published in 2000 when he briefly ran for the Reform Party presidential nomination, Mr. Trump called both major parties extreme.\u201cThe Republicans walk the N.R.A. line and refuse even limited restrictions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201dMr. Trump owns guns and has had a concealed weapon permit since 2010. When he set out to win the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, he was pressed by voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to support gun rights, an experience that aides said hardened his views. He dropped support for an assault rifle ban. \u201cI love the N.R.A.,\u201d he declared. \u201cI love the Second Amendment.\u201dWhether they change the outcome, the students have at least changed the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be traumatic for a long time,\u201d said Mr. Scalise, speaking from experience. \u201cThe fact that they want to get more engaged and find out what they can do to help to prevent this, I think, is courageous.\u201dFollow Peter Baker and Michael Shear on Twitter: @peterbakernyt @shearm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buffett\u2019s Annual Letter: Berkshire Records $29 Billion Gain From Tax Law", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s bottom line for 2017 got a big lift from the new tax law.In an annual letter to Berkshire\u2019s shareholders on Saturday, the company\u2019s chief executive, Warren Buffett, said the conglomerate recorded a more than $29 billion gain related to the tax overhaul that became law in December.He also said that a \u201cpurchasing frenzy\u201d had raised deal prices to a level that the company could not stomach. That was why, he said, that Berkshire had largely avoided big acquisitions last year.Here\u2019s a look at some of the highlights from the letter:Berkshire recorded a hefty windfall from the tax bill that Congress passed at the end of last year. The annual report said the tax overhaul produced a $29.6 billion gain that was offset slightly by $1.4 billion of tax payments on repatriated foreign earnings. The tax gain contributed nearly two-thirds of Berkshire\u2019s $44.9 billion in net earnings for 2017.Each year, Mr. Buffett highlights the change in Berkshire\u2019s book value, a measure of the company\u2019s net worth. The company\u2019s book value rose by $65.3 billion to $348 billion in 2017, a 23 percent gain from $282 billion at the end of 2016. The tax benefit made up a hefty 45 percent of the book value increase. In commenting on the contribution from lower taxes, Mr. Buffett said: \u201cThe $65 billion gain is nonetheless real \u2014 rest assured of that.\u201dOne of main ways that Berkshire has grown over the years is by spending large sums to acquire other companies.But the company hasn\u2019t done a big deal for some time. While that may make it harder for Berkshire to grow, Mr. Buffett said acquisitions have to have \u201ca sensible purchase price.\u201d That requirement, he said, \u201cproved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far from spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimistic purchasers.\u201dStill Mr. Buffett said he and Charles T. Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, were happy to sit on the sidelines:\u201cBoth of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don\u2019t need.\u201d\u201cDespite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will have opportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less the prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own.\u201dMr. Buffett has long set the goal of beating the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index and in 2017, Berkshire did just that.The company\u2019s book value rose 23 percent, while its stock price climbed 21.9 percent. The S.&P. 500 climbed 21.8 percent.For years, Berkshire\u2019s book value was Mr. Buffett\u2019s preferred measure for comparing Berkshire\u2019s performance to the S.&P. 500 and he highlighted the comparison on a table on the first page of the letter. But outperforming the S.&P. 500 has become more difficult as Berkshire has grown and shifted to buying whole companies. A few years ago, Mr. Buffett added Berkshire\u2019s annual stock price performance to the table.Warren Buffett has long railed against the fees that hedge funds and money managers collect from investors.A decade ago, he made a $1 million wager that an index fund that tracks the S.&P. 500 would outperform a basket of hedge funds over the next 10 years.The bet is now complete and Mr. Buffett won. The S.&P. 500 index fund that Mr. Buffett picked is up nearly 126 percent, easily outpacing the returns of five funds of hedge funds, which were up 2.8 to 87.7 percent.The big winner of the bet was Girls Inc. of Omaha. The charity received $2,222,279 last month rather than the planned $1 million.The reason? Mr. Buffett and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners had originally invested $318,250 each in United States Treasuries, with the expectation that the investment would appreciate to $1 million over the life of the bet. But in 2012, they sold the bonds and bought shares of Berkshire.That proved a wise move.Mr. Buffett\u2019s annual letter is combed over for its investment advice and folksy wisdom as well as a few corny jokes. Here are some the best lines from the latest one:An earlier version of this article misstated the book value for Berkshire Hathaway in 2017.

{"Headline": "Gains on Wall St. Subside as Global Investors Grow Cautious", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks fell Wednesday in a seesaw trading session, as markets sought direction after several tumultuous days of trading.After registering a 1.7 percent gain on Tuesday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index spent much of Wednesday in positive territory, led by large industrial companies positioned to capitalize on global growth and investors hunting for potential bargains from recent selling.But slumping oil prices weighed on the energy stocks throughout the afternoon. Crude oil futures closed down 2.5 percent in New York. Exxon Mobil fell 1.8 percent, and Chevron dropped 1.6 percent. The energy sector, which fell 1.7 percent, helped pull the S.&P. 500 back into negative territory in the last hour of trading. The broad index fell 0.5 percent.Other indexes also dropped. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9 percent.Another uptick in interest rates also seemed to dampen what had started out as a relatively decent day for stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.84 percent after lackluster demand in an auction of $24 billion worth of the benchmark government bonds. Yields on 10-year Treasuries, which serve as the foundation for a range of consumer borrowing rates, are near their highest levels since January 2014.The steady climb in interest rates has gained pace in 2018. And it has become a concern for investors who believe the low interest rates since the financial crisis have been a cornerstone of the long bull market for stocks. Interest rates on shorter-term Treasury bonds, such as the two-year note, have also risen sharply.Those shorter-term bond yields tend to be sensitive to changing expectations surrounding monetary policy, another source of worry in recent days.Those developments, on their face, should not be bad signs for the consumption-heavy American economy. But some economists consider wage growth an indication that inflation could rise. And investors took the wage data as a reason to worry that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than policymakers had previously suggested.Stocks fell sharply when the January jobs report was issued on Friday. The sell-off gathered force on Monday when the S.&P. 500 fell 4.1 percent, its biggest single-day drop since August 2011. The sell-off briefly spread through global markets. But a solid performance by markets in the United States on Tuesday seemed to cool the fire.\u201cWe have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.The American economy does indeed appear to have significant momentum. At 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate is low. And the gross domestic product grew at an annual clip of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter. Recent corporate earnings reports have been solid, with several companies outlining plans to increase investment, in part because of the tax code overhaul that became law in December.Industrial companies are also piggybacking on that economic strength both in the United States and abroad.Ball Corporation, a maker of metal packaging like beer cans, was one of the best-performing stocks in the S.&P. 500 on Wednesday. Shares in Ball, which has plants around the world, rose sharply after the company reported favorable earnings results and cited momentum in its business supplying the aerospace industry. Other large industrial companies, such as Boeing, also rose, helping to lift indexes.\u201cAs we look forward, the market drivers of better economic prospects and higher profits have not changed at all,\u201d Steven M. Duryee, a portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley\u2019s Bergman Continuum Group, a wealth management firm, said in an email to clients.An earlier version of this article misstated when stock markets on Wall Street recovered following recent sell-offs.

{"Headline": "Why Markets Have Gotten So Jumpy ", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo understand the wild swings on Wall Street, consider a farm town, a long drought and the cost of flood insurance.To understand why global financial markets have been so volatile the last few weeks, imagine a town full of farmers who have been living through a decade-long drought. The first few years of the drought, they probably adapted by shifting to crops that could grow without much water, but at the same time they probably kept renewing their flood insurance. After all, the drought could end at any time, and losses caused by too much water are every bit as painful as those caused by too little.But after years and years of writing checks for flood insurance, our farmers might get a little tired of throwing money away to protect against a risk that never seems to materialize. By the seventh or eighth year of the drought, they might just say \u201cforget it\u201d and let flood insurance lapse.Then, with the 10-year mark approaching, it rains. Not very hard: Imagine a perfectly normal rainstorm by pre-drought standards, not enough to cause a flood, but enough to make the farmers think flooding just might be a possibility again.What would the farmers do? There\u2019s a good chance that they would call their insurance broker and very quickly, even desperately, sign up for flood insurance once again.And that helps explain why the markets have been so topsy-turvy of late.Rain, in this metaphor, is inflation \u2014 and the decade-long drought is the near-decade that global inflation and interest rates have been persistently low.When you pick apart the shifts in the financial markets, they are consistent with the idea that investors are not yet betting on an inflationary flood but are opening their minds to the idea that it could happen.For example, by comparing the prices of regular Treasury bonds with inflation-protected bonds, you can get a sense of how worried investors are about inflation. On Dec. 1, those prices were such that an investor would break even if from five to 10 years in the future \u2014 December 2022 through December 2027 \u2014 consumer prices rose 1.78 percent a year.That has now risen to 2.21 percent, which is quite a large swing by the standards of the generally staid bond market.This framework also helps explain why there have been such big swings in financial markets lately.And the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 has moved more than 1 percent on eight of 16 trading days in February thus far, which doesn\u2019t make much sense if you\u2019re looking for fundamentals-based reasons for such big moves in stock prices. It makes more sense if you believe that investors are trying to extrapolate from tiny fragments of information the potential risk of a radically different economic and financial market environment in the years ahead.The swings in stock prices appear to be intimately linked to movement in long-term interest rates, which in turn hinges on those expectations of inflation and how the Federal Reserve will respond if inflation does rise.On Wednesday, for example, the stock market had been on track for a sharply positive day until the Fed released minutes of its last policy meeting at 2 p.m. Soon after, the stock market plunged and bond yields rose, as investors evidently concluded that the Fed was inclined toward a somewhat faster rate of interest rate increases than had been assumed.But you can also interpret swings like that one as a result of investors trying to draw big conclusions about the economic future from incremental pieces of information.In December, Fed officials projected that the main interest rate the central bank targets would be 2.8 percent in the longer run. But when it first started publishing its consensus of that number, in June 2015, it was 3.8 percent. If the economy evolves in a direction that causes the earlier estimate to prove more accurate, it implies that a wide range of assets are priced incorrectly (in particular, it would mean that prices for long-term bonds should be a lot lower and their yields higher). So as long as this pattern continues, you can interpret every day\u2019s economic news and market swings as a referendum on which state of the world is more likely. Are we still in the world of 2009 to 2017, in which inflation and interest rates stayed low and asset prices continued their steady rise? Or are we returning to the pre-2008 levels of each, a possibility that is perhaps less probable but would be hugely consequential if it happens?If that world does arrive, the people who re-upped their flood insurance at the first sign of rain will be glad they did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bonuses and Bogosity", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Feb. 19 Walmart, America\u2019s largest employer, announced broad-based pay hikes. In fact, it announced that it would be raising wages for half a million workers. The Trump tax cut is working!Why did Walmart raise wages? Partly because the labor market was tightening: unemployment had fallen more than 40 percent from its peak in 2009 (a decline for which the Obama administration\u2019s stimulus and other policies actually do deserve some credit.) This tightening labor market meant that Walmart was having trouble attracting workers.Walmart was also in the midst of a change in business strategy. Its policy of always low wages, always, was starting to look problematic: low pay meant high turnover and low morale, and management believed that moving at least partway to the Costco strategy of paying more and getting better performance as a result made sense.The moral of this story is that unless the economy is deeply depressed, there will always be some companies, somewhere, raising wages and offering bonuses. Which brings me to the Trump tax cut and the very bad, no good job much of the media initially did of covering its effects.Yet for a while there the news was full of stories about companies announcing that they were giving their workers bonuses thanks to the Trump tax cut. Why were they doing this?Well, the tax cut provided no immediate incentive to raise wages. It did, however, give companies that benefited from the tax cut a strong political incentive to claim that the tax break was the reason for bonuses or wage hikes they would have given in any case. Why not? They want the tax cut to look good, since it\u2019s good for them. And hyping its benefits is a cheap way to make a de facto campaign contribution to an administration that can do a lot to help companies it likes, say by removing pesky safety or environmental regulations.In other words, the whole \u201cbonuses thanks to tax cut\u201d story was bogus, and obviously so. Yet much of the media fell for it.Furthermore, the surge in stock buybacks suggests that the long run effect of the tax cut on wages will be small. Remember that the chain that should lead to trickle-down begins with lower taxes -> higher investment. If companies use the cuts to buy back stocks, not add to plant and equipment, the wage-growth story doesn\u2019t even get started.So the real news about the tax cut is that it is \u2013 I know you\u2019ll be shocked \u2013 mainly a giveaway to corporations. Who could have predicted?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walmart and Dick\u2019s Raise Minimum Age for Gun Buyers to 21", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo of the nation\u2019s leading gun sellers, Walmart and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, took steps on Wednesday to limit their sales of firearms, thrusting themselves into the middle of the polarizing national debate over gun control.Walmart, the biggest gun seller, announced late in the afternoon that it would not sell any gun to anyone under 21 years of age. It also said it would no longer sell items resembling assault-style rifles, including toys and air guns.Early in the day, Dick\u2019s said it was immediately ending sales of all assault-style rifles in its stores. The retailer also said that it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and would also require any gun buyer to be at least 21, regardless of local laws.Under federal law, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer. But 18-year-olds can buy semiautomatic rifles and other firearms.This time, Walmart directly linked its action to the shooting in Florida, saying, \u201cIn light of recent events, we\u2019ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales.\u201dTop Walmart executives made the decision and then informed the board, a company spokesman said.Walmart sells guns in roughly half of its nearly 4,000 supercenters, the company said, but the sheer scale of its customer base gives its decision significant heft. Every week, more than 150 million people around the country shop at Walmart.Dick\u2019s decision was announced by Edward Stack, the 63-year-old chief executive whose father founded the store in 1948. Mr. Stack made clear that he was deliberately steering his company directly into the storm over gun reform.\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset,\u201d Mr. Stack said in an interview. \u201cWe love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and, hopefully, bring people along into the conversation.\u201dWhen a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.About 79 percent of the tweets had a positive sentiment, Sprout Social said, including supportive messages from Hollywood actors and actresses.But the company\u2019s critics posted their plans to no longer shop at the retailer, some closing their tweets with \u201c#boycott.\u201dInvestors did not appear to worry about a backlash, as Dick\u2019s stock spent much of Wednesday trading about 1.8 percent higher before finishing up 0.69 percent.Mr. Stack said Dick\u2019s hoped to move the conversation beyond social media and into the political realm. As part of its stance, the company is calling on elected officials to pass what it called \u201ccommon sense gun reform\u201d: raising the minimum age to buy guns to 21, banning assault-type weapons and so-called bump stocks, and conducting broader background checks that include mental-health information and previous interactions with law enforcement.As of Wednesday morning, the company said, AR-15-style and other semiautomatic rifles will no longer be sold in its 35 Field & Stream stores or on its websites. And this time, Mr. Stack added, the changes will be permanent.Mr. Stack said the retailer had begun scouring its purchase records shortly after the identity of the suspected Parkland killer, Nikolas Cruz, became known. The company soon discovered that it had legally sold a gun to Mr. Cruz in November, though it was not the type used in the school shooting.\u201cBut it came to us that we could have been a part of this story,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe said, \u2018We don\u2019t want to be a part of this any longer.\u2019\u201dThat response raised rounds of discussions with the company\u2019s top executives and its directors, all of whom backed the decision to take a stand, Mr. Stack said.He said Dick\u2019s remained a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and would continue to sell a variety of sport and hunting firearms. Although he has never been a member of the N.R.A., Mr. Stack said, he is a gun owner and enjoys trapshooting.But when it comes to selling guns to individuals under 21 or stocking assault-style rifles, Mr. Stack said, his company is done. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a part of a mass shooting,\u201d he said.The company said that it had not decided what to do with its inventory of assault-style rifles but that they would not be sold in the marketplace.Legal experts said they saw no likely challenges to Dick\u2019s decision to stop selling assault-style rifles. But the decision to stop selling weapons to anyone under 21, however, could be tested in court.Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the School of Law of the University of California, Los Angeles, said Dick\u2019s could be challenged in lawsuits claiming a violation of laws that bar age discrimination. Although federal civil rights laws do not apply, some states, including New York, prohibit businesses from denying goods and services on the basis of age.\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if an aggressive attorney general of a gun-friendly state brings an age-discrimination claim against Dick\u2019s,\u201d Professor Winkler wrote in an email response to questions.The company said that it believed its decision was in accordance with the law and that it was instituting the policy immediately.Matthew Haag contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Adds Cautious Support to Changes to Background Checks for Gun Buyers", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump signaled on Monday that he was willing to join a discussion on gun restrictions amid the national outcry led by teenagers who survived last week\u2019s mass shooting at a Florida high school.The White House stopped short of backing the bill, but the statement was a departure for a president who has focused on the mental health of gunmen and suspects, rather than the firearms used in the attacks, after other mass shootings.\u201cWhile discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, \u201cthe president is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system.\u201dThe proposed legislation \u2014 introduced by Mr. Cornyn, three other Republicans and four Democrats in the Senate \u2014 would make significant changes to the national instant criminal background check system. The bill would hold federal agencies accountable for failing to add relevant information. It would also establish an initiative to better monitor gun buyers with records of domestic abuse.But the legislation would have done little to stop the shooting last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people. The suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, had no criminal record. He bought at least seven guns legally, including an AK-47 he had purchased in the past month, a federal law enforcement official said on Monday.Mr. Cruz, who has confessed to investigators, appeared on Monday in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom in shackles and a red jumpsuit as lawyers argued over whether a defense motion filed last week should be kept confidential. Mr. Cruz did not look up during the brief hearing.Several other Republicans have expressed a willingness since the shooting to discuss a change in gun laws, though they have given few specifics. On Monday, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida announced he would hold meetings with state and local leaders, focusing on ways to improve school safety, expand mental health care and keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness.Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said on Sunday that some \u201csmall steps\u201d should be taken on gun control, addressing background checks and mental illness. Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont said in a statement that his administration would review its procedures and policies on gun safety.Students from Parkland and across the country have organized protests and marches to urge Mr. Trump and lawmakers to act. About 100 people gathered in front of the White House on Monday to rally for stricter gun control. Seventeen students, representing the number of people killed in Florida, lay on the ground in protest. Parents, teachers and friends joined them on the pavement, and high school students stood in clusters in 40-degree temperatures, chanting \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d and waving signs that read \u201cAm I next?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been afraid to go to school since the shooting in Florida,\u201d said Maya Galanti, a 12-year-old from Bethesda, Md., who attended the rally with her mother and two siblings. \u201cThose students thought they were having a normal day, and we have the same chances of getting shot as they did.\u201dStudents from the Parkland area have also lashed out at Mr. Trump on Twitter, and some were incensed when he suggested in a tweet that the shooting had occurred because the F.B.I.\u2019s resources had been diverted to the Russia investigation.The legislation last fall was considered a modest step toward a bipartisan compromise on gun safety.The lead senators behind the bill \u2014 Mr. Cornyn and Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut \u2014 have seen some of the worst mass shootings in United States history unfold in their states. A shooting that killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 came near the start of Mr. Murphy\u2019s time in office, and gun restrictions became a defining issue for him. The shooting deaths of over two dozen people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November prompted Mr. Cornyn to be a co-sponsor of the bill.The president, who has spoken favorably about gun rights over the years, has held wavering views on gun restrictions. He had a concealed weapon permit in New York when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor, but it is not clear whether he maintained it.In 2000, as he considered an earlier run for president, Mr. Trump wrote in his book \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d that \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201dHe added, \u201cWith today\u2019s internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.\u201dIn 2016 on CNN, Mr. Trump said guns should not be allowed in classrooms, and then followed up moments later by saying that some teachers should have access to firearms.\u201cYou look at some of our schools, unbelievable what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019m not advocating guns in the classroom,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cRemember in some cases, a lot of people admit this, trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.\u201dReporting was contributed by Patricia Mazzei from New York; Neil Reisner from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Ali Watkins and Emily Baumgaertner from Washington.

{"Headline": "Trump Suggests Teachers Get a \u2018Bit of a Bonus\u2019 to Carry Guns", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Thursday enthusiastically embraced a National Rifle Association position to arm highly trained teachers to fortify schools against mass shootings like the one last week. Mr. Trump, who said the armed teachers should receive extra pay as an incentive, promoted his idea as demands for stronger gun control intensified across the country.\u201cYou give them a little bit of a bonus, so practically for free, you have now made the school into a hardened target,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The president estimated that 10 percent to 40 percent of school employees would be qualified to handle a weapon \u2014 he offered no data for the claim \u2014 and said he would devote federal money to training them.Mr. Trump has cycled through a number of proposals \u2014 including some gun limits deemed unacceptable by the N.R.A. \u2014 in the days since the rampage killed 14 students and three adults last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. On Thursday, he returned to an idea championed by the gun rights group.Mr. Trump echoed that language during his meeting at the White House, using the term \u201charden\u201d more than a dozen times in less than an hour as he said a fortified school would be an unappealing target for a gun-wielding assailant.The president also said he believed the powerful gun lobby would support a move to raise the age threshold for buying firearms to 21 from 18, a change the N.R.A. is resisting, along with enhanced background checks.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on arming teachers revealed that he was in the thrall of the gun lobby. \u201cNot surprised the N.R.A. reeled President Trump back in,\u201d he said. \u201cJust amazed at how fast it happened.\u201dMayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who has been an outspoken advocate for gun control and is among Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal critics, blistered the president.\u201cNo police officer, no educator of any note is advocating that what we need is more weapons on school campuses rather than fewer,\u201d said Mr. Emanuel, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s totally asinine and it doesn\u2019t even warrant a response, but it\u2019s so reckless that the head of the United States\u2019 idea for solving this problem is to arm more people.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous feeling that we want to get something done,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Roosevelt Room on Thursday, adding that the N.R.A. shares the sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take action,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump said he had spoken with the \u201ctop people\u201d at the N.R.A. \u2014 White House officials said he had talked with Chris Cox, the organization\u2019s top lobbyist, over the weekend \u2014 and come away believing that \u201cthey\u2019re ready to do things,\u201d including tightening regulations.\u201cThey gave me tremendous support \u2014 tremendous,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the N.R.A. \u201cI told them, I said we\u2019re going to have to toughen them up, because it doesn\u2019t make anybody look good, and most importantly, I saw the devastation of these families. We can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201dBut he also defended the gun lobby, saying they were \u201cgood people\u201d and \u201cpatriots,\u201d and adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be going up against them.\u201dMr. LaPierre, whose remarks on Thursday were his first public comments since the Parkland shooting, criticized Democrats for calling for more gun control laws.While Mr. Trump has said in recent days that he wished to strengthen background checks for people seeking to buy guns, the White House said on Thursday that the president is not currently proposing to close a loophole for sales at gun shows.Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump supported including mental health information in the federal background check system, as well as measures to ensure more complete and accurate data.The president has also been working to use executive authority to act on gun-related proposals that do not rile gun control opponents. As early as Friday, the Justice Department will ask federal prosecutors to prioritize prosecutions of people who lie on the federal background check forms required to buy guns, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the decision. The request would enforce a rarely prosecuted law that makes lying on those forms a felony.On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was not in favor of one measure that schools around the nation have increasingly taken to defend themselves and their students against school shooters: holding drills to practice what to do.\u201cActive shooter drills is a very negative thing,\u201d Mr. Trump said after Pam Stewart, the Florida Department of Education commissioner, mentioned such preparations. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. I\u2019d much rather have a hardened school.\u201dMr. Trump added that active shooter drills were \u201ccrazy,\u201d and \u201cvery hard on children.\u201dLater, the White House sought to walk back the president\u2019s statement, arguing that he was condemning the term \u201cactive shooter\u201d drill, not the practice itself.\u201cHe said the term \u2018active shooter drills\u2019 is particularly \u2014 could be frightening for young children,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cHe thinks a drill that has a different name and is not \u2014 the brand of it, frankly, doesn\u2019t frighten children, might be a better way to approach it.\u201dRandi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said she had held a telephonic town hall on Wednesday night in which she discussed the proposal with 60,000 educators.\u201cThe response was universal, even from educators who are gun owners: Teachers don\u2019t want to be armed, we want to teach,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be, and would never have the expertise needed to be, sharp shooters; no amount of training can prepare an armed teacher to go up against an AR-15.\u201dKatie Benner, Jonathan Martin, Ali Watkins and John Ismay contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Bad News in the Good News", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis morning\u2019s job market report was definitely good. Job creation was surprisingly strong for this late in an economic expansion; wages are finally rising, although still far more slowly than they were before the Great Recession. You never want to make too much of one month\u2019s report, but this was clearly positive.And stocks plunged. What?One answer is that stocks gonna do what they\u2019re gonna do \u2013 as Paul Samuelson famously put it, the market predicted nine of the last five recessions. But there\u2019s a bit of economic logic here too. One way of looking at recent economic data is that they\u2019re actually telling us that future U.S. growth will be lower than one might have hoped.If we care about the medium term \u2013 say, 5 or 10 years \u2013 prospects for U.S. growth depend on two things. First, how much slack is there in the economy? How many people who aren\u2019t working can still be drawn into employment without inflation taking off?Second, how fast will productivity \u2013 output per person-hour \u2013 rise?The first question has posed something of a puzzle. Standard indicators like the unemployment rate and the quit rate suggest an economy at more or less full employment. (Quits matter because they tell us how easily workers expect to find new jobs.) But low wage growth suggested that there might still be substantial room to run.Now, finally, we may be seeing some significant wage gains:Again, you don\u2019t want to make too much of one month\u2019s number. But the wage gain strengthens the case that we really are near full employment; interest rates rose because the odds of Fed rate hikes to limit inflation have risen. And that hit stocks.Meanwhile, productivity numbers have been pretty dismal:So what the data are suggesting, although not with a lot of confidence, is that America is about to settle into a low-growth rut, maybe 1.5% a year. And yes, that\u2019s only half what Trump is promising.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tumultuous Week on Wall Street Ends With a Small Rally", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street ended a volatile week on an upswing, as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended Friday\u2019s trading session about 1.4 percent higher.After Thursday\u2019s session marked a 10 percent drop from the market\u2019s peak in January, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average started higher on Friday, then plummeted, then swung back into positive territory in the afternoon.Asian and European markets tumbled on Friday. Chinese stocks were among the biggest casualties in a broad sell-off across Asia. It was a stunning reversal for Chinese shares, which investors had been snapping up only days before.The cause of one of the most turbulent weeks in recent memory, market participants in the United States said, appeared to be widespread expectations that the global economy is improving and that growth would accelerate in the near future.That has led to fears that interest rate increases could cheapen the value of certain kinds of investments.\u201cEven if stocks continue to rise, they could rise more slowly and could be subject to large drops,\u201d said Kate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.She said investors were moving money out of riskier stocks like Apple and Disney, which are considered \u201cconsumer discretionary\u201d stocks because they don\u2019t serve basic daily needs, and into safer areas like utility stocks and United States Treasury notes.\u201cLonger-term investors should stay invested and not let this worry them. This is an opportunity to buy at lower prices,\u201d Ms. Warne said.Many investors are now growing nervous that central banks will raise interest rates in a bid to keep inflation at bay. If policymakers move too quickly, their efforts could temper the global growth.Anthony Clemente, the chief executive of Canaras Capital, which specializes in high-yield loans and has $1.3 billion under management, said some of the market movement appeared to be an effort by portfolio managers to protect themselves from volatility in stocks rather than a broader fear of market turmoil.\u201cIt\u2019s really out of equities and inflows into the debt markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an expectations that yields \u2014 fixed income and debt instrument \u2014 are the place where you will want to be at some point.\u201dWhatever the cause, there is now little doubt that markets are jittery.After being lulled into a sense of complacency by years of steadily rising stocks, even small worries can snowball into a bad day for stocks. The losses can then feed on themselves in a financial industry dominated by computerized trading systems, with the weakness in the United States spreading around the world.\u201cAsia is going to be the tail that gets wagged by the U.S. dog,\u201d Timothy Moe, chief Asia Pacific strategist at Goldman Sachs, said on Friday.But the Chinese market does offer reasons for concern. Investors kept a careful eye this week on China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, which is carefully managed by the Chinese government. It took a hit on Thursday, falling as much as 1.2 percent before strengthening a bit on Friday.Before that, the renminbi had been rising steadily against the American dollar, leading to worries that Beijing might step in further to contain it. World markets can be sensitive to sharp swings in China\u2019s currency.The tough day of trading on Friday put Chinese shares by some measures into correction territory. \u201cWe are witnessing the longest rally in the history of Chinese stocks,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote to clients early this week, adding, \u201cA tactical correction appears overdue, and markets could fall further.\u201dShares in Shanghai fell about 4 percent on Friday, while Hong Kong shares lost 3.1 percent. Shares in Tokyo fell 2.3 percent. In Europe, stocks wavered, off more than 1 percent in afternoon trading.In the logic of stock markets, bad news can sometimes be good news. Recent gains in the value of the euro against the dollar and other major currencies were expected to slow exports and potentially put the brakes on the eurozone economy.Slower growth would, in turn, dissuade the European Central Bank from raising interest rates too soon, prolonging the cheap money that has been partly responsible for the bull market.\u201cThe E.C.B. has, in fact, a vital interest in keeping euro area interest rates at low levels,\u201d Ralph Solveen, an analyst at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients on Friday.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Live by the Dow, Die by the Dow? Trump Is Quiet on Market", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump boasted about the economy during a speech on Monday, he left out one of his favorite lines. Nowhere did he mention the skyrocketing stock market.By the time a bullish Mr. Trump was done speaking in Blue Ash, Ohio, the bearish market had plunged by nearly 1,600 points before recovering somewhat to close 1,175 points down.Despite the stumble of the past two trading sessions \u2014 totaling 1,841 points, or 7 percent \u2014 the Dow remains far higher under Mr. Trump, and there is no sign that the broader economy has lost momentum. But critics who have chafed at what they considered the president\u2019s shortsighted boasting for the past year saw Monday\u2019s meltdown as overdue comeuppance and eagerly piled on.After Monday\u2019s tumble, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides were left in the awkward position of ignoring it or explaining that it was not especially meaningful. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accompanied Mr. Trump to Ohio, declined to comment on the market when he encountered reporters on Air Force One during the trip back to Washington and again on the tarmac after it landed. The television on the plane was tuned to Fox Business Network as it dissected the day\u2019s dark developments.\u201cLook, markets do fluctuate in the short term. We all know that,\u201d Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, told reporters en route to Ohio when the market was heading down. \u201cAnd they do that for number of reasons. But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong and they\u2019re headed in the right direction \u2014 for the middle class, in particular.\u201dAfter the president returned to the White House, his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, issued a written statement.\u201cThe president\u2019s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment and increasing wages for American workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president\u2019s tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people.\u201dThose tax cuts may actually be contributing to the market\u2019s decline. Analysts attributed plummeting share prices to Friday\u2019s job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment. Rising wages are a good thing for those who receive them, and for the presidents who seek to stimulate them, but investors see them as a sign of possible inflation and higher interest rates.Instead of fueling growth, investors worry that the extra money Mr. Trump is pumping into the economy through tax cuts and, if he is successful, with a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan will inflate wages and prices. And that could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly, suppressing growth to keep a lid on inflation.\u201cEven before the fiscal stimulus plan has really begun to kick in, we are already seeing markets worrying more about inflation,\u201d said Torsten Slok, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. \u201cThey are coming to the conclusion that the U.S. economy is in danger of overheating.\u201dStill, some analysts cautioned against overinterpreting the meaning of market movements.\u201cIn many cases, it is near impossible to figure out what moves the stock market in any given day,\u201d said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard University economist and former chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Bush. \u201cThe stock market is a leading indicator, albeit an imperfect one. So it is natural to see a rising market as good news. But it is highly speculative to tie a stock market movement to any particular set of policies.\u201dWhile the Dow closed at its lowest point in two months, the market remains well above where it was when Mr. Trump was elected. Even with the loss, the Dow is 23 percent higher than on Inauguration Day 2017 and 33 percent higher than on Election Day 2016.Over all, the 25 percent increase in 2017 was the largest annual rise since 2013, when the Dow shot up by 26.5 percent. Over the eight years of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, which began at the depths of a financial crisis and recession, the market rose nearly 150 percent.After calling attention to the daily running of the bulls for so much of the past year, Mr. Trump chose to focus on other metrics on Monday at a manufacturing plant in Ohio where the company used some of the proceeds from the tax cuts to give employees bonuses.\u201cYour paychecks are going way up,\u201d he told workers. \u201cYour taxes are going way down. And right now, for the first time in a long time \u2014 and you\u2019ve seen it \u2014 factories are coming back. Everything is coming back. They all want to be where the action is.\u201dAt least some of the action, for the moment, will be on the trading floor.Advertisement"}

From 2008 through 2012, Tucker\u2019s companies extended approximately five million loans to customers across the country, while generating more than $2 billion in revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. Most of this money flowed through accounts that Tucker maintained at the Bank.USB employees responsible for servicing Tucker\u2019s ongoing account activity disregarded numerous red flags that Tucker was using the tribes to conceal his ownership of the accounts. For example, Tucker spent large sums of monies from accounts in the names of Tribal Companies on personal items, including tens of millions of dollars on a vacation home in Aspen and on Tucker\u2019s professional Ferrari racing team.U.S. Bancorp said on Thursday that it had put in place measure to improve its anti-money laundering controls.

The cause? Fears the economy was heating up, which would lead to a pickup in inflation and Federal Reserve raising rates faster than anticipated.But in the week since the S.&P. 500 has stage a comeback. The index is up 7.6 percent and on pace for best week since 2014, according to Bloomberg. In fact, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 2 percent the past two days despite the latest inflation data coming in much higher than expected.So what happened to those concerns about inflation? One explanation for why stock investors shrugged off the inflation data was a very weak report on retail sales. Investors seemed to take that as evidence the economy is not overheating and that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a very slow pace.Two weeks ago when the sell-off started, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow forecast for first-quarter G.D.P. fell to 3.25 percent from 5.4 percent two weeks ago.\u201cWhile it does appear that inflation is accelerating, it appears much less likely that the economy is really taking off and forcing the Fed into a more aggressive rate hiking cycle,\u201d write the strategists over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The bigger pictureA rising rate environment is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks. Jodie Gunzberg, the head of United States equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, points out that since 1971 the S&P 500:ProPublica\u2019s article centers on the bureau\u2019s handling of investigations into Wells Fargo. It reports that Mr. Mulvaney ordered restrictions on the accessing of personal data of Wells Fargo customers, a move that hampered the bureau\u2019s investigations. An exemption on the freeze was later granted to enforcement staff looking into Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance business. But ProPublica added:Mulvaney\u2019s order has had effects beyond enforcement, hampering the bureau\u2019s efforts to monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer protection rules and conduct research on financial products, according to several staffers. The freeze has even stymied state attorneys general, according to two C.F.P.B. staffers and one attorney for a state office.The tax overhaul requires funds to hold onto investments for three years to qualify for the lower rate. They\u2019ve been getting around it by creating single-member LLCs in Delaware to receive carried interest payouts.More from Miles Weiss of Bloomberg:Four LLCs have been created under the name of Elliott Management Corp., the hedge-fund giant run by Paul Singer. More than 70 have been established under the names of executives at Starwood Capital Group Management, the private-equity shop headed by Barry Sternlicht.The headline reason is his belief that Silicon Valley is too intolerant of conservatives and libertarians. But there\u2019s an interesting second reason in the article (emphasis added):The WSJ reports that Mr. Thiel will spend at least a bit more time working on a non-tech endeavor: a right-leaning media organization. He will still be involved in Founders Fund, the V.C. firm he co-founded, as well as stay on the boards of Facebook, the data consultancy Palantir and other tech companies.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cMy goal is to make it so the next generation grows up in a world where cancer is managed just like the common cold, and the body\u2019s natural regenerative engine remains empowered throughout our lives,\u201d said Dr. Hariri.Celgene, United Therapeutics, Sorrento Therapeutics, Human Longevity, the Dreyfus Family Office and Section 32 took part in the series-A funding.In other health care deal newsWhy? The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation report was higher than expected. But weaker retail sales tempered those fears \u2014 at least for equity investors.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeTo some, the bond market is a particularly prescient predictor of economic trends. So is it picking up on an inflationary surge that the Federal Reserve likely will take too long to recognize?But the overheating fears may be overdone. Yesterday\u2019s January inflation report was hardly conclusive. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that the January increase \u201cprobably overstates the underlying trend.\u201dStill, even though there are reasons to believe that while the U.S. economy is breaking out of its recent rut \u2014 thanks to big tax cuts and a revival of the global economy \u2014 it may not be as vibrant as it looks.The economic flyaroundNestl\u00e9 added that its future is likely to contain more deals in the several-hundred-million range of the Blue Bottle Coffee takeover. \u201cThe sweet spot is in small to mid-sized deals, but we don\u2019t want to rule out anything,\u201d its C.E.O., Mark Schneider, said.The deals flyaroundHe also offered this ambition: \u201cI want you to be able to take an Uber and get into the subway \u2014 if the trains are running on time, you\u2019ve got real-time data \u2014 get in the subway, get out and have an Uber waiting for you for right now. Or know that there\u2019s a bike right there for you that gets you where you\u2019re going in the fastest manner.\u201dWhether the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C. are the best venues for this type of regulation is something Congress will have to decide. Neither agency has experience in overseeing virtual currencies, so assigning responsibility to one (or both) will require increased appropriations to develop rules and effective oversight.\u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.

{"Headline": "What It Takes to Be a Whistle-Blower: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 What it takes to be a whistle-blower.\u2022 Broadcom whacks Qualcomm for raising its NXP bid.\u2022 Untangling the productivity mystery.\u2022 How Skadden got involved in the special counsel\u2019s Russia inquiry.Sigmund Freud is reputed to have said that \u201csometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\u201d The Supreme Court took that approach in deciding what is required to qualify for protection from retaliation as a whistle-blower.In Digital Realty Trust v. Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.\u2019s rule.The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: \u201cCourts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition\u2014tell the S.E.C.\u2014Congress imposed.\u201d By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers.One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don\u2019t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.\u2019s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation.\u2014 Peter J. HenningWhy?There didn\u2019t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish.Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday\u2019s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on.In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained.\u2014 Peter EavisBroadcom\u2019s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders. From the news release:Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS\u2019s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP\u2019s activist stockholders.Let\u2019s take a look at the math\u2022 Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price.\u2022 Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn\u2019t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year.The bet on the shareholder meetingBroadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm\u2019s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees.A Qualcomm representative didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe deals flyaroundLittle in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey\u2019s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cIf these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place.During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter.The tower would be the first major project under New York City\u2019s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area.Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software.Here\u2019s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor\u2019s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: \u201cWe are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.\u201dGlassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants.Skadden\u2019s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.The judge overseeing the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T\u2019s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not \u201cmade a credible showing\u201d that the White House had singled it out for retribution.The decision puts a crimp in AT&T\u2019s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal.AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list \u2014 but could call him during the trial if needed.The trial begins March 19.Symptom A: Albertsons buying Rite Aid to gain scale and enter the pharmacy businessSymptom B: Walmart\u2019s online sales growing just 23 percent in the fourth quarter, after it splashed out on Jet.com, Bonobos and more\u201cIt\u2019s the battle of the old generation versus the new generation,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. \u201cAnd right now the companies that are gaining share is the new generation.\u201dCritics\u2019 cornerElsewhere in Amazon newsFrom Peter Eavis:For the first time \u2014 and after much protest \u2014 public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of their C.E.O.s.

{"Headline": "California Today: How a Market Tumble Affects California", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.\u201cSell off!\u201d \u201cCrash!\u201d Investors bracing for \u201cuncertainty.\u201dIn an interview on Tuesday afternoon, Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, a professor of finance at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, put the market decline in context for the Golden State.Here are some things to keep in mind:The market\u2019s impact on capital gains \u2013 and the state budgetWhen the stock market goes down, the amount of money Californians who sell stock must pay in capital gains taxes also decreases. The state\u2019s tax code is very progressive, which, in this case, Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said, compounds the problem.California has one of the highest top tax brackets in the country, and the state relies heavily on those top earners to fill its coffers. (In 2014, the top 1 percent of earners paid 48 percent of all state income taxes in California, according to a 2016 article in the Economist.)\u201cSince the top 1 percent of Californians own a lot of stocks, a stock market decline that results in lower capital gains could have a disproportionately large impact on California \u2013 and its state budget,\u201d Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said.We have a lot of tech companies in California \u2013 and their stocks tend to feel the impact of market movement more acutelyTech companies like, say, Apple, tend to sell products known as \u201cconsumer durables\u201d \u2013 products like an iPhone that do not have to be bought frequently because they last for a long time. When people are feeling strapped, they tend to cut back on buying those types of products.Those companies tend to be \u201chigh beta,\u201d Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said, meaning that tech stocks move more than \u201cone for one\u201d with the stock market. Companies like Apple, she said, have a beta above one, meaning that a 10 percent drop in the market tends to be associated with a larger than 10 percent drop in their stock prices.\u201cThe industry composition of our businesses matters because some industries like tech are more affected by the underlying economic drivers of the stock market decline,\u201d Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said.The big pictureAll that said, Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen urged people to keep things in perspective.\u201cThe stock market has declined, but it\u2019s a pretty modest decline compared to how much the run up has been,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s now basically flat for this year, but it still went up a huge amount last year.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The year was 1968, and California-born Peggy Fleming took to the ice at the Stade de Glace in Grenoble, France \u2014 a 19-year-old with a shot at Olympic gold. Just a few years before, a plane crash had killed the entire American figure skating delegation, wiping out a generation of top skaters.\u201cHere they were, one after another\u2014the double loop, the double axel, the Wally jump, the ballet jump, another Wally, the flying camel and the double lutz,\u201d wrote our reporter. \u201cPeggy was nearing the end now\u2014her skates flowing onto the ice and there suddenly was the finale\u2014a half-toe loop, one-and-a-half toe loop, then a double-toe loop, perfectly conceived, perfectly executed.\u201dMs. Fleming took home the nation\u2019s only gold medal in that Olympics, and her victory became a global symbol of the resurgence of U.S. figure skating.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Works by Day, but It Loves the Night", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe daytime is for losers. Overnight is when the big money is made in the stock market \u2014 not by trading but by getting a good night\u2019s sleep.That\u2019s because of a gap between daytime and overnight returns in the American stock market. The real profits for investors have come when the market is closed for regular trading, according to a new stock market analysis by Bespoke Investment Group.The Bespoke data builds on the findings of academic researchers, who have documented the existence of the gap, without being able to entirely explain its cause.Simply put, the gap may be defined as the difference between stock returns during the hours the market is open, and the returns after regular daytime trading ends. How the gap is calculated may not be intuitively obvious, though.One set of returns is straightforward: It is based on prices at the start of trading in New York at 9:30 a.m. to the market close at 4 p.m. The second set is, essentially, the reverse: It is price returns from the 4 p.m. close to the market opening at 9:30 a.m. the following day.Because stock prices at the market open tend to be higher than the price at the previous day\u2019s close, you don\u2019t actually have to stay up all night and trade on an electronic network to rack up overnight gains. Simply holding shares while you sleep will do it. So for buy-and-hold investors, these findings are particularly encouraging: Get your rest, ignore the temptation to trade and you can do just fine.The SPY\u2019s overall price gain from its inception through January has been stupendous: 541 percent cumulatively, not counting dividends, Bespoke says.But look more closely, as Bespoke did, and a remarkable fact emerges.Separate the daytime and the after-hour returns and calculate them cumulatively, as Bespoke has done, and it turns out that all of that price gain since 1993 has come outside regular trading hours.If you had bought the SPY at the last second of trading on each business day since 1993 and sold at the market open the next day \u2014 capturing all of the net after-hour gains \u2014 your cumulative price gain would be 571 percent.On the other hand, if you had done the reverse, buying the E.T.F. at the first second of regular trading every morning at 9:30 a.m. and selling at the 4 p.m. close, you would be down 4.4 percent since 1993.One implication is immediate. \u201cForget about the news and the market ups and downs during the day,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. \u201cThey are nowhere close to what they are cracked up to be.\u201d In fact, he said, most people are better off if they just sit tight.Buying and holding the overall market \u2014 using an E.T.F. like the SPY, or a traditional index mutual fund, or a very diversified portfolio of stocks \u2014 has been an extremely profitable strategy if you stuck to it for the last 25 years. On the other hand, buying and selling during the day has generally been a money-losing strategy \u2014 one that would have been far more painful if you had traded frequently, incurring steep costs, which would have compounded your losses.That said, there are plenty of exceptions to these general statements.Many individuals and institutions have made tons of money through short-term trading during regular trading hours, even if investors over all have not. Furthermore, the steadily rising stock market in the 12 months through January has been better in the daytime than it has been historically \u2014 posting gains in the SPY during regular trading hours of 9.2 percent. Still, the overnight gains have been much better: 13.4 percent over the same period. The gap in returns has endured.One possibility, he said, is that frequent traders laboring under the \u201cillusion of control\u201d believe that they can respond easily to information and events during the day but can\u2019t do so as easily after hours, when there are far fewer market participants and less money, or \u201cliquidity,\u201d involved in trading. \u201cPeople may be inclined to sell at the market close so they can feel in control of their money overnight,\u201d he said.There is some evidence that smaller traders are prey to this tendency and tend to sell late in the day \u2014 and that some big institutional traders, who are well aware of the day-night gap, tend instead to buy at the close and sell at the open.Because relatively few people actually trade after the market closes, orders tend to build up overnight, and in a rising market, that will produce an upward price surge when the market opens. But during extended declines, overnight sell orders may cause prices to plummet when the market opens.If there were no trading costs \u2014 possible in a thought experiment but not in the real world \u2014 an excellent strategy over the last few decades would have been buying shares at the last possible moment during regular trading hours and selling them methodically at the opening bell every day, Professor Gulen of Purdue said.While transaction costs make that strategy uneconomical, he said, the concept may still have a certain value. \u201cIf you do know that you are going to make a trade on a given day, and you have the ability to choose when you do it, you might be able to take advantage of this pattern \u2014 buying late in the day and selling early.\u201d Of course, the pattern doesn\u2019t hold every single day, and you could easily be disappointed.His data shows that during the bear market year of 2008, the overall market, as represented by the SPY E.T.F., declined 36.8 percent. But most of the damage occurred during the day, with losses of 26.7 percent, compared with only 13.8 percent overnight.But further study needs to be done before the mystery of the day-night gap is unraveled, he said.In the meantime, Mr. Hickey said, \u201cIf you are tempted to day trade, this is another argument for not doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd trading after hours is in some ways, even riskier, because with fewer people in the market, prices can be erratic.\u201dSlow and steady investing generally avoids these problems. And over long periods, it has paid off. Frequent trading generally has not, either night or day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Reduce Shootings", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "\nIt has happened yet again: Inevitably, predictably, fatefully, a gunman shot dead 26 people in a Texas church on Sunday. These incidents are peculiarly American tragedies, and what\u2019s particularly heartbreaking is that they aren\u2019t shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the U.S. do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence.Two of the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history have occurred in the last six weeks. So let\u2019s not just mourn the dead, let\u2019s not just lower flags and make somber speeches. Let\u2019s also learn lessons from these tragedies, so that there can be fewer of them. In particular, I suggest that we try a new approach to reducing gun violence \u2013 a public health strategy.Guns per 100 peopleThe United States stands alone among developed countries: It has by far the highest rate of firearms ownership.88.8United States45.7switzerland31.6Sweden31.2france30.8canada30.3germany15.0Australia11.9italy10.4spain6.2England, wales0.6JapanGun murders per 100,000 peopleAmerica\u2019s private arsenal is six times as lethal as Canada\u2019s, and 30 times worse than Australia\u2019s.3.00United States0.7Italy0.5Canada0.3Sweden0.2Germany0.2Switzerland0.1Australia0.1England, Wales0.1france0.1Spain0JapanGuns per 100 peopleThe United States stands alone among developed countries: It has by far the highest rate of firearms ownership.88.8United States45.7switzerland31.6Sweden31.2france30.8canada30.3germany15.0Australia11.9italy10.4spain6.2England, wales0.6JapanGun murders per 100,000 peopleAmerica\u2019s private arsenal is six times as lethal as Canada\u2019s, and 30 times worse than Australia\u2019s.3.0United States0.7Italy0.5Canada0.3Sweden0.2Germany0.2Switzerland0.1Australia0.1England, Wales0.1france0.1Spain0JapanGun enthusiasts often protest: Cars kill about as many people as guns, and we don\u2019t ban them! No, but automobiles are actually a model for the public health approach I\u2019m suggesting.We don\u2019t ban cars, but we work hard to regulate them \u2013 and limit access to them \u2013 so as to reduce the death toll they cause. This has been spectacularly successful, reducing the death rate per 100 million miles driven by 95 percent since 1921.Take a look at the history of motor vehicle safety since World War II:Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.3581968  First federal safety standards for cars64201621.18\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910sDeaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.35First seatbelt offered in an American carFirst federal safety standards for cars81974  55 m.p.h. national speed limit1993  Car safety ratings introduced61978  Tennessee is first to require child safety seats1999  Airbags, invented in 1951, become mandatory1984  4New York is first to require seat belt use2000  Mandatory reporting of defects by carmakers201621.18\u201946\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s2000s\u201910s\u201916Frankly, liberal opposition to guns has often been ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive. The 10-year ban on assault weapons accomplished little, partly because definitions were about cosmetic features like bayonet mounts (and partly because even before the ban, such guns were used in only 2 percent of crimes).The left sometimes focuses on \u201cgun control,\u201d which scares off gun owners and leads to more gun sales. A better framing is \u201cgun safety\u201d or \u201creducing gun violence,\u201d and using auto safety as a model\u2014constant efforts to make the products safer and to limit access by people who are most likely to misuse them.What would a public health approach look like for guns if it were modeled after cars? It would include:If someone steals my iPhone, it\u2019s useless, and the same should be true of guns. Gun manufacturers made child-proof guns back in the 19th century (before dropping them), and it\u2019s time to advance that technology today. Some combination of smart guns and safe storage would also reduce the number of firearms stolen in the U.S. each year, now about 200,000, and available to criminals.We also need to figure out whether gun buybacks, often conducted by police departments, are cost-effective and help reduce violence. And we can experiment more with anti-gang initiatives, such as Cure Violence, that have a good record in reducing shootings.In Texas on Sunday, it seems that a man living near the church grabbed his gun and confronted the shooter after he left the church. It may be that this defensive use of a weapon saved lives, and the N.R.A. often hails this view that guns are necessary to counter gun violence.But really? Can anybody possibly see what unfolded in Texas as a success of gun policy?Percent of Households With Guns,by StateHawaiiMass.U.S. AVERAGE: 32% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE GUNS R.I.N.J.N.Y.Del.Conn.Ill.Calif.Fla.Md.Wash.N.H.Ind.OhioCo.Pa.IowaMinn.Ariz.Nev.N.D.Mich.Va.Ore.N.M.N.C.Tex.S.C.Neb.Kan.Ga.Mo.Okla.Wisc.La.Ky.UtahAla.MaineTenn.S.D.W.

Yet remember that although it is mass shootings that get our attention, they are not the main cause of loss of life. Much more typical is a friend who shoots another, a husband who kills his wife \u2013 or, most common of all, a man who kills himself. Skeptics will say that if people want to kill themselves, there\u2019s nothing we can do. In fact, it turns out that if you make suicide a bit more difficult, suicide rates drop.Here are the figures showing that mass shootings are a modest share of the total, and the same is true of self-defense \u2013 despite what the N.R.A. might have you believe.OTHER CAUSESDEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456VICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:OTHER CAUSESVICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589DEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:Yet while we should be moving toward sensible regulation, in fact we\u2019ve been moving in the opposite direction.

In 1995, Connecticut tightened licensing laws, while in 2007 Missouri  eased gun laws.The upshot? After tightening gun laws, firearm homicide rates dropped 40 percent in Connecticut. And after Missouri eased gun laws, gun homicide rates rose 25 percent.Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsEstimated change in\u201340%Estimated change in\u201315%Missouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change in+25%Estimated change in+16%Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsMissouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change inrate of gun homicide\u201340%+25%Estimated change inrate of gun suicide\u201315%+16%One of the lessons of gun research is that we often focus just on firearms themselves, when it may be more productive to focus on who gets access to them. A car or gun is usually safe in the hands of a 45-year-old woman with no criminal record, but may be dangerous when used by a 19-year-old felon with a history of alcohol offenses or domestic violence protection orders.Yet our laws have often focused more on weapons themselves (such as the assault weapons ban) rather than on access. In many places, there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms.In these two states, the laws affected access, and although there\u2019s some indication that other factors were also involved in Connecticut (and correlations don\u2019t prove causation), the outcomes are worth pondering.There\u2019s simply a scandalous lack of research on gun violence, largely because the N.R.A. is extremely hostile to such research and Congress rolls over. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did try to research gun violence, Congress responded by cutting its funding.Here is the American toll from four diseases and firearms over the years 1973-2012 \u2013 and the number of National Institutes of Health research grants to explore each problem over that same time.N.I.H. research awardsDiseaseNumber of casesRabies6556Polio266212Cholera400129Diphtheria1,33789Firearmsinjuries3>4 millionNumberof casesDiseaseN.I.H. research awardsRabies6589Polio266129Cholera400212Diphtheria1,33756Firearm Injuries3>4 millionOne approach that could reduce the abuse of guns is better training. As a 13-year-old farm boy in Oregon, I attended a N.R.A. gun safety class (which came with a one-year membership to the N.R.A., making me an N.R.A. alum who despises what that organization has become). These classes can be very useful, and audits found that more than 80 percent cover such matters as checking the gun to see if it\u2019s loaded, keeping one\u2019s finger off the trigger until ready to fire and being certain of the target.Yet the audits also suggest that trainers are more likely to advocate for the N.R.A. or for carrying guns than for, say, safe storage. This is a missed opportunity, for all classes should cover the risks of guns and alcohol, the risks of abuse with suicide and domestic violence, the need for safe storage, and so on. Here\u2019s what researchers found that the gun classes they audited actually covered:NOTDISCUSSEDPERCENT OF CLASSESWHERE DISCUSSEDTrainers encouragedgun carrying81%19Encouragedgun ownership7624Prevent unsupervisedaccess by children7030Encouraged gun usefor self-defense69316040Ricochet6040Theft preventionEncouraged membershipin gun-rights group5644Legal ramifications ofshooting in self-defense55455347Child access lawsRecommendation: whennot in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: usegun only as last resort4555Young childrenand gun accidents55457030Decision-making in crisesTheft is important sourceof firearms used in crime8020Techniques forde-escalating threats8515Recommendation:report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicidein household members90109010Domestic violence riskTopic discussedPercent of classes where discussedNot discussedTrainers encouraged gun carrying1981%Encouraged gun ownership2476Prevent unsupervised access by children3070Encouraged gun use for self-defense3169Ricochet4060Theft prevention4060Encouraged membership in gun-rights group4456Legal ramifications of shooting in self-defense4555Child access laws4753Recommendation: when not in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: use gun only as last resort5545Young children and gun accidents5545Decision-making in crises7030Theft is an important source of firearms used in crime8020Techniques for de-escalating threats8515Recommendation: report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicide in household members9010Domestic violence risk9010It may sometimes seem hopeless to make progress on gun violence, especially with the N.R.A. seemingly holding Congress hostage. But I\u2019m more optimistic.Look, we all agree on some kinds of curbs on guns. Nobody believes that people should be able to drive a tank down Main Street, or have an anti-aircraft gun in the backyard. I\u2019ve been to parts of northern Yemen where one could actually buy a tank or an anti-aircraft gun, as well as fully automatic weapons \u2014 and that area\u2019s now embroiled in a civil war \u2013 but fortunately in America we have agreed to ban those kinds of weaponry.So the question isn\u2019t whether we will restrict firearms, but where to draw the line and precisely which ones to restrict.Check out these polling numbers as a basis for action on gun safety:Agree with the following:Householdswith no gunsGun households50%Background checksfor all gun buyers93%96%Preventing mentally ill from buying guns8989Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289Ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines(10+ bullets)*5277Householdswith no gunsGun householdsAgree with the following:50%93%Background checks for all gun buyers96%89Preventing the mentally ill from buying guns89Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289A ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines (10+ bullets)*5277Looking ahead, I\u2019m optimistic that there can be progress at the state level, and some of the necessary research funding will come from private foundations. Maybe some police departments will put in orders for smart guns to help create a market.But the real impetus for change will come because the public favors it. In particular, note that 93 percent of people even in gun households favor universal background checks for gun purchases.The terrible truth is that Wednesday\u2019s school shooting was 100 percent predictable. So is the next one. After each such incident, we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims, but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability.Some of you will protest (as President Trump did the last time) that it\u2019s too soon to talk about guns, or that it is disrespectful to the dead to use such a tragedy to score political points. Yet more Americans have died from gun violence, including suicides, since 1970 (about 1.4 million) than in all the wars in American history going back to the Revolutionary War (about 1.3 million). And it\u2019s not just gang members: In a typical year, more preschoolers are shot dead in America (about 75) than police officers are.Yes, making America safer will be hard: There are no perfect solutions. The Second Amendment is one constraint, and so is our polarized political system and the power of the gun lobby. There\u2019s a lot of talk about banning assault weapons, for example, but the 10-year assault weapons ban didn\u2019t accomplish much for reducing gun violence, partly because defining assault weapons proved to be much more complex than anybody had anticipated (in the end, the definition depended partly on cosmetic features). And new restrictions have limited effectiveness because we have delayed so long that there are already so many guns out there. So it\u2019s unclear how effective some of my suggestions will be, and in any case this will be a long, uncertain, uphill process.But automobiles are a reminder that we can chip away at a large problem through a public health approach: Just as auto safety improvements have left us far better off, it seems plausible to some gun policy experts that a sensible, politically feasible set of public health steps could over time reduce firearm deaths in America by one-third \u2014 or more than 10,000 lives saved each year.So let\u2019s not just shed tears for the dead, give somber speeches and lower flags. Let\u2019s get started and save lives. Let\u2019s not accept that school classrooms can turn any moment into war zones.Advertisement"}

One is that mandatory spending on things like Social Security and Medicare keeps rising as a percentage of overall spending. Last I checked, it amounted to more than half of federal outlays, if you take Medicare to stand for mandatory health care spending generally. So the programs you mentioned are inevitably going to be on the endangered list, especially in an administration that wants to spend more of its discretionary dollars on defense. As I do.Anyway, my second point is that if liberals want to preserve those programs, they need to start acting more like a normal political opposition and less like \u201cthe resistance.\u201d We hear too much from Democrats about how awful the president is, as if he doesn\u2019t do a fine job by himself of proving the same point.

Rising wages are good for those who receive them, and for the presidents who seek to stimulate them, but investors see them as a sign of possible inflation and higher interest rates.

The core index, which excludes food and energy, also came in above forecasts, prompting Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan, to describe it as \u201chotter than Hades.\u201dWhile the stock market shrugged off the jump in inflation, bond markets got a bit of a jolt. The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note rose above 2.9 percent on Wednesday, well above the 2.4 percent at which it finished last year.Indeed, the index overshot expectations because two items \u2014 clothing and medical services \u2014 had very strong increases, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. Clothing was due for a big rebound because it seemed to lag a lot in recent months, Pantheon asserted. As for medical services, the jump there came from hospital costs, which Pantheon described as \u201cvery erratic.\u201dThe analysts at Hoisington Investment Management have in recent years highlighted stubborn weaknesses in the United States economy, and the firm still sees significant problems.

{"Headline": "One Cause of Market Turbulence: Computer-Driven Index Funds", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA decade ago, the center of gravity on Wall Street were raucous trading desks and stock exchange floors. These days, the locus has shifted to far quieter places, where computers are in charge.The transition has been years in the making, but its effect has been on full display over the past week. After propelling the market to historic highs, passive investment strategies \u2014 which follow a simple set of rules and are carried out by sophisticated computer programs, not humans \u2014 are among the factors fueling the market\u2019s recent plunge.This is the new reality of today\u2019s stock market: Funds that track financial indexes have become a dominant force, and they can act as accelerants, adding momentum to the market\u2019s rise and fall.This week, as markets shuddered, exchange-traded index funds were responsible for 38 percent of total stock trading on some days, an astonishing figure given that these funds were just a curiosity 10 years ago. Indexing giants like BlackRock and Vanguard now own vast swaths of the market and are the largest shareholders in just about all the major companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.In many ways, this stampede toward passive investing \u2014 in which people put their money into funds that track indexes and broader market themes as opposed to relying on human stock pickers \u2014 is uncharted territory. Now the key question is how this transformed market holds up during a financial storm that lasts more than a few days.\u201cThese flows have had a big effect on the market,\u201d said Peter Tchir, a strategist at Academy Securities. \u201cAnd when people want to get out, there is a similar effect.\u201dCheaply priced exchange-traded and index funds have pumped trillions of dollars into the stock market since early 2009. They now own close to 40 percent of stocks in the United States, according to research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Unlike mutual funds, E.T.F.s are listed on public exchanges, which makes many of them very easy to trade even if the securities they hold may not be. On Thursday, for example, the second most actively traded security in the equity market was a BlackRock fund that invests in large companies in emerging markets.There was a lot to keep an eye on.BlackRock, which manages $6 trillion overall, is the leading issuer of exchange-traded funds, with $1.3 trillion under management. But as the market fell and trading in BlackRock funds accelerated, there was little sign of panic or emotion among the E.T.F. specialists at the firm.They fielded phone calls from clients and let the computers do their work.Martin Small, who oversees United States-based E.T.F.s at the firm, said the high share of E.T.F. trading was positive for the markets. That is because on days when fearful investors want to sell, large, easy-to-trade E.T.F.s serve as a critical release valve.\u201cEverything worked,\u201d Mr. Small said. \u201cVolumes were higher and more people were watching, but our funds did what they were supposed to do.\u201dInvesting on the basis of what machines, as opposed to humans, do has been a trend in financial markets for years. What\u2019s different now is that so much money has poured into a specific type of computer-driven trading.From cost-conscious millennials to the world\u2019s largest pension and sovereign wealth funds, E.T.F.s have become a preferred investment choice. In addition to all the major stock and bond indexes, they enable investors to get a piece of the action in arcane areas like junk bonds, bank loans and stocks in Pakistan. There is even an E.T.F. that tracks companies that make whiskey.The popularity of E.T.F.s has concentrated unparalleled financial power in BlackRock and Vanguard, the two biggest providers of index funds and E.T.F.s. Together, they sit on $10.5 trillion in assets and control 65 percent of the 1,700 exchange-traded funds that exist.Relying on sophisticated computer programs, they funnel investor money into the stocks and bonds that make up indexes around the world. As the flows have grown in volume, much of these funds have gone toward index heavyweights like Amazon, Apple and Facebook, pushing their valuations ever higher.Active fund managers \u2014 human stock pickers \u2014 will be marginalized, the argument goes. And that could cause harm, because they are the ones who buy when others sell. So when stocks suddenly plummet, there will be fewer funds to step in, extending the fall.An analyst at Sanford C.

{"Headline": "How Inflation Works (or Why Your Chicken Is Going to Cost More)", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "Advertisement\nIt\u2019s the worrisome byproduct of a healthy economy: inflation.After the global financial crisis, the world sank into one of the deepest recessions since the Great Depression. And for most of the last decade, it has been in an economic funk, characterized by low levels of growth and piddling price increases.To get their economies out of that rut, central banks helped push interest rates sharply lower. The goal was to bolster investment and growth. And now it appears that the world economy is finally starting to generate real momentum.The United States has been ahead of the pack, having started its somewhat sluggish recovery in the second quarter of 2009.As the economy gains momentum, companies and business buy more. Metal tubes. Industrial hose. Accounting and legal services. Steel. Wireless internet. Tires. Printer toner.And amid the Amazonification of American retail, cardboard boxes. Lots of cardboard boxes.\u201cClearly demand is strong,\u201d Thomas A. Hassfurther, head of the corrugated products division at the Packaging Corporation of America, said on a conference call with analysts.  \u201cWe're in a phase now where the box business is tracking the G.D.P. a lot closer than it had been.\u201dTo make more boxes, his company needs more of the material that goes into them, like raw cardboard fiber and chemicals. And it is paying higher prices for both. \u201cWe're competing with everybody for that same shortage of labor and equipment,\u201d Mr. Hassfurther said.Trucks deliver the raw ingredients and trucks deliver the final goods. But there is a limited supply of trucks.Basic economic theory then kicks in. When demand goes up and supply holds steady, prices should rise. Essentially, companies that need things shipped are willing to pay more to get them delivered.Sure enough, so-called spot rates for freight \u2014 the price for deliveries not covered by longer-term contracts \u2014 rose by more than 20 percent last year.Those rates aren\u2019t likely to fall anytime soon. While trucking companies are ordering more vehicles for their fleets, it will take time for those rigs to be ready. And even when they are, an acute shortage of drivers could limit the number of vehicles deployed.\u201cIf you buy more trucks, the challenge is finding enough drivers to put in those trucks,\u201d said Bob Costello, the chief economist of the American Trucking Associations.When trucking companies need more employees, they simply offer more money. In recent months, hourly wages for truckers moved steadily higher. In the fall, their annual growth rate exceeded 4 percent, the fastest pace seen since late 2013.When Eduardo Andrade looked at one of his paystubs in the fall, the trucker thought his boss might have made a mistake. His check from Baylor Trucking, a family business based in rural Indiana, showed that he was earning 52 cents per mile, up from the 48 cents he had been making. He often drives for three straight weeks, moving food and garments from the East Coast to the Midwest and then hauling insulation materials back. The raise will fatten his paycheck by $6,000 per year, if he maintains his regular mileage.\u201cThis is the biggest increase I have ever had with the company,\u201d said Mr. Andrade, who has driven for Baylor for a decade. The 60-year-old has seven grandchildren and plans to spend his extra cash to buy them more movie tickets, clothes and pizza dinners.Those higher wages have to be paid for \u2014 and it\u2019s usually trucking customers that end up footing the bill.For example, during the third quarter, packaged food companies, which need lots of trucks to ship their products, saw their margins shrink by 0.8 percentage points. They attributed the trend, in part, to rising freight costs.\u201cAll my companies are talking about it,\u201d said Robert B. Moskow, an analyst who researches companies in the food industry for Credit Suisse.Corporations are in the business of making as much money as possible, and they generally aren\u2019t inclined to simply accept thinner profit margins.They have a couple of options. They can try to reduce costs in other parts of their businesses. Or they can try to charge more for their products.Tyson Foods, the giant meat and chicken company, recently told analysts that it planned to increase prices to offset rising freight costs. Tom Hayes, Tyson\u2019s chief executive, estimated that rising freight prices would cost the company more than $200 million this year. \u201cUltimately, the consumer is going to pay for it at some point,\u201d Mr. Hayes said.By itself, a 3-cent price increase for a pound of chicken isn\u2019t significant. But recent signs suggest that prices are edging higher for a range of products, like oil and gasoline, clothing, car insurance and medical care.And if other industries follow suit, it would mean that the United States \u2014 and likely the world \u2014 is finally shifting into a higher economic gear after over a decade of sputtering.Illustrations by Pete RyanAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Era of Easy Money Is Ending, and the World Is Bracing for Shocks", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe worst that could happen, the money masters averred, was that investors would be lulled into reckless investments, taking on too much risk in the belief that the dangers of the marketplace had been tamed.As it turns out, the dangers were already at work. A decade-long era of easy access to money engineered by central banks in Asia, Europe and the United States was ending, opening a new chapter in which corporations would have to pay more to borrow and ordinary people would have to pay more to finance homes, cars and other purchases.To digest the wild swings in stocks and bonds from New York to London to Tokyo is to absorb this uncomfortable realization taking hold.Investors concluded that interest rates would rise faster than they had anticipated, almost certainly in the United States, and perhaps eventually in Europe and Asia, too. They yanked their treasure out of stocks and entrusted it to safer repositories of wealth like bonds and cash.No degree in finance was required to divine the lesson of the moment: Markets go down as well as up, a reality often drowned out by the euphoric celebrations to greet one record or another being shattered.While trading in the United States was clearly the initial source of alarm, the concerns spread to everywhere that money changes hands. The American economy had swapped the frivolity of a stock market party for the grim trappings of a bedside vigil. The result was gloom and anxiety in every reach of the financial sphere.\u201cThe United States is by some distance the largest market on earth,\u201d said Gaurav Saroliya, director of global macro strategy at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cGrowth in the United States has a huge bearing on economies everywhere. If the largest market is selling off, that has a very powerful effect on investment sentiment. It makes people risk averse.\u201dThe fear that seized the United States was the spawn of good times. As the feeling sank in that stock trading was governed by a surplus of exuberance, the odds increased that the Federal Reserve would dampen the festivities by lifting interest rates faster than policymakers had previously telegraphed.Not for nothing, central banks are seen by investors as crucial yet fun-averse grown-ups charged with solemnly watching for trouble. When crises emerge, they make money available to spur commerce while keeping terror at bay. The global economic expansion underway now is in large part a product of the Fed\u2019s swiftly unleashing an overwhelming surge of credit after the start of the financial crisis in 2008, combined with the slower yet, eventually, effective torrent of cash delivered by the European Central Bank.But when the party gets raging \u2014 when economies accelerate and stock prices ascend to levels out of whack with fundamentals \u2014 central bankers play killjoy, lifting interest rates to snuff out attendant dangers.Higher rates diminish speculation that can end badly by making credit more expensive. They slow economic growth while making stocks less appealing, because corporations must pay more to keep up with their debts. Investors can make more just by keeping their holdings in cash or bonds, rather than by accepting the higher risk of stocks.Then, last Friday, the latest monthly snapshot of the American labor market revealed that wages had climbed 2.9 percent in January compared with a year earlier. The tight job market was forcing employers to pay more.This appeared to presage a strengthening of American consumer power. If more working people take home more money, they will presumably be more inclined to buy houses and cars, generating jobs in construction and at auto plants from Michigan to South Carolina. They will fill restaurants, necessitating more truck drivers to ferry the food, and more mechanics to keep the trucks running.This same so-called virtuous cycle appeared to be amplifying global growth. More cars made in the United States would require more brake linings made in Mexico and more circuitry forged in China, using copper mined in Chile. More construction would require equipment from Germany and Japan, and more iron ore from Brazil to make steel.This interconnectivity has been central to the anticipation that a strengthening economy in the United States would lift fortunes around the world.But the increase in wages for American workers meant something else. It was a flashing warning to investors about potential inflation, or rising prices, which have crippled many economies. The Fed, always vigilant, wields a standard tool for snuffing out inflation if necessary: higher interest rates.This is how a positive jobs report, presumably a sign of a strengthening American economy, wound up as the impetus for the dumping of stocks from Taipei to Toronto. It enhanced the likelihood that the Fed would raise rates faster. It prompted investors to wonder how long the European Central Bank could maintain its own ultralow rates.In the past year, Europe has shaken off perpetual worries of a grinding decline to emerge as one of the faster-growing major economies on earth. Inflation remains weak in Europe, undergirding expectations that the central bank will be slow to take back its free money.But if the Fed were to lift rates faster, that could prompt Europe and perhaps even Japan to follow suit. Otherwise, the United States would be in a position to capture an outsize share of global investment, as rates presumably rise on American government bonds.Mario Draghi, the Italian who heads the European Central Bank, is scheduled to complete his eight-year term late next year. At the Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s term as governor expires in April, and there is uncertainty over whether he will be reappointed.Some economists think that the dour talk is overblown and that the stock markets are running on emotion untethered from economic reality, a narrative that gained force as markets in New York snapped back from the depths on Tuesday.The fundamentals of the United States expansion remain intact. Rising wages should indeed give people money to spend without resorting to some newfangled credit bubble that ends tragically.Whatever the interest rates, central banks retain trillions of dollars on their balance sheets earmarked for buying up financial assets, making credit available. And the return to higher interest rates is inevitable, a healthy turn for a world economy that can finally close the books on the global financial crisis that began a decade ago.\u201cWe have gotten used to this low interest rate environment,\u201d said Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at SEB, a global investment bank based in Stockholm. \u201cThis is not the normal situation.\u201dThe global economic expansion has occasioned hopeful talk that the world now has multiple engines of growth, inoculating it against trouble in any single region. But the events of recent days have challenged that notion, given that a sudden deterioration of stock prices on Wall Street quickly burst into a global rout.Sentiments are clearly a viral phenomenon. Yet the distress in global markets also underscores the fact that real economic fortunes are fused.If General Electric, Ford and other multinational companies see their share prices brought down as borrowing costs climb, they could limit plans for expansion. The trend would be felt in diminished orders for computer chips made in Taiwan, flat-panel displays forged in South Korea and auto parts built in the Czech Republic. It could cool demand for raw materials harvested from Argentina to India to South Africa.\u201cBusiness cycles across different markets are more correlated than they have ever been,\u201d said Mr. Saroliya, of Oxford Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s the global supply chain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toilet Paper Shortage Strikes Taiwan Amid Pricing Panic", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Across Taiwan\u2019s major cities, consumers are in a near panic over a shortage of one of modern life\u2019s basic necessities: toilet paper.From Taipei in the north to Tainan in the south, retailers are having difficulty keeping it on their shelves, as reports of imminent price increases have sent consumers rushing to stores to stock up on the household staple, which in Taiwan is sold folded in packs rather than as rolls.In Taipei\u2019s Da\u2019an district on Tuesday, PX Mart\u2019s paper products section was down to its last few small packages of toilet paper; all the bulk packs were sold out. Around the corner, the situation was just as desperate at a normally well-stocked 7-Eleven convenience store, where an employee said stocks disappeared as soon as they were replenished. The rush on toilet paper was a top story for local newspapers stacked next to the cash register.Things weren\u2019t much different in the virtual world.The price increases stem in part from supply disruptions in short-fiber pulp after forest fires in Canada and production problems in Brazil.The ministry statement said that the price of pulp accounts for nearly half the cost of toilet paper in Taiwan, which has little in the way of its own resources to produce paper for the bathroom or otherwise.It also encouraged Taiwanese consumers to choose toilet paper with recycled content, noting that in Taiwan only 5 percent of the toilet paper and tissues comes from recycled paper, compared with 65 percent in neighboring Japan and more than half in the United States and Europe.While acknowledging that local producers are particularly sensitive to shifts in international pulp prices, the ministry also said it would watch the situation on behalf of consumers to guard against price gouging.\u201cIf we discover any abnormal movements in market prices or that companies are working together to unfairly drive up prices,\u201d it will ask the Fair Trade Commission to investigate, the ministry said.The run on toilet paper highlights the high price sensitivity of the Taiwanese market, where wages have stagnated for years while housing prices have gone up. President Tsai Ing-wen has made increasing wages a central goal for her administration this year.The stock prices of both YFY Inc. and Cheng Loong Corporation declined on Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bitcoin Thieves Threaten Real Violence for Virtual Currencies", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The currency they were after was virtual, but the guns they carried were anything but.In the beach resort of Phuket, Thailand, last month, the assailants pushed their victim, a young Russian man, into his apartment and kept him there, blindfolded, until he logged onto his computer and transferred about $100,000 worth of Bitcoin to an online wallet they controlled.A few weeks before that, the head of a Bitcoin exchange in Ukraine was taken hostage and only released after the company paid a ransom of $1 million in Bitcoin.In New York City, a man was held captive by a friend until he transferred over $1.8 million worth of Ether, a virtual currency second in value only to Bitcoin.The rich have always feared robbery and extortion. Now, big holders of Bitcoin and its brethren have become alluring marks for criminals, especially since the prices of virtual currencies entered the stratosphere last year.Virtual currencies can be easily transferred to an anonymous address set up by a criminal. While banks can stop or reverse large electronic transactions made under duress, there is no Bitcoin bank to halt or take back a transfer, making the chances of a successful armed holdup frighteningly enticing.Thieves have taken advantage of this system in a startling number of recent cases, from Russia, Ukraine and Turkey to Canada, the United States and Britain.\u201cThis is now becoming more pervasive and touching more law enforcement divisions that deal with organized crime and violent crime on a local level,\u201d said Jonathan Levin, the founder of Chainalysis, which has worked with several law enforcement agencies on virtual currency crimes.Mr. Levin\u2019s company specializes in tracking criminal transactions on the blockchain, the computerized ledger where every Bitcoin transaction is publicly recorded.Chainalysis has helped police attempt to track down criminals in several recent cases, including some that have not been made public, according to Mr. Levin.But even when a transaction can be tracked, the design of Bitcoin means that criminals do not have to associate their identity with their Bitcoin address \u2014 as is necessary with most traditional bank accounts. That has stymied police in several cases.\u201cFor this, the advantage of Bitcoin is that it\u2019s hard to verify,\u201d said Chanut Hongsitthichaikul, an investigator with the Chalong Police Station, which investigated the case in Phuket. \u201cWe asked the victim how to track it since they know Bitcoin better than us. We asked them how to check the receiver. They said there is no way. It is hard to do.\u201dThe Thai police tracked the victim\u2019s laptop, which was also stolen, to Kuala Lumpur. That\u2019s where the trail went cold.But criminals have grown much more brazen as the price of Bitcoin has spiked.A spokeswoman for Exmo said the money came from Mr. Lerner\u2019s personal funds. Mr. Lerner was on leave from the company but would return.Many big virtual currency holders privately say that they will no longer travel to Russia, Turkey or other countries where they assume that attacks may be easier to pull off because of organized crime.In a number of cases, the assailants have been caught \u2014 and forced to return money \u2014 because of video footage. In other cases, the criminals are still at large.The unsolved crimes have sown fear among the ranks of the so-called crypto rich, which have grown considerably over the past year.At a conference for about 170 leaders in the virtual currency industry this month, there was a panel discussion about how to deal with the threat of robbery, extortion and kidnappings in which the criminals seek Bitcoin or other virtual currencies.Organizers of the conference, known as the Satoshi Roundtable and held near Cancun, Mexico, brought in a security force and instituted significant privacy measures for guests to protect them from criminals while they were in attendance.During the group discussion at the conference, attendees talked about having a \u201cduress wallet\u201d at home that can be handed over to throw an assailant off the trail of a bigger fortune, as well as several other security measures that can be used to deal with the threat.Most of the crypto rich are loath to speak publicly about the risk of physical attacks, for fear of making themselves targets.But Jameson Lopp, a longtime Bitcoin engineer and virtual currency holder, said the community should be proactive in confronting the threat, to let criminals know that people are taking steps to protect themselves.Last summer, someone called a SWAT team to Mr. Lopp\u2019s house to harass him.

{"Headline": "Has Trumphoria Finally Hit a Wall?", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen talking about stock markets, there are three rules you have to remember. First, the stock market is not the economy. Second, the stock market is not the economy. Third, the stock market is not the economy.So the market plunge of the past few days might mean nothing at all.And on the other side, don\u2019t assume that the stock price decline tells us much about the economic future, either. The great economist Paul Samuelson famously quipped that the stock market had predicted nine of the past five recessions. That 1987 crash, for example, was followed not by a recession, but by solid growth.Still, market turmoil should make us take a hard look at the economy\u2019s prospects. And what the data say, I\u2019d argue, is that at the very least America is heading for a downshift in its growth rate; the available evidence suggests that growth over the next decade will be something like 1.5 percent a year, not the 3 percent Donald Trump and his minions keep promising.There are also suggestions in the data that risky assets in general \u2014 stocks, but also long-term bonds and real estate \u2014 may be overpriced. Leaving Bitcoin madness aside, we\u2019re not talking dot-coms in 2000 or houses in 2006. But standard indicators are well above historically normal levels, and a reversion toward those norms could be painful.About that plummet: If there was any news item behind it, it was Friday\u2019s employment report, which showed a significant although not huge rise in wages. Now, rising wages are a good thing. In fact, the failure of wages to rise much until now has been a deeply frustrating deficiency in the otherwise impressively durable economic recovery that began early in the Obama administration.Again, this is all good news. But it does mean that future U.S. growth can\u2019t come from putting the unemployed back to work. It has to come either from growth in the pool of potential workers or from rising productivity, that is, more output per worker.Did the markets believe Trump? At the very least, they\u2019ve been acting as if the U.S. economy still had lots of room to run; throwing cold water on that belief should mean both higher interest rates and lower stock prices, which is what we\u2019re seeing.But should we be worried about something worse than a mere downshift in growth?Individually, these numbers aren\u2019t that alarming: Stocks, as I said, don\u2019t look nearly as overvalued as they did in 2000, housing not nearly as overvalued as it was in 2006. On the other hand, this time both markets look overvalued at the same time, at least raising the possibility of a double-bubble burst like the one that hit Japan at the end of the 1980s.Still, all of this would be manageable if key policymakers could be counted on to act effectively. Which is where I get worried.It\u2019s surely not a good thing that Trump got rid of one of the most distinguished Federal Reserve chairs in history just before markets started to flash some warning signs. Jerome Powell, Janet Yellen\u2019s replacement, seems like a reasonable guy. But we have no idea how well he would handle a crisis if one developed.So are we heading for trouble? Too soon to tell. But if we are, rest assured that we\u2019ll have the worst possible people on the case.Advertisement"}

The car, thought to be one of just 17 surviving examples of the model, sold for far less than the presale estimate of \u20ac175,000.\u201cThe market has gone down. It\u2019s flat,\u201d said Mr. Celada, who owns a dozen classic cars and who regularly participates in historic rallies.Mr. Celada said that his collecting field had attracted \u201ca lot of people who didn\u2019t know about cars who were just interested in investment.\u201d They now appeared to be less active, he said, leaving the market once again to specialists like him.RM Sotheby\u2019s 84-lot sale was the first of three major classic car auctions held during the week. Bonhams followed with 228 lots on Thursday, and the Paris auctioneers Artcurial with 250 lots on Friday.At RM Sotheby\u2019s, only two of the five lots estimated to sell for more than \u20ac2 million managed to find buyers.The evening was topped by a 2017 Bugatti Chiron, which sold to a telephone bidder for \u20ac3.3 million with fees, just above the low estimate. With an electronically limited top speed of 260 miles per hour, this road car \u2014 one of the first 20 of the 500 Chirons manufactured \u2014 bucked new models\u2019 reputation for value depreciation: Last year\u2019s list price was \u20ac2.4 million.The Paris auctions posted an aggregate \u20ac70.9 million, down from the \u20ac86 million achieved at the equivalent auctions in 2015.Mr. Hage, 29, entered a grime-encrusted 1965 Porsche 912 into the RM Sotheby\u2019s sale. Regardless of the state of the market, an untouched \u201cbarn find\u201d usually creates a stir at auction. It proved to be one of the few lots to sell over estimate at RM Sotheby\u2019s, reaching \u20ac92,000 with fees against an upper valuation of \u20ac70,000.In the absence of the rarest 1960s Ferraris, the Bugatti marque captured the top prices at all three auctions. At Bonhams, a 1935 3.3-liter Bugatti Type 57 Torpedo Tourist Trophy that Earl Howe raced in the Ulster TT sold for \u20ac713,000. The following day, Artcurial took \u20ac2.9 million for a 1938 Type 57C Atalante coupe. Both prices were below presale expectations. Artcurial had by far the biggest-grossing sale, with \u20ac31.8 million, but it offered more vehicles than either of its competitors.These auctions of automotive classics are increasingly being bulked up with modern cars. The many Porsche 911 variants are the most obvious example, representing for some collectors a more affordable, more dependable investment than a 1930s Bugatti or a 1960s Ferrari.\u201cPorsches are good for a timid buyer. They keep working,\u201d Nick Bartman, a British collector, said at the Bonhams auction, where a 1973 Porsche 911 S 2.4-liter Targa sold for a low estimate of \u20ac145,833.Mr. Bartman, 63, said that the investment value of older cars could be undermined by mechanical failure. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for 5 or 10 percent, you don\u2019t want the gearbox to go,\u201d he said. \u201cSpares are expensive.\u201d\u201cWe had three fantastic years when everyone was talking about investment and cars performing better than stocks,\u201d said Mr. Aaldering, 37. \u201cNow we\u2019re back to a normal kind of classic car business. I\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cCars have to be top quality, with a clean history, good documentation and certification, and the right price,\u201d Mr. Aaldering said, adding that two years ago his Ferrari Spyder would have been tagged at \u20ac1.9 million.But will wealthy collectors want to keep buying gas-guzzling sportsters when everyone else is zipping around in self-driving electric cars?Mr. Aaldering said he thought that there would still be a market in 20 years\u2019 time for the rarest and most prestigious postwar classic cars. \u201cBut they have to be drivable,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Boom and Gloom: An Economic Warning for California", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo why is its longtime governor, Jerry Brown, issuing prophecies of doom?California has accounted for about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s economic growth since 2010, significantly more than its share of the population or overall output. But Mr. Brown, in his final year in office, has raised the question on the minds of those paid to think about the economy: How long can this last?For California and the nation, there is a long list of things that could go wrong. A surging budget deficit could stoke higher interest rates. And if the recent upheaval in stocks signals a longer-term decline, it would hurt California in particular because its budget relies heavily on high earners whose incomes rise and fall with the market. President Trump\u2019s moves to upend longstanding trade arrangements could be a setback for the state, home of the country\u2019s biggest port complex. And because the growth of the technology industry has played a huge role in California\u2019s recent boom, a drop in company valuations or in venture capital investments would reverberate swiftly through the state\u2019s economy and tax receipts.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to believe we are going to have a recession this year or the next year,\u201d said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm in Los Angeles, referring to Mr. Brown\u2019s grim forecast. \u201cHe\u2019s just pointing out the obvious, which is that things feel good now but there is going to come a time when all hell is going to break loose \u2014 and we better be ready for it.\u201dMr. Brown\u2019s statements highlight California\u2019s distinction as a state of high highs and low lows. From the recession of the early 1990s to the 2001 dot-com crash to the housing collapse of a decade ago, downturns often end up being more pronounced in the state than elsewhere. The next recession, whenever it comes, will almost certainly land harder here than it does in the rest of the country. And that boom-bust pattern is especially tough on California\u2019s budget \u2014 something that Mr. Brown, who was first elected governor more than four decades ago, knows well.In 2009, as the last recession took hold, California state revenue fell 19 percent, versus 8 percent for state revenues nationwide, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. There has been a strong rebound since then, but the gains are unlikely to last. That is because California\u2019s government relies on a heavily progressive income tax that generates most of its revenue from a relatively small number of wealthy taxpayers whose incomes are erratic.\u201cHis successor gets a world in which revenues are more volatile,\u201d without the option of raising taxes, said David Crane, a lecturer in public policy at Stanford University and a former adviser to Mr. Brown\u2019s predecessor, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. \u201cThat\u2019s a really tough world to operate in.\u201dA recession would also further expose problems that have festered for decades. Across California, cities and school districts are having trouble keeping up with ballooning pension obligations, squeezing teacher salaries and state services. In warning about budget troubles to come, Mr. Brown was making a case for adding more of today\u2019s surplus to the state\u2019s rainy day fund to cushion the blow of the next downturn.Still, economists generally agree that the state\u2019s long-term prospects are bright. It is home to many of the world\u2019s most valuable and innovative companies, and it attracts an outsize portion of the skilled work force and venture capital financing, helping it create new industries as old ones slow down or fade away.And recession forecasting is a tough business even for those whose livelihoods depend on it, like Ed Del Beccaro, a senior managing director in the Walnut Creek office of Transwestern, a commercial real estate brokerage. He manages a team of brokers and travels around the Bay Area giving speeches and forecasts to chambers of commerce and other business groups.\u201cTwo years ago I was predicting a recession in September of 2017, and in October I said we were going to have a recession at the end of 2018,\u201d he said. \u201cToday I think that unless we get bombed by North Korea, we will have a pretty amazing two years of growth.\u201dWith a sudden spurt in demand for office space, Mr. Del Beccaro said, he is hiring new workers and spending more on marketing to prospective clients. \u201cI was just authorized to go out and get more brokers and offer them incentives to hopefully get them to switch over from other companies,\u201d he said.But winter will come eventually, and when it does, Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel about planning ahead may help shape how California weathers it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jerome Powell Is Sworn In as Federal Reserve Chairman", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell took the reins of the Federal Reserve on Monday with a depleted board and a list of challenges that has suddenly expanded to include a second day of stock market wobbles.Mr. Powell is unlikely to respond to the decline in stock prices unless it worsens dramatically. In remarks after his swearing-in as Fed chairman, he emphasized the health of the economy.The stock market declined 35 percent in the three months after Alan Greenspan became Fed chairman in August 1987, including the \u201cBlack Monday\u201d crash in mid-October. Mr. Greenspan responded by sharply cutting the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate and issuing a public statement declaring that the Fed was ready and willing \u201cto support the economic and financial system.\u201dThe intervention, which reversed the decline, was celebrated at the time, but it contributed to an expectation in financial markets that Mr. Greenspan would not allow stock prices to fall.The current downturn is much smaller. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 6 percent since Thursday. Mr. Powell said on Monday that the economy is in good health. With unemployment low, the Fed is focused on raising its benchmark interest rates to stay ahead of inflation.\u201cPowell could have done without a slump in the U.S. stock market, but unless the slump becomes a rout, he is unlikely to intervene,\u201d wrote John Higgins, an economist at Capital Economics.In addition to Mr. Powell, the members of the board are Randal K. Quarles, the vice chairman for supervision, and Lael Brainard.Mr. Quarles, who oversees financial regulation issues at the Fed, has recused himself from Wells Fargo-related business because he held significant investments in the firm before he joined the Fed last year. That leaves Ms. Brainard, the other member of the committee that oversees supervision, as the Fed\u2019s point person on the Wells case, although Mr. Powell would also participate in significant decisions.Mr. Trump has not announced nominees for the other three seats on the board.The regulators who directly supervise Wells Fargo are employees of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, one of the 12 regional banks that make up the Fed system. Before the 2008 financial crisis, the regional reserve banks exercised significant control over the institutions headquartered in their regions. But in 2010, the Fed centralized the regulation of large banks to improve the consistency of regulation and to take a broad view of issues affecting multiple banks.The judgment about Wells Fargo\u2019s progress will be made by a staff committee, the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, that is led by Michael S. Gibson, the Fed\u2019s director of supervision and regulation, in close consultation with the board of governors.Mr. Powell was sworn into office by Mr. Quarles, a longtime friend. When Mr. Powell worked as a senior Treasury Department official under President George Bush in the early 1990s, he hired Mr. Quarles as an assistant. Later the two men worked together at the Carlyle Group, a private equity investment firm.Mr. Quarles was selected by Mr. Trump as the Fed\u2019s point man for an overhaul of post-crisis financial regulations, which the president views as excessive. Mr. Powell on Monday reiterated his view that the financial system \u201cis now far stronger and more resilient\u201d as a result of increased regulation and \u201cwe intend to keep it that way.\u201d He added that there is room for improvement to make regulation \u201cefficient as well as effective.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Blow Against Gerrymandering", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe stocks have fallen because traders are worried the global economy is slowing down. Or maybe they\u2019re worried it is heating up and sparking inflation. Maybe President Trump\u2019s erraticism is finally worrying markets. Or maybe none of the above \u2014 and stocks have fallen because of what Paul Krugman calls \u201ca pure self-fulfilling panic.\u201dIt helps to go back a few years to understand what\u2019s happened in Pennsylvania. In the 2012 congressional elections, the Democratic candidates won a narrow majority of votes \u2014 just over 50 percent across the state\u2019s 18 House districts, compared with 49 percent for the Republican candidates.As their reward for winning more votes, however, the Democratic candidates won only five of the 18 House seats. That\u2019s the brutal math of gerrymandering, in which 50-plus percent of the popular vote can equal 28 percent of political power.It\u2019s important to note that both parties have abused gerrymandering in recent years. Democrats have done so in Illinois and Maryland. Republicans have done so in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, among other places. Republicans have been able to do more gerrymandering mostly because they control more state governments \u2014 not because Democrats are above gerrymandering.But I think that this shared blame should make the problem easier to address. In some states, less gerrymandering would benefit Democrats. In other states, it would benefit Republicans. In almost all states, less gerrymandering would make the electoral system fairer. It wouldn\u2019t solve all of our political problems, or anywhere close to all of them, but it would represent progress worthy of celebration.Next up in Pennsylvania: Either the state legislature or the courts will draw a new map. Next up nationwide (and even more consequential): The Supreme Court is likely to issue rulings on cases from Maryland, North Carolina and Wisconsin, which could eventually affect the entire country. It probably won\u2019t be in time for this year\u2019s elections, though.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Profits Drove a Stock Boom. Did the Economy Pay a Price?", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneStocks are too expensive.This is not a market forecast. I wouldn\u2019t be particularly surprised if the Dow shrugged off its recent turbulence and continued its long upward thrust. What I contend is that if the American economy behaved in the way that most economists say market economies should, stocks would in all likelihood be cheaper.It is a grim proposition. Wall Street\u2019s titans might welcome the fact that equity prices have grossly exceeded what a well-functioning, competitive economy should deliver. But for almost everybody else, it amounts to a disaster. From wage stagnation to the depressed investment rates that are holding back long-term economic growth, many of the fault lines running through the American economy can be traced back to the same root cause powering the rise of America\u2019s overpriced stocks.What makes this particularly puzzling for scholars reared on the classical models of competitive economies is that all this happened despite a persistent decline in real interest rates. In a more orthodox economy, declining rates on corporate bonds would encourage a surge in corporate investment. As companies invested more and more capital, the returns on investments would gradually decline until companies\u2019 returns matched their cost of capital: the interest rate they pay to borrow.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.In a nutshell, the United States has built an economy where businesses don\u2019t invest even though it has rarely been cheaper to finance investment. Still, they reap spectacular profits that warrant runaway share prices.What happened? It turns out that there is one straightforward reason for the American economy\u2019s unorthodox behavior. As Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues argue, the standard economic theory based on competitive markets cannot apply when markets are not competitive. And competition, in the United States, is shriveling.The scholars argue that the American economy is afflicted by \u201crents\u201d \u2014 returns in excess of what investments would yield in a competitive economy, where fat margins are quickly whittled away by competition.These rents don\u2019t fall from the sky. Companies free of competitive pressures, with the power to set prices more or less at will, squeeze them from their customers and their workers. They pad corporate profits and send stock prices sky high.Global inequality, after widening for decades, has stabilized. The share of the world\u2019s income captured by the top 1 percent has shrunk since its peak on the eve of the financial crisis.Executives love it. The critical question is what these rents hold in store for the rest of us.Still, there are good reasons to worry about rising rents, no matter where they come from. Mr. Shapiro argues that while some measures of market concentration may not be meaningful, persistently high profits are of themselves a cause for concern.Profits as a share of output have risen by half over the last 30 years. Combined with evidence that large corporations are accounting for an increasing share of revenue and employment, Mr. Shapiro writes, \u201cit certainly appears that many large U.S. corporations are earning substantial incumbency rents, and have been doing so for at least 10 years, apart from during the depths of the Great Recession.\u201dThis is particularly true in the tech sector, where a handful of dominant companies \u2014 you know the ones I\u2019m talking about \u2014 have sustained spectacular profits for years. Their sky-high stock prices suggest that investors expect high profits to continue as well.\u201cThey probably are geniuses; what they are doing is wonderful,\u201d Mr. Shapiro told me. \u201cStill, you would expect competition to erode away the excess profits over time.\u201dHere is why we should worry.Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues built an alternative model of the American economy by doing away with the assumption of perfect competition. They contend that there are barriers to entry that stop competitors and allow rents to persist.In this economy, stock prices don\u2019t just reflect the future stream of normal economic returns that would accrue to a company\u2019s capital investment. They also include a claim to a stream of rents that generate \u201cpure profits.\u201d These profits can\u2019t be replicated by another company\u2019s capital investment. They are owned by a specific company.Rents interfere with incentives in a big way. Companies will spend more time and effort trying to preserve those rents \u2014 often by working to block rivals from their markets. Rivals will fight to grab a share of those rents for themselves, perhaps through lobbying. Amid all this jockeying, investment in productive capabilities will most likely be neglected as a secondary consideration.And inevitably, inequality will rise: The owners of the shares in the powerful corporations capturing the economy\u2019s growing monopoly rents will peel further and further away from the average Jane and Joe, who own little but their labor.This is not the kind of economy proposed by classical economic theory. It is not the kind of country portrayed by evangelists of the American dream. But it looks as if we are stuck with it, regardless of what the stock market does tomorrow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Condemns Florida Officer Who Didn\u2019t Act; Sticks by Plan to Arm Teachers", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump condemned on Friday a Parkland, Fla., sheriff\u2019s deputy who stayed outside the school he was patrolling while a shooting rampage unfolded inside last week, even as he insisted that his proposal to arm well-trained teachers would have prevented the massacre.\u201cHe was there for five minutes \u2014 for five minutes,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cThat was during the entire shooting. He heard it right from the beginning. So he certainly did a poor job, but that\u2019s a case where somebody was outside, they\u2019re trained, they didn\u2019t act properly under pressure, or they were a coward.\u201dHe spoke on his way to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where he continued to promote his proposal \u2014 embraced by the National Rifle Association \u2014 to allow some teachers and other educators to carry concealed firearms in schools. He said on Thursday that such teachers should be paid a small bonus, and that he would devote federal resources to training them to use weapons to protect students.\u201cThese teachers love their students, and these teachers are talented with weaponry and with guns,\u201d Mr. Trump said Friday during a fiery speech to the conservative gathering, where he said that Democrats wanted to revoke Second Amendment rights.\u201cI\u2019d rather have somebody that loves their students and wants to protect their students than somebody standing outside that doesn\u2019t know anybody, and doesn\u2019t know the students, and frankly, for whatever reason, decided not to go in even though he heard lots of shots being fired inside,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to Mr. Peterson. He said the officer \u201cwas not a credit to law enforcement.\u201dSpeaking of the gunman in Parkland, Mr. Trump added that if his idea had been in place, \u201ca teacher would have shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened.\u201dMr. Trump is under pressure to embrace stiffer gun restrictions, including a ban on assault weapons and limits on high-capacity ammunition, despite vehement N.R.A. opposition. The president has instead seized on the idea of loosening gun laws to protect schools.\u201cWhy do we protect our airports and our banks, our government buildings, but not our schools?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to make our schools a much harder target for attackers.\u201dHe said declaring schools gun-free zones \u201cputs our students in far more danger.\u201dMr. Trump, who was endorsed by the N.R.A. during his campaign and has been an ardent ally, suggested that he was pressuring the gun lobby to accept measures it had deemed objectionable. But the two proposals he mentioned on Friday \u2014 improving background checks for gun buyers and ensuring that mentally ill people cannot have access to firearms \u2014 are both supported by the group.Later Friday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that lawmakers would join forces with him to address the tragedy, particularly on the issue of background checks.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a lot, but we are going to be very strong on background checks,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a news conference at the White House with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with many of our people in Congress \u2014 our senators, our congressmen and women \u2014 and there\u2019s a movement on to get something done.\u201dBut Democrats were stepping up their calls for more restrictive gun laws, far beyond what Mr. Trump suggested.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Republicans in Congress to show just a shred of the courage of American students,\u201d Representative Ted Deutch, the Democrat who represents Parkland, said in the party\u2019s weekly radio address. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Speaker Ryan to let the House vote to require background checks on every sale and transfer, to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists, to outlaw bump stocks that enable automatic rates of fire, to require that no one under the age of 21 can buy a gun, and to once again ban assault weapons from our streets.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s comments on arming teachers were part of a highly partisan speech to the conservative gathering \u2014 an annual meeting that draws the hard-right activists who form the backbone of his political coalition \u2014 in which the president proclaimed that his first 12 months in office \u201cthe most successful first year in the history of the presidency.\u201d He referred to Democrats as \u201ccrazed,\u201d and said his opponents had \u201ccommitted a lot of atrocities.\u201d His remarks were met with rapturous applause.\u201cOh, I try like hell to hide that bald spot, folks, I work hard at it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look bad. Hey, we are hanging in, we are hanging in, we are hanging in there \u2014 right?\u201dBut most of his speech had a harder edge. Mr. Trump outlined his efforts to step up immigration enforcement and crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, those that decline to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to track and remove undocumented immigrants. And he returned to a favorite campaign-trail routine of reciting the lyrics to a song called \u201cThe Snake,\u201d about a woman who takes in an ailing snake that recovers and repays her hospitality with a lethal bite \u2014 suggesting an analogy between immigrants and a poisonous reptile.\u201cThink of it in terms of immigration,\u201d Mr. Trump said, before reciting the verses for the cheering audience. When he finished, he said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with our country, we\u2019re letting them in.\u201dMr. Trump ended the address with a call to action for Republicans, and warned that they must not be complacent about getting out to vote in 2018 and defeating Democrats.\u201cThey want to give your money away, they want to end your tax cuts, they want to do things you wouldn\u2019t believe \u2014 including taking your Second Amendment rights away,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey will do that, so we have to get out there, and we have to fight in \u201818 like never before.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ignore the Stock Market. The Economy Looks Fine.", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic data and the bond market are painting a more optimistic picture than the Dow Jones average.What is the stock market telling us with its precipitous drop over the last several days? In all likelihood, not much of anything.That\u2019s because the stock market, though crucial in the long run for individuals accumulating wealth and companies raising capital, is so erratic as to be useless in providing information about the short run. The 8.5 percent drop in the S.&P. 500 through Monday\u2019s close (before a 1.7 percent rebound on Tuesday) could signify the onset of a global recession. But it could just as well mean only that some trading algorithms at a big hedge fund collided in weird ways.For what really matters \u2014 the well-being of the economy and the ability for individuals and companies to prosper in the years ahead \u2014 look first to fundamental economic data, especially those that tend to be leading indicators. Second, look to the bond market and other financial market indicators that are more reliable measures of investors\u2019 expectations than stock prices.There is good news on both fronts, as both point to a global economy that will continue growing steadily in the months and years ahead, perhaps with inflation that is a bit higher than in the recent past. That contrasts this market sell-off with drops in 2011, 2015 and 2016, which coincided with pessimistic signals in both economic data and the bond market.The stock market can, when looked at in concert with these other indicators, provide some useful insight. Right now it appears to be more noise than signal.The bond market is also looking optimistic about the future, with prices suggesting that continued growth \u2014 without inflationary overheating \u2014 is the most likely future.The stock market has lost ground since the start of the year, thanks to the sharp sell-off Monday. But the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds is up in that span, from 2.4 percent to 2.8 percent at Tuesday\u2019s close. That suggests bond investors think that continued steady recovery will allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates gradually.Bond investors are pricing in higher inflation than the United States has experienced in recent years, but roughly in line with the 2 percent the Federal Reserve aims for. Prices for inflation-protected bonds imply 2.09 percent annual inflation over the coming decade, up from 1.98 percent at the start of the year.Other market indicators that might signal global economic troubles, like the price of oil, instead point to a steady-as-she-goes global economy.None of this makes a case for economic complacency. There are plenty of things that could go wrong in the world, from conflict on the Korean Peninsula or in the Middle East to destructive trade wars. But if the stock market was actually giving us any insight into the likelihood of those outcomes, we would expect to see moves in bond and commodity markets that just aren\u2019t happening.Think of it this way. The economy is like a horse race \u2014 and what we really care about is which horse wins, places or shows. The bond market is the equivalent of the people betting directly on the race. And while of course gamblers get it wrong sometimes, the market is efficient enough that there\u2019s a fairly direct relationship between the odds a horse pays and its probability of victory.The stock market, by contrast, is like a weird side game in which people bet one another on which gambler is going to have the best day. It\u2019s erratic, volatile and a couple of degrees removed from the underlying horse race on which it is all based.And that\u2019s why the best way to make sense of the drop in the stock market is to think of it as a sideshow to the broader trajectory of the United States and global economy, which for now look perfectly fine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Is a Stock Market Correction?", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sell-off in stocks has reached a new level in market lingo: a correction. After tumbling in recent weeks, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed on Thursday in that territory.What is a stock market correction?A correction is a 10 percent drop in stocks from their peak. Since Jan. 26, the S.&P. 500 has fallen 10.16 percent.In some ways, 10 percent is an arbitrary threshold. But it often signals that investors have turned more pessimistic about the markets.Does this mean stocks are headed down even further?Not necessarily.Over the past 20 years, there have been 10 corrections in the S.&P. 500, including the current one, according to Yardeni Research. The previous correction ended in February 2016.Of those corrections, only two have turned into bear markets:Wait. What is a bear market? It is a more severe and usually more sustained downturn in the market, when stocks drop by at least 20 percent.The last one, during the financial crisis, lasted until March 2009. Then, the S.&P. 500 sank nearly 57 percent from peak to trough, according to Yardeni Research.The previous bear market occurred during the dot-com bust. From the top of the market in March 2000 until the bottom in October 2002, the S.&P. 500 lost 49 percent.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Has Turned Nasty. It Was Long Overdue.", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesUntil this month, the scariest thing about the stock market was its uncanny calm and stability. Like the opening sequences of a classic horror movie, the market last year was relentlessly and unnaturally cheerful.The scariest thing about the market right now is the shocked response of traders who had become accustomed to the unsustainably placid conditions that have been unceremoniously swept away.The precise timing of the market plunge was a surprise, and it has evidently unnerved some investors. But while it may seem harsh to say so, after so many months of fizzy profits, a downturn was long overdue.\u201cThe movements we\u2019ve been having the last couple of weeks may not be pleasant but they are entirely normal, on a historical basis, \u201c said Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist for LPL Financial.Based on the historical record, \u201cnormal\u201d in the stock market includes unsettling conditions of the kind we have been experiencing lately. More of the same is likely in the months ahead: gut-wrenching swings down as well as up, rather than the steady gains that evidently lulled some investors into complacency.That is not a declaration that the market is in deep trouble. Far from it. I don\u2019t know where stocks are heading in the weeks ahead, but I assume, based on history, that they will eventually rise. \u201cEventually\u201d is a word with a lot of wiggle room, however. Markets tend to overshoot, up and down, and they could certainly plunge much further.That said, a good argument can be made that the underlying stock market fundamentals today are better now than they were a few months ago. After all, the economy appears to be fairly strong in the United States and in much of the rest of the world, and corporate earnings have been rising. Higher earnings and cheaper stock prices are an appealing combination. Using classic definitions, stock valuations have markedly improved in just a few months.Still, the current downturn is a harsh reminder: The stock market entails risk, pain and losses, and it isn\u2019t for everyone. Whatever \u201cnormal\u201d is, it is nothing like the benign stock market of late 2016 or 2017.Mr. Mehta\u2019s view, which I share, is that a stock market decline of the kind we have been experiencing was overdue and that there is probably even greater volatility ahead. My own admittedly hopeful perspective is that declines now may reduce and postpone extreme speculative excesses later. Such excesses eventually lead to big market crashes and real pain for the broader economy.Consider that since the election in November 2016 through January, stock returns, including dividends, increased every month. That was the longest such streak since 1928, when reliable records began to be kept, Mr. Detrick says.And it\u2019s not just that stocks moved up every month. They did so on a daily basis in the gentlest and steadiest of fashions. The average daily change in the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for all of 2017 was a mere 0.30 percent up or down. That is the lowest number \u2014 and the most stable market, based on that metric \u2014 since 1964.No wonder the stock market seems so unsettling in 2018. Through Thursday, the average daily change, up or down, was 0.84 percent. That is a big increase. Yet going back to 1928, the average has been 0.75 percent. The current market, which has been depicted as wildly disruptive is, basically, just an average one, Mr. Detrick said.There have been major losses in the broader market, however. Through Thursday, the stocks in the S.&P. 500 had lost $5.2 trillion from the index\u2019s peak on Jan. 26, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. That is a staggering amount, but even with those losses, the S.&P. 500 through Thursday had swollen by $3.55 trillion since the 2016 election.Bear markets in stocks \u2014 defined as downturns, from peak to trough, of at least 20 percent \u2014 rarely occur without a recession, and, at the moment, none is visible. That\u2019s one reason for Mr. Detrick\u2019s belief that the market is \u201cprobably getting fairly close to its bottom now.\u201dWhile that history is comforting, the 20 percent threshold for a bear market is arbitrary, and the link between recessions and the stock market is not ironclad. The bear market of 1987 occurred without a recession, for example. And who would really be surprised if the unusual political conditions in the United States today fostered unexpected patterns in the economy and stock market?What is safe to say is that the market has entered a new, troubling phase. The current turmoil may turn out to be blissfully brief, but it makes sense to be ready for the worst.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Emotional-Support Animals, Cheating in School, Movies and Climate Change: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationEnjoy this week\u2019s roundup, and please note that all student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted._________I truly believe emotional support animals are a scam. From the evidence shown in this article it seems like people are just abusing the system currently in place. Its unfair to people on flights who are allergic of dogs unless you have a PHYSICAL disability such as being blind or having diabetes. These peoples lives actually depend on their animals. People need to stop being so selfish and pay the fee to bring their dog on a plane. Airlines should also decrease the price of flying the dogs to avoid people scamming them.I taught hippotherapy classes for around two years (maybe more, maybe less. Anyone who knows me knows I have a terrible perception of time. But, I digress). Hippotherapy is a form of therapy where a child or adult with a social, emotional, or physical disability learns to ride horses. I learned one lesson time and time again over those two years - animals have power.Emotional-support animals are not a scam. Tell that to the countless clients I have worked with. Tell that to the client who threw their arms around their horse, but got anxious when they were around people. Tell that to the mostly nonverbal kid who told their horse, \u201cwooahhh!\u201d. I hold these stories close to my heart because they make me realize that yes, humans can do a lot for humans, but there is something about an animal that speaks to someone in a way that another person cannot.Unfortunately, there are scammers out there. There will always be people with selfish ambition, who see a system set up for someone who is not them, and who take whatever they can get. But, you never know. There are disabilities that you cannot see - remember, I did say \u201csocial and emotional\u201d. Here\u2019s the thing, friends. You and I do not have the right to sleuth around and see if someone has a disability. It is not our job to validate someone\u2019s disability. Someone with anxiety does not need a sticker for their emotional support dog that says \u201cMy anxiety has been confirmed! Don\u2019t worry, I can have an emotional support dog!\u201dI agree with Mr. Leonhard\u2019s argument, because people is taking advantage cheating the system. If the people wants to bring their pets with them, everybody should pay the fee as the law said, because is very selfish of them that people who has disabilities which really needs a Service Animal will have to pay the consequences of the other people actions making more complicated their lives. Personally, I do not have so much knowledge about Services animal\u2019s, bud I do believe that animals could be helpful for people, I have seen people with disabilities who used horses for therapy\u2019s, they said that is very good for them and they make them feel better. I also think for someone blind as well having a training dog can be very helpful. Therefore, I do not think emotional support animals are Scam at all; the scam is made by the people who use them to break the rules in their own benefits.There are many studies, as Mr. Leonhardt said, that show how many people with mental and physical disabilities do in fact function better with a trained animal accompanying them. These people aren\u2019t the problem and should not be punished by airlines and other public establishments for following the law. It is their constitutional right, as stated in a 1986 law, to not be discriminated for being handicapped air travelers. It\u2019s the people that game the system by buying their dog or pig or monkey or cat a $30 EMOTIONAL SUPPORT animal vest so they can avoid the $100 fee for boarding an animal. These people think that they are \u201cgaming the system\u201d when in reality they are making it harder for the people who ACTUALLY need an emotional support animal to travel with their service animal.It is sad that we as a society that are to driven by our own selfish motives that we can\u2019t see how our actions are affecting others negatively. Airlines need to have stricter rules and regulations for people travelling with emotional support animals by asking for official licenses to prove these emotional support animals authenticity.While trusting people to tell the truth about whether or not the pet is an emotional-support animal or not is a good thought I don\u2019t think that it is possible in this day and age. As said in the article, it is easy to get a red vest for animal and call them an emotional-support animal, this makes it almost impossible to know who is telling the truth and who is not.Sadly I think it is necessary for people to provide papers that prove their animal is certified. I think that some time in the future these problems will be resolved and thing can go back to a trust basis. But until people take responsibility for their actions and stop lying the rules will have to increase.Mr. Leonhardt certainly makes a good argument against emotional-support animals as a whole, especially when considering the tight confinement of a commercial flight. However isn\u2019t the environment of a college campus different?The way I see it, the majority of the issues with animals flying arise from the small space allowed to passengers, as shown by the mauling case from the San Diego flight. The man was not able to escape or defend himself due to the lack of space in the plane. Yet an attack like this is certainly unlikely on any college campus or classroom, given larger amount of room for escape or self-protection....Aside from their location, I believe that to be qualified as a therapy pet, the animal at hand must have proper training and pass certain tests and requirements. If only well trained animals are eligible to be therapy pets, issues associated with them will lessen significantly._________My overarching dream is to write scripts for tv shows and movies, to create the dreams before they hit big screams. Naturally, I depict what lessons and meanings are hidden in movies about love, freedom, friendship, responsibility, and chaos. Believe me, you can ask anybody in my class about me, and they will say this kid knows almost any movie quote.Some of the best lessons I\u2019ve learned from movies come from lesser known movies or secretly popular.I\u2019ve learned that love can come right from behind you by staying true to yourself, whether a lovely girl or a hunched zombie from Warm Bodies and 16 Candles.I\u2019ve seen that friendship lasts from the highs and lows, even if you are a lobby-boy in a deathly chase for a dead woman\u2019s will for Grand Budapest Hotel.Logan taught me responsibility can lead to the redemption of who you once were and that it can give somebody else a better life than you had.The Road Within gove me an insight on how to set yourself free and enjoy life, even with turrets syndrome.Of course, I\u2019ve had a fair share of chaos, and how people cause and experience it from The Dark Knight and Pulp Fiction.If you toss these traits together, you can create a masterpiece. I could go on about Shape Of Water and the Marvel Universe, but people know those, whereas these movies are special to me and truly men something in my life. I see that movies aren\u2019t always for entertainment, but rather for us to embrace a lesson on how we can better ourselves and the world.I love the 1987 film Dirty Dancing, in which can never truly be recreated in this century. Patrick Swayze fit the role as a misunderstood individual perfectly. And therefore my favorite moral was how you can not assume something about a person who you do not even know. Furthermore dwelling into the idea that religion, race, or class shouldn\u2019t separate us. And how the people we associate with shouldn\u2019t be restrained by the size of our diamond rings or the house we call home. As these are materialistic things that will never hold true value to us. I would rather live a short life in the company of many types of people and cultures than have to live a million years in my invisible barrier.I want to see more Historical Movies. Not only because there entertaining but they are real. They people on screen are not characters that someone has thought up, they exist. They have more depth to them than any character anyone could think up. Historical movies don\u2019t just entertain, they educate.Movies like Hacksaw Ridge and Saving Private Ryan show the Grittiness of WWII, and in the theater... they\u2019re so much better. The sight of the battlefield mixed with the sounds of war make for a raw, untamed experience. You hear every gunshot, you feel every explosion, as far as you know, you are at war. There exists another type of struggle though. One that is not physical, but social and emotional. In this light, a different type of movie shines. Hotel Rwanda, Schindler\u2019s List, 42. These movies all show the Struggle and hardship faced by the main character.One of the greatest movies of all time is about a black man struggling with poverty and his wife leaving him. He was fired from his job and was in search of a new one while trying to pay his rent. He eventually found a job at a big corporation and lived to be a millionaire. If you haven\u2019t guessed what movie I\u2019m talking about yet, it is The Pursuit of Happyness. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and can truly show you what it\u2019s like to live in poverty. This movie really shows how if you put your mind to something, you can accomplish it.Two of my favorite movies are Mean Girls and Clueless, which aren\u2019t the movies you would look to for a profound life lesson. But, for me, these movies set a sort of expectations for life.Before I started high school, I had no clue what I was walking into. The only reference point I had for what high school was truly like was from these movies. Obviously I wasn\u2019t expecting people to be making Burn Books a la Mean Girls, but I did expect to attend three or four parties a year, be in a tight-knit clique, and to put lots of effort into my outfit every day. Little did I know that I would be spending my weekends studying and I would attend school in my workout gear instead of a dress and sandals._________While I believe that cheating is wrong and immoral, if I caught a classmate of mine cheating I wouldn\u2019t report them.For one, their dishonesty doesn\u2019t affect me in any way, it is their choice whether to cheat or not and they will have to live with the consequence of their decision. As long as those consequences don\u2019t harm anyone else it is not my place to tell them what is right or wrong, they have to decide themselves.Moreover, the majority of students cheat on exams because most schooling systems today value high grades more than student\u2019s value learning. There is an immense amount of pressure put on students to get high grades, where I believe the focus should be put on learning and hard work.In conclusion, as much as I think cheating is wrong I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to report a student who cheated on an exam.Just to get this out there, I\u2019m not saying cheating is the best way to pass high school, but if we\u2019re being completely honest, I\u2019m pretty sure every single kid in high school has cheated. And yes, convincing yourself that it was only a small peek is still cheating.What I do know, is that just because a student cheated on a test doesn\u2019t make them a bad person. For all you know they could\u2019ve been having a really bad day, are tired from all the stuff a normal high schooler goes through, and completely forgot they had a quiz. Sounds familiar? It does to me. I think that one time you cheated should not come to define you as being a careless student.For me telling on someone really depends. In general I don\u2019t think I would. Wanting to cheat is their own business, now whoever they\u2019re cheating off of...that is a different story. If that person feels their learning and hard earned studying is being compromised by all means report it. Some people feel that it\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019d say out of those two categories I\u2019m probably in the middle...drifting toward the second.Whether or not someone should be reprimanded or \u201ctold on\u201d for cheating, like anything, really depends. Do they cheat often, or is this their first time? Does the whole class believe they were not properly prepared for this test? Are they struggling with problems outside of school? There are so many questions regarding what should be done about cheating and how you should feel, it\u2019s difficult to have one definite answer.I hate that feeling when you are in the middle of an exam you studied countless hours for and then the person beside you is staring at your Scan Tron bubbling in all the same answers.While it makes me furious, I don\u2019t want to be that one person everyone hates always following the rules and being a teacher\u2019s pet.I feel like we have a moral code, us students. When someone cheats, don\u2019t tell on them because you will surely end up in a situation when you need to do the same. When that time comes around, you won\u2019t want anyone reporting you. Also, you have no idea what\u2019s going on in the cheater\u2019s life as the article concluded. Maybe their home is an unsuitable environment where they have to attend to all the cooking and cleaning, leaving them no time to study. I believe it\u2019s better to just stay silent and not get caught up in their issues as the full story is unknown and you could potentially ruin their chances of being successful.I remember when in my freshmen year of high school, my class was accused of cheating. Our teacher turned out to be correct when he found that one of my peers had found the quizzes online. As a consequence, our quizzes began to only be made by our teacher. I knew that my peer had found the quiz online, however, I figured that he was doing no harm to me. He was only hurting his own intelligence because he would eventually be tested on this chapter, and he would have to actually study this time. I don\u2019t feel that I should be the one to report them.I honestly can\u2019t say if I would tell on a friend for cheating or not. There are so many variables I\u2019d need to consider before making up my mind to tell. I have seen my friends cheat before, but I haven\u2019t ever said anything. Like the article said, people often cheat because of pressure. I think instead of focusing on trying to get rid of cheating, we should try and help people feel less pressured, so they don\u2019t feel like their only option is cheating. This isn\u2019t to say they shouldn\u2019t care about a bad grade, but I know so many people who will tear themselves apart because of bad grades. I think parents, students, and teacher alike should try and understand that a bad grade isn\u2019t the end.If I caught my classmates cheating on a school assignment, I probably would not tell on them. First of all, if I tell the teacher, that person will establish a negative feeling towards me, some people will even make trouble for you after school, etc. Secondly, when someone is cheating, they are ultimately deceiving themselves. When they really face a challenge in real life, how can they cheat then? As a result, my opinion is to ignore people who are cheating to avoid any trouble, and for those who cheated, they will taste their consequences later on.On the other hand, If they are cheating off of me, I would not just let it go. I feel that is an invasion of privacy, with the direct breach of our school\u2019s code of conduct, I would tell on them. After all, cheating is bad and against the school rules. It is unfair to those who really put in the efforts to study and taking on class works legit to get the same or if lower grades than the person who cheats._________Annabella the fairy queen was disgruntled. This was her hundredth ball and yet her hair refused to be properly tamed. Her beau, king of darkness was late. She would make him pay when he finally rode his flaming horses into the portico.It is now or never.Well, at least, that\u2019s according to her mother. Well, at least, that\u2019s according to everyone\u2019s mother. The pressure weighs down on each of them like a third coat of mascara.It is now or never.She eyes the rest of them like they are competition. In another world, perhaps she would go off on a champagne-coated tangent about how tragic it is that mankind has forced her to see girls in this way, not for their innate goodness, not for their girlhood, but for the way that their hair looks and the fact that so-and-so didn\u2019t put enough lash glue on, and now her falsies are somewhere underneath all of this tulle.It is now or never.She takes another anxious sip of water. Feels it slide down the back of her throat and splash into the pit of her stomach. Licks her lips and licks them again, the sticky redness of new lipstick most definitely coming off on her tongue.It is now or never.It smells of perfume. The cheap kind. Knock-off Chanel and Juicy Couture. She takes her wrist, pale and shaking, and holds it to her nose. Perfect.It is now or never.Now? She thinks. Never?They make it seem like you have a choice. You do not.It was almost time. I sat nervously in the corner waiting for my number to be called. Soon I would be given the chance to become a member of the royal family. My mother\u2019s words echoing in my mind, \u201cDon\u2019t blow it.\u201d134. 135.They were getting closer to my number, 138. What would I say when I came face-to-face with the prince. What if I made a complete fool of myself?I looked around the room at all the young men and women that had gathered for the ceremony. They all were dressed in their finest in hope of impressing the prince and princess.136. 137.I was next. My hands were shaking and I could feel the tears begin do pool up in my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t blow it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you do don\u2019t bother coming home.\u201dI blinked away my tears and pulled out my compact mirror to fix my makeup. I was in a room filled with some of the most gorgeous women in the country, but my little brother said I was as beautiful as a queen.I can\u2019t let him down. I wasn\u2019t doing this for mother or myself but for him. My sweet little brother who meant to world to me.138.It was my turn. I held my head up high and gracefully walked toward the man who had called my number.It was time to have my shot at becoming the future Mrs. Belmont.Every girl in my family has been forced to participate in the annual debutante ball. My three older sisters have done it, and now its my turn. But I would rather die than be paraded around in front the \u201celite\u201d families. Unlike my sisters I never cared about our money, and I don\u2019t want to be apart of this society. Everyone in that ballroom is shallow and selfish.My mother nudges me, \u201cit\u2019s time to get in line.\u201dI shake my head, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this mom.\u201dAs I say this she is pushing me towards the stairs. She proceeds to tell me how all of my sister were nervous too.\u201cPlaces everyone!\u201d The music starts, and the first couple walks down the stairs. I turn around to face my mother, and I hug her. Before I let go I whisper, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d into her ear. And then I run, and I don\u2019t stop until I reach the train station._________People tend to think others look better when they smile so they tell them to smile. This is more for women, it shows the struggles the women face and tend to cover up with their smile because everything is okay if you\u2019re smiling. Everything is not okay just because you smile, it sometimes makes it worse.Telling someone to smile never gets you what you\u2019re looking for anyway. If you can, make them smile. It\u2019ll be more sincere and more pleasant for them. And if they don\u2019t want to smile, respect their autonomy to be who they are and to feel what they feel.If you feel a person is only worth seeing when they\u2019re smiling, then perhaps you shouldn\u2019t inject yourself into their world in the first place. Regarding art, we are more meaningfully served when we explore the full range of human emotions, not just the easy to consume ones. And it is alienating to be only presented with smiles and feel you\u2019re alone in not feeling this way yourself. Once we allow images to convey all that women feel, perhaps then we\u2019ll better see them as complete human beings instead of just candy for our eyes.This artwork is making one of the most crucial points necessary for this new era. For the longest time, women were seen as mere objects. Objects were meant to look pretty. Therefore women also had to look pretty. The easiest way to appear \u201cpretty\u201d in modern society is to be happy. The definition of happiness changes depending on who is being asked, but usually, happiness is associated with smiles. Smiles are a symbolic way of showing that someone is feeling comfortable with their surroundings. Before, women had to look as though they were always happy with their surroundings. Their appearance did matter, but their opinions did not. While our society has been able to make some progress with women\u2019s rights, the stigma remains....There is too much going on in this world for people to focus on whether or not I, or any woman, smile. Smiling may be considered pretty, but there is nothing more attractive than someone who can speak their mind and show how they feel.Gender equality is something that men and women have been fighting for for centuries, and things still aren\u2019t what they should be. This artwork is saying that women should not be expected to be okay with with making less than a man, and that we shouldn\u2019t be satisfied with being someone\u2019s assistant or secretary. I think the message is very powerful and speaks for all women who are tired of being okay with the same old society.I want to put my own sign next to it: \u201cStop telling other people what to do.\u201d It\u2019s meta, ya see.I agree I think we should all be nicer to each other in everyday life. Sometimes people are just having really bad days maybe they just got fired from a job, their boyfriend/girl friend just broke up with them, or they just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Some people just want to be left alone, and others like to have new iterations with new people. People should do what they want to do, period.You\u2019re walking in a public area, deep in your own thoughts. You are alone among a sea of strangers when one of those strangers decides to intrude. They don\u2019t catcall, make obscene gestures or suggestive comments. They nicely tell you to \u201csmile.\u201d Raised to be nice, you feel obligated because it seems so benign, giving a stranger a smile. But what it actually feels like, is having that stranger pull strings on your facial muscles. You could be witch and tell them to shove it, but that\u2019s out of character for many of us. So we let the stranger into our carefully-constructed mental fortress of solitude, and let them play puppeteer_________Everytime my parents play in the lottery, we will all have a big conversation at dinner on what we would do with the money. They say they would pay off their cars, the house, and that we would buy an island somewhere. In fact, my mom played with people at work and one of their tickets won, they all split it and she got about $1000, which she spent making the house look nicer.Winning the lottery sounds great. It\u2019s a fun fantasy to imagine, but realistically, it may not be that great. I believe that with money comes power and in most cases that power gets to your head. When you have a bunch of money, you could see something in a store and no longer have to calculate everything you have already to see if you have enough, you would just put it in the cart and keep going. You would lose the value of things, you would no longer have to work for what you want because you could just buy it, but if you were to spend the money on more important things then it may not turn out that way.Right now, I would love to win it. I\u2019m at the age where I can start driving soon and being able to buy a car would be great, since im in highschool the money could also be helpful once I graduate and go to college.Honestly, winning would be more of a hassle and burden than being self made. First of all, it puts a target on your back for robbery and other horrible crimes. It isolates you from your family and changes you. If that doesn\u2019t happen, than you get to deal with taxes, and it\u2019s proven that depending on how much you win, at least 30% goes to taxes. Not only is it a burden, it can also be life changing, for the worst. Being self made is the key to living a happy life, if you do it right.My family has actually talked about what would happen if we won a few years back while seated around the dinner table. We went around the table spewing out ideas left and right on what we\u2019d do with the money. Of course, there were the usual wishes: dream cars, a new house, vacations, etc., but we went deeper than that.We discussed what stocks we would invest in, which charities we\u2019d support, the debts we\u2019d pay off, the savings accounts we\u2019d open, college payments, and more. My dad continued to say that he\u2019d quit working and enjoy the chance to relax, but then we looked towards my mom.My mother is THE most hard-working and devoted person I know. She\u2019s an OB/GYN and she absolutely loves her job. When we asked whether or not she\u2019d quit her job, my mother firmly answered \u201cNo. Winning the lottery will not affect my job. I might shorten my hours and not go on call anymore, but overall it will remain the same.\u201dI know that the majority of lottery winners spend all of their money within the first few years, but after having that conversation years ago, I know that my family would be different. My parents are very smart with their money, and the winnings would be managed very well and used wisely.Definitely invest some in stocks, and put a majority of it away in a savings account. I would give some to my family, so they can pay off any debts, mortgages, or help pay for my cousins college. Some of the money I would keep to use for something that I always wanted to buy but could never afford it.I have heard countless times over the news that people who won the lottery have gone bankrupt because they spent all there money on luxuries. I would maybe buy myself a nice car or when I\u2019m older buy the dream house I\u2019ve wanted since I was a little girl. But, there has to be a limit where you can\u2019t spend lots of money on simple necessities such as clothing. If I was to win the lottery I wouldn\u2019t think about it being that I have millions dollars to spend but being able to buy things that would be beneficial to me in the long run.Just like the women in the article, I would like to keep my identity a secret. If people figure out that you just won millions of dollars, you became a really big target. People who were just your acquaintances might start reappearing in your life asking for favors or money. My fear is that if I won and my identity was revealed I would no longer be a girl who lives in Wilmington, but a girl who has a lot of money.If I were to win the lottery I would probably use the money to makeup for small inconveniences in my life, such as buying a new desk since mine is old and unstable, or splurge on things I\u2019ve always wanted, like an iPad. After spending the money that I need, I would put the rest into savings. With college coming up in my near future I would want to make sure I was financially stable and would be able to pay for college, plus the many other expenses that come along with it.The lottery has been the source of imagination for the easy way to the good life. Going against all odds and winning millions of dollars in an instant, the classic gamblers dream. Winning the lottery is actually can be extremely detrimental to you and the ones your love in a myriad of ways.First of the people who won lotteries, 70% of them have spent their fortune in 5 years! Millions of millions of dollars spent on superficial items that make you \u2018happier\u2019, just to end up or in an even worse place than you were before. The lottery is just a more accepted form of gambling fueling a masked disease. Personally if I won the lottery I would save most of the money just because I wouldn\u2019t even know what to spend a million dollars on._________This article shows that the smaller, more expensive, and you can even say \u201ctrendy\u201d dogs are more common in the areas of New York City that are home to more wealthy citizens. The bigger the dog, some that are feared by those who are probably uneducated on those breeds, are more common in the areas that have lower income households. This proves that where you live can influence the type of furry friend you decide to become best friends with.I own a Shih-Tzu named Gizmo. Having Gizmo shows who I am as a person. Him and I have the same personality. We\u2019re both calm and collected but when something exciting happens, we both are joyful and very outgoing. In my area Shih-Tzus are a pretty popular dog to have, but there are also a lot of bigger more unpopular dogs in around where I live. This shows that there is a mix between people with higher incomes and people with lower incomes yet we all live near each other.When I am out riding my bike or walking, I see many different types of dogs, hardly any are the same, unless in the same family. I see everything from huge dogs \u201cwalking their owners,\u201d to tiny dogs being rolled around in a stroller.I have three dogs, all different breeds, and all with a name that symbolizes something. My brothers and I take turns getting to name our dogs, and with our oldest dog, a chihuahua mix, it was my brother\u2019s turn to choose, and he was only two, so he picked Captain Elizabeth, from Pirates of the Caribbean. Being that my family are huge N.C. State fans, we named our next dog after Carter Finley Stadium, his name is Finley. Our last dog, a dachshund is named Annabel Lee after the Edgar Allen Poe poem. We didn\u2019t really get a choice of the types of dogs we have, because they were all rescued. The names of my dogs show a whole lot more about my family than the types of dogs they are.In the second grade, I got a puppy for Christmas. The puppy was a little brown and white spotted pit bull - a bundle of energy and sweetness.Because I am from an Asian household living in a suburban community, my family\u2019s decision to get a Pit bull caught many of my neighbors and friends by surprise. The predominant dog breeds around my community include Labs, Beagles, and Boston terriers - rarely do I see Pit bulls. Some of my mother\u2019s coworkers even told her that we would never be able to handle such a dog, one belonging to a breed known for dogfighting.It is disappointing that Pit bulls are often stuck with the false stereotype of being aggressive or dangerous, leading to the breed being put down tenfold more than other breeds, as the article states. It is nice, however, to hear that Pit bull adoption rates have gone up by 10-20% due to the growing popularity of adoption. I have begun noticing similar trends in my own community. Rather than buying from breeders, more families are beginning to adopt from the local animal shelter._________The concept of climate change in schools has been made overly controversial due to the fraught and polarised political atmosphere surrounding it. In standard science classes since elementary school, I have been taught about global warming very upfront - it is introduced as the rapidly progressive period of warming that our Earth is currently undergoing, and has undergone in the past. Climate change is discussed, albeit not so thoroughly; we learn about the effects of long-term global warming and how climates across the world can be catastrophically altered, as well as human contribution.Despite feeling that it should be a more heavily studied concept, I now feel lucky, knowing that in some districts in Idaho teachers can choose to skip that part of the curriculum completely if not reinforced within state standards. I find it ridiculous that politics has parasitically attached itself to a globally paramount issue that has been vindicated by scientific consensus. Students are the future, and should not have their right to be completely and fully educated unwittingly taken away from them.YES climate change is real, and YES climate change should be taught in schools all across the country. Climate change is being caused by us, and it\u2019s a scary topic. The temperature of our Earth is slowly rising every year, which is causing our sea levels to rise.I think that every child deserves the right to get an education on climate change. The children of America are our country\u2019s future and we need to educate them on the problems going on around the world. If this generation of kids is taught about climate change maybe they will find a way to prevent it or maybe even end it for good! Our generation of kids are strong and intelligent, and I am confident in saying that we have the power to change the world for the good, so let our schools teach kids about climate change!Oh, yes! I definitely think that Climate Change should be taught in schools. More than that, I think that students should talk about it, and understand how important and scary it is.Why shouldn\u2019t they? Because president said so? That\u2019s an absurd, that\u2019s not how a modern democratic country works.The president is just an employee (!!!) of the country and not everything he says is true, especially if it\u2019s based not on obvious facts, but on foolish beliefs. I agree with Christopher Taylor when he says that Climate change should not be a political issue, it\u2019s a 100% science and should be treated as such.To not teach real science is just plain wrong. Of course schools should teach about the effects of green house gases and its consequences. This question falls into the same category as evolution and whether the earth is flat or spherical.Education shapes the minds of children everywhere. School systems are responsible for creating a curriculum that effectively educates the youth, and makes them aware of current issues. Climate change is a current issue that affects many people. Therefore, I believe schools should teach about climate change. Climate change is an issue that needs a solution, and by teaching about climate change in schools, the youth can become fully educated and take steps toward solving the problems of climate change.Climate change has always been a reality on earth, but not man-made climate change. Before humans were around, the dinosaurs lived on a tropical earth, and after that there were ice ages, and man had no impact on them. The earth has always changed temperature and climate. Now, there are definitely greenhouse gas issues with the atmosphere, but I do not know if that is what is causing global climate change.I cannot say whether I believe in climate change or not, but I do think that schools should allow children to make their own opinions, rather than making them pawns of the government and indoctrinating them with the ideals of politicians on both sides. The children are the future and should not be corrupted at a young age by the corrupt government that we live under. Yet another example on how we need to fix our country by removing corruption from the government.

{"Headline": "Cash-Strapped Chinese Giant Taps a New Money Source: Its Workers", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Just before payday, an email went out to employees from top executives: Give us your money, and we\u2019ll make it worth your while.It was one of many pitches by HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate struggling under an estimated $90 billion in debt accumulated during a global shopping spree that included buying stakes in multinationals like Hilton Hotels and Deutsche Bank.The company, in an email, advertised an \u201cemployee treasure\u201d product with an 8.5 percent return if workers handed over $1,500. A similar one dangled 9 percent. A third mentioned a return as high as 40 percent if employees ponied up $15,000.These pitches, more than a dozen of which were reviewed by The New York Times, were not part of an employee stock program. Instead, they appear to be high interest loans, with the company as borrower and its workers as lenders.It is unclear how much money HNA has raised from employees. The company has long offered such investments to its employees as a way to incentivize them and to share in the company\u2019s success, Thomas A. Clare, an attorney for HNA, said in an email.\u201cHNA has never approached the offering of these products and opportunities as a financing mechanism, as the amounts contributed by HNA employees to these opportunities are a very small percentage of the funds raised,\u201d he said.Companies around the world allow employees to buy stock or provide other ways for workers to invest in the business. But the HNA pitches do not offer direct ownership stakes in the business.The offers reviewed by The Times had similar hallmarks, namely high returns for funding certain operations.In an email dated Jan. 4, one HNA unit told employees that it needed nearly $8 million to fund a duty free business. It advertised a 9.8 percent annualized interest rate. One week later, HNA\u2019s media and entertainment arm said it was looking to raise nearly $80 million from employees, pledging strong returns and a plan to build up the business.Some emails have asked for big investments, while others emphasized how little employees have to invest to be eligible for hefty returns. One email, dated Jan. 17, offered commissions to employees who referred friends and family.\u201cIf you successfully invite someone else to invest in fixed-term wealth management products,\u201d the email told employees, \u201cyou can get a high commission.\u201d The email did not elaborate.In one seven-day period in January, an HNA employee received seven separate pitches. Mr. Clare said any increase would be the result of trying to incentivize more employees.Chinese companies have often turned to individual investors or their own workers to raise money. But such moves, according to some China finance experts, can signal problems.\u201cIt\u2019s a desperation measure when companies really have no other source of financing and they are stuck,\u201d said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research, a corporate research firm.\u201cInternal funding is a common way for companies to raise funds,\u201d said Sun Lijian, an associate professor at the China Center for Economic Study at Fudan University in Shanghai.\u201cBut employees shouldn\u2019t be forced to contribute and they should be informed of all the details of the project including the risks,\u201d he added.Raising money from workers is legal in China if an employer clears regulatory hurdles, experts say, particularly permission from the country\u2019s central bank. The People\u2019s Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment.Companies raising money directly from Chinese investors must obtain licenses from securities, insurance or banking regulators. The HNA pitches reviewed by The Times did not say whether they were reviewed by regulators.Mr. Clare, HNA\u2019s attorney, said that the offerings comply with all laws and referred questions to the various Chinese regulatory agencies, which did not respond to requests for comment.HNA sometimes directed employees to Jubaohui, its online investment portal, which is generally open to Chinese investors. The portal also has an employees-only area. Publicly, HNA often positions itself as a major player on the move, with talented leadership and vast resources at its disposal.Jubaohui has had trouble paying back some investors, according to an email sent to an investor and reviewed by The Times. It promised to pay later at a higher interest rate, after it was unable to make the final payments of two investments at the end of last year.Mr. Clare, the attorney for HNA, said, \u201cAbsent specific evidence that Jubaohui was actually late in making a required payment, there is no basis for any such statement or speculation.\u201dAs HNA has faced more questions about its operations by both the local and foreign media, the company has issued groupwide emails urging employees to not speak to reporters. In January, HNA\u2019s human resources department told employees they would be required to take a test on how to deal with the news media, according to an internal document reviewed by The Times.Meanwhile, the emails kept flooding employee inboxes.\u201cYour year-end bonus is here,\u201d said one sent on Jan. 15, for an investment tied to HNA\u2019s Qianhai Air and Shipping Exchange arm. In one corner of the email was the animated image of a smiling barrel overflowing with gold coins.The next day, another one backed by Qianhai Air and Shipping was sent out. It cited the rising cost of school and property in major Chinese cities, then contrasted it with the $16 minimum investment for the product, called Ladle Full of Gold.\u201cThe cost of living is high?\u201d it said. \u201cLadle Full of Gold won\u2019t give in!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "We All Have a Stake in the Stock Market, Right? Guess Again", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTake a deep breath and relax.A whopping 84 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households. And that includes everyone\u2019s stakes in pension plans, 401(k)\u2019s and individual retirement accounts, as well as trust funds, mutual funds and college savings programs like 529 plans.There was a move toward democratizing stock ownership in the 1980s and 1990s, with the advent of individual retirement accounts, but the busts of 2001 and 2007 scared off some middle-class investors.But the day-to-day impact on most people\u2019s overall wealth is minimal.A look at some fundamentals may provide a clearer perspective.Roughly half of all households don\u2019t have a cent invested in stocks, whether through a 401(k) account or shares in General Electric. That leaves half the population with some exposure to financial market whims, but as Mr. Boshara said, \u201csome exposure can be 100 bucks.\u201d\u201cIf you look at where the money is really held, it\u2019s among the top 10 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you break it down by age, race and education and parental education, you\u2019ll see the disparities are even larger.\u201d Parents who lack a four-year degree and, later on, their children are much less likely to have a direct stake in the stock market than college graduates; blacks and Hispanics are much less likely than whites.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad such a small percentage of the population has any real or meaningful ownership stake in equities, given their historic and current growth,\u201d Mr. Boshara said.For 9 out of 10 households, even a shift in value of 10 percent \u2014 enough to qualify as a \u201cmarket correction\u201d \u2014 would \u201cat most, have a 1 or 2 percent impact on their wealth holdings,\u201d Mr. Wolff said.Still, valuations of assets and the country\u2019s economic health \u2014 as determined by productivity, employment, investment, spending, housing values, production capacity, growth and more \u2014 are two different kettles.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.\u201cOlder people can buy less stock,\u201d and fewer goods and services, because they are living off their investments rather than accumulating them, Mr. Steuerle said. But younger people can better afford to buy stock while it is cheap, which sets them up for bigger gains down the road.Advertisement"}

Tronc is likely to use the sale proceeds to pay down its debt.\u2014 Sydney EmberAfter days of sometimes wild moves in stock markets, investors on Wall Street refocused on the ongoing strength in the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A sometimes-panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated through the day, and the S.&P. 500 ended Tuesday\u2019s session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs.Investors appeared to reassess whether the previous day\u2019s violent decline\u2014the S.&P. suffered its worst decline since August 2011\u2014reflected actual fundamentals or was merely a long-overdue outbreak of investor jitters.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk higher, as measures of volatility\u2014the ups and downs of stock prices\u2014hit historically low levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop in which growth and inflation remained lackluster, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But the peaceful climb ended over the past week amid worries that solid economic growth in the United States and abroad could be showing early signals of growing inflation pressure. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data\u2014such as the U.S. jobs report on Friday\u2014showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.The Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became the latest prominent company to report solid earnings amidst the market turmoil. The strong numbers support the belief that plunging stock markets do not reflect weakness in the real economy.Disney made $1.89 per share in the last three months of 2017, after excluding a tax benefit. That number is 22 percent higher than the $1.55 per share earnings in the same period of 2016. It is also well in excess of the $1.61 per share that Wall Street analysts had forecast for the latest quarter.Disney did best in its parks and resorts business, which reported $1.35 billion of operating income, which was 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period. The earlier period\u2019s results were somewhat depressed by the impact of Hurricane Matthew, Disney said. In its press release, the company noted that higher profits at its domestic parks and resorts were driven by an increase in guest spending and an increase in attendance, which underscores consumers\u2019 willingness to spend more. On the other hand, the company said parks and resorts are dealing with higher labor costs and other expenses. That may not be lost on investors who are starting to see inflation as a threat to stock prices.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Numbers\u2022 Snap reported revenue rose 72 percent to $285.7 million, easily exceeding the $252.9 million expected by analysts.\u2022 The company lost 13 cents per share, below estimates of 16 cents a share.\u2022 Snap added 8.9 million daily active users for a total of 187 million, compared to the 184.2 million estimated.The ContextSnap\u2019s shares have struggled since its initial public offering in March 2017. The stock fell below its I.P.O price of $17 a share last summer and has remained below that level since. If Snap\u2019s after-hours gains hold up on Wednesday, the stock will be on the cusp of crossing back over its I.P.O. level.The stock market\u2019s slide over the past week has given investors plenty of anxiety.Stocks have lost roughly $4 trillion in value. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 endured their worst point declines in their histories Monday and their largest percentage drops since 2011. C.B.O.E. Volatility Index surged more than 100 percent Monday, the biggest increase in its history.But there are reasons investors shouldn\u2019t get too concerned.Strategists over at Goldman Sachs wrote:\u201cThe stock market correction appears to be more technical and positioning-driven rather than fundamentally-based.We believe the fundamental drivers of the equity market remain intact and reiterate our S&P 500 year-end 2018 forecast of 2850.\u201dHere\u2019s a video of the launch:When stock markets are plunging, sober-minded investors try to gauge the underlying strength of bellwether companies, to see whether all the selling is justified.That is why many eyes will be on the earnings of the Walt Disney Company, which reports after the close of regular trading Tuesday. If the company releases stronger-than-expected results for the three months through the end of December, it will reinforce a general sense of optimism about corporate America .Stellar results from Disney would add to a strong earnings report on Tuesday from General Motors, which helped push the company\u2019s shares 3 percent higher. Micron Technology, a large maker of computer chips, on Monday upped its outlook for the current quarter. Its shares soared 7.7 percent on Tuesday.Though Disney is not a high growth company, its results offer insight into the strength of consumer spending. As a result, if the company reports earnings that are below the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, it may add to the unease among investors..Of course, a lot more companies are going to have to report strong earnings to convince investors to jump back into the stock market. One of the reasons that stocks rallied in recent months is that analysts are expecting a 20-percent plus jump in profits in 2018, an eye-popping rise. The more large companies that hit their numbers in this earnings season, the more likely the stock market will find a floor.\u2014 Peter EavisAt a hearing of the Senate banking committee on Tuesday, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama asked the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the market turmoil.\u201cIs this perhaps more than an ordinary correction?\u201d Mr. Shelby asked.Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C. said that he could not tell what had caused the big declines, but he said that the market infrastructure had held up well under the strain of heavy trading.\u201cAs I sit here today, there\u2019s nothing that came out of this that concerns me,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the C.F.T.C. said that his staff had a late night on Monday checking in with all the exchanges, and had not heard anything that concerned them.\u201cThe system worked as it was designed to do,\u201d he said.\u2014 Nathaniel PopperFollowing a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that he has been in touch with market participants this week and that they are reacting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems. He said it was possible that algorithmic trading was partially responsible for the recent volatility in the stock market.\u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said.Despite that volatility, it does not appear that the Trump administration is ready to give up on the stock market as a measure of its success.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been looking at the long-term impact of the stock market, it\u2019s still up over 30 percent since the election and we continue to think American is a great place to do business,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with companies\u2019 response with more and more investments in the U.S.\u201dAsked about the roiled stock market at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the Trump administration was not concerned and that it remains focused on the long-term trajectory of the economy.\u201cWe are very focused on long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we have enacted, including tax reform are very positive for long-term economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He said that he was closely monitoring for orderly market functioning and that there were \u201cno systemic issues\u201d that were reported to him.\u201cI\u2019m happy to report I got the green lights,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The Treasury secretary said that given how much the market has rallied in the last year, he does not think the recent drop in prices raises financial stability concerns.Asked if the Trump administration will take the blame for the recent drop in stocks after taking credit for the rally, Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\u201cI think we\u2019ll still claim credit for the fact that it\u2019s up over 30 percent since the election,\u201d he said of the stock market.\u2014 Alan RappeportWhen stock markets sell off as they have the past two trading sessions, there is often more than one cause. But one popular trade is taking a lot of blame for Monday\u2019s plunge: short volatility.Investors had piled money into exchange-traded products designed to rise when the C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, falls. The VIX, known as the market\u2019s fear gauge, measures how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead. Those wagers paid off handsomely, rising 180 percent last year as the VIX plumbed historic lows.That quickly reversed Monday. The VIX surged 117 percent in its biggest one-day jump on record and two short volatility exchange-traded product \u2014 VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange Traded Note, XIV, and Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Inverse ETN \u2014 endured heavy selling.From Barclays:\u201cIn our opinion, the significant spike in the VIX index and futures yesterday was technical in nature and does not necessarily indicate a true increase in risk perception.\u201dFrom Morgan Stanley:\u201cThe near bankruptcy of the inverse VIX ETPs will be a very negative headline, and the several billion dollar loss for holders, largely retail, will scare some out of the market or force liquidations of other products to raise cash.\u201dFrom Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research:\u201c Assuming volatility-related ETFs really are a market structure \u201cAchilles heel\u201d, this will take days if not weeks to play out, and there could be other problems waiting in the wings.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u2022 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 5 percent.\u2022 Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 4.7 percent.\u2022 The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was down 2 percent.\u2022 Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d the VIX, is at its highest level in two and a half years.More from Ben White of Politico:\u201cThis is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,\u201d said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. \u201cUntil now, Trump\u2019s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed. Now she\u2019s out the door and volatility is back.\u201dInvestors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down.\u201cCryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,\u201d said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThe combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large.\u201dExpect more give-and-take between the two sides of Congress:\u201cI think everyone understands that this will probably end up being a Ping-Pong situation, and we\u2019ll see where the ball lands,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida.Elsewhere in policyMore from Alex Sherman of CNBC:An unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney\u2019s bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox\u2019s Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox\u2019s assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast.Elsewhere in the deal world\u201cI talked to women engineers at Uber who were getting invited to strip clubs and bondage clubs in the middle of the day.

{"Headline": "Even After High School Massacre, Albany Demurs on Gun Control", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 It was, especially in a restrictive state like New York, a seemingly modest set of gun-control proposals.And yet, the legislative proposals have not been embraced by the Republican-controlled State Senate.On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers tried a different parliamentary gambit: They attached the gun-control proposals to an existing bill, a move known as a hostile amendment, trying to force the Republican leadership to formally vote them down in an election year.Across the nation, the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida has seemingly pushed the needle on gun control; even President Trump, a guns-rights advocate, now says he wants to ban bump stocks and favors tighter background checks.But in New York, the needle was unmoved. Each Republican senator, along with a single rogue Democrat, refused to take it up on Wednesday.\u201cThey have apparently followed the lead of their allies in Washington who are unable to do anything when it comes to sensible gun control,\u201d said Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who leads a group of nearly two dozen Democrats in Albany\u2019s upper chamber. \u201cI was hoping that New York, would be, at least, an example.\u201dThe vote was by no means assured, given the dynamics of the Senate, where the Republicans hold control through their collaboration with nine renegade Democratic senators, eight of whom comprise the Independent Democratic Conference.The Democratic maneuver began with Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s deputy, Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, trying to get the amendments considered and calling for the Senate to act.\u201cWe have to cross a line in our thinking, not only in this state but in the country,\u201d Mr. Gianaris said, adding that it was \u201cmind-boggling to me that we could watch our children die and we\u2019re sitting here making excuses.\u201dTwenty-nine Democrats, including all eight members of the Independent Democratic Conference, voted to consider the amendments, falling short of the 32 needed for passage. Mr. Gianaris failed to persuade a single Republican to consider the measure; more important, he also failed to lure Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat, to his side.Mr. Felder said that he felt the bills were being rushed to the floor in piecemeal fashion.\u201cI do believe that its better to do something that\u2019s as important as this in a very comprehensive way,\u201d said Mr. Felder, who has sponsored a bill to put armed guards at schools, something he says he wished would have been taken up sooner.\u201cI think \u2018now\u2019 is a very broad term,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a balance between doing something expeditiously or doing something immediately that\u2019s not really conclusive, not comprehensive.\u201dThe Independent Democratic Conference and Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019 group of mainstream Democrats have tentatively pledged to form a new majority in April, after two special elections to fill seats vacated by Democrats. (That plan still depends on Mr. Felder, who has repeatedly said he is loyal to no party.)\u201cThose who stand on the wrong side of history on this issue will be judged harshly,\u201d Mr. Gianaris said. \u201cStarting with this election.\u201dScott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, questioned Mr. Gianaris\u2019s foresight. \u201cEvery two years Senator Gianaris predicts our demise and he\u2019s been wrong every single time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win in November because we\u2019re actually delivering on the issues that middle-class families care about: affordability, opportunity, and yes, security.\u201dJust before the push for a vote, the Republican leader of the Senate, John J. Flanagan of Long Island, issued a statement, suggesting a variety of measures aimed at increasing school safety, including more funding for security cameras, armed guards at schools, panic buttons, \u201chardening of school doors,\u201d and \u201ca much stronger response to the mental health issues at the heart of much of this violence.\u201d\u201cEvery responsible option is on the table, and wherever we think we can make a difference, we will act,\u201d Mr. Flanagan said, saying the Senate could consider new legislation by next week.\u201cSchools must be safe havens, where students can learn and teachers can teach. In New York, they will be,\u201d he said. Mr. Flanagan\u2019s statement did not mention the word \u201cguns.\u201d\u201cWhile we need to review the specific legislation, these are all concepts we support as ways to strengthen the strongest gun safety laws in the nation,\u201d said Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor.The governor, a second-term Democrat seeking re-election in the fall, had been more forceful earlier Wednesday on a conference call with reporters, criticizing Republicans in Washington and other states for their \u201cincremental\u201d approach to gun control, including raising the age for buying some weapons, calling it \u201creprehensible political pandering.\u201dBut he also conceded that \u201ca state law cannot solve this problem,\u201d and called on his fellow Democrats in Washington to \u201cput a real gun bill on the table,\u201d including new background checks, a mental health database, and a ban on military-style assault weapons, like the one used at Marjory Stoneman Douglas.Mr. Cuomo also openly mocked ideas like arming teachers or placing more security officers at schools.\u201cThat worked phenomenally well in Florida, right?\u201d said Mr. Cuomo, apparently referencing a Broward County sheriff\u2019s deputy who did not enter the high school after the shooting started, and saying he was bewildered by the idea of \u201cshootouts in classrooms.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an N.R.A. answer,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir answer is always the same: more guns.\u201dMs. Stewart-Cousins seemed disheartened by the lack of action on Wednesday.\u201cTo just do nothing, to continue to do nothing, day after day, week after week, year after year, in the face of things that we really all know are terrible tragedies, that we can do something about,\u201d Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. \u201cIt\u2019s just really unacceptable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Deep Is the Hole the Stock Market Just Stepped In?", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPothole or abyss?After the Dow Jones industrial average index shed 1,175 points on Monday, extending a rout that began in earnest last week, investors will be wondering what size hole the market has just fallen into.Of course, it\u2019s impossible to tell exactly where a bottom is, but there are ways to assess whether a sell-off will gather steam or burn out.Nearly all the economic news has been good in recent weeks, but in the often-neurotic world of investing, the news has perhaps been too good. Two reports last week that wages are growing at a solid pace, for instance, helped prompt the latest selling.Investors fear that an increase in wages, especially at a time of low unemployment, might lead to higher inflation, which in turn could prompt the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly than expected. The higher borrowing costs would then crimp companies\u2019 investment plans, leading eventually to lower economic growth over all. There is no evidence that this chain reaction has begun, but when the stock market is in a skittish mood, it does not wait around for the next economic release.The market will stop sliding when investors start to see bargains and start buying in earnest. But on certain measures, stocks are still expensive.One way to value companies on the stock market is to compare their share prices with their earnings. If, say, a company made a dollar per share last year and its stock trades at $20, it has a price-to-earnings multiple of 20. As the market kept rising in recent months, investors were willing to pay a high price for companies\u2019 earnings. And even after Monday\u2019s plunge, stock valuations still look demanding. At its peak in January, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index traded at 23 times the 2017 profits of the companies in the benchmark. That multiple was well above the average of 19 times for the past five years. If the S.&P. 500 traded at 19 times 2017 earnings, it would be 10 percent lower than Monday\u2019s closing level of 2,649.But there is a more optimistic approach that looks at what companies will make in the future. Now, earnings expectations are bullish, with Wall Street analysts expecting companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase their profits by more than 20 percent. Applying a valuation of 19 times expected 2018 earnings suggests that the market has already sold off too much. But the danger with that approach is that it depends on companies actually delivering those stellar profits. And any sign of a widespread earnings disappointment could set off more selling.Steep and prolonged stock market sell-offs become particularly dangerous when they spread fear through other markets and weigh on the financial system and the wider economy. On that front, it is worth noting that a closely watched index of the S.&P. 500\u2019s volatility, a gauge of fear known on Wall Street as the Vix, more than doubled on Monday. Bond markets have also been hit by selling. At times like this, professional investors, especially those using borrowed money to make their bets, can report shock losses, adding to the climate of fear. And consumers, long buoyed by the rising value of their stock investments, may cut back spending.But there are some grounds for optimism. The financial system has far more protection against losses than it had in 2008, which means it can withstand hits itself and should have the strength to keep serving clients through a rocky period.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Files to Go Public on the New York Stock Exchange", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpotify has already won over the music industry, and listeners worldwide, with an online streaming service that makes millions of songs instantly available. Now, it is ready to test its business model on Wall Street.On Wednesday, the company filed a prospectus to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange, an indication of the imminent arrival of one of the most anticipated technology stocks in years. It was also a signal of the maturation of the streaming market that has already begun to revive the long-struggling music industry.Instead of a traditional initial public offering, Spotify will, as expected, pursue a direct listing of its shares, an unusual process in which no new stock is issued \u2014 and therefore no money is raised. However, existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market.But because Spotify is eschewing Wall Street banks to manage the raising of new capital, the listing could face a rockier reception in the markets. Those banks typically spend weeks assessing investor demand for a company\u2019s shares and try to match the amount that hits the market to ensure the shares are supported.According to the prospectus, investors trading Spotify\u2019s shares in private transactions have valued the company as highly as $23 billion. Spotify\u2019s shares will be traded under the ticker symbol SPOT, but there is no indication of when that will begin.The company, showing no shortage of ambition, said that its mission was \u201cto unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators.\u201dFor the music industry, Spotify \u2014 and the streaming model it has championed \u2014 has been a powerful engine. After more than a decade of decline, the global music market began to turn around in about 2015, just as streaming began to take hold.In the United States, for example, streaming now accounts for about two-thirds of recorded music revenues, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and SoundCloud have become the new outlets where stars develop and hits are minted.Spotify\u2019s prospectus is the most detailed disclosure the company has given about its business.According to the filing, Spotify, which began its streaming service in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States three years later, had nearly $5 billion in revenue in 2017, up 38.6 percent from the year before. In 2016, it had grown by 52 percent.By the end of 2017, Spotify, whose full name is Spotify Technology, had 159 million active users, including 71 million who pay for subscriptions; the rest, using the \u201cfreemium\u201d model that has become Spotify\u2019s marketing hallmark, get free access to music but are subjected to advertisements.As quickly as Spotify has grown, though, so have its losses. Last year, it had a net loss of $1.5 billion, up from about $650 million the year before. Its largest expense, by far, is the cost of licenses from record companies and music publishers.The prospectus also highlights Spotify\u2019s successes, and its value to the music industry. Through the end of last year, the company had paid more than $10 billion in music royalties since its inception, and its \u201cchurn\u201d \u2014 a measure of how many paying users cancel each month \u2014 has been steadily declining, to 5.5 percent in 2017 from 7.7 percent in 2015.The largest stakes are owned by its two founders: Daniel Ek, the chief executive and the company\u2019s public face, and Martin Lorentzon, who holds no executive position. In addition to their shares, they also have \u201cbeneficiary certificates\u201d granting them extra voting rights. In total, Mr. Ek has 37.3 percent voting power over the company, and Mr. Lorentzon 43.1 percent, according to the prospectus.The major record labels also own minority stakes in the company, as a result of licensing deals struck over the years. Sony has the largest, with 5.7 percent; the others were not disclosed.The market for public offerings has been robust so far this year. Through late February, 30 companies listed their shares publicly on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.At least some of the highly valued, privately held technology companies, known as unicorns, could move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity and sell shares publicly.But to convert that paper wealth into actual cash at top dollar, early-stage investors, company founders and employees with stock options need receptive public markets to buy their shares.If the public investors do not think the companies are worth as much as the small number of deep-pocketed investors who dominate the private markets, it could mean the large amounts of paper wealth could be vaporized once the company\u2019s shares start trading.That\u2019s effectively what happened last year, when some prominent public offerings fizzled once the shares were trading publicly. Shares of Snap, the start-up behind the popular Snapchat app, surged when it went public last March, but it has since had difficulty staying above its offering price of $17 a share. And the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June, is now trading at less than $3 a share.Given that it involves a direct listing, Spotify\u2019s debut on the public markets has the potential to be even more volatile.Matt Phillips contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gun Smoke and Mirrors", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs I watched President Trump blathering to a group of governors on Monday about throwing people who have not committed a crime into mental hospitals to prevent mass shootings at schools, I recalled a country where I once lived in which the government had that power \u2014 the Soviet Union.From the mid-1960s until the fall of Soviet Communism, the Kremlin employed the notion of \u201csluggish schizophrenia\u201d \u2014 dreamed up by the Mengele-like psychiatrist Andrei Snezhnevsky \u2014 to imprison people on the ground that they were on their way to becoming insane.Rejected by most civilized nations as a transparent fraud, sluggish schizophrenia was used against dissidents and other citizens who simply dared to seek exit visas. When I worked in Moscow as a reporter in the mid-1980s, I knew an Estonian man who was committed twice for refusing to enter the Red Army during the war in Afghanistan, an act of sanity. It was a literal Catch-22.Now comes Trump, urging the nation\u2019s governors to return to a time when he said the states could \u201cnab\u201d people and throw them in a padded room because \u201csomething was off.\u201dIn fact, the law has required court-ratified findings of actual mental illness for involuntary commitment since around 1881, said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s medical school. \u201cIt was never the case that people could be involuntary committed for being a little odd, or even for that matter thought to be dangerous to other people unless they had evidence of mental illness,\u201d he said.I\u2019m not bringing this up to suggest that Trump is a disciple of Snezhnevsky, despite his bizarre affinity for Kremlin autocracy, or merely to point out that the president was once again making things up. Rather, it is an example of the incoherent, insincere and inadequate ways in which the president and others on the right are suddenly claiming to be dedicated to addressing the nation\u2019s epidemic of gun violence.They are playing a cynical game of misdirection.It is tragic that in recent decades, states have closed mental hospitals and thrown people into prisons when they should be receiving psychiatric care. But that has little to do with gun violence \u2014 in or out of schools, on a small or mass scale.Similarly, the president\u2019s newfound support for banning bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic weapons to be fired nearly as rapidly as automatic ones, is fine, on the surface. But bump stocks could have been banned at any time before or since a killer used them to murder 58 people in Las Vegas last fall, and Trump has done nothing to make it happen.Some politicians \u2014 so far not including Trump or the Republican leadership in Congress \u2014 are calling for raising the age to buy a semiautomatic weapon to 21 from 18. (The person charged with the murders in Parkland, Fla., this month was 19.)There should be such a law, on a national basis and not state by state, but Everytown found that only 5 percent of the mass shooters it studied were under 20. And of course, mass shooting victims account for a tiny percentage of the Americans gunned down every year. A majority of children killed by guns are killed by accident, or by their own hand, or by adults, with weapons legally obtained by adults.Trump also chimed in on calls from the right to arm more teachers and train them to shoot would-be killers. It\u2019s an absurd and dangerous idea. Highly trained police officers frequently miss their targets, even at close range, in the heat of the moment. Having armed civilians at a shooting scene would just make their jobs harder.The real problem with gun violence is not about mental hospitals, armed teachers, bump stocks or age requirements. The real problem is that there are far too many firearms in America \u2014 more than 300 million, according to Congress. They are too easy to obtain and they are becoming ever more lethal.But the gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association, has stopped every effort to reduce the number and lethality of firearms, a crusade that seems as much or more about expanding the markets for firearms makers than about constitutional principles.Banning the possession of semiautomatic weapons by civilians would be a better approach. So would repealing lax concealed-carry laws, stand-your-ground laws and other rules that are proliferating around America to make it easier to shoot someone and get away with it.The risk is that the passage of a few partial measures will take our eyes off the bigger picture and drain the energy out of the demands for change led by young people after the Parkland slaughter. That is what the gun lobby is counting on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Proposes Stiff Penalties on Steel and Aluminum Imports", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration for the first time declared imports of steel and aluminum from China and other nations a threat to national security, laying the foundation for President Trump to impose the types of punitive tariffs he has long championed.Yet erecting barriers could prompt swift retaliation from other trading partners, including China and the European Union, which have already warned of reciprocal action in response to protectionist measures. It could also further erode relations with foreign allies that might be ensnared by the measure and drive up prices for American consumers.Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, outlined three alternatives Mr. Trump could choose from to protect American steel producers, which have struggled to compete with a flood of cheap metals from China and other countries. The options included a broad 24 percent tariff on all steel imports, or a targeted 53 percent tariff on all steel products from 12 countries, including China, Brazil, India, South Korea and Vietnam. Under this option, imports from all other countries would be limited to the level they imported in 2017.Mr. Ross also proposed an alternative for the steel industry that involved no tariffs, but would set a quota limiting steel imports from all countries to roughly two-thirds the level they were at last year.For aluminum, the Commerce Department also outlined three alternatives, including a flat 7.7 percent tariff on imports from all countries, or a targeted 23.6 percent tariff on aluminum from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam. A third option involved putting into effect quotas to limit aluminum imports to lower levels than were shipped to the United States last year.Mr. Ross did not indicate which way Mr. Trump might go, saying the president could pick a separate path, or reject the penalties altogether. But the president\u2019s longstanding support for tariffs and his recent remarks suggest he is likely to support some kind of action.\u201cThis is a step in the right direction, and hopefully the president responds sooner than later,\u201d said Todd Leebow, the chief executive of Majestic Steel USA, which buys American-made steel from mills to sell to customers in construction, agriculture and other industries. Mr. Leebow said he had seen a troubling decline in the industry in recent years, and he was hopeful Mr. Trump\u2019s measure might reverse that.But the investigation has also prompted criticism from American industries that use steel and aluminum to make their products, including automakers and food packagers. These businesses say tariffs or quotas will cause their prices to rise and shrink their profits, and could end up costing American jobs.Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, a think tank that supports free markets, said that for every one steelworker that may be helped by trade restrictions, more than 38 workers in other sectors that could be harmed by it. \u201cThere is ample evidence that import taxes will harm economic growth and cost American jobs,\u201d she said.In a call with reporters on Friday, Mr. Ross played down any negative impact from the trade actions, saying that any increase in the cost of steel and aluminum for products like soft drinks and canned soup would be \u201ctrivial.\u201d \u201cWe really don\u2019t buy that argument,\u201d Mr. Ross said.Shares of American steel companies, including United States Steel, Nucor and AK Steel, rose following the release of the report. Stocks of Ford Motor Company and General Motors, which purchase aluminum and steel for their cars, declined.United Steelworkers, which strongly supported the tariffs, commended Mr. Ross\u2019s announcement. \u201cThese recommendations have the potential to focus on the bad actors in the world that historically and systemically cheat in international trade,\u201d said Leo W. Gerard, the president of United Steelworkers International.Companies with operations outside of the United States were more circumspect. Aluminum companies including Alcoa, Rio Tinto Aluminum and Constellium issued statements urging the administration to exempt Canada, a major supplier of aluminum, from the rule, and focus on the issue of Chinese overcapacity instead.Mr. Trump will have authority to determine which countries should be subject to any trade action, in part because of way in which the investigation was started. In April, the administration opened an investigation into steel and aluminum imports with a little-used provision of trade law that gives the president broad discretion to act to protect national security.But American options for aiming at China directly are limited. Because the United States has already imposed a raft of restrictions on Chinese steel in previous years, only 2 percent of American steel imports came directly from China in 2015.That means that any measures from the Trump administration are likely to weigh more heavily on other countries, including some close allies. In 2016, Canada accounted for the largest proportion of United States steel imports, about 17 percent, followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Turkey and Japan.Allies including the European Union, South Korea and Japan have also pushed back against the United States curbing imports, saying their products support the American military by providing a secure supply of metals, rather than harming it.Advertisement"}

Chief Goes Against the Administration Stereotype", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "Trump RulesDr. Scott Gottlieb isn\u2019t rolling back his agency\u2019s mission, although he is straddling the interests of the drug and health industries along with public health.Supported byA millionaire with a libertarian bent, he made his money working for the industry he now regulates, and had investments in 20 health care companies whose products could come before the agency for approval. Pharmaceutical and medical device executives enthusiastically supported his nomination, while consumer and public health groups sounded the requisite alarms.Now, more than nine months after he was confirmed, Dr. Gottlieb has achieved something unusual among President Trump\u2019s appointees: He has quieted some skeptics, while also managing to keep industry supporters content and the president on his side. He has done so by making moves to protect public health while also offering rewards to industry \u2014 double plays that have some willing to give him a second look.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to blow up the agency,\u201d said Mark I. Schwartz, a Washington lawyer who worked at the F.D.A. in Republican and Democratic administrations.So far, the commissioner has displayed a collaborative management style, seeming to allay the concerns of some career employees who had balked at his industry ties and were dismayed by articles he had written criticizing the F.D.A. He has overcome some divisions by promoting several agency veterans, but he has also hired a few industry insiders for top positions. He is described by staff as energetic and intense, while holding town hall-style meetings before making decisions.\u201cHe\u2019s being thoughtful; he\u2019s being deliberative,\u201d said William Hubbard, who retired from the F.D.A. after 30 years, including work as a consultant to a former commissioner, Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, until she stepped down in 2015. \u201cHe seems to be putting aside some of his more extreme rhetoric from when he was outside, and working through the issues with a public-health orientation.\u201d\u201cI thought he was a bad pick,\u201d said Andrew Kolodny, a co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University. \u201cBut I may have been wrong.\u201dEven as Dr. Gottlieb makes some progress, there are major unsettled regulatory matters before the agency. They include the extent to which drug companies can market their products for off-label uses as well as how much oversight is needed for the laboratory-developed tests that hospitals and doctors often use to detect conditions ranging from heart disease to ovarian cancer \u2014 a booming business.Among the most far-reaching decisions will be the efforts taken to reduce the time for drug companies to develop new drugs.\u201cThat is where anxiety lies,\u201d said Mr. Hubbard, who added that the key will be ensuring that, in moving new products to market more quickly, public health is not compromised. \u201cThe test will be whether he can do that safely, and we won\u2019t know the results of that for quite some time.\u201dHe has taken steps to speed drug and device approvals, and has promised to do more.Dr. Michael Carome, director of the consumer group Public Citizen\u2019s health research arm and a former health department official, opposed Dr. Gottlieb for the job, and has not seen anything to change his mind.\u201cThe bottom line is this: He\u2019s pursuing a pro-industry deregulatory agenda that ultimately is going to put patients at risk,\u201d Dr. Carome said. \u201cThe F.D.A. now views industry as their customers, and they need to keep them happy.\u201dDr. Gottlieb\u2019s Republican credentials made him a strong candidate for the agency\u2019s top post from the beginning. He had previously worked for both the Department of Health and Human Services and the F.D.A. during the administration of President George W. Bush.Critics pointed to Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s stints on advisory boards for pharmaceutical companies, among them GlaxoSmithKline and Daiichi Sankyo, and his consultant work for others, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Bristol-Myers Squibb.His investments through New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm, and T.R. Winston & Company, an investment bank, were also called into question. Earlier in Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s career, before attending the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, he worked as a health care investment banking analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons.That experience, Dr. Gottlieb has said, benefits the F.D.A. because it helps him understand the industry. He has recused himself for two years from matters concerning about 20 companies with which he was associated \u2014 in accordance with the White House ethics pledge. The day he was sworn in, he sold all of his health-related stock, including investments in Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Collective Health and U.S. Renal Care, according to a financial report filed with the Office of Government Ethics. He purchased government bond funds.Like most of Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees, Dr. Gottlieb has also hired industry lawyers and lobbyists whose former clients often have business before the agency. Among them are Jack Kalavritinos, an associate commissioner who had lobbied for the device maker Covidien, now owned by Medtronic, for seven years; Nina Devlin, a senior communications adviser who was the head of global communications at Mylan, makers of the EpiPen; and Rebecca K. Wood, who was a partner in the law firm Sidley Austin and is now the agency\u2019s top lawyer.He has already disagreed with an administration position, objecting to a plan to move an international food-safety division to the trade office, saying it would hurt the country\u2019s reputation as a food watchdog.The administration backed down on the trade matter, but Dr. Gottlieb has been forced to compromise on other issues. Last October, he questioned proposals backed by Vice President Mike Pence and others that would give terminally ill patients greater access to experimental treatments. He did make a concession \u2014 promising that the F.D.A. would find a way to make it easier for patients to get some of those treatments, although he noted that the agency already approves 99 percent of such requests. Mr. Trump also recently told Republican lawmakers that Dr. Gottlieb was leading the effort to get legislation passed by Congress.That balancing act has also been on display in Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s approach to regulating tobacco. Last July, he sent tobacco stocks into a dive after he vowed to take aggressive steps to render cigarettes nonaddictive by forcing manufacturers to cut nicotine levels.But even as he railed against big tobacco, Dr. Gottlieb softened the blow by delaying for several years the deadline for companies to comply with tough new rules on e-cigarettes, cigars and other products.At the time, he said smokers needed better and more substitutes to get them off nicotine.But whether he can maintain that balance remains to be seen: Last month, an F.D.A. advisory committee rejected a major alternative tobacco product to be considered under the new regulations, saying its manufacturer, Philip Morris International, could not claim it was safer than cigarettes. The product under review was the IQOS, a heated tobacco stick device that the company wanted to market as a healthier alternative to cigarettes.If the industry can\u2019t overcome such hurdles for approval or finds the process too cumbersome and expensive \u2014 Philip Morris is spending billions of dollars developing smoking alternatives that would need agency approval \u2014 Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s efforts to straddle the division between public health and commerce could be hobbled.Despite the panel\u2019s rejection \u2014 the experts questioned the science behind the product \u2014 agency officials were quick to say they would continue reviewing Philip Morris\u2019s studies and would ask for more information.Kenneth Warner, a tobacco control expert and dean emeritus of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said he found it surprising that the F.D.A. was taking such strong steps to rein in the tobacco industry. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat ironic to me that it takes a Republican administration to think about a new regulation like that, that would have a benefit for public health,\u201d he said.Congressional Democrats, though, are still smarting from Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s decision to extend the deadline for compliance with new e-cigarette rules, which took effect in 2016. The rules called for companies with products already on the market to disclose their contents and to prove their positive impact on public health in order to gain approval.High drug prices \u2014 and what to do about them \u2014 were a frequent topic of the last election, and the Trump administration seems poised to offer some new proposals in its budget.Here, Dr. Gottlieb has shifted the agency\u2019s position. F.D.A. officials have traditionally said that regulating prices is beyond the agency\u2019s purview. But Dr. Gottlieb has taken steps to encourage more competition for products that have lost patent protection, including shortening an agency backlog for approvals of new generic drugs and publishing a list of off-patent drugs for which there is no alternative.He surprised critics by holding up for ridicule brand-name drug companies that had refused to supply would-be rivals with samples of their drugs to deter generic competition.The commissioner\u2019s actions so far are likely to do little to substantially lower prices for most Americans, and they notably do not address the towering prices that brand-name drugmakers set for their products.Still, Chester Davis Jr., president and chief executive of the Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents generic drug companies, was effusive. \u201cThe commissioner has been very effective in using his bully pulpit to shine a very bright light on anti-competitive practices,\u201d Mr. Davis said.Any decision the agency makes worries people like Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, who was at the F.D.A. in the Obama administration. \u201cIf the F.D.A. surrenders on First Amendment issues, there could be very serious consequences for the agency\u2019s ability to do its job,\u201d he said.Senator Murray is still concerned about Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s leadership, saying the agency wasn\u2019t doing enough on nutrition or to keep children away from tobacco products. She added that \u201cthe F.D.A. is too often focused on doing what\u2019s best for massive corporations, rather than patients and families.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, was also an early critic, but she has grown more supportive. \u201cDr. Gottlieb is willing to tackle tough problems,\u201d Senator Warren said. \u201cI let him know when I think he\u2019s got it wrong, and when he\u2019s got it right.\u201dJennifer Miller, an assistant professor and clinical trials transparency expert at New York University School of Medicine, said a pilot program started by Dr. Gottlieb, in which pharmaceutical firms voluntarily release information about their clinical studies for approved drugs, was a step in the right direction.\u201cThe industry is already trending toward releasing them,\u201d Dr. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe time to roll out a pilot. I think he\u2019ll likely be successful and learn what works and what didn\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But an alternative way to view the tensions is that so much trade goes on between Britain and the bloc, and others ties are so deep, that both sides will ultimately strike a new relationship that retains much of the existing one. As analysts at Nomura wrote earlier this week:In terms of the bespoke deal issue, we think it is not credible to say the U.K. can only take an off-the-shelf Norway / Switzerland / Turkey / Ukraine / Canada / Mexico deal. They were all bespoke deals when they were made. The idea that the world\u2019s seventh largest economy, an ex-member and a country that will still have strong institutional, economic and geographic ties to the E.U. should not get a bespoke deal is not reasonable, in our view.The paper, produced by the Belgian government for a meeting of diplomats last week, will prove a huge boost to British negotiators and gives new insight into E.U. thinking.\u2014 Peter EavisPresident Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda seems to have met its match in the obscure world of international financial regulation.A big reason the Treasury held back: The concerns of foreign regulators.Further, these judges, once designated, could engage in planning and coordination exercises, including cross-border efforts (e.g., the crisis management groups discussed above).Instead, fearing higher costs for United States banks, the Treasury apparently gave the concerns of foreign regulators considerable weight and took an internationalist approach.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Chinese manufacturer has built up a $9 billion stake, or just under 10 percent, in the German automaker and parent of Mercedes-Benz.From Bloomberg:The investment in the parent of Mercedes-Benz furthers Hangzhou-based Geely\u2019s foray into the European premium automotive market and ends months of speculation.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Volatile Again. Get Used to It.", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fear generated by Wall Street\u2019s sharp fall in recent days had been greatly magnified by the calm that preceded it. Before the 8 percent decline in United States stocks over the past week \u2014 which was followed by a bounce back of nearly 2 percent on Tuesday \u2014 the S. & P. 500 had gone two years without suffering a drop that large. Spoiled by this unnaturally placid stretch, many Americans had forgotten what a routine market setback even looks like.They better get used to this. In a typical year, according to data going back three decades, the market experiences a correction of about 10 percent. What Americans are witnessing now is thus a return to normal market behavior, which has never followed a straight line.This year could be pivotal, because the conditions that underpinned the steady upward march of stock prices are now likely to deteriorate. In the United States and around the world, stocks have been buoyed by the trifecta of accelerating global growth, low inflation and loose central bank policies, all of which are now poised to turn against the bubbly market.This looming shortage of workers is now putting upward pressure on wage growth, which has been steadily rising in recent months. And historically, wage growth has been a strong driver of inflation, as workers use their expanded paycheck to bid up prices for goods and services.The scale and timing of a turn in the markets is likely to be decided by the third leg of the trifecta: easy money. Central banks have been printing money like never before, holding interest rates at record lows for extended stretches. Investors have used this cheap liquidity to drive up prices for everything from stocks and bonds to Bitcoin and fine art. The United States stock market is now around 25 percent higher than it would have been had it grown at its historic average pace.Stock values have rarely risen so high, yet many seasoned investors had come to believe that these nosebleed valuations could be justified as long as the Federal Reserve Board kept interest rates low. When investors are worried about the future, they move money into cash, and today their cash balances are at record lows. In other words, complacency was arguably at a record high when the correction began last week.In the past, whenever the stock market has been this expensive, an increase in interest rates has brought it back down to earth. In recent years, the swelling size of the stock market has magnified the potential economic impact of a correction. If the stock market suddenly reverts to its long-term trend, implying a fall of almost 25 percent, it could push the American economy close to recession.All eyes are now on the central bank. Confidence that the idyllic economic conditions of the past year will last indefinitely has been rattled, particularly as wage growth begins to signal a return of inflation. Many investors are fretting that the Fed may be compelled to raise rates faster than anyone had expected, just the kind of negative surprise that could deflate sky-high prices in all assets, and not only for stocks. The year 2018 may be remembered as the time when the moody market beast returned to its natural state.Advertisement"}

The short answer is that, in most places in the world, the reckless borrowing that led up to the financial crisis of 2008 does not seem to have reoccurred. Still, when a long period of low interest rates ends, as appears to be the case now, all the borrowers and lenders who have grown used to cheap credit may retrench in ways that may not be initially obvious.

{"Headline": "U.N. Links North Korea to Syria\u2019s Chemical Weapons Program", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 North Korea has been shipping supplies to the Syrian government that could be used in the production of chemical weapons, United Nations experts contend.The evidence of a North Korean connection comes as the United States and other countries have accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons on civilians, including recent attacks on civilians in the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta using what appears to have been chlorine gas.The supplies from North Korea include acid-resistant tiles, valves and thermometers, according to a report by United Nations investigators. North Korean missile technicians have also been spotted working at known chemical weapons and missile facilities inside Syria, according to the report, which was written by a panel of experts who looked at North Korea\u2019s compliance with United Nations sanctions.The report highlights the potential danger posed by any such trade between Syria and North Korea, which could allow Syria to maintain its chemical weapons while also providing North Korea with cash for its nuclear and missile programs.The possible chemical weapons components were part of at least 40 previously unreported shipments by North Korea to Syria between 2012 and 2017 of prohibited ballistic missile parts and materials that could be used for both military and civilian purposes, according to the report, which has not been publicly released but which was reviewed by The New York Times.Neither the report\u2019s authors nor members of the United Nations Security Council who have seen it would comment, and neither would the United States\u2019 mission to the international agency.It is unclear when, or even whether, the report will be released.\u201cI don\u2019t know about its publication date, if any,\u201d St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday in response to queries. Asked to comment on the report, he said, \u201cI think the overarching message is that all member states have a duty and responsibility to abide by the sanctions that are in place.\u201dThe eight experts who make up the panel all come from different countries and possess specific expertise in areas like weapons of mass destruction, maritime transport and customs controls. Since 2010 the panel has had a mandate from the Security Council to investigate possible sanctions violations by North Korea and present its findings in an annual report.Though experts who viewed the report said the evidence it cited did not prove definitively that there was current, continuing collaboration between North Korea and Syria on chemical weapons, they said it did provide the most detailed account to date of efforts to circumvent sanctions intended to curtail the military advancement of both countries.William Newcomb, who was a member of the United Nations panel of experts on North Korea from 2011 to 2014, called the report \u201can important breakthrough.\u201dSince the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, there have been suspicions that North Korea was providing equipment and expertise to maintain the chemical weapons program of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. Those suspicions were not assuaged when in 2013 Syria signed onto the Chemical Weapons Convention and claimed to give up its chemical weapons stocks.\u201cWe knew stuff was going on,\u201d Mr. Newcomb said. \u201cWe really wanted to up the game on chemical weapons programs, and we just weren\u2019t able to get what we needed to do so.\u201dThe report, which is more than 200 pages long, includes copies of contracts between North Korean and Syrian companies as well as bills of lading indicating the types of materials shipped. Much information was provided by unidentified United Nations member states.The military-related cooperation, if confirmed, indicates major shortcomings in the international effort to isolate both countries. The shipments would have eluded detection even though both nations are subject to highly restrictive sanctions, and are under the intense scrutiny of American and other spy services.North Korea\u2019s relationship with Syria takes up one section of the report, which also documents the many ways the government of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, has tried to circumvent sanctions. It describes how North Korea uses a complex web of shell companies and sympathetic foreign citizens to gain access to international financing, employs sophisticated cyber operations to steal military secrets and enlists its own diplomats in smuggling operations.It also criticizes Russia and China for failing to do enough to enforce sanctions on items like oil, coal and luxury goods.The sanctions, it says, have yet to be matched \u201cby the requisite political will, international coordination, prioritization and resource allocation necessary to drive effective implementation.\u201dThe report gives fresh details of a military relationship between North Korea and Syria that goes back decades. During the Arab-Israeli wars in the 1960s and 1970s, North Korean pilots flew missions with the Syrian Air Force. Later, North Korean technicians helped to develop Syria\u2019s arsenal of ballistic missiles and to build a nuclear power plant capable of producing plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons. Israel destroyed the plant in 2007.In 2015, Syria honored that assistance by opening a monument and park in Damascus dedicated to North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung, grandfather of the current leader. The unveiling ceremony, held as Syria\u2019s civil war raged, featured North Korean and Syrian dignitaries, military officials and a marching band.North Korea has provided training and support for Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program since at least the 1990s, according to a coming book by Bruce Bechtol, a former Korea analyst at the United States Defense Intelligence Agency who is now a professor at Angelo State University in Texas. The book also describes an accident in 2007 in which several Syrian technicians, along with North Korean and Iranian advisers, were killed in the explosion of a warhead filled with sarin gas and the extremely toxic nerve agent VX.The relationship with Syria \u201chas been a boon for the North Korean military-industrial complex,\u201d Mr. Bechtol said in an interview.The United Nations report says the cooperation continued during Syria\u2019s civil war, despite international sanctions. Crucial evidence of that was found in January 2017, when two ships carrying acid-resistant tiles, commonly used in the construction of chemical weapons factories, were interdicted at sea en route to Damascus, the report said.Those shipments were among five deliveries agreed to in a contract between a government-owned company in Syria and the Korea Mining Development Trading Corp., a North Korean company involved in arms exports, according to the report. It based those findings at least in part on copies of contracts provided by the shipping company, identified as Cheng Tong Trading Co. Ltd., based in China.The report said the three other shipments had been sent between Nov. 3 and Dec. 12, 2016.The report did not say which country interdicted the two January tile shipments or whether the other three shipments were delivered to Damascus. The contract stipulated that the materials were to be delivered to the Metallic Manufacturing Factory, a company run by the Syrian government that was penalized by the United States Treasury Department last year for its involvement in Syria\u2019s weapons industry.Several months earlier, in August 2016, a delegation of North Korean missile technicians visited Syria, at which point there was a transfer of \u201cspecial resistance valves and thermometers known for use in chemical weapons,\u201d the report said, without elaborating. An unidentified United Nations member country told the report\u2019s authors that North Korean missile technicians worked at Syrian chemical weapons and missile facilities in Barzeh, Adra and Hama.In 2013, after the Obama administration threatened military action in response to a sarin gas attack on the rebel enclave of Ghouta that some experts estimated killed 1,400 people, Mr. Assad agreed to destroy his stockpile and join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which comprises 192 countries that are to have dismantled their chemical weapons programs.But Western officials and nonproliferation experts have long suspected that Mr. Assad retains some chemical weapons.So far this year, according to diplomats and witnesses, several chlorine gas attacks have occurred in rebel-held areas in Ghouta, Idlib and Afrin. A separate United Nations panel also said Mr. Assad\u2019s forces were responsible for a sarin gas attack on the rebel-held village of Khan Sheikhoun last April that killed at least 83 people and sickened roughly 300.Mallory Stewart, a former State Department official who was involved in the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program, said that there were always concerns that the Assad government had not listed all of its chemical weapons stockpile on its declared inventory of what it gave up. The report, she says, \u201cconfirms everything we\u2019ve been saying.\u201d\u201cCertainly what we tried to do in the last administration is dismantle the entire chemical weapons program,\u201d Ms. Stewart said, \u201cwhich we know they never did.\u201dEstablishing the origins of such weapons has been difficult. In November, Russia used its Security Council veto to end the work of an independent panel investigating chemical weapons used in the Syrian conflict. The Joint Investigative Mechanism, as it was known, had found that both the Syrian government and Islamic State militants had used chemical weapons in the war, though Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations labeled the panel\u2019s reporting \u201ca joke.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the role William Newcomb played on a United Nations panel of experts on North Korea. He was a member of the panel, not the chairman.Anne Barnard contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.videovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Bitcoin Bubble Loses Air, Frauds and Flaws Rise to Surface", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 You did not have to be a technophobe to worry that the virtual-currency boom of the past year papered over plenty of problems.The scale of those problems is starting to become clear as digital tokens have slid more than 50 percent in value from their peaks in early January, with steep drops on Monday pushing the value of Bitcoin specifically below $7,000.Hackers draining funds from online exchanges. Ponzi schemes. Government regulators unable to keep up with the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies. Signs of trouble have appeared at nearly every level of the industry, from the biggest exchanges to the news sites and chat rooms where the investment frenzy has been discussed.Some virtual currency enthusiasts argue that the problems are no different from what has happened in other booms, like the internet bubble of the 1990s. But even true believers say the design of virtual currencies \u2014 meant to cut out middlemen and government authorities \u2014 has made bad behavior more prevalent amid this particular bubble.\u201cCryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,\u201d said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThe combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large. The fact that the money got huge almost overnight, before there were good regulatory or even self-regulatory models in place, made the problem acute.\u201dThe fall from the peaks of early January has been dizzying. The value of all outstanding virtual currencies has been cut by more than half, down over $400 billion as of Monday, according to the website Coinmarketcap.com.Government agencies in the United States have shut down a few notable frauds. Early last month, securities regulators in Texas and North Carolina issued cease-and-desist orders to BitConnect, an operation that had grown to be worth $3 billion.But those moves only came after BitConnect had operated openly for months, collecting hundreds of millions of dollars from people around the world despite being labeled a Ponzi scheme by many prominent people in the virtual currency industry. BitConnect offered tokens on a decentralized network, similar to Bitcoin, but promised regular payouts to coin holders.But regulators have not gotten near most of the brazen schemes that have popped up in the past year, many of which had been attacked by hackers first, or simply shut down by their operators after money had been raised.One challenge facing regulators is that it is unclear how much of the deceptive activity they can legally control.Many schemes have been able to expand quickly because they do not use bank accounts and therefore do not have to win approval from established institutions. Instead, they are able to use virtual currency \u201cwallets\u201d without any approvals. And virtual currency transactions cannot be reversed like normal bank or even PayPal transfers.For investors, some of what has caused the most concern are well-intentioned businesses set up in a hurry with little outside oversight or time to work out kinks.Coincheck, which until last month was one of the largest exchanges in Japan, announced on Jan. 26 that it had lost nearly half a billion dollars of a virtual currency known as NEM, in what appeared to be the largest hack to hit the industry.In the United States, even the most widely used virtual currency company, Coinbase, has struggled to keep up with demand, shutting down trading for hours at particularly important moments, and attracting widespread complaints about its customer service.Most of the newer virtual currency projects borrow their basic design from Bitcoin, which uses a network of computers to maintain its records so that no central government or authority is needed.That design has allowed Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to grow as fast as they have with no regard for international borders, attracting followers from Zimbabwe to South Korea. It has also allowed some of the most talked-about uses of the technology, helping people escape hyperinflation in Venezuela or transfer money across borders with lower fees. But it has also allowed in a lot of bad actors.\u201cIt is a perfect storm for the kind of scammy activity we are seeing, and it\u2019s not obvious to me how that is easily removed,\u201d said Fred Wilson, a partner at the venture capital firm Union Square Venture and one of the earliest advocates of Bitcoin in Silicon Valley. \u201cRegulation, ideally prudent and informed regulation, can help. But we may also need to have a big correction to really clean things up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Asked for Patience. Remarkably, Wall Street Complied.", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAllen Gillespie is one lonely stock analyst.Of the dozens of Wall Street analysts covering Amazon, he is the only one tracked by Bloomberg who recommends that investors sell the company\u2019s shares.Mr. Gillespie, a partner at FinTrust Investment Advisors, a wealth management firm in Greenville, S.C., questions whether Amazon deserves such a stratospheric share price.\u201cEverybody thinks I am crazy,\u201d said Mr. Gillespie, who also serves on the board overseeing South Carolina\u2019s pension fund. \u201cI have had people I\u2019ve never met email me to ask if I was serious.\u201dIt is a bold call indeed. Since Mr. Gillespie put a sell rating on the company last July, Amazon\u2019s shares have increased 37 percent, to $1,429. On Friday, one day after Amazon reported the biggest quarterly profit in its history, Amazon\u2019s market value briefly crossed the $700 billion mark, and its share price increased 3 percent even as the Dow fell 2.5 percent.For most analysts, the end is not yet in sight. When the investment firm D.A. Davidson & Company predicted last month that Amazon\u2019s shares could rise to $1,800, Morgan Stanley upped the ante the next day, forecasting a possible $2,100 share price.\u201cIt\u2019s an infatuation,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern business school, who recently published a book about Amazon, Google and other tech giants.How that infatuation developed is the story of a company that figured out how to tame Wall Street. In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along.Over its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway.\u201cI think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn\u2019t deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,\u201d said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon.In part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn\u2019t appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years.In a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company\u2019s ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them.\u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Long Term.\u2019\u2019Mr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.And its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year \u2014 hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see.Yet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.It may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true.\u201cIf Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,\u201d said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.)The reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street\u2019s old rules, which demand consistent profit growth.It wasn\u2019t always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys.But like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon\u2019s shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival.Mr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days. But it took many years for investors who had been burned by the dot-com crash to give Amazon a second chance.For long stretches from 2002 to 2006, Amazon\u2019s stock price languished, while it invested in researching and developing new technologies and businesses.Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets, looked at the company\u2019s slipping profit margins during that period and warned investors to stay away.Mr. Mahaney said he failed to realize \u201cthat all that spending on R.&D. was a bullish sign for the future.\u201d He has had a buy rating on the company for more than a decade.Those long-term investments, which Amazon didn\u2019t detail at the time, eventually gave rise to some of the company\u2019s most profitable businesses, like its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services.The success of the cloud computing business proved a tipping point. If investors allowed Amazon to spend time and money investing, patience would pay off.By now, Wall Street has been well trained to believe that Amazon has a strategy for Whole Foods and it will take time to carry it out.\u201cWhat the market finally figured out is Amazon is extremely good at investing those dollars,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the investment officer at Miller Value Partners.Ultimately, much of the investor confidence in Amazon reflects a belief in its future opportunity \u2014 what investors frequently call a company\u2019s \u201caddressable market.\u201dFor Amazon, the addressable market in retail is roughly $5 trillion in the United States and many times that globally, Mr. Miller said. And that\u2019s not even including the traditional information technology market that Amazon Web Services is attacking. \u201cI asked Jeff what the addressable market is for A.W.S.,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018Trillions and trillions.\u2019\u201dEven Mr. Gillespie, the skeptic, acknowledges that Amazon is \u201coperating extremely well.\u201d But he questions whether years of low interest rates have helped inflate Amazon\u2019s value because investors are so starved for return, they are willing to overlook some of the risks.Those risks, he said, include regulators deciding the company is growing too large or not paying its fair share in taxes.\u201cPeople tend to assume away these things,\u201d he said.Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Worried About Inflation. Should It Be?", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs the economy at risk of overheating? The answer will depend on what really drives price increases, and what the Fed does.To the degree the recent wild swings in the stock market are rooted in economic fundamentals, these are the fundamentals to fear: that the already strong economy may overheat, inflation may spike, and the Federal Reserve may then raise interest rates more aggressively to try to combat that higher inflation.The kernel of evidence that supported those fears was a report Friday that average hourly earnings for American workers rose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ended in January, the highest since the economic expansion began nine years ago.It\u2019s only a single data point, and an erratic one at that. But when paired with a rock-bottom unemployment rate and some signs of acceleration in economic growth, it suggests that overheating/inflation is a meaningful risk for the United States economy in 2018 in a way it hasn\u2019t been for a decade.What does it all mean and how real is the risk? To answer the question, it helps to start with some basics.Inflation is when the buying power of a currency falls over time. When inflation is 2 percent, a basket of products that cost $100 today would cost $102 a year from now.But people buy lots of different things, some prices are always rising and others falling, and the exact mix of items I buy is different from the mix of items you buy.That\u2019s why government statisticians and mainstream economists focus on indexes created to try to capture the full range of goods and services people consume, weighted by how much an average household spends on each.It\u2019s both. High inflation can be disastrous. In Venezuela right now, in Zimbabwe a few years ago, in Weimar Germany in the early 1920s, inflation was so extraordinarily high that the currency essentially ceased to be a useful medium of exchange, leading to a barter economy and breakdown of the country\u2019s financial system.But when inflation turns negative \u2014 that would be deflation, meaning the purchasing power of a currency rises over time \u2014 it can also be disastrous. Debts become more onerous over time, and consumers and businesses have incentive to hoard cash rather than spend or invest it.That\u2019s what the United States and other countries experienced during the Great Depression, and it has been experienced in milder forms by Japan over much of the last 20 years and Europe since 2010.It might seem inherently bad to have the purchasing power of a falling dollar. But having a bit of inflation seems to grease the wheels of the economy while not distorting economic decisions too much. It helps cushion against deflation, and gives the Fed room to cut interest rates and stimulate the economy during a downturn, helping keep the economy on an even footing.Over the last couple of decades, central bankers around the world have mostly settled on 2 percent per year as the optimal level of inflation that they aim for. It\u2019s a level low enough that the purchasing power of their currencies is fairly stable and people don\u2019t have to worry about inflation all that much in doing business with one another, while also keeping a buffer to prevent deflationary effects from taking hold.The important thing is arguably less the exact level of inflation and more that it is fairly stable over time. It is big swings that tend to be most disruptive, favoring either debtors (inflation) or creditors (deflation), and generally contributing to lack of faith in a country\u2019s financial system.For now, though, 2 percent is the goal.Under the inflation measure that the Federal Reserve most focuses on, prices rose only 1.5 percent in 2017, below the target. That\u2019s based on the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy (the logic being that commodity prices can swing wildly for reasons unrelated to underlying inflation trends).That\u2019s not far from the 2 percent target. But the numbers have been undershooting that target continuously since 2012. That undershooting has been a key rationale for the Fed\u2019s keeping interest rates low \u2014 its aim is to boost economic growth and thus help get inflation up to the 2 percent target.The answer is more uncertain than you might think. A central component of the models that mainstream economists have used for decades is that the inflation rate is shaped by the amount of \u201cslack\u201d or unused capacity in the economy, especially unemployment.The intuition goes like this: When the unemployment rate is high, there are lots of workers available for any employer that wants to hire them. So employers don\u2019t need to compete for workers by paying higher wages. But if the unemployment rate is low, companies have to pay more to get employees, driving up wages. Higher wages in turn mean more money coursing through the economy chasing finite goods and services, creating inflation.That basic relationship between unemployment and inflation is known as the Phillips Curve. It did a pretty good job explaining inflation trends from the 1950s to the 1980s, and still forms the underpinnings of how many policymakers think about where inflation comes from: that inflation is essentially evidence that the economy is running too hot, producing goods or services at a level that is not sustainable.It is a little like revving a car. Once a car is already at top speed, if you push the accelerator harder, you won\u2019t go any faster, but you may overheat the engine. Inflation, in this model of how the world works, is the evidence of overheating.That\u2019s not at all clear.For one thing, the Phillips Curve relationship hasn\u2019t been working quite right in the last decade. The unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in late 2009 to 4.1 percent today, and yet wages have been rising at a modest rate, between about 2 and 2.5 percent, throughout that time (at least until the January 2.9 percent gain).Even as wage gains start to emerge, the relationship between higher wages and overall inflation isn\u2019t ironclad, either. For example, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure dipped through the first eight months of 2017 despite a low unemployment rate and steady wage gains.You can imagine a lot of factors that affect inflation that are unrelated to the domestic labor market. Perhaps in a modern, globalized world, when there is a shortage of American workers, companies are better able to outsource service work and import manufactured goods, rather than bid up wages.If low unemployment spurs new investment in productivity-enhancing machinery, wages could rise without broader inflation breaking out, because higher worker pay would result in higher output, not just more money chasing the same goods.Or maybe employers have so much power in the labor market now that they can keep wages depressed despite low unemployment, rather than get in bidding wars with one another.The traditional overheating story might be right. But the recent evidence is hardly definitive.The unemployment rate is already low, and the new tax cut may push economic growth even higher. Wall Street knows that if Fed officials think inflation is poised to exceed its 2 percent target, they will raise interest rates to try to stop that from happening.If the Fed \u2014 under new leadership, as Jerome Powell became chairman this week \u2014 believes it can let the economy roar ahead without inflationary pressure, it will probably continue its recent practice of low interest rates and gradual rate increases, which in turn is good news for stocks.But if the overheating/Phillips Curve narrative is coming true, the Fed will have to raise interest rates to try to cool the economy, which would make capital more costly for businesses and dampen consumer spending. That\u2019s all bad news for stocks.What happened Friday was that a wage number was published that was consistent with the overheating/Phillips Curve story of how the economy works, which is a big reason markets sold off.For the last decade, the Fed has been more focused on trying to get inflation higher rather than lower, so in some sense the possibility of finally breaking out of that low-inflation, low-growth, low-interest-rate pattern would be welcome.Right now, prices in the bond market suggest that the Fed is in a sweet spot \u2014 that inflation will indeed hover around 2 percent in the years to come. As recently as August, inflation-protected bond prices implied that prices would rise only 1.6 percent a year over the next five years; that is up to 2 percent now.But there are risks on both sides of that forecast.One month\u2019s wage number doesn\u2019t definitively mean that the first step of the overheating story is happening \u2014 low unemployment translating into higher pay for workers. And it definitely doesn\u2019t mean that the second step is happening \u2014 higher wages translating into higher overall price inflation.Seeing how things evolve in 2018 and beyond will be fascinating not just for watchers of the stock market and the Federal Reserve, but also for all those who would like to see a bigger paycheck, or who dread what higher inflation might do to their savings.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Heirs Inherit Uncertainty With New Estate Tax", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritics of the estate tax like to call the federal levy on assets passed on by the wealthy to their heirs the \u201cdeath tax.\u201d But the better nickname might be the \u201czombie tax.\u201dThe tax law passed by Congress in December certainly keeps it alive \u2014 on more generous terms. Instead of taxing any amount above $5.49 million per person at a rate of 40 percent, the new law raises that exemption to $10 million, which, when indexed for inflation, allows individuals to pass on $11.2 million and couples to transfer twice that amount without paying a penny of tax.But leaving the estate tax in place means America\u2019s richest families now face the prospect of scurrying to tax lawyers to revise older estate plans, and may need to do so again before the end of 2025. The new exemption is on the books for only eight years, and if Congress doesn\u2019t change the law again, estates could face tax bills after 2026 for moves made under the new, temporary limits.\u201cSome of the wealthier clients are happy\u201d with the changes, said Brian Jenney, a partner with Kemp Klein in Troy, Mich. \u201cBut when you tell them it ends in 2025, they\u2019re frustrated because they\u2019re still going to be alive.\u201dDespite these complications, what\u2019s clear is that even though Congress didn\u2019t kill the estate tax, the new limits come close.\u201cThe estate tax used to cover a lot more people even in recent decades, up to 2 percent of all estates. Now we\u2019re down to less than one-tenth of 1 percent,\u201d said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. \u201cThe estate tax is hanging on by a thread.\u201dAccording to IRS figures, 12,411 estates filed Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, for 2016. Of those filers, fewer than half \u2014 5,219 estates \u2014 owed anything, paying $18.3 billion on assets of $108 billion, for an effective tax rate of 17 percent. Even among estates valued at more than $50 million, 133 managed to avoid paying any estate tax.If the new exemption had been in place that year, it would have trimmed those estate-tax bills by an amount between $2.3 billion and $6.2 billion. No more than 2,204 estates would have exceeded the individual $10 million baseline exemption in 2016. And under the new $20 million baseline exclusion for married filers, the tax would have hit just 911 estates.Besides the generous exemption, the estate tax always has provided another big benefit to inheritors: Those assets are passed on at their market value at the time of death. This allows stocks, real estate and other holdings that may have appreciated to be sold with no tax ever paid on those gains.That\u2019s the prime reason that anyone with an estate valued between the old and new exemption limits needs to consider rewriting his or her plans to bring the maximum amount of assets back into the estate. The problem is that one vehicle that\u2019s often used is an irrevocable trust, which, as the name implies, isn\u2019t easily reversed.\u201cEvery estate planner has a handful of files where we now want to bring those assets back into the estate to get that step-up in basis, but it\u2019s not that easy,\u201d Mr. Jenney said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to petition the probate court, show that circumstances have changed, go to court and terminate the trust.\u201dAnother time bomb in older estate plans could lurk in trusts that move assets out of the estate to future generations, called generation-skipping transfers. These transfers are taxed in coordination with the estate tax and gift tax and count toward the estate tax exemption amount. Often, those trusts use a formula that automatically removes the maximum exemption amount from the estate and places that money in the trust, said Melissa Langa, managing partner of Bove & Langa in Boston.\u201cIf you had an $11 million estate before the new act, $5 million would go to the trust for future generations, $6 million would be held for the spouse, and that would have been a great plan,\u201d Ms. Langa said. \u201cNow it might be that all $11 million is held for the benefit of the children and grandchildren and the spouse is left with nothing.\u201dAn added sting for families forced to rewrite their estate plans (a process that can cost between $2,000 and $10,000) is that unless the work is a business expense, they can\u2019t deduct that cost. The new tax law eliminated the allowance for tax preparation fees.But it\u2019s the sunset provision of the new law that creates the most potential problems, according to estate planners, many of whom are unimpressed with the hasty, late-December tax-law rewrite.\u201cWe\u2019re lucky it\u2019s as tame as it is, because the legislation is just idiotic,\u201d said James Spica, an estate tax specialist with Dickinson Wright in Detroit. \u201cI don\u2019t think there even was a handful of people working on it who understand how it works.\u201dMr. Spica pointed out that the estate of a spouse who died under the older, lower exemption would benefit if the surviving spouse died between now and the end of 2025. Estates of any amount pass untaxed to a spouse and are taxed only after the surviving spouse dies. So even if the first spouse died when the estate exemption was $11 million for a couple, that estate enjoys a $22 million exemption \u2014 but only if the surviving spouse dies before Dec. 31, 2025.Meanwhile, someone who dies today under the $22 million exemption could see that allowance cut in half if the surviving spouse passes away in 2026, when the exemption drops back to the earlier limit.\u201cYou\u2019ll get half the benefit if the second spouse dies outside this new regime,\u201d Mr. Spica said.Another issue Congress left hanging concerns how to handle gift taxes after the higher exemption expires. Because the tax on large gifts works in concert with the estate tax, the estate of someone who gives away more than the lower exemption could be hit with a \u201cclaw back\u201d tax bill for several million dollars when the law reverts to the lower limit, said James Blase of Blase & Associates in St. Louis.\u201cIf you make a very large gift before 2026 and die afterward, there\u2019s absolutely no law,\u201d Mr. Blase said. \u201cCongress left it totally up to the I.R.S. to issue regulations, and that\u2019s a big deal. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.\u201dThe one place where estate-tax certainty does exist is within the very wealthiest families, who continue to face a 40 percent maximum tax rate on their estates.\u201cFor the uber-wealthy, a $5 million change in the exemption doesn\u2019t really make a difference,\u201d Ms. Langa said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge thing for people in the $10 million to $20 million range, but if you\u2019re in the $200 million range, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Investors refocused on the continuing strength of the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated on Tuesday, and the S.&P. 500 ended the session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles.The decline in stock markets on Monday was steep, but not the worst one-day percentage drop in the S.&P. 500. In the history of the index, 38 one-day drops were worse.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk ever higher, as measures of volatility \u2014 the ups and downs of stock prices \u2014 hit remarkably calm levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop of lackluster growth and inflation, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But that peaceful climb ended in recent days. Investors have become worried that the solid economy in the United States could be showing early signals of inflationary pressure and that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than previously expected. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data \u2014 such as the Labor Department\u2019s jobs report on Friday \u2014 showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.But Tuesday\u2019s results put a brake to the slide, at least for now.The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said it was possible that algorithmic trading programs were partly responsible for recent volatility in the stock market. \u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role \u2014 as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said Tuesday, adding that market participants are acting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems.In a sign of investor confidence, yields on the 10-year Treasury note rose on Tuesday. Spooked investors had bought supersafe government bonds in recent days after being startled by the market sell-off, bringing yields lower. So, the rise in yields suggests investors are regaining their nerve.Jack Ewing, Alexandra Stevenson and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Florida Republicans Face Mounting Pressure to Act on Gun Control", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Seven days after the killing of 17 students and school staff members in Florida, Republican state leaders are facing pressure unlike any they have experienced before to pass legislation addressing gun violence.On Wednesday, swarms of student protesters carrying signs and boxes of petitions stormed the Florida Capitol, pleading with lawmakers to pass tougher gun control in the wake of the deadly shooting at a Broward County school last week.On one floor, they crowded the doorway of the office of Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican and an ardent supporter of gun rights, shouting, \u201cShame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you!\u201d On an upper floor, they gathered outside the office of the powerful speaker of the Florida House, Richard Corcoran. \u201cFace us down! Face us down! Face us down!\u201dAnd on the House floor, Alondra Gittelson, who survived the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, confronted Mr. Corcoran, a Republican, demanding to know why \u201csuch a destructive gun\u201d \u2014 the AR-15 rifle \u2014 is widely accessible.\u201cHow is an individual in society able to acquire such a gun?\u201d Ms. Gittelson, 16, asked Mr. Corcoran.Mr. Corcoran replied that he saw the rifle as a legitimate hunting weapon and did not believe a ban would help matters. \u201cI\u2019ll just be honest with you,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, personally \u2014 I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the solution.\u201dWith about two weeks left in the legislative session, Republicans led by Mr. Scott have concluded that it would be politically catastrophic if they failed to do something to address the growing outcry. But they appear likely to pursue legislation narrower than what students are demanding, avoiding a ban on assault weapons.In the Florida House and Senate, lawmakers said they were involved in bipartisan efforts to craft gun-related legislative proposals that could be introduced Friday or earlier.State Senator Bill Galvano, a Republican, said in an interview that the Senate proposal would likely involve raising the age to purchase semiautomatic rifles to 21 from 18; introducing a three-day waiting period to purchase such guns; banning \u201cbump stocks,\u201d an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster; and expanding the power of law enforcement to restrict the actions of mentally ill people under Florida\u2019s Baker Act.\u201cNothing about this is par for the course,\u201d Mr. Galvano said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had one too many horrific incidents in this country and really around the world. And to have this tragedy occur here in the State of Florida has in some ways been very sobering.\u201dHe added that there was a \u201ctrue commitment in the Senate and the House to try to address issues that would prevent something this devastating from ever happening again.\u201dIn addition to the students amassing in Tallahassee, Democrats in Florida have vowed to make gun control a central campaign issue in 2018, and a national gun-control group is already targeting Mr. Scott with television ads that say he neglected public safety.The developing clash over firearms has the potential to define Florida politics in a critical election year, thrusting the state into the center of a stalemated national debate around gun violence and the Second Amendment. In a politically divided state where the National Rifle Association has held broad influence for decades \u2014 every governor for 20 years has been an ally of the group \u2014 even fierce supporters of gun rights now believe Republicans cannot afford to seem passive in response to gruesome scenes of violence.The arrival of the student protesters from Stoneman Douglas, who traveled hundreds of miles by bus to the state capital, drastically raised the political stakes for Florida\u2019s long-ruling Republicans. Having reached Tallahassee overnight, the young activists quickly set about advocating for sweeping new gun restrictions, included expanded background checks for gun purchases and an outright ban on the sale of military-style firearms.Inside the Capitol, the students divided into groups of 10. Senator Lauren Book, a Democrat, had helped the students arrange meetings with lawmakers in both parties, and the groups planned to meet with some 70 elected officials.Throughout the day, the Stoneman Douglas students moved through the labyrinthine building, and met for 20 or 30 minutes at a time with lawmakers in their offices. They crowded around small conference tables and packed onto leather couches or sat cross-legged on nubby carpets.Some lawmakers asked for photographs they could use for promotional materials. At least one, a Democrat, pulled students into a picture before even introducing himself.Group No. 6 crammed into the elevator with two parent chaperones. They met with Representative Patricia H. Williams, a Democrat, and Senator Debbie Mayfield, a Republican. Ms. Mayfield said that changes were needed, perhaps including raising the minimum age to buy powerful weapons, but she rebuffed criticism from a student, Daniel Bishop, 16, that such a change would not actually prevent deaths.\u201cWe can\u2019t stop crazies,\u201d she told the group.Afterward, Amanda De La Cruz, 16, looked distraught. \u201cI want the ban on semiautomatic weapons,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the crazies.\u201dWill Weatherford, a former speaker of the Florida House, said on Tuesday that the ferocious public response to the Parkland shooting exposed pent-up feelings of horror and fear that have mounted over time. Mr. Weatherford, a conservative Republican, said legislators might be able to move quickly on a few tailored proposals, such as raising the legal age for possessing assault rifles.\u201cWith Pulse, with what took place in Las Vegas, there\u2019s been an aggregate effect,\u201d Mr. Weatherford said, referring to the mass killings in 2016 and 2017 at an Orlando nightclub and an outdoor concert in Las Vegas. \u201cAll of it is adding up and there\u2019s a lot of frustration that\u2019s boiling over.\u201dMr. Weatherford said he expected the Legislature to take action of some kind, but cautioned: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to write a thoughtful policy in three weeks.\u201dProponents of stricter gun control, however, seem unlikely to be appeased by what they perceive as half-measures. Students at the Capitol Wednesday denounced the Legislature for having voted down a proposal on Tuesday to consider banning assault weapons. \u201cThe people around us failed us,\u201d declared Delaney Tarr, a student at Stoneman Douglas. \u201cAnd if they continue to fail us, then they will no longer be in office because soon we will have the ability to vote, and we will vote them out.\u201dThe mood in the Capitol grew progressively more contentious throughout the day, as respectful disagreements between students and lawmakers gave way to blunt expressions of indignation by frustrated activists. By the afternoon, the Stoneman Douglas students had been joined by thousands of other Floridians, including college students, who had come to voice their support for changes to gun laws.The revival of gun regulation as a political issue comes at a precarious moment in Florida politics, as a polarizing president warps traditional political boundaries in a state he narrowly won in 2016. Republicans in Florida have experienced several setbacks recently in special elections, as traditionally Republican-friendly voters have deserted the party in heavily suburban and Hispanic areas. Representative Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat from the Orlando area, said voters in her largely suburban district had reached a breaking point.\u201cPeople are angry and they\u2019re outraged and they\u2019re motivated,\u201d said Ms. Murphy, who defeated an N.R.A.-backed candidate after the Pulse shooting in 2016.This year, control of Florida\u2019s governorship, the State Senate, several congressional seats and a United States Senate seat are expected to be intensely contested.The growing pressure on Florida Republicans may reflect the changing national contours of the gun debate, which for years has been shaped chiefly by ardent supporters of the Second Amendment who vote in force. While several Democratic-leaning states, like Connecticut and Colorado, passed ambitious gun-violence laws after mass shootings, no state wholly controlled by Republicans has enacted legislation even on the comparatively modest scale currently being contemplated in Florida.As a matter of electoral politics, the Republican with the most at stake may be Mr. Scott, a wealthy former hospital executive who is closely aligned with the N.R.A. Mr. Scott has been moving to challenge Senator Bill Nelson, a long-serving Democrat who supports gun control, and the governor\u2019s political allies believe passing some form of public-safety legislation is essential to his prospects in the race.The Stoneman Douglas students saved their final meeting on Wednesday \u2014 a two-hour sit-down to which the press was not invited \u2014 with Mr. Scott. Afterward, one student, Piero Guerra, 15, said the governor had been \u201ckind of neutral\u201d on their proposal to ban semiautomatic rifles but had been \u201cadamant\u201d in support of mental health reforms.The meeting with the governor ended after dark, and Mr. Guerra and his classmates headed for the three buses that would take them some eight hours home to Parkland.Lindsey Salomone, 15, said that after a day speaking with lawmakers \u2014 she sat next to the governor during their meeting \u2014 she was ready to go home and do the real work: grieve.\u201cI was in the building; my friends were shot in my class,\u201d she said. \u201cSo emotionally, I\u2019m pretty much in shock. I\u2019m not feeling anything, actually.\u201dShe added, \u201cBut everybody is telling me: It will come.\u201dJess Bidgood and Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s so cold that the steering wheel hurts to touch. Life plays out under streetlight instead of daylight, and the rest of the world seems twice as far away as it did when the leaves were green.Talk to anybody and the conversation veers into two intertwined ideations: vacation and food.Alaskans are lusting after fresh fruits and vegetables right now, fantasizing about the pepper and snap of an arugula stem and the sweet acid of a mango. They crave simple things that shoppers in the Lower 48 \u2014 where grocery stores are restocked daily with produce whisked in from greenhouses and farms \u2014 can get their hands on with just a short drive or a swipe on an app.Even in this cosmopolitan city of 350,000, people who like to cook spend the moonlit mornings before work scrolling through Instagram pictures of faraway blood oranges and heirloom tomatoes as if they\u2019re stalking crushes.\u201cIt would be a D\u2019Anjou or a Bosc, something run-of-the-mill,\u201d he said on a recent afternoon as snowflakes feathered down outside the bakery window. \u201cI would touch it and it would just kind of yield to my thumb, and then I would take a bite of it right there in the store and I would have to make a little slurping sound, so not all the juice would run down my chin, but some would.\u201dBy the time they get here, tomatoes have become ghosts, their flesh pinkish and watery. Avocados are hard but rotten around the pit. Boxed, prewashed lettuces often arrive with an odor of decay. But fresh food is still expensive, and there isn\u2019t always enough \u2014 especially on Sunday afternoons, when whole swaths of the produce section are frequently bare.Between shipments, stores can\u2019t always keep up with the demand. \u201cOut of stocks,\u201d the grocery business term for empty shelves, are a fact of life. The farther from Anchorage shoppers are, the more often they encounter them. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way around it,\u201d Mr. Lacy said.Leah Glasscock-Sanders, a recess attendant at a charter school in Wasilla, an Anchorage suburb, always plans her shopping in the early mornings to get the best selection. Even so, she sometimes can\u2019t find what she needs.\u201cIt\u2019s cleaned out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere might be five bell peppers to choose from when I get there, and they would all be of a quality I wouldn\u2019t purchase.\u201dAll of this deprivation can lead to unusual relationships. Maybe there\u2019s a \u201cpeach guy\u201d you meet in a parking lot, and you trade $70 in cash for a case of what\u2019s in his trunk. Or, if you live way up north, you may plead on Facebook for someone, anyone, to tuck an avocado into a pocket when he gets on a bush plane to your village. And you may think about it for days until it arrives, as you watch Giada and the Barefoot Contessa on cable.And then, after you thank whoever brought you the avocado with some caribou meat from your freezer, you may cut it in half and share it with your best friend, keeping it a secret from the children.\u201cYou have to cultivate these relationships when you are living in a place like this,\u201d she said.\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve smuggled back some things,\u201d she said.Isolation stokes her imagination, she said; cravings motivate her. They make Alaska a perfect laboratory for writing recipes. No pine nuts? Use pistachios. No lemons? Try oranges.\u201cI cannot tell you how many times I envisioned a recipe and I went to the store and I couldn\u2019t find the ingredients,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cI was so spoiled in California. Alaska has made me such a much more self-sufficient human being.\u201dIt used to be worse. Maybe 50 years ago, most winter vegetables and fruit came frozen or in a can. Many Anchorage children first encountered cherries, for example, in canned fruit cocktail, waxy and pink.Allison Warden, an artist and rapper who lives in Anchorage, is Inupiaq, with roots in the far-north village of Kaktovik. She lives with her mother, and they share a freezer full of wild foods: caribou, walrus, seal, whitefish, duck, seal liver and whale, mostly supplied by family.When money is tight in winter, Ms. Warden finds herself eating traditional proteins and rice, but her fantasies are full of tropical fruit. She still remembers eating her first mango, when she was 28, on a trip to New York.\u201cIt was the most amazing thing ever that I never thought I could ever taste,\u201d she said.Kate Consenstein, who owns a communications business in Anchorage, believes in eating seasonally, but then something comes over her when she glimpses an exotic fruit among the waxy apples and leathery oranges in Safeway, like a four-leaf clover in the grass.\u201cWhen you live in Alaska and, like, a dragon fruit waves at you from a stack at the grocery store, I run at it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m moved by its gravitational pull. I want that sweet brightness. I want it in my mouth. Then I get to the register and it\u2019s 20 freaking dollars. And I am like, so be it.\u201dMr. Watt, the chef at Fire Island bakery, is originally from South Carolina. He decided years ago to lean into Alaska\u2019s extremes, rather than resist them. His approach to winter cooking is to embrace the austerity and master what\u2019s left in the root cellar and freezer.\u201cYou learn what potato to get in order to get that perfect crispy exterior and the buttery interior,\u201d he said. \u201cYou figure out that roasting a whole carrot until it turns black is delicious.\u201dAlaska summers, short and lush, are electric, the long days packed with activity. In winter, he said, you get to catch your breath and revel in the slowness. You study the incremental return of the light, enjoy anticipation, get drunk on spring when it comes. Once you understand how all that works, you can call yourself Alaskan.\u201cThis is your penance,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get through it. Then you\u2019re rewarded, slowly at first with a few radishes and maybe a little bit of greens, and later with, like, everything. You are paying your dues in order to be a local in the summertime.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When a Gun Maker Proposed Gun Control", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Devin Patrick Kelley took a Ruger AR-556 semiautomatic assault rifle to the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., last November, he brought 15 high-capacity magazines that each contained 30 bullets.How many did he empty?\u201cAll of them,\u201d a Texas law enforcement official said at a news conference in the days after the massacre.Mr. Ruger was certainly not a cheerleader for gun control. But considering the tide of mass shootings and gridlock on the issue of guns, his willingness to compromise is worth revisiting.He also liked to recount how he once revealed to guests at a Manhattan cocktail party what he did for a living.\u201cWhen you mention you\u2019re in the gun business, people look shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cThey infer that you have an utter disregard for human life, which is preposterous.\u201dHe said at the time, \u201cThere\u2019s so much hostility, so many people stimulated to violence. But to be talking about gun legislation as a cure for this is ridiculous.\u201dWith momentum building for gun control, Mr. Ruger\u2019s move was partly tactical. He and his allies wanted \u201cto take a responsible position to head off any further restrictions that might even have banned all semiautomatic firearms,\u201d Robert L. Wilson wrote in the book \u201cRuger and His Guns.\u201dFrom the gun industry\u2019s point of view, Mr. Ruger\u2019s stance is a cautionary tale. If he aimed to forestall a ban on assault weapons, in the end, both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines were banned through a 1994 measure signed by President Bill Clinton. The ban expired in 2004.In an email, Kevin B. Reid Sr., the vice president and general counsel of Sturm, Ruger, said, \u201cAs I am sure you can appreciate, Mr. Ruger died many years ago and folks who were around and worked with him directly are long gone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in the Second Amendment, I\u2019m a gun owner and take my son shooting,\u201d he said in an interview. But at the same time, he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s completely reasonable to make it more difficult for those who do not have a legitimate right to a firearm to obtain them.\u201d\u201cYou know, the N.R.A. used to be very big supporters of mine, institutionally; they are not so much anymore,\u201d Mr. Toomey said. \u201cI will say honestly, a vast majority of Pennsylvanians agree with my approach on background checks, so on balance, I don\u2019t think it hurt me politically.\u201d\u201cThe way to move Congress is to show where the people stand on this issue, and you do that most effectively through state ballots and state legislation,\u201d Mr. Feinblatt said, likening the approach to the way gay rights advocates methodically advanced marriage rights through state legislatures.Twenty-six people died in the Sutherland Springs shooting, including the pastor\u2019s 14-year-old daughter and a pregnant woman, while another 20 were injured by a gun bearing the Ruger name. If he were alive today, America\u2019s most outspoken gun maker would likely have had something to say.An earlier version of this article included a quote that was attributed incorrectly to William B.

{"Headline": "Settlements for 3 Wall Street Banks Hold a Silver Lining", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnder the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, banks that violate financial rules are disqualified from access to a streamlined process for certain types of business they conduct, unless they receive a waiver from federal regulators.That provision, known as the bad actor rule, was created to make legal settlements with regulators riskier and more financially painful for banks \u2014 an incentive for them to avoid the conduct that precipitates such settlements.On Monday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reached settlements with Deutsche Bank, HSBC and UBS Group for a type of market manipulation called spoofing. The banks collectively paid just under $47 million to settle the civil charges without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.\u201cI am extremely disappointed by the C.F.T.C.\u2019s actions in this case,\u201d the commissioner, Kara Stein, said on Thursday. \u201cThey did not consult with the S.E.C. before injecting themselves into securities markets in which they have little or no expertise. The implications of the C.F.T.C.\u2019s actions are deeply troubling and may put U.S. investors at risk.\u201dErica Elliott Richardson, a spokeswoman for the C.F.T.C., said granting the waivers lets the agency reach settlements with the banks more quickly. Otherwise, she said, the banks would have wanted to apply for waivers from the bad actor rule before finalizing and announcing the settlement agreements.J.W. Verret, a professor at George Mason University\u2019s law school, said the C.F.T.C.\u2019s move relieved banks of a burden they never should have faced in the first place.\u201cOutside of the partisan back and forth and outside of the cheap rhetoric about this issue, the reality is it\u2019s very difficult to apply criminal and civil liability concepts for individuals to large multinational institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what underlies this whole controversy.\u201dEither way, the change is expected to benefit Wall Street.\u201cIt\u2019s very positive for the banks,\u201d said Therese Doherty of Mintz Levin, a lawyer who represents financial institutions in regulatory matters.Representatives of HSBC, Deutsche Bank and UBS declined to comment.The Securities and Exchange Commission oversees the sale of securities like stocks and bonds. A longstanding rule permits well-known sellers, like the large banks, to bypass an enormous amount of paperwork that normally would be required for new securities sales.Under the Dodd-Frank law, banks that commit crimes or are punished by regulators for knowingly engaging in misconduct stand to lose the privilege of bypassing the paperwork. The extra work can cost millions of dollars and delay new securities offerings for months or even years, stymying their clients\u2019 attempts to raise money by issuing stocks or bonds.They can avoid that fate by applying for a waiver from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Regulators generally agree that the S.E.C. should grant such waivers liberally, because the alternative \u2014 handcuffing the world\u2019s biggest banks \u2014 could have a detrimental impact on their large corporate clients, which employ hundreds of thousands of people and generate crucial economic activity.The waivers used to be granted automatically. But in mid-2015, the commodities trading commission ended the practice. The decision followed public criticism from Ms. Stein and Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusets Democrat and leading advocate for tougher regulation of Wall Street, who said the automatic waivers were an unwarranted sop to badly behaving banks.That change wasn\u2019t catastrophic for the banks. It simply meant they had to apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the waivers \u2014 which were always granted.In December 2016, for example, Goldman Sachs Group agreed to pay $120 million to settle a C.F.T.C. case over manipulation of a derivatives benchmark. The agency did not grant an automatic bad actor waiver as part of the settlement. Instead, Goldman had to go to the S.E.C. The bank\u2019s lawyers told the commission that it would be \u201cextremely harmful\u201d to the bank if its market privileges were revoked. The S.E.C. granted Goldman\u2019s request for a waiver.Ms. Elliott Richardson said forcing banks to wait for waivers had kept the C.F.T.C. from finalizing settlement agreements. \u201cThe S.E.C.\u2019s waiver process has taken up to nine months,\u201d she said. \u201cIn these cases, this has delayed C.F.T.C. enforcement actions, which otherwise would have been resolved, for almost a year.\u201dA Securities and Exchange Commission spokeswoman declined to comment.On Thursday, when she learned of the C.F.T.C.\u2019s decision, Ms. Warren said: \u201cIt amazes me that there are still Republican officials who believe the lesson of the past decade is that federal regulators have been too hard on financial firms that break the law.\u201dKathryn Judge, a Columbia Law School professor, said the change was a sign of the waning influence of Ms. Warren.\u201cElizabeth Warren has done an outstanding job for a long period of time being simply so vocal and so visible and understandable to the public that the administration and regulators were scared to take action that would have invoked her ire,\u201d Ms. Judge said.Regulators in the Trump administration, however, \u201csimply feel less threatened by Elizabeth Warren as a figure,\u201d she said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated which regulator reached settlements with three banks. It was the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, not the Securities and Exchange Commission.Follow Emily Flitter on Twitter: @FlitterOnFraudAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Marco Rubio and an N.R.A. Official Were Jeered and Lectured on Gun Control", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly heckled at a nationally televised forum on Wednesday night in Florida after they refused to back new gun control measures.The spokeswoman for the N.R.A., Dana Loesch, offering the group\u2019s first public comments after a shooting last week at a Florida high school, strongly defended the gun advocacy group\u2019s positions in front of students and teachers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\u201cPeople who are crazy should not be able to get firearms,\u201d she said, insisting that enforcement of mental health laws, not new gun restrictions, would prevent future massacres.Mr. Rubio, Republican of Florida, also drew the ire of the crowd for refusing to support a ban on assault weapons and for saying that he intended to continue accepting money from the N.R.A. and other groups that support his pro-gun agenda.Ms. Loesch and Mr. Rubio appeared during the two-hour forum, broadcast on CNN from a site near Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Fla., knowing full well that they would be assailed by the gathering of people directly affected by the mass shooting last week.President Trump and Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, both declined invitations to participate in the town hall-style meeting.The father, Fred Guttenberg, demanded that Mr. Rubio explain his opposition to a ban on the kind of assault weapon that the gunman at the school used to shoot his daughter, Jaime.\u201cMy daughter, running down the hallway, was shot in the back with an assault weapon, the weapon of choice,\u201d Mr. Guttenberg said during the forum as Mr. Rubio stood stone-faced. \u201cIt is too easy to get. It is a weapon of war. The fact that you can\u2019t stand with everybody else in this room and say that, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe room erupted in applause for Mr. Guttenberg and repeatedly booed as Mr. Rubio sought to explain his opposition to a proposed assault weapons ban. The bill, he said, is riddled with loopholes that would make it easy for criminals to get around.\u201cFirst, you have to define what it is. It basically bans 220 specific models of gun,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, prompting applause from the audience.He continued, saying that the bill also allows for \u201c2,000 other types\u201d of guns that operate the same way but are not classified as assault weapons.Ms. Loesch repeatedly deflected questions about restrictions on the availability of guns, insisting instead that keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill or people with criminal records would keep students safe.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that this insane monster should have ever been able to obtain a firearm, ever,\u201d Ms. Loesch told Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, a senior at the high school. \u201cNone of us support people who are crazy, who are a danger to themselves, who are a danger to others, getting their hands on a firearm.\u201dBut her answers prompted angry taunts from the audience. At times, Ms. Loesch struggled to answer, but she steadfastly refused to back down on the N.R.A.\u2019s position opposing new gun restrictions.She said the group opposed raising the legal age for purchasing an assault weapon to 21 from 18, an idea that Mr. Trump had earlier signaled support for. Students who are old enough to serve in the military should be allowed to own firearms, she said.Diane Wolk Rogers, a history teacher at Stoneman Douglas, confronted Ms. Loesch by asking her to defend the idea that allowing the suspect in the shooting, a 19-year-old, to own an assault rifle represents \u201ca well-regulated militia\u201d as is written in the Second Amendment.Ms. Loesch said the phrase was meant to protect the rights of anyone who \u201ccould operate and service their firearm,\u201d an answer that drew loud yelling and more boos from the audience.Mr. Rubio, for his part, had offered opening remarks that he clearly hoped would deflect criticism during the event. He expressed grief for those who were affected by the shooting, but he said that people in the United States needed to find ways to disagree \u201cwithout accusing one another of being evil people.\u201dBut the audience, including Mr. Guttenberg, did not hold back in criticizing Mr. Rubio\u2019s position on gun control. Mr. Guttenberg repeatedly asked whether Mr. Rubio believed that \u201cguns were the factor in the hunting of our kids.\u201dThe senator said he agreed, but he insisted that other types of laws would better prevent such attacks. He said that he would support a bill to increase the minimum age for the purchase of an assault weapon to 21 from 18. And he said that he backed improvements to background checks and a ban on so-called bump stocks, which can convert semiautomatic weapons to fire automatically.Students and teachers at the forum on Wednesday also had questions for Florida\u2019s other politicians, including two Democrats, Senator Bill Nelson and Representative Ted Deutch.One young student talked about how her best friend was killed in front of her, and she asked Mr. Nelson about background checks, and how to improve them.Another student, whose brother died in the shooting, bluntly said to Mr. Deutch that \u201cmy friends and I are worried that we are going to be murdered in our classrooms.\u201d He asked what Mr. Deutch was going to do about it.\u201cAs a starter,\u201d the congressman said, \u201cI\u2019m going to introduce legislation to make sure that assault weapons are illegal in every part of this country.\u201dThe audience burst into applause.But Mr. Rubio, who ran for president in 2016, was repeatedly challenged on his positions on gun control and his willingness to accept donations from the N.R.A.The issue of donations was raised by a junior at Stoneman Douglas who stood just feet from the senator and asked him whether he would renounce money from the gun advocacy group in the future. When Mr. Rubio refused, the audience booed loudly.\u201cPeople buy into my agenda, and I do support the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, repeatedly refusing to say he would stop accepting money from the group. \u201cThe influence of these groups comes not from money, the influence comes from the millions of people who support the agenda.\u201dMr. Deutch at one point engaged in a brief debate with Mr. Rubio, saying that a gun allowing someone to fire off 150 rounds in six to seven minutes \u201cshould be banned.\u201dLater, Chris Grady, a student at the high school, thanked Mr. Rubio for appearing at the forum, unlike Mr. Trump and Mr. Scott.\u201cA lot more than can be said for our so-called president and governor,\u201d Mr. Grady told Mr. Rubio. \u201cWe need you and your colleagues on both sides to come together with us and find a compromise if we are ever to solve this epidemic.\u201dMr. Grady asked the senator whether he supported legislation to limit high-capacity magazines that allow weapons to fire many bullets quickly. Mr. Rubio said that he had long opposed such legislation, but was now reconsidering that position.The senator said that there could be evidence from the Florida school shooting that suggested the gunman might have killed fewer people if he did not have high-capacity magazines.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have prevented the attack, but it would have made it less lethal,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is This the Moment for Gun Control? A Gridlocked Congress Is Under Pressure", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lawmakers will return to Washington on Monday facing intense public pressure to break their decades-long gridlock on gun control, a demand fortified by a bipartisan group of governors calling for Congress to take action to protect against mass shootings.But even as members of both parties said it might be difficult for Congress to remain on the sidelines after the school massacre this month in Parkland, Fla., lawmakers have no clear consensus on even incremental changes to gun restrictions, let alone more sweeping legislation.Over a weeklong recess, Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate remained largely silent on gun legislation, a reflection of the significant obstacles to passing even modest measures this year.Many Republicans fear primary challenges from the right in the midterm elections this fall and do not want to be pushed into difficult votes. Democrats are not eager for legislation that they deem too incremental. And with lawmakers of both parties looking to wrap up their work to focus on their campaigns for re-election, the time to pass any significant legislation is running short.If the past is prologue, Congress will do nothing.But governors who gathered in Washington for their annual winter meeting warned of the perils of inaction. Animated by a wave of polling since the Florida massacre, Democratic governors warned that candidates would pay a political price for opposing new gun regulations, and some of their Republican counterparts conceded that the pleas of voters could no longer be ignored as they increasingly abandon the party.\u201cI think for Republicans our challenge in the next race is going to be about appealing to the suburban vote that hasn\u2019t been so good for Republicans the last few races,\u201d said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, citing in particular suburban women. It is clear, he added, that \u201cpeople want to see action.\u201dThe combination of political pressure from the governors and moves by President Trump to embrace certain limited measures opposed by the National Rifle Association could set up a congressional showdown with the powerful firearms lobby not seen since the gun debate that followed the deadly school shooting in 2012 in Newtown, Conn.The sudden focus on guns is likely to complicate an already busy agenda. Congress left Washington without coming up with a replacement for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation and expires next week. A contentious debate over gun legislation could push immigration to the back burner.While the Newtown massacre and the many that have followed have produced familiar scenes in which Democrats push for tough new gun restrictions and Republicans dig in and resist, the latest mass shooting appears to have shifted the landscape, even if just slightly, as the Parkland students have become overnight gun control advocates and media fixtures.A smattering of congressional Republicans \u2014 including some who have been staunchly opposed to gun control legislation \u2014 now suggest that they would be willing to take at least small steps toward restricting gun rights.Gun control advocates are looking toward the changing political climate in Florida, where the Republican governor, Rick Scott, and state lawmakers defied the N.R.A. in proposing to raise to 21 the minimum age to buy any firearm.Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, is teaming up with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, on legislation that would raise to 21 from 18 the age threshold for purchasing assault weapons like the AR-15 used to kill 17 people in Parkland.\u201cI don\u2019t know if crossing the Rubicon is the right historical analogy, but there is a sense that this is different,\u201d Mr. Flake said, adding, \u201cWhere the public is and where some Republicans have been on some of these issues just doesn\u2019t match, and I do think we\u2019re going to have to deal with it.\u201dMr. Flake, however, is not seeking re-election, and Mr. Roberts, 81, is unlikely to run again in 2020.At the governors\u2019 meeting, there was agreement on the issue between Democrats and some Republicans. \u201cWe do it for alcohol; we\u2019re talking about raising the age for tobacco to 21,\u201d said Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a Republican. \u201cI think that\u2019s worth talking about.\u201dSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said that with such talk among Republicans, \u201cthis feels like a watershed moment.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re seeing some significant and meaningful cracks in the bond that traditionally holds the Republican Party together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is: Are those cracks enough to get something done?\u201dGun rights advocates said the answer was no. \u201cThis, thus far, has shown no different a dynamic than any of a dozen fights over the past two decades,\u201d said Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, which has fought gun control measures for decades. \u201cPeople who, after a week, suggest that this is a tipping point either weren\u2019t around during previous battles or failed to learn the lesson.\u201dSome Republicans, warning against a rush to enact new laws, appeared inclined to respect the wishes of the N.R.A., even as the group came under pressure from some corporate leaders, who were moving to cut ties with it.\u201cI think there\u2019s a temptation just to do a whole host of things that are not really addressing the fundamental problem but would make people feel better that they\u2019ve done things,\u201d said Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who has deep ties to the N.R.A., explaining his opposition to raising the age limit.Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky and the chairman of the Congressional Second Amendment Caucus, warned that Republicans who had run for office on a platform that included protecting gun rights would face political consequences if they changed their tune.\u201cI suspect that a majority of Republicans are not going to turn on their base,\u201d Mr. Massie said.While such sentiment makes it unlikely that lawmakers will consider sweeping new gun restrictions, Congress is considering a number of more modest proposals.But the bill, called the Fix NICS Act, which is backed by the N.R.A. and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, is modest. It would not expand the number of gun sales subject to background checks, and it does nothing to close loopholes that allow guns to be sold over the internet, or at gun shows, without background checks on the purchasers.Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and a co-chairman of a bipartisan group of lawmakers known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, said his group planned to tackle the issue of mass shootings this week, with the hope of developing proposals that could become law.But Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who said in an interview that he favors banning assault weapons \u2014 a major break with his party \u2014 called the proposed ban on bump stocks a \u201csmall step,\u201d and took issue with the age limit proposal. \u201cBy raising the minimum age from 18 to 21, then you\u2019re almost officially legalizing assault weapons,\u201d he said.If the latest push for tighter gun restrictions has any better chance of success than the ones that came before, it is in large part a result of the fierce lobbying effort by the student advocates, including those from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of this month\u2019s mass shooting.\u201cWe have a group of articulate and smart students who are also very angry and have been activated, and so they have captured the attention of our country, including members of Congress,\u201d said Mark Kelly, a founder of Giffords, an advocacy group named for his wife, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was grievously wounded during a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson.\u201cCongress seems to have a hard time paying attention to important issues long enough to solve them, and they\u2019ll move on to the next thing,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cI don\u2019t think these kids are going to move on to the next thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But today\u2019s column will focus on the incompetence, whose full depths \u2014 and consequences \u2014 we\u2019re just starting to see.Let\u2019s start with a few recent stories.FEMA later said that this was a miscommunication. But at the very least it suggests a complete lack of focus.Trump also declared, as he has in the past, that he is \u201ccommitted\u201d to taking action on the opioid epidemic. But he\u2019s been in office a year and has basically done nothing.The thing is, these aren\u2019t isolated examples. A remarkable number of Trump appointees have been forced out over falsified credentials, unethical practices or racist remarks. And you can be sure there are many other appointees who did the same things, but haven\u2019t yet been caught.Why is this administration hiring such people? It surely reflects both supply and demand: Competent people don\u2019t want to work for Trump, and he and his inner circle don\u2019t want them anyway.By now it\u2019s obvious to everyone that the Trump administration is a graveyard for reputations: Everyone who goes in comes out soiled and diminished. Only fools, or those with no reputation to lose, even want the positions on offer. And in any case, Trump, who values personal loyalty above professionalism, probably distrusts anyone whose credentials might give some sense of independence.But what\u2019s the problem? After all, stocks are up and the economy is steadily growing. Does competence even matter?The answer is that America is a very big country with a lot of strengths, and it can run on momentum for a long time even if none of the people in charge know what they\u2019re doing. Sooner or later, however, stuff happens \u2014 and then incompetence becomes a very big deal, as it already has in Puerto Rico.What kind of stuff may happen? The scariest scenarios involve national security. But we can\u2019t count on smooth sailing for the economy, either. And who will manage economic turbulence if and when it hits? After all, we currently have perhaps the least impressive Treasury secretary in U.S. history.Matters are a bit better at the Federal Reserve, where nobody seems to have bad things to say about Jerome Powell, just confirmed as Fed chairman. On the other hand, why didn\u2019t Trump just follow the usual norms and appoint Janet Yellen, who has done a fantastic job, to a second term?One answer may be that Trump is a traditionalist \u2014 and few things are more traditional than passing over a highly qualified woman in favor of a less qualified man. But I also suspect that he found Yellen\u2019s independent stature threatening.And lower-level Fed appointments are becoming cause for concern.Now, everyone makes bad predictions now and then; God knows I have. But you\u2019re supposed to face up to your mistakes, figure out what went wrong and adapt your views. Goodfriend refused to do any of that. And why should he? His errors were politically correct; they reinforced Republican orthodoxy. From the G.O.P.\u2019s point of view, having been completely wrong about monetary policy isn\u2019t a defect, it\u2019s practically a badge of honor.The point is that even at the Fed, which is partly insulated from the Trumpian reign of error, U.S. policymaking is being denuded of expertise. And the whole nation will eventually pay the price.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Stuns Lawmakers With Seeming Embrace of Comprehensive Gun Control", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump stunned Republicans on live television Wednesday by embracing gun control and urging a group of lawmakers at the White House to resurrect gun safety legislation that has been opposed for years by the powerful National Rifle Association and the vast majority of his party.In a remarkable meeting, the president veered wildly from the N.R.A. playbook in front of giddy Democrats and stone-faced Republicans. He called for comprehensive gun control legislation that would expand background checks to weapons purchased at gun shows and on the internet, keep guns from mentally ill people, secure schools and restrict gun sales for some young adults. He even suggested a conversation on an assault weapons ban.At one point, Mr. Trump suggested that law enforcement authorities should have the power to seize guns from mentally ill people or others who could present a danger without first going to court. \u201cI like taking the guns early,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second.\u201dThe declarations prompted a frantic series of calls from N.R.A. lobbyists to their allies on Capitol Hill and a statement from the group calling the ideas that Mr. Trump expressed \u201cbad policy.\u201d Republican lawmakers suggested to reporters that they remained opposed to gun control measures.\u201cWe\u2019re not ditching any constitutional protections simply because the last person the president talked to today doesn\u2019t like them,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said in a statement.Democrats, too, said they were skeptical that Mr. Trump would follow through.\u201cThe White House can now launch a lobbying campaign to get universal background checks passed, as the president promised in this meeting, or they can sit and do nothing,\u201d said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut.Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace did not immediately yield converts. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said after the meeting that he was unmoved, repeating the Republican dogma that recent shootings were not \u201cconducted by someone who bought a gun at a gun show or parking lot.\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, who sat next to the president looking flustered, emerged from the meeting and declared, \u201cI thought it was fascinating television and it was surreal to actually be there.\u201d\u201cIt would be so beautiful to have one bill that everyone could support,\u201d Mr. Trump said as Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and a longtime advocate of gun control, sat smiling to his left. \u201cIt\u2019s time that a president stepped up.\u201dDemocrats tried to turn sometimes muddled presidential musings into firm policy: \u201cYou saw the president clearly saying not once, not twice, not three times, but like 10 times, that he wanted to see a strong universal background check bill,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mince words about it. So I do not understand how then he could back away from that.\u201dJust what the performance means, and whether Mr. Trump will aggressively push for new gun restrictions, remain uncertain given his history of taking erratic positions on policy issues, especially ones that have long polarized Washington and the country.When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.But at the meeting, the president repeatedly rejected the N.R.A.\u2019s top legislative priority, a bill known as concealed-carry reciprocity, which would allow a person with permission to carry a concealed weapon in one state to automatically do so in every state. To the dismay of Republicans, he dismissed the measure as having no chance at passage in the Congress. Republican leaders in the House had paired that N.R.A. priority with a modest measure to improve data reporting to the existing instant background check system.Mr. Trump also flatly insisted that legislation should raise the minimum age for buying rifles to 21 from 18 \u2014 an idea the N.R.A. and many Republicans fiercely oppose. When Mr. Toomey pushed back on an increase in the minimum age for rifles, the president accused him of fearing the N.R.A. \u2014 a remarkable slap since the association withdrew its support for Mr. Toomey over his background check bill.\u201cIf there\u2019s a Republican who\u2019s demonstrated he\u2019s not afraid of the N.R.A., that would be me,\u201d Mr. Toomey said after the meeting.The president appeared eager to challenge the impression that he is bought and paid for by the gun rights group. While calling the membership of the N.R.A. \u201cwell meaning,\u201d he also said he told its leaders at a lunch on Sunday that \u201cit\u2019s time. We\u2019re going to stop this nonsense. It\u2019s time.\u201dOfficials at the gun group were taken aback by the president\u2019s comments and immediately ramped up their lobbying against measures that they have long said would damage the Second Amendment and do little to protect people against gun violence.\u201cWhile today\u2019s meeting made for great TV, the gun control policies discussed would make bad policy that wouldn\u2019t keep our children safer,\u201d said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the N.R.A.\u2019s lobbying arm. \u201cWe are going to continue to work to pass policies that might actually prevent another horrific tragedy.\u201dBut at least for Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed willing to venture far from the N.R.A. script, even appearing to suggest that he might back a ban on assault-style weapons when Ms. Feinstein asked what they could do about \u201cweapons of war.\u201d The N.R.A. has helped defeat an assault weapons ban since the last one expired in 2004.The reaction in Washington was swift. Breitbart.com, a right-wing site once led by Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s onetime chief strategist, published an article with a headline in bright red that said, \u201cTRUMP THE GUN GRABBER.\u201dThe site added that the president \u201cCedes Dems\u2019 Wish List \u2014 Bump Stocks, Buying Age, \u2018Assault Weapons,\u2019 Background Checks. Tells Scalise to Take a Hike \u2014 After Surviving Assassination Attempt.\u201dThe president did return several times to a proposal that conservatives like: arming teachers in schools and ending the so-called gun-free zones around schools that Mr. Trump said had made those institutions among the most vulnerable targets for mass shooters.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have defense, too,\u201d the president told the lawmakers. \u201cYou can\u2019t just be sitting ducks. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve allowed people in these buildings and schools to be.\u201dBut several times, he acknowledged how controversial that proposal was, and seemed to accept the idea that it might not be included in a comprehensive gun control measure that could pass both chambers of Congress.He also backed a modest measure sponsored by a Republican and a Democrat in the Senate to improve the quality of the data in the background check system. But he told the bill\u2019s author, Mr. Cornyn, to consider just adding that proposal to the broader expansion of the background check system.\u201cIt would be nice to add everything on to it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMaybe change the title. Maybe we could make it much more comprehensive and have one bill.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of a similar televised meeting. It was in January, not last year.Reporting was contributed by Thomas Kaplan, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Peter Baker and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Enter Correction Territory: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 Stocks enter correction territory.\u2022 Qualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s revised offer.\u2022 Snap and Twitter: From also-rans to worthy contenders?\u2022 BlackRock is reportedly setting its sights on Berkshire Hathaway and the Blackstone Group.\u2022 A top WSJ editor heads to Lazard.\u2022 Brunswick Group has named Neal Wolin as its new C.E.O.The Dow Jones industrial average and S.&P. 500 went more the 400 days without a pullback of 5 percent.That streak ended this week, and on Thursday, the two indexes fell into correction territory, defined as a pullback of at least 10 percent from their high. For both, it is the first time they have crossed into a correction since early 2016.The Dow plunged more than 1,000 points Thursday, its second decline of more than 1,000 points this week. The S. & P. 500 dropped 100 points, its third decline of more than 100 points in its history.On a percentage basis, the Dow fell 4.15 percent, the S. & P. 500 dropped 3.75 percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.9 percent.The bigger pictureAnxieties about inflation have driven the much of decline over the past week and a half. The yield on the benchmark Treasury note climbed above 2.85 percent \u2014 its highest level since 2014 \u2014 for the second time this week. Higher yields can crimp economic activity by raising borrowing costs, while also making riskier assets like stocks less appealing to bonds.Many market watchers say that investors should not worry about the recent spate of volatility in the stock market. Such swings, they say, are normal. They point to strong corporate earnings and a strengthening economy both in the United States and abroad as reasons to be optimistic about stocks.Investor sentiment has reversed in recent weeks as the sell-off in stocks gained momentum.According to the American Association of Individual Investors\u2019 weekly survey, bullish sentiment, or the percentage of respondents that say stocks will rise over the next six months, declined to 37 percent. The drop ended a streak of eight straight weeks with bullish sentiment above its historical average of 38.5 percent.It began the year at nearly 60 percent, its highest level since 2010.The contextThe survey has proved to be a good contrarian indicator. That means overly bullish sentiment often signals that the stock market is ripe for a pullback, while overly bearish sentiment often indicates that market may soon rally.The chip maker said its board had rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised $121 billion offer.The reasons\u2022 \u201cThe Broadcom proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm.\u201d\u2022 The offer \u201cfalls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction.\u201dQualcomm said that it was willing to meet with Broadcom to see if its issues with the offer could be addressed.The contextQualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.Till this week, many investors wondered whether Snap and Twitter had much of a future at a time when Google and Facebook are sucking up such a large share of digital advertising dollars. But after Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even as they remain in the shadow of Facebook and Google.\u2014 Peter EavisBlackRock itself raises a different comparison, according to Sarah Krouse of the WSJ \u2014 to Warren Buffett:The \u201cbest known\u201d example of BlackRock\u2019s approach with this new vehicle is Berkshire Hathaway, according to a fund-raising document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Omaha conglomerate run by Mr. Buffett is well known for its long-term ownership of companies.BlackRock\u2019s Long-Term Private Capital fund would be a tenth of Berkshire\u2019s $101 billion in cash. But it too would look to buy and hold positions for more than 10 years. Over all, though, this seems more akin to private equity.The practice has grown on Wall Street with the rise of activist investors, with investment banks touting their defense capabilities to corporate clients.Before becoming finance editor at the Journal, Mr. Berman oversaw the paper\u2019s business coverage and was its M.&A. reporter prior to that.Mr. Berman, who will join as a managing director and be based in New York, will start on Feb. 26.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedAndrew, with a bit of contextDennis follows in the footsteps of Steven Rattner, who worked as a reporter at the NYT in the 1980s before going to work as a banker at Lazard and becoming an influential financier. (Today, Mr. Rattner overseas Michael Bloomberg\u2019s fortune.)Dennis was my fiercest reporting competitor over the last decade and is one of the most talented financial journalists in recent memory.Mr. Wolin, who will remain based in Washington, will take over from the London-based Susan Gilchrist, who will become chairwoman of Brunswick\u2019s global clients operations and focus on client work full time.Alan Parker, Brunswick\u2019s founder, said in a telephone interview of the move, \u201cIt reflects the growth of the business and the business opportunity in America.\u201dThe contextIn some ways, the appointment of Mr. Wolin reflects that trend. Beyond his time at the Treasury Department, he previously worked as a senior executive at The Hartford, an insurer. And he was previously a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration.\u201cIncreasingly, I think senior executives and boards of directors have come to understand that a lot of their challenges and opportunitiess sit at the intersection of business and governments and society and so forth,\u201d Mr. Wolin said in a phone interview.Or as Mr. Parker put it, \u201cMore and more we hear ourselves described as a critical issues business.\u201dOther moves at Brunswick\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe recent stock market freak-out may have abated, but the dynamics that drove the sell-off \u2014 worries that faster global growth and hotter inflation will trigger faster-than-expected rate hikes \u2014 are alive and well in the currency markets.On Thursday, the Bank of England raised its growth forecasts for the United Kingdom, and Mark Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said rates would likely have to be increased faster than previously expected.The British pound promptly popped by more than 1 percent against the dollar, and yields on British government bonds rose. Treasury bonds yields in the United States also rose, with the 10-year note offering yields of nearing 2.90 percent.The sight of bond yields nearing 3 percent should keep stock investors on edge amid the growing conviction we\u2019re moving out of the era of low-interest rates, which were such a key ingredient for the near-decade-long bull market in stocks.\u2014 Matt PhillipsThe bigger pictureWhat business cares about in the proposal:\u2022 Nearly $300 billion in additional spending over the next two years\u2022 $20 billion for infrastructure spending\u2022 A lifting of the debt ceiling until March 2019The agreement will cause federal budget deficits to grow even larger, on top of the effects of the sweeping tax overhaul that lawmakers approved in December. But because the deal gives long-sought victories to both parties, the deficit effect appears to be of little concern.Steve Wynn is gone.

{"Headline": "Will America Choose Its Children Over Guns?", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAs surely as there are camels\u2019 backs and straws to break them, moments arrive when citizens say they\u2019ve had enough, when they rise up against political leaders who do not speak for them and whose moral fecklessness imperils lives. We may be witness to such a moment now with the protests by American teenagers sickened \u2014 and terrified \u2014 by the latest mass murder at the hands of someone with easy access to a weapon fit for a battlefield, not a school.These kids have had enough. They\u2019ve had enough of empty expressions of sympathy in the wake of the sort of atrocities they\u2019ve grown up with, like last week\u2019s mass shooting that took 17 lives at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Enough of the ritualistic mouthing of thoughts and prayers for the victims. Enough of living in fear that they could be next in the cross hairs of a well-armed deranged killer, even with all the active shooter drills and lockdowns they\u2019ve gone through. Enough of craven politicians who kneel before the National Rifle Association and its cynically fundamentalist approach to the Second Amendment.They are asking in what kind of country are children sent off to school with bulletproof book bags strapped to their backs \u2014 capable, one manufacturer, Bullet Blocker, says, of \u201cstopping a .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, 9mm, .45 caliber hollow point ammunition and more.\u201dSo are we all.It is too soon to tell if this righteous anger augurs a sustained youth movement for gun sanity, going beyond the occasional protest. We hope it does. It\u2019s time, once again, for America to listen to its children. Who among us have more at stake than they?Sensible young people have it in their power to make their senseless elders take heed \u2014 and act. We saw it happen during the Vietnam War half a century ago. Young people, initially reviled by establishment forces as unwashed, longhaired traitors, energized an antiwar movement that swept the country and, even if it took years, ultimately ended America\u2019s misguided adventure in Southeast Asia.To be effective, any movement needs a realistic program, not mere emotion. Otherwise, it risks coming and going in a flash with little to show for itself. A tighter federal system of background checks is a start, to better monitor would-be gun buyers with mental illness, for example, or histories of gun violence. Such a program should also include reinstating a nationwide ban on assault weapons \u2014 a state measure died in the Florida Legislature Tuesday \u2014 and ending an absurd prohibition against using federal public health funds to study gun violence.What the young protesters are saying now is: Put down the guns. We\u2019re your children.How can anyone not heed their pained voices?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Chair Powell Indicates He\u2019ll Keep Bolstering Growth in Public Debut", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn testimony before Congress, Mr. Powell said that the Fed planned to continue increasing its benchmark interest rate only gradually, as it did under his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. But investors responded to his optimism as an indication the Fed may be compelled to move more quickly. As Mr. Powell testified, stocks fell, the dollar strengthened and bond yields rose.Mr. Powell told the House Financial Services Committee that headwinds once holding back the American economy had now turned into tailwinds.\u201cMy personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Yet he struck a careful tone. Inflation has remained sluggish for nearly a decade, and Mr. Powell said the Fed \u201cwill continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy\u201d and allowing inflation to tick up toward the Fed\u2019s target of a 2 percent annual pace.Investors widely expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate in March, into a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, and most expect another quarter point increase in June.Some Wall Street analysts said that Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony increased the chances that the Fed would continue with quarterly rate hikes in the second half of the year.\u201cWe are naturally more confident in our standing call for four hikes this year and another four next year,\u201d said Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.But the Fed has emphasized that stronger growth is necessary to justify three rate hikes this year. Fed officials have also said growth will not prompt the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate more quickly unless it increases inflationary pressures.Randal K. Quarles, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, said Monday that the tax cuts could increase the country\u2019s economic capacity, allowing faster growth without faster inflation. His remarks suggested the Fed is willing to wait and see what happens.\u201cI will be carefully watching indicators of economic activity and inflation and assessing the degree to which activity appears to be pushing up against the constraints of the economy, as opposed to being a reflection of the expansion of those constraints and the growth of the potential output of the economy,\u201d Mr. Quarles said.Lawmakers grilled Mr. Powell on Tuesday on many subjects. House Republicans, who pressed for Mr. Trump to put a Republican in charge of the central bank, asked Mr. Powell how he would respond to changes made after the 2008 financial crisis, including stronger financial regulations and a new approach to managing interest rates.Democrats, nervous about the new leadership, pressed Mr. Powell for assurances that the Fed would remain committed to supporting job growth and that it would enforce laws aimed at reducing discrimination by financial institutions.Both sides sought Mr. Powell\u2019s affirmation for their views about the economic effect of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that took effect in January.Mr. Powell began his remarks by commending Ms. Yellen on her tenure and calling for continuity with her policies. But the differences between Mr. Powell, a former investment banker, and his predecessor, a labor economist, showed through. Unlike Ms. Yellen, Mr. Powell shied away from questions about economic inequality, and he spoke more freely about financial regulation.Mr. Powell reaffirmed to House members that the Fed intends to loosen some limits on banks. One change could reduce capital requirements for some large banks, allowing them to rely more heavily on borrowed money.The goal of the changes is to reduce the burden of regulation \u201cwithout losing any safety and soundness,\u201d Mr. Powell said. He also said the Fed plans to reduce regulation of smaller banks.He added the Fed must be alert to both the buildup of financial imbalances and inflation, but that neither risk appeared high at the moment.\u201cThere\u2019s always a risk of a recession at any point in time, but I don\u2019t see it as at all high at the moment,\u201d Mr. Powell added. \u201cI would expect the next two years on the current path to be good years for the economy.\u201dStocks took a tumble this month as investors began to chew on the possibility of faster rate hikes. Mr. Powell dismissed the turbulence, saying the Fed saw no evidence that it was \u201cweighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market and inflation.\u201dThe losses on Tuesday were more modest. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 lost 1.27 percent, closing at 2,744.28.Mr. Powell has taken the helm of the central bank as the economy is nearing the end of its ninth year of expansion. The Fed has been steadily raising its benchmark rate back to a more normal level after cutting it nearly to zero to stimulate lending in response to the financial crisis.Those rate hikes are intended to keep the economy from running too hot, while also giving the Fed the capacity to fight a future recession by once again cutting interest rates.Although a strong economy and low unemployment typically drive up inflation, it has remained puzzlingly low in recent years. Mr. Powell acknowledged the trend, but said that he believed sluggish price increases were due in part to temporary factors and that inflation would gradually rise this year.He noted, however, that some indicators suggest the labor market still has room for improvement, including the modest pace of wage growth. The share of working-age adults who are not working also remains significantly higher than before the recession; most of those people are not counted in the unemployment rate because they are not actively seeking work.Investors are watching carefully for any indication that inflation could lift off faster than they expected \u2014 a sign that the Fed might have to raise rates more quickly than it planned and risk choking off economic growth.On Monday, Mr. Quarles was cautiously optimistic that faster economic growth is likely. \u201cThere are indications that we have a sustainably stronger economy,\u201d Mr. Quarles said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too early to call that as happening, but there are clear indications that it could be happening.\u201dMr. Powell, a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors who was sworn in as chairman this month, will testify again on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lines Out the Door and Strong Sales at Tampa Gun Show", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAMPA, Fla. \u2014 The lines stretched out the door this weekend at a gun show in Tampa, Fla., as thousands of potential buyers and the merely curious waited for their turn to browse booths stocked with the latest firearms, ammunition, customizable holsters and patriotic paraphernalia.Inside, parents pushed their babies in strollers past T-shirts emblazoned with phrases like \u201cI study triggernometry.\u201d A nonprofit group in one booth was raffling off a rifle to raise money to battle child and animal abuse. On large signs by the entrance, the National Rifle Association was offering refunds on the $11 admission if shoppers signed up for a membership. Outside, Girl Scouts were selling cookies.But the deadly mass shooting a couple of hundred miles away at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School cast its shadow. Both buyers and sellers were talking about the attack, as well as about the divisive debate that it had recently reignited.Several sellers said they were on track to double their normal sales for a weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to say, but whenever there\u2019s a shooting, business only goes up because people are afraid of losing their right to own a certain weapon,\u201d said Quaidman Woody, who was running a booth with his father, a sales representative for CrossHeirs. \u201cSo even if they don\u2019t need another AR, they\u2019ll buy another AR or pieces of it.\u201dBut she added that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with guns\u201d and that \u201cthere are nuts everywhere.\u201d\u201cEveryone has a different perspective, a different outlook,\u201d she said of her fellow show participants. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re bad people.\u201dNorman Carolino, who was selling body armor at the Tampa show, called the scrapped plans a disservice to people looking for protection. He said most of his sales on Saturday were to teachers, school administrators and \u201cparents who are scared to death.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m wiped out of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are parents in here who\u2019ve never seen the inside of a gun show.\u201dJuanita Stafford and her husband, Tommy, bought bullet-resistant backpack plates for their eight school-age grandchildren in Florida and Alabama. They received a bulk discount off the $199 price a pad.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the people going to funerals and saying coulda, woulda, shoulda,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is.\u201dMr. Woody estimated that only 10 percent of gun show shoppers were firearms aficionados. The rest, he said, are either newcomers or dabblers. Many buyers have never purchased an AR-15 before, he said.But he decried efforts to raise the minimum age to buy semiautomatic firearms.\u201cThere\u2019s a big stigma around the AR-15,\u201d Mr. Woody said. \u201cBut say they ban it \u2014 if the person knows what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re just going to buy a different gun that shoots the same caliber and does the same thing but doesn\u2019t get included in the ban because it doesn\u2019t look tactical.\u201dEven before the Parkland shooting, the gun industry was distressed.Thriving demand for firearms after the Sandy Hook attack in 2012 and during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration caused new gun companies to swarm the market. But many of those businesses have since scaled back or folded as enthusiasts became less nervous about potential gun legislation and less anxious to stock up.Show participants said the financial pressure on the industry and the renewed public attention on guns would make companies especially eager to bolster quality and safety \u2014 especially in military towns like Tampa and other markets with avid, discerning firearms customers.\u201cWe are under a lot of scrutiny,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we should be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "So It\u2019s Your First Market Hiccup. What Should You Do Now?", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyWe\u2019ve been here before. Stocks can fall fast and bounce back hard, even if they haven\u2019t moved all that much or that quickly in recent years.And now, after watching the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fall by several percentage points since Thursday and bounce some of the way back on Tuesday, you have a different kind of fear: that all the stock market riches have been won already or that your emotions will get the best of you amid all of the volatility. It\u2019s tempting to sell what you have as quickly as possible to make that feeling go away.But before you do, take a deep breath and ask yourself these six questions.Watching the overall market numbers move up and down on television or the internet can be addictive. Even if your net worth is low, when the market goes up and down by a few percentage points in a day, there can be sizable dollar amounts at stake.But part of what you\u2019re trying to do here is avoid making panicked decisions. Big red or green arrows or commentators with raised voices generally don\u2019t induce calm. Also, those talking heads know nothing about you and why you invested in the first place. So don\u2019t base your actions on their pontificating and pronouncements.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in the first half of your career. You probably invested in stocks because over the very long haul, they deliver better returns than the other investment choices that are easily available to you at an online brokerage firm or through your workplace retirement plan.When you buy stocks, you\u2019re purchasing tiny little pieces of the profits that our capitalist system generates. Nothing about the events of the last few days suggests that the system is under siege. Quite the contrary: The markets may be spooked in part by the fact that the economy is humming along so nicely that companies will have to pay more for workers. That can hurt the profits that help drive stock prices and also lead to inflation.The small overall decline in the stock market over the past few days pales in comparison with the large gains over the past few years. So hopefully you\u2019re still on schedule to meet your goals, absent any big health or job changes.This moment of checking your gut, however, is as good a time as any to consider whether you have the right proportion of your money in stocks versus other options like cash, bonds or real estate that don\u2019t experience this kind of volatility or may not rise or fall in tandem with stocks. In other words, are you taking too much risk? Or too little? If so, buy or sell some stocks accordingly \u2014 not because of what the stock market will or will not do next but because you are or are not on track to pay for the things you want to buy someday.Let me answer that one for you: No. Perhaps you got lucky with some individual stocks as a teenager or used what you learned in finance class to buy just the right mutual fund at exactly the right time.Congratulations! But you\u2019re almost certainly more lucky than you are smart. Professionals rarely do so well over 50 years that their decisions about when to get in and out of a stock lead to better performance than they might have achieved by just putting money into an index fund that buys every stock in a particular category. And you can\u2019t know ahead of time whether you are that rare breed of market genius.Any decline hurts, even if it\u2019s only on paper and you don\u2019t plan on selling for decades. But consider everything else that might happen over that many years.You will (hopefully) pay down your student loan debt. You will (hopefully) get promotions and raises or start a company that will increase your income. You will buy a home, and its value will probably go up over time, or at least match inflation. Or you\u2019ll rent and draw dividends from the freedom and flexibility that brings you.In other words, you are not the stock market. There is so much more to your net worth (and, hopefully, self worth) than a bouncing S.&P. 500 chart. Check in with your life, and if it\u2019s better than it was a year or five years ago, think about that if the stock market keeps falling.Some of us (O.K., me, although I do a good job of hiding it in my columns) are more anxiety-prone than others. And maybe there is only so far we can go toward suppressing those feelings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Does Monday\u2019s Stock Plunge Stack Up?", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere have been far blacker Mondays.Measured by points, those are steep drops \u2014 the biggest on record for the indexes. The previous largest point declines for each benchmark came in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.But Monday\u2019s plunge was far less impressive on a percentage basis. The Dow\u2019s fall ranked as its 100th biggest, while the S. & P. 500\u2019s slide was the 127th biggest in the index\u2019s history, according to S & P Dow Jones Indices.Here is how Monday\u2019s sell-off stacks up against two other major tumbles.But points are not the best way to compare the magnitude of a stock index\u2019s declines across eras. As the stock market has risen, big point moves have translated into increasingly smaller percentage changes. The Dow and the S. & P. 500 have more than doubled from their closes on Sept. 29, 2008.\u201cBlack Monday\u201d was a petrifying moment \u2014 an even bigger decline in both points and percentage than the stock market crash of 1929. But unlike the 1929 crash, the slide in 1987 did not contribute to a wider economic slump. The stock market recovered its losses by early 1989.Advertisement"}
