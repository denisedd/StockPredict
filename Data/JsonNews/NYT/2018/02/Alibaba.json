{"Headline": "U.S. Blocks a Chinese Deal Amid Rising Tensions Over Technology", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 United States officials have torpedoed a Chinese state-backed group\u2019s plan to buy an American electronics company, signaling the Trump administration\u2019s continuing skepticism toward Chinese investment deals, particularly those that involve transferring technological know-how.Xcerra, a Massachusetts-based provider of equipment for testing computer chips and circuit boards, said this week that it was withdrawing from its $580 million sale to an investment group backed by a Chinese government-controlled fund.The reason, according to Dave Tacelli, Xcerra\u2019s president and chief executive, was that the deal was not likely to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency Washington panel that operates largely out of the public eye. The committee, known as Cfius, plays an advisory role to the president, but it can effectively block foreign acquisitions of American companies over national security concerns.\u201cDespite our best efforts to secure approval, it has become evident that Cfius will not clear this transaction,\u201d Mr. Tacelli said. The deal would ultimately have been financed by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, a $21 billion fund that counts several Chinese state-run companies as investors.In scuttling the purchase of Xcerra, American officials have struck at a major priority area for China\u2019s innovation policies.Progress so far has been mixed. Despite government subsidies, the technologies at China\u2019s leading chip makers remain generations behind those at Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.In the business of semiconductor assembling, packaging and testing, however, China has surged to become a world leader. Xcerra designs and makes equipment to test chips, but it doesn\u2019t manufacture chips themselves.Advertisement"}

Do these gadgets and services really behave as advertised? How will they evolve in the years ahead? How quickly will they overhaul the way we live and change the way we do business?A month after the Chinese electronics giant Huawei suffered a big setback in its quest to sell its high-end smartphones to Americans, the company\u2019s chief for consumer devices, Richard Yu, said he was still optimistic about Huawei\u2019s prospects in the United States.\u201cWe have won global consumers\u2019 trust, in over 170 countries,\u201d Mr. Yu said at the New Work Summit. \u201cWe very strictly protect consumers\u2019 privacy.\u201dAt the conference on Tuesday, Mr. Yu said that Huawei had no ties to the Chinese government. \u201cWe are a globalized company, just headquartered in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not part of any government. We have to be a company that is independent from every country.\u201dMike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, offered a glimpse of how the social network is applying artificial intelligence to ward off bad actors and keep its platform free of toxicity.Calling the fight against rules violators a \u201ccat and mouse game,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that Facebook\u2019s A.I. efforts had succeeded at certain types of content moderation, such as image classifier algorithms that find and automatically remove nude photos and videos.Now on Facebook, he said, \u201cthe vast majority of nudity and pornography reporting is automatic.\u201dBut the company has since added thousands of human content moderators and struck partnerships with human fact-checking organizations. Mr. Schroepfer implied Facebook has learned that A.I. alone would not do the trick, given the sophistication of bad actors who find ways around the platform\u2019s filters.Mr. Schroepfer also said that human judgment would be required in certain situations, like a comment (\u201cnice jacket\u201d) that could be either an earnest compliment or a sarcastic insult, depending on the context. And when it comes to some of Facebook\u2019s thornier problems, like trying to enforce consistent hate speech policies, human intervention may always be necessary.Michael Kratsios, a deputy chief technology officer at the White House, said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that regulators should get out of the way of advances in emerging technologies.He cited progress toward a repeal of some regulations on commercial drones, such as rules prohibiting them from flying at night.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s key to get ahead of those regulatory hurdles,\u201d said Mr. Kratsios, who previously worked as chief of staff to Peter Thiel, the libertarian venture capitalist. These regulations, he said, are \u201cputting us at a disadvantage.\u201dUnlike some experts who believe China is poised to dominate the A.I. age, Mr. Kratsios said he wasn\u2019t worried about overseas competition. The United States, he said, has a \u201c30-year head start\u201d in A.I. development.Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, blasted companies like Facebook on Tuesday for addicting children to their products and renewed his calls for more government regulation of the tech industry.Mr. Benioff compared a new Facebook Messenger product for children to candy cigarettes, which he used to pretend to smoke as a boy.\u201cWhat do you think they were trying to get us to do with those?\u201d Mr. Benioff asked onstage at the New Work Summit. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is any different now. They\u2019re focused on the addictive nature of these user interfaces. At some point, we have to say, \u2018Hold on.\u2019\u201dSilicon Valley is nearing the point where moral lines will have to be drawn by the government since the industry is not regulating itself and does not seem to be guided by a \u201cstrong hand of ethics,\u201d he said.There is a \u201ccrisis of trust,\u201d he added, that will become a \u201ctidal wave\u201d among American consumers who are growing wary of tech giants.\u201cI\u2019m trying to protect our industry,\u201d said Mr. Benioff, whose company sells access to business software over the internet. \u201cIf companies aren\u2019t able to regulate themselves, they should have external regulations.\u201dOne of the solutions he suggested was to move decision-making away from algorithms and back toward humans. He cited Facebook\u2019s decision to disband its trending news curation team as an example.\u201cFacebook had a team promoting, sorting and focusing stories, 100 curators that they removed and put an algorithm in their place, and that started the downward spiral that they\u2019re in today,\u201d Mr. Benioff said.He also spoke about the recent ban on kegs of beer at Salesforce offices after he recently stumbled across one while visiting a company he had acquired.Fei-Fei Li, a chief scientist at Google and a Stanford professor, has called on technologists to take a more \u201chuman centered\u201d approach to the creation of artificial intelligence. On Tuesday at the New Work Summit, Ms. Li said that researchers must work to ensure that A.I. embodied human qualities and that it would ultimately operate alongside humans, not replace them.\u201cI often tell my students not to be misled by the name \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 \u2014 there is nothing artificial about it,\u201d she said. \u201cA.I. is made by humans, intended to behave by humans and, ultimately, to impact humans lives and human society.\u201dAt Stanford, Ms. Li was instrumental in the recent rise of \u201ccomputer vision\u201d systems that can recognize people and objects entirely on their own. At Google, she is working to package and sell these and other systems as cloud computing services, delivering the latest A.I. technology to a wide range of businesses.But she said that as Google and other internet giants pushed these techniques forward, academia and the government must help ensure that A.I. evolved into something that enhanced our humanity, created as many jobs as it replaced and operated in safe and predictable ways.In particular, Ms. Li said, academic institutions can help ensure that computer scientists work alongside social scientists in building this new breed of technology.\u201cA.I. has outgrown its origin in computer science,\u201d she said.Ultimately, said Ms. Li, who was born in China, A.I. reflects the people who build it more than other technologies do. For that reason and others, she said, A.I. researchers must work in a way that spans not only many industries but many cultures as well.Tuesday\u2019s first speaker at the New Work Summit was Kai-Fu Lee, who used to lead Google in China and knows a thing or two about American tech giants in China. His prognosis about whether companies like Facebook will ever be able to crack the world\u2019s largest internet market?\u201cThe American products are simply uncompetitive in the China market,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who is now chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on Chinese technology. Even if internet titans from the United States could operate in China, he said, the local competition means they would have a hard time thriving.\u201cMessenger is a much worse product than WeChat,\u201d he said, referring to Facebook\u2019s messaging app and Tencent\u2019s ubiquitous app for chatting, social networking, making payments and other tasks.\u201cAmazon in China is substantially worse than Taobao, JD and Tmall,\u201d he said, referring to three leading Chinese e-commerce sites. And, he said, \u201cApple Pay is much narrower and much harder to use than WeChat or Alipay.\u201dMr. Lee sees other issues that augur against a big Facebook or Google renaissance in China. Multinational companies tend not to hire local managers to lead their China operations. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned about winning in the local market,\u201d he said.Last year, the Chinese government unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030, vowing to create a domestic industry worth $150 billion. This manifesto read like a challenge to the United States, and in many ways it echoed policies laid down by the Obama administration in 2016.John Krafcik, chief executive of the self-driving car company Waymo, took the stage at the New Work Summit on Monday night and spoke out for the first time since his company reached a settlement last week with Uber in a lawsuit over trade secrets that riveted Silicon Valley.\u201cWe were really happy with the outcome that we engineered,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in that case talking about the hardware, but the extra benefit we got from that suit was the ability to understand and ensure that Uber wasn\u2019t using any of our software.\u201dHe called the software Waymo\u2019s \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\u201cThis was a really special case with a really special set of circumstances,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cFor us, this was always about, and really just about, the fact that we needed to ensure Uber wasn\u2019t using our trade secrets.\u201d He added that he did not foresee Waymo suing other former employees.Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s chief executive of its consumer business, which includes its e-commerce operations, doesn\u2019t often make public appearances. But on Monday night, he joined the New Work Summit to discuss the internet retailer\u2019s move into artificial intelligence.His key message: A.I. is everywhere, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will take our jobs.\u201cIf you look at the evolution of technology over the course of decades, tech doesn\u2019t eliminate work; it changes work,\u201d Mr. Wilke said.Amazon has also embedded A.I. throughout the company, he added, with technologists working together with people who run businesses. The company is using machine learning and deep learnings, which are different flavors of A.I., to upgrade internal algorithms, he said.As A.I. technology barrels ahead in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s also starting to pick up steam as a political issue in Washington.So he\u2019s proposing a universal basic income plan called the \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d which would give every American adult $1,000 a month to guarantee them a minimum standard of living while they retrain themselves for new kinds of work.If there are many more white men than black women in the system, for example, it will be worse at identifying the black women. That appears to be the case with some popular commercial facial recognition software.Advertisement"}

But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval.However, Fox\u2019s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast\u2019s opportunity.Whom to thank for the Comcast bidCritics\u2019 cornerMarket reactionComcast investors don\u2019t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky\u2019s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast\u2019s offer.When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval.Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit.A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump.\u201cIn gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.\u201d(F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.)Update from the hearingIn this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond.He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: \u201cFiscal policy changes can have an effect.\u201d He also said: \u201cWe really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. \u201cWe don\u2019t do fiscal policy at the Fed,\u201d he said.\u2014 Peter EavisThe details\u2022 \u201cRing has raised $209 million so far and was last valued at $760 million, according to Pitchbook.\u201d\u2022 Amazon\u2019s Alexa Fund, which invests in startups that make Alexa compatible devices, was an investor.\u2022 Amazon plans to have Ring operate as a separate business, much as Zappos and Twitch do.Ms. Bartiromo, then, followed up with:Mr. Schultz is one of a number of business executives and celebrities long speculated to be considering a run for president in 2020. The list has included Oprah Winfrey, Mark Cuban, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Bob Iger of Disney and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.On other topicsThe tweet from Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, Delta\u2019s home state, shows that it isn\u2019t easy for companies to find a balance between those who want corporate America to push for more gun control and those who think conservatives are being unfairly maligned.The policy flyaroundIf Cfius intervenes, it would sidestep Broadcom\u2019s move to relocate its headquarters to the U.S., which critics said was aimed in part at preventing such a review. (Broadcom\u2019s C.E.O., Hock Tan, said the redomiciling would happen even if the deal didn\u2019t go through.)More from Diane Bartz of Reuters:Part of the CFIUS\u2019 current concern, which is echoed in Cornyn\u2019s letter, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.That\u2019s what Larry Hutcher, a corporate lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said of the last-minute turmoil that sank an investor group\u2019s bid for The Weinstein Company and led the embattled studio to plan a corporate bankruptcy filing.Beijing\u2019s takeover of the troubled Anbang Insurance Group is another sign that deal making by that country\u2019s moguls is slowing to a halt.

In part, the push is driven by the eventual maturation of its online business.For now, however, online shopping still rules the roost.Alibaba on Thursday reported a one-third rise in profit for the three months that ended in December, on revenue that rose by more than half. The revenue growth rate was its slowest in a year but still came in better than expected.Still, a pullback in growth is inevitable for a company with Alibaba\u2019s reach.The company has lifted its recent results by offering more and better services to the vendors on its platforms. But it is also eyeing the 84 percent of physical goods sales that still take place offline in China.Alibaba has been pouring cash into experiments in what its founder, Jack Ma, calls \u201cnew retail\u201d: a kind of teched-up re-envisioning of how people shop in store. In particular, it hopes to gather more detailed user data, which could help it offer more personalized services and ads to its customers online and off.\u201cSome of Alibaba\u2019s \u2018new retail\u2019 initiatives have shown quite promising signs of initial success,\u201d said Jialong Shi, an analyst with Nomura, singling out Hema. Still, he said, \u201cthese initiatives may require a few more years of incubation before we can see profits.\u201dAnother challenge: Tencent, Alibaba\u2019s biggest rival, is getting into fresh food and traditional retail, too.Tencent is the world\u2019s largest video game company. It also runs WeChat, China\u2019s most popular messaging and social media app.For now at least, analysts do not expect Alibaba and Tencent to end up owning rival alliances of stores. Tencent primarily seems to want to create more opportunities for people to use its mobile payment service, WeChat Pay. It is also hunting for new clients for its cloud computing business.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to imagine that Tencent would fully own and operate a supermarket on its own,\u201d Mr. Shi of Nomura said.For both Alibaba and Tencent, though, creating more points of contact with their customers helps them amass more user data. This is one reason the companies are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, which helps them make sense of the boatloads of user information they are hauling in every minute.\u201cThey not only have the largest data sets, but they have data sets tied to customers that they can identify,\u201d Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research, said. \u201cThe potential for A.I.-led monetization growth, we think, is still at a very early stage.\u201dAlso on Thursday, Alibaba said it would acquire a one-third stake in the parent company of Alipay, one of China\u2019s two main online payment services. The two sides agreed in 2014 to give Alibaba the right to acquire the stake. The two companies used to be one until Mr. Ma took the Alipay operations out and formed a separate company.Advertisement"}

The S.&P. 500 jumped 1.5 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4 percent.For the week, the S.&P. 500 and the Dow tumbled 5.2 percent, their steepest weekly declines since January 2016.At its lows on Friday, the Dow had given back nearly 40 percent of its gains since election day in 2016 and more than 45 percent of the gains since President Trump was inaugurated.How volatile were stocks this week?\u201cThe journey from ecstasy to agony is entirely unprecedented, in the United States at least. That\u2019s the largest momentum swing in history \u2014 and it\u2019s not particularly close.\u201dThe bigger pictureThe cause of one of the most turbulent weeks in recent memory appeared to be widespread expectations that the global economy is improving and that growth would accelerate in the near future.That has led to fears that interest rate increases could cheapen the value of certain kinds of investments.More on the markets and economyNearly 70 percent of S.&P. 500 companies have reported results so far, and profits are on pace to grow 14 percent, according to FactSet. Analysts expected earnings to rise 11 percent at the end of the fourth quarter.\u2022 If that growth rate holds up, it would mark the third quarter of double-digit earnings growth in the past four.\u2022 All 11 of the S.&P. 500\u2019s sectors are reporting higher profits, and five sectors have reported double-digit gains.\u2022 74 percent of companies are announcing earnings above Wall Street estimates.\u2022 79 percent are reporting sales above forecasts.\u2022 S.&P. 500 companies that generate more than 50 percent of their sales abroad are on pace to report a 17.4 percent increase in their bottom lines. For those that get the majority of their revenue from within the United States, earnings are set to rise 12 percent.Nearly a year after Waymo first accused the ride-hailing company of plotting to steal important self-driving car technology, the two companies have settled their courtroom fight.After four days of arguments in Federal District Court here, Uber agreed to provide Waymo with 0.34 percent of its stock. Uber is now valued at about $72 billion, which works out to about $240 million, according to Waymo.Rand Paul, who temporarily halted the Senate\u2019s vote on the deal, said this:\u201cI want people to feel uncomfortable.

Mr. Trump, meanwhile, still wants his border wall and an infrastructure plan.

Some Democrats called on her to force her colleagues to block the deal, but others pointed to its funding for domestic programs.The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both fell into correction territory on Thursday. Fed officials, though, have remained upbeat on their outlook for the United States economy and sanguine about the market\u2019s tumble.This week Robert Kaplan, the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said:\u201cI think it\u2019s healthy that there is some correction, a little more volatility in markets\u2026can be a healthy thing.\u201dWilliam Dudley, the New York Fed President, said:\u201cIf the stock market were to go down precipitously and stay down, then that would actually feed into the economic outlook, and that would affect my view in terms of the implications for monetary policy.\u201dMore in marketsShares in the two big names in package delivery were down in premarket trading today.

Amazon then aims to expand the service to more cities as soon as this year, some of the people say.Where else have investors felt fear about what Amazon might do to an industry?\u2014 Michael de la MercedBut there\u2019s still a lot they disagree on:Behind the scenes, the games reflect cozy ties between South Korea\u2019s government and Samsung \u2014 ones that continue to attract criticism.The company\u2019s chairman, Lee Kun-hee, is a longtime member of the International Olympic Committee and lobbied for years behind the scenes to bring the Winter Games to South Korea. The government saw Mr. Lee as so pivotal to its Olympic dreams that after he was convicted of tax evasion in 2008, the country\u2019s president then pardoned him expressly so he could resume lobbying for Pyeongchang.So extraordinary is the overlap between Samsung, South Korea and the Pyeongchang Games it is unlikely to be repeated, say IOC members and Olympics experts. Mr. Lee\u2019s lobbying and Samsung\u2019s close involvement are now considered inappropriate by some Olympics experts and voters.After Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even in the shadow of Facebook and Google, Peter Eavis writes:The tech flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Tronc Nears Deal to Sell Los Angeles Times", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Tronc nears a deal to sell L.A. Times.\u2022 Dow surges 500 points.\u2022 Reasons not to worry about the recent sell-off.\u2022 Disney easily exceeds Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\u2022 Snap jumps 20 percent after earnings.\u2022 Clayton: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that came out of this that concerns me.\u201d\u2022 Is algorithmic trading to blame for Monday\u2019s plunge?The transaction would include The Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune, these people said. Dr. Soon-Shiong is a major shareholder in Tronc, the parent company of The Times.A deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday but could still fall apart, the people said. Tronc is likely to use the sale proceeds to pay down its debt.\u2014 Sydney EmberAfter days of sometimes wild moves in stock markets, investors on Wall Street refocused on the ongoing strength in the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A sometimes-panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated through the day, and the S.&P. 500 ended Tuesday\u2019s session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs.Investors appeared to reassess whether the previous day\u2019s violent decline\u2014the S.&P. suffered its worst decline since August 2011\u2014reflected actual fundamentals or was merely a long-overdue outbreak of investor jitters.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk higher, as measures of volatility\u2014the ups and downs of stock prices\u2014hit historically low levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop in which growth and inflation remained lackluster, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But the peaceful climb ended over the past week amid worries that solid economic growth in the United States and abroad could be showing early signals of growing inflation pressure. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data\u2014such as the U.S. jobs report on Friday\u2014showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.The Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became the latest prominent company to report solid earnings amidst the market turmoil. The strong numbers support the belief that plunging stock markets do not reflect weakness in the real economy.Disney made $1.89 per share in the last three months of 2017, after excluding a tax benefit. That number is 22 percent higher than the $1.55 per share earnings in the same period of 2016. It is also well in excess of the $1.61 per share that Wall Street analysts had forecast for the latest quarter.Disney did best in its parks and resorts business, which reported $1.35 billion of operating income, which was 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period. The earlier period\u2019s results were somewhat depressed by the impact of Hurricane Matthew, Disney said. In its press release, the company noted that higher profits at its domestic parks and resorts were driven by an increase in guest spending and an increase in attendance, which underscores consumers\u2019 willingness to spend more. On the other hand, the company said parks and resorts are dealing with higher labor costs and other expenses. That may not be lost on investors who are starting to see inflation as a threat to stock prices.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Numbers\u2022 Snap reported revenue rose 72 percent to $285.7 million, easily exceeding the $252.9 million expected by analysts.\u2022 The company lost 13 cents per share, below estimates of 16 cents a share.\u2022 Snap added 8.9 million daily active users for a total of 187 million, compared to the 184.2 million estimated.The ContextSnap\u2019s shares have struggled since its initial public offering in March 2017. The stock fell below its I.P.O price of $17 a share last summer and has remained below that level since. If Snap\u2019s after-hours gains hold up on Wednesday, the stock will be on the cusp of crossing back over its I.P.O. level.The stock market\u2019s slide over the past week has given investors plenty of anxiety.Stocks have lost roughly $4 trillion in value. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 endured their worst point declines in their histories Monday and their largest percentage drops since 2011. C.B.O.E. Volatility Index surged more than 100 percent Monday, the biggest increase in its history.But there are reasons investors shouldn\u2019t get too concerned.Strategists over at Goldman Sachs wrote:\u201cThe stock market correction appears to be more technical and positioning-driven rather than fundamentally-based.We believe the fundamental drivers of the equity market remain intact and reiterate our S&P 500 year-end 2018 forecast of 2850.\u201dHere\u2019s a video of the launch:When stock markets are plunging, sober-minded investors try to gauge the underlying strength of bellwether companies, to see whether all the selling is justified.That is why many eyes will be on the earnings of the Walt Disney Company, which reports after the close of regular trading Tuesday. If the company releases stronger-than-expected results for the three months through the end of December, it will reinforce a general sense of optimism about corporate America .Stellar results from Disney would add to a strong earnings report on Tuesday from General Motors, which helped push the company\u2019s shares 3 percent higher. Micron Technology, a large maker of computer chips, on Monday upped its outlook for the current quarter. Its shares soared 7.7 percent on Tuesday.Though Disney is not a high growth company, its results offer insight into the strength of consumer spending. As a result, if the company reports earnings that are below the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, it may add to the unease among investors..Of course, a lot more companies are going to have to report strong earnings to convince investors to jump back into the stock market. One of the reasons that stocks rallied in recent months is that analysts are expecting a 20-percent plus jump in profits in 2018, an eye-popping rise. The more large companies that hit their numbers in this earnings season, the more likely the stock market will find a floor.\u2014 Peter EavisAt a hearing of the Senate banking committee on Tuesday, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama asked the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the market turmoil.\u201cIs this perhaps more than an ordinary correction?\u201d Mr. Shelby asked.Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C. said that he could not tell what had caused the big declines, but he said that the market infrastructure had held up well under the strain of heavy trading.\u201cAs I sit here today, there\u2019s nothing that came out of this that concerns me,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the C.F.T.C. said that his staff had a late night on Monday checking in with all the exchanges, and had not heard anything that concerned them.\u201cThe system worked as it was designed to do,\u201d he said.\u2014 Nathaniel PopperFollowing a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that he has been in touch with market participants this week and that they are reacting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems. He said it was possible that algorithmic trading was partially responsible for the recent volatility in the stock market.\u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said.Despite that volatility, it does not appear that the Trump administration is ready to give up on the stock market as a measure of its success.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been looking at the long-term impact of the stock market, it\u2019s still up over 30 percent since the election and we continue to think American is a great place to do business,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with companies\u2019 response with more and more investments in the U.S.\u201dAsked about the roiled stock market at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the Trump administration was not concerned and that it remains focused on the long-term trajectory of the economy.\u201cWe are very focused on long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we have enacted, including tax reform are very positive for long-term economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He said that he was closely monitoring for orderly market functioning and that there were \u201cno systemic issues\u201d that were reported to him.\u201cI\u2019m happy to report I got the green lights,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The Treasury secretary said that given how much the market has rallied in the last year, he does not think the recent drop in prices raises financial stability concerns.Asked if the Trump administration will take the blame for the recent drop in stocks after taking credit for the rally, Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\u201cI think we\u2019ll still claim credit for the fact that it\u2019s up over 30 percent since the election,\u201d he said of the stock market.\u2014 Alan RappeportWhen stock markets sell off as they have the past two trading sessions, there is often more than one cause. But one popular trade is taking a lot of blame for Monday\u2019s plunge: short volatility.Investors had piled money into exchange-traded products designed to rise when the C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, falls. The VIX, known as the market\u2019s fear gauge, measures how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead. Those wagers paid off handsomely, rising 180 percent last year as the VIX plumbed historic lows.That quickly reversed Monday. The VIX surged 117 percent in its biggest one-day jump on record and two short volatility exchange-traded product \u2014 VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange Traded Note, XIV, and Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Inverse ETN \u2014 endured heavy selling.From Barclays:\u201cIn our opinion, the significant spike in the VIX index and futures yesterday was technical in nature and does not necessarily indicate a true increase in risk perception.\u201dFrom Morgan Stanley:\u201cThe near bankruptcy of the inverse VIX ETPs will be a very negative headline, and the several billion dollar loss for holders, largely retail, will scare some out of the market or force liquidations of other products to raise cash.\u201dFrom Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research:\u201c Assuming volatility-related ETFs really are a market structure \u201cAchilles heel\u201d, this will take days if not weeks to play out, and there could be other problems waiting in the wings.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u2022 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 5 percent.\u2022 Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 4.7 percent.\u2022 The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was down 2 percent.\u2022 Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d the VIX, is at its highest level in two and a half years.More from Ben White of Politico:\u201cThis is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,\u201d said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. \u201cUntil now, Trump\u2019s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed. Now she\u2019s out the door and volatility is back.\u201dInvestors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down.\u201cCryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,\u201d said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThe combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large.\u201dExpect more give-and-take between the two sides of Congress:\u201cI think everyone understands that this will probably end up being a Ping-Pong situation, and we\u2019ll see where the ball lands,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida.Elsewhere in policyMore from Alex Sherman of CNBC:An unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney\u2019s bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox\u2019s Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox\u2019s assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast.Elsewhere in the deal world\u201cI talked to women engineers at Uber who were getting invited to strip clubs and bondage clubs in the middle of the day. The middle of the day! And often they would go because that\u2019s just what everyone was doing.\u201dThe misconduct flyaroundThe venture firm, which has invested in the likes of Groupon, Dollar Shave Club and Nutanix, has closed both its 12th venture fund, at $800 million, and its latest side fund for later-stage deals, at $450 million.
