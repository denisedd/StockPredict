I developed an eating disorder. I began cutting myself. That torment was made worse by Hollywood.\u201d\u201cThere were days when I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake, I should never have opened my mouth,\u2019\u201d Dylan told me the other day.All this has been \u201cincredibly healing,\u201d Dylan said.Maco added that both Dylan and her mother, Mia Farrow, had appeared to be honorable and truthful. \u201cMia Farrow acted as nothing more than a concerned mother,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no indication that this was a fabricated story.\u201dI\u2019m a friend of Dylan and her family, so I\u2019m not an unbiased observer. But over the years I have reviewed the evidence, and on balance it persuades me. The most important contrary point is that an evaluation team from Yale New Haven Hospital concluded that Allen had not sexually abused Dylan, but it was sharply criticized by other experts. Meanwhile, the New York judge in the Mia Farrow-Woody Allen child custody case ruled that although he couldn\u2019t be sure whether the sexual assault itself had occurred, \u201cMr. Allen\u2019s behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate.\u201dThat judge, Elliott Wilk, noted that on the day of the alleged assault, a babysitter saw Allen with his head on Dylan\u2019s lap, facing her body. A tutor soon afterward found that Dylan wasn\u2019t wearing her underwear. And nobody has explained where Dylan and Allen went when they both disappeared as the babysitter was searching for them \u2014 except Dylan, who says that that\u2019s when the assault happened.Indeed, the certainty of the Dylan Farrow case is that there has been a gross injustice: Either an innocent man\u2019s career is being destroyed, or a victim has been unfairly doubted since she confided in her pediatrician about an assault when she was 7 years old.I asked Dylan if there was any chance that this was a false memory, that she had been brainwashed.\u201cNo,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cI think it\u2019s more logical almost that the people who accuse me of being brainwashed are brainwashed themselves by the celebrity, the glamour, the fantasy, the pull they have to Woody Allen, their hero on a pedestal.\u201dThe larger point, she said, is not her own suffering over the years, but the need to listen to victims.Yes, false accusations happen, and we must struggle to balance rights of victims against those of the accused \u2014 but it should be obvious now that we haven\u2019t gotten that balance nearly right. Too often, we have deferred to the powerful and doubted the weak, creating impunity and injustice.The problem is not only abusers but more broadly a society that often disbelieves or scorns those crying for help, like that young woman curled up on her bed crying during the Golden Globes. I\u2019ll leave her with the last word:\u201cWhat needs to change,\u201d she said, with a teary firmness that comes from 25 years of pain, \u201cis our response.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As the Streaming Wars Heat Up, Ryan Murphy Cashes In", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe battle between the Hollywood establishment and the streaming-media giants has caused big changes in the entertainment industry in recent months, driving up the prices of major stars and series producers while leaving traditional companies in danger of losing relevance.Mr. Murphy was in an ideal bargaining position not only because he possesses a fecund imagination able to spin out one successful series after another, but because Apple and Amazon have lately proved themselves willing to spend their way into rivalries with the old-line movie studios and television networks.Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, \u201cThe goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201dThat statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes.Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos\u2019s signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood.\u201cWhat Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there\u2019s a new template in town,\u201d Ms. Walden said. \u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator.\u201dRick Rosen, the head of TV at the agency WME, said it had become clear that Netflix was now able to outspend the companies that had been around since the early days of the movie business.\u201cAs a representative of talent, if you have top-top talent, you must talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d be negligent if you didn\u2019t. Top talent wants to pitch to Netflix.\u201dAnother competitor in the expanding streaming industry, Hulu \u2014 which is available only in the United States \u2014 has gained momentum recently with original series like the much-decorated \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and now has 17 million subscribers. While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters.With the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts.The mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry \u2014 one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space.\u201cWere the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,\u201d said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. \u201cIf the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us.\u201dMr. Murphy declined to comment for this article.Disney \u2014 a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger \u2014 has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney\u2019s own television studio has not been a reliable supplier.The day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network\u2019s long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d) and Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d).\u201cWith more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,\u201d he said.The money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: \u201cWhen this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I\u2019m interested in that and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201dThe Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year \u2014 and when the streaming services are spending in manic style.And it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right.The question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion \u2014 a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the United States Search Data Overseas?", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorShould the United States government be able to conduct a search of your emails if they are stored on a server in another country, or does the government\u2019s right to examine digital evidence stop at the border?Both sides in the case have legitimate concerns. If the court sides with Microsoft and declines to allow searches for data stored in another country, the government will be hampered in investigating crimes like terrorism, child pornography and fraud.If the court sides with the government and rules that it may demand data stored overseas by American companies, those companies will find it much harder to do business abroad. This is because many foreigners fear that United States warrants authorizing such searches will disregard privacy protections afforded by their country. The government of Germany, a country with stringent privacy laws, has already indicated it will not use any American company for its data services if the court decides to allow searches.For the United States technology industry, the stakes are high. Last year, the worldwide public cloud services market was estimated to be a $246.8 billion business. Most of the leading companies in this sector are American: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, IBM. If other countries were to follow Germany\u2019s lead, the economic consequences could be severe.While a clarifying decision is needed in this particular case, nothing that the Supreme Court rules will solve the fundamental problem: The Stored Communications Act, a 1986 law that governs the storage and disclosure of electronic communications by third parties, is outdated. Congress needs to act to ensure that technology companies can flourish overseas while law enforcement has the right tools to gather evidence worldwide.The Supreme Court case goes back to 2013, when federal agents served a warrant on Microsoft, seeking email communications belonging to a drug trafficking suspect. Microsoft handed over the suspect\u2019s account information and address book, which sat on its servers in the United States, but refused to turn over any email content, which was stored at a data center in Ireland.Microsoft argued that the email content was outside the reach of United States law enforcement. The government countered that because Microsoft could retrieve the data in Ireland with a click of a mouse, without leaving its headquarters in Redmond, Wash., the email content was within its reach.Two lower courts agreed with the government. But in July 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York reversed the lower courts and determined that the information stored in Ireland was beyond the reach of a United States warrant.At the center of this case is the Stored Communications Act, which was written when there was no modern global internet or cloud storage. It provides Fourth Amendment safeguards to prevent unreasonable searches of electronically stored communications \u2014 but says nothing about data held abroad.The Court of Appeals concluded that the Stored Communications Act was not intended by Congress to allow searches outside the country. The ruling followed the well-established principle that American courts generally do not apply United States law beyond its borders unless Congress intended so.But at least four federal courts have since refused to follow the ruling, mostly for practical, technology-driven reasons. The cases before those courts involved Google and Yahoo, which store data \u201cdynamically\u201d \u2014 breaking data into many small pieces and constantly shuttling it among storage centers in various countries to optimize performance and network efficiency. The text of an email might reside in Bulgaria, but the attachment in Spain.Does it make any sense to think of this email as located in a specific country overseas? As a United States District Court judge, Juan R. S\u00e1nchez, wrote in an opinion that rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, \u201cno one knows which country to ask\u201d for the data.Because Microsoft still frequently uses local-based storage, the Supreme Court case, though important, is of limited significance. The court has an opportunity to clarify the scope of the Stored Communications Act with respect to data stored \u201cstatically\u201d outside the United States. (When signing up for service, a Microsoft user indicates his or her country of residence and Microsoft usually stores the user\u2019s data in a nearby data center.) But the case does not address the more general question of the legal standards that govern information that crosses borders \u2014 and in particular, data stored \u201cdynamically.\u201dOnly Congress can address that larger question, by writing an urgently needed new law. (Even the Second Circuit appealed to Congress to step in.) The International Communications Privacy Act, introduced last term in Congress, is a good place to start. It provides a framework by which United States law enforcement can obtain communications of both United States and foreign citizens, consistent with the privacy protections afforded by international law.The guiding principle should be that the reach of any new law is defined by the citizenship and geographical location of the individual whose data the government seeks, rather the physical location of the data. This would allow for the right balance between global privacy rights and the needs of United States law enforcement.No matter how the Microsoft case is decided, if Congress fails to act, we will continue to have a legal system that inadequately governs the vast stores of electronic data that move seamlessly across international borders.Craig A. Newman is a lawyer at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler.Advertisement"}

Your phone might be a good place to start. There are quite a few apps designed to help you earn some extra dough, either in the form of gift cards or standard cold, hard cash.There is a trade-off, however. Nearly any kind of reward app, even the legitimate ones, will track at least some of your personal data.By signing up for almost any app, you agree to share some personal information. That\u2019s not to say your information isn\u2019t safe, but it\u2019s a good reminder to always make sure you read the fine print before downloading. So what exactly should you look for in an app\u2019s privacy policy?We looked at dozens of apps that promise to help you make money from the comfort of your smartphone, and most of them aren\u2019t worth your time. Some, however, do what they promise, even if the trade-off is a good bit of your personal data.If you\u2019re willing to trade, the following (free) apps are well established and can legitimately help you earn cash back. No, you won\u2019t fund your retirement or put a down payment on your home, but you can earn a few bucks to pay for your latte \u2014 or dare we suggest avocado toast?If you don\u2019t mind searching the web, answering surveys or watching videos, you can earn a few \u201cSwagbucks,\u201d which you can then trade in for gift cards at places like Amazon, Starbucks and Home Depot.Shopkick rewards you for shopping at stores you probably visit anyway: CVS, Marshalls and Best Buy are a few of its partner retailers.\u201cShopkick I primarily use in Target,\u201d Ms. Lowe said. \u201cBecause why not get rewarded when you\u2019re there? I like that you can cash out your rewards at as little as $2 in gift cards, too. Every little bit helps. I typically stockpile and cash out around Christmas to supplement our budget.\u201dOnce you download the app, you earn points, or \u201ckicks,\u201d every time you spend at partner retailers. You can earn kicks without spending, too, by checking into stores or scanning certain items. While you won\u2019t get cash back directly, you can trade the points for gift cards to dozens of partner retailers. In short, Shopkick essentially works like any other rewards shopping site except there\u2019s no need to hop through a portal to earn your points. Just spend with your card as you normally would.Ibotta is a couponing app, but instead of getting a discount on your purchases, you get cash-back rebates. You check the app for offers \u2014 $1 cash back on a pizza brand, for example \u2014 and then either scan your receipt or link the app to your store loyalty cards so your savings are automatic. Ibotta accepts receipts only from participating stores and retailers, but most of the big players are listed: Whole Foods, Walmart, Ralph\u2019s, Kroger, HEB. Some offers will apply to only one retailer; others might be valid at several.\u201cI use Ibotta regularly and have made $253 so far,\u201d said Jessica Landon, an avid Ibotta user who\u2019s been using the app for about a year and a half. \u201cI usually look up offers before I head in the store, then upload and scan the products right when I get in my car so I don\u2019t forget.\u201d She said staples like produce usually earned only about 25 cents cash back, but it can add up. \u201cBuying beer for my husband usually gets me larger amounts. Diapers is another item that can earn you cash back faster.\u201dWith UserTesting, you get paid to offer feedback on a website. The pay is $10 per test, and it involves visiting a website, completing some tasks, then recording your feedback about the user experience. While you\u2019re visiting the app, UserTesting uses software to record your mouse movements, clicks and your voice. The tasks take about 10 to 20 minutes to complete.To use the software, you will need an internet connection and a microphone and to be able to download their testing software. If you want to take mobile tests, you\u2019ll need an iPhone, an iPad, an Android phone or an Android tablet. You\u2019re paid via PayPal, which means you can live and use the service to make money as long as you live in a country where PayPal works.Advertisement"}

Ms. Bonatsos spoke at one such event this month in San Francisco. And Jalak Jobanputra, founder of the start-up investment firm Future Perfect Ventures, and other blockchain developers gathered in New York this month to discuss the issue. They later announced that they would form a blockchain diversity advocacy group called the Collective Future and create a diversity pledge for crypto companies to sign as a show of commitment.\u201cThe early days are what decide the culture of an industry and who gets involved in making the decisions,\u201d Ms. Jobanputra said. She cited the venture capitalists who funded eBay and Amazon and whom they funded next.\u201cWomen always question if they\u2019re qualified,\u201d she said. \u201cBut look at these clowns around us.\u201dThe response to some of the events has been encouraging, some of the women said. Brit Morin, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, recently held a blockchain gathering for women that sold out in an hour. She moved the meeting to a bigger venue, where all 500 seats sold out again. So she set up a livestream for the event; that evening, 16,000 viewers joined to watch.\u201cWe have an opportunity to rebuild the financial systems,\u201d Ms. Morin said. \u201cWomen want to be part of that.\u201dThe resistance follows increasing outrage at the lack of diversity in virtual currencies, punctuated by the sexist incidents involving DateCoin\u2019s Facebook ad and Prodeum, the blockchain-for-fruit start-up. Neither company returned requests for comment.\u201cIt just coincidentally happened that there were more men than women speakers,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not intentional not to include them. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t have time to include them.\u201dWhen others in the cryptocurrency industry realized the conference\u2019s after-party would be held at a strip club, they encouraged Mr. Levin to change locations. He said the strip club was the most convenient and safest venue he could find.\u201cDowntown Miami doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of event spaces,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cAnd we needed a lot of security.\u201dThe year before, the conference\u2019s kickoff party featured underwear-clad models \u2014 painted gold and covered in Bitcoin logos.\u201cMoe does something just as sexist every year,\u201d said Rose Chan, who founded the World Bank\u2019s blockchain working group and now runs her own cryptocurrency project. \u201cHe switches it up, which actually means that he thinks about it.\u201dOne group of female investors said they had decided to boycott the conference in the future.Mr. Levin said this reaction surprised him. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people who had a great time,\u201d he said.At some women-in-crypto events, frustration is giving way to anger and sadness. On a recent night, about 50 young women interested in cryptocurrencies gathered at the Woman\u2019s Club of Palo Alto. Some were engineering students at nearby Stanford University.Over wine, they shared their stories \u2014 some had been mistaken for hired models, others propositioned during job interviews, and many men had not believed they were engineers at all.Catheryne Nicholson, the chief executive of BlockCypher, which provides infrastructure for blockchain applications, explained to some of the younger women why the gender situation had deteriorated.\u201cNow there\u2019s a lot of money, and the men think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a whale now,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re a little more full of themselves.\u201dKaren Hsu, BlockCypher\u2019s head of growth, said she thought some of the gender concerns had been overstated. She said that at a recent conference, she had been asked if she was a speaker, which was validating.\u201cIt was nice because he didn\u2019t think I was a booth babe,\u201d Ms. Hsu said, referring to hired models who stand near the booths of start-ups to draw the attention of conference attendees.Other women spoke about how the culture of blockchain was slowly wearing them down. Jay Graber, a developer at Zcash, a new cryptocurrency aimed at enhanced privacy, was wearing small green earrings she had made out of RAM sticks used in cryptocurrency gear. She said she had become interested in blockchain after joining the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011, and she viewed the technology as a tool that could take power away from big central banks. Now she\u2019s not so sure.\u201cI never felt insecure before I got into this space,\u201d Ms. Graber said. \u201cBut I just realized there is no one else like me. It is a very hard feeling when you don\u2019t see anyone who is like you.\u201dMs. Graber said she had considered leaving the industry.\u201cI have this perpetual sense of being on the outside of that conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a general state of alienation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In an Era of \u2018Smart\u2019 Things, Sometimes Dumb Stuff Is Better", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIt still feels magical to light up your living room by saying \u201cAlexa, turn on the lights.\u201d But with all the hype surrounding so-called smart things \u2014 everyday devices that are connected to the internet \u2014 it\u2019s easy to forget that sometimes the dumb stuff is just better.Tech companies are adding internet connections to just about everything you can imagine so that they can be controlled with smart speakers or phones. Thermostats, surveillance cameras, mosquito zappers, coffee makers \u2014 you name it.But before we get carried away setting up the Wi-Fi connections on all our appliances, lights and fashion accessories, let me play Luddite for a second. Some of the most mundane devices are designed to accomplish a simple task extremely well \u2014 and in some cases they still execute those duties better than their high-tech brethren.So let\u2019s take a moment to appreciate some of the best dumb things. Here are my top picks.Yet a normal wristwatch is still superior at one crucial task: Telling the time.The Apple Watch\u2019s screen wakes up when you tilt your wrist at an angle, which indicates you are trying to check the time. That helps conserve battery life. But any Apple Watch wearer is familiar with situations where this feature gets frustrating.While riding a bicycle, for example, you often have to let go of the handle bar and lift the watch toward your face to check the time. When you\u2019re standing on a bus or subway train and holding onto a pole, it is difficult to tilt your wrist at the correct angle to look at the time. Or when you\u2019re in a meeting and want to see if you\u2019re staying on schedule, flicking your wrist isn\u2019t very subtle.Until the Apple Watch manages to constantly display the time without sapping the battery, a normal wristwatch is better for telling the time in all those scenarios. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see me wearing a normal watch at work but an Apple Watch at the gym.Many cars are now equipped with a touch-screen on the console that essentially mirrors your smartphone screen. Android phone users get to use Android Auto, and iPhone users hook into CarPlay.The problem with this concept is there are a limited number of apps that work with these smart infotainment systems. For example, if on CarPlay you prefer to use Google Maps or Waze, you\u2019re out of luck and are stuck with Apple Maps.Voil\u00e0, your phone has become your infotainment system, capable of running your favorite navigation and music apps and using voice controls to place calls over speakerphone. The screen is large enough to clearly read maps, and you can update the operating system on your own. What more do you need?A camera on your nightstand that is constantly pointed at your bed? It\u2019s like asking for your privacy to be violated. You might as well shop for your groceries in your underwear or post all your smartphone photos publicly on the web.Amazon promises the camera software on the Echo Spot can be turned off whenever you aren\u2019t using it. But it\u2019s an obvious feature for hackers to target with malware.So if your primary goal is to have a device that wakes you up on time to go to work, just get an old-school alarm clock.But there are reasons a cheap kitchen timer can be superior.Cooking timing can vary depending on your heating element, among other factors. So if you have to check your food for doneness and change the kitchen timer, an old-school timer \u2014 either the analog variety or the type with a digital time display and two or three physical buttons \u2014 can be easier. It simply dings or beeps when the time is up and it\u2019s quicker to add or subtract a few minutes by turning a dial or pressing a button or two.You can also constantly see how much time is left on the timer, whereas with the Echo, you have to open a smartphone app to see the remaining time or ask Alexa to tell you how much time is left. Over the long term, using a smart speaker as a timer gets tedious.When people buy new iPads or Amazon Fire tablets, they often give their older tablet a second life by designating it for the kitchen. There, the ancient tablet gets mounted to the refrigerator with a magnet and becomes a glorified recipe reader.Having tried this experiment, it\u2019s a hassle. You often have to clean the tablet after smearing food on the screen. The battery eventually needs to be recharged. And if you want to double or halve a recipe, you have to do some mental math, which makes multitasking more challenging when you are busy in the kitchen.Printing out or jotting down a recipe on a piece of paper is just simpler. You can easily scribble additional notes, like changes and improvements to the recipe. Assuming you have decent handwriting, it\u2019s easy to read the steps and ingredients.And if it gets covered in food, you can just throw it away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Writer\u2019s Controversial Past That Will Not Die", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter never talked about my little cousin Thomas. Not that I ever would have asked him, yet I also know that my uncle would not stint on blaming himself. In memoir notes that Peter prepared before he died, in 2014, the loss of the child and the blame for it are handled tersely and honestly. He writes that the concierge where he and my aunt were living rapped his cheeks in the French manner \u2014 \u201csmack, smack!\u201d \u2014 and admonished him to try again: \u201cBut you\u2019re young! Just make another one!\u201dPostwar France was politically unstable; the city churned with Communists, fellow travelers, Gaullist plotters and foreign spies. In the late 1970s The New York Times revealed that Peter had worked for the C.I.A. during his two years in Paris. In fact, he sold the idea for The Paris Review to the other two co-founders, Humes and Plimpton, to firm up his cover for the agency. To be sure, my uncle had published award-winning short stories and had completed a first novel \u2014 that work was genuine and would continue \u2014 but the C.I.A. suggested that an additional activity, a real job, would deflect suspicion from the nosing around in left-wing circles that he was being paid to do. Nevertheless, in early 1953 the agency could not or would not tell Peter who was tailing his car in the streets.My grandparents were wealthy. Like the etiolated hero of \u201cPartisans,\u201d my uncle believed that his privileged background and private schooling had stunted his personal growth. To use today\u2019s psycho-parlance, Peter didn\u2019t like himself very much. Before he married and went off to Paris, he was often in one sort of trouble or another without really knowing why. He dodged a court-martial while in the Navy. He blew up his own engagement party \u2014 insulting Patsy\u2019s mother and making out with a bridesmaid. To paraphrase St. Augustine on his own bad-boy phase, Peter became to himself a place of unhappiness in which he could not bear to be, but he could not escape himself. Time and again he would bring himself to the lip of a crisis and, meaning to leap over, leap in.But at this juncture he acted wisely. Quitting the C.I.A., Peter took his wife and newborn son, my cousin Lucas, back home. He settled in Sagaponack, on Long Island, still and always a footloose man but more focused. In midlife he produced two fine novels, \u201cAt Play in the Fields of the Lord\u201d and \u201cFar Tortuga,\u201d and a glorious spate of nonfiction about the natural world. His best nonfiction works are \u201cUnder the Mountain Wall,\u201d \u201cThe Tree Where Man Was Born\u201d and especially \u201cThe Snow Leopard,\u201d which appeared in 1978. Matthiessen is the only writer to win National Book Awards in both nonfiction, for \u201cThe Snow Leopard,\u201d and fiction, for his 2008 novel, \u201cShadow Country.\u201dIf he were alive, he might voice one regret about his sterling career. His time in Paris kept bobbing to the surface, both the good part about The Paris Review, as the magazine\u2019s stature among intellectuals increased, and the negative part about his role in the C.I.A. Well before the C.I.A. story became public, Peter had acknowledged the connection to Plimpton and Humes, and after the revelation he tried to placate other friends for having been less than candid. He protested that he was young and had no politics to speak of, other than a vague, Ivy League sense of patriotism. \u201cPeople tend to forget,\u201d he wrote in his memoir notes, \u201cthat 60 years ago, at the start of the Cold War, the C.I.A. had not yet earned the evil repute it has today, and I look back on my own brief participation with more chagrin than shame.\u201d He also wrote, \u201cI was no good at this low work and hated the deception that went with it, which I found nerve-racking and disagreeable and made worse by the fact that it all seemed petty and pointless as well as an idiotic waste of public money.\u201dPutting on a pained smile, Peter would observe that by introducing him to socialists the C.I.A. had educated him in the wrong direction. My uncle, don\u2019t forget, became a champion of left-wing causes. He wrote books in support of the farmworkers leader Cesar Chavez and the Native American activist Leonard Peltier, and he regularly chastised big corporations and the government for harming the environment. The occasionally shrill vein in his writing cost him both money and credibility.I worry that as Peter\u2019s wonderful body of work fades from memory, younger readers might learn of him primarily through his Paris period, when he was reckless and secretive, before he discovered his true path. Will they pick up his books anyway? I imagine my uncle as I last saw him: in a sea-spattered shirt, eschewing the salon and the stirrings of social media, shaking his head in that pronounced way he had, the lion in his 80s and yet \u201cI am still beset by ankle-biters.\u201dPeter concluded, Zen Buddhist that he was, with a sort of koan about his time in Paris: \u201cEver try to wipe wet rice off a wood table? More than a half century has passed and the table is still sticky.\u201dJeff Wheelwright\u2019s most recent book is \u201cThe Wandering Gene and the Indian Princess.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Sex Toy Shops That Switched On a Feminist Revolution", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionTo be fair, Mailer & Co. had cause to quake. The quest for sexual self-knowledge, as two new books on the history and politics of sex toys reveal, would become a driver of feminist social change, striking a blow against men\u2019s overweening insecurity and the attempt (still with us today) to control women\u2019s bodies. As Lynn Comella writes in \u201cVibrator Nation,\u201d retailers like Good Vibrations in San Francisco created an erotic consumer landscape different from anything that previously existed for women, one that was safe, attractive, welcoming and ultimately subversive, presenting female sexual fulfillment as \u201cunattached to reproduction, motherhood, monogamy \u2014 even heterosexuality.\u201dAs you can imagine, both books (which contain a great deal of overlap) are chockablock with colorful characters, starting with Betty Dodson, the Pied Piper of female onanism, who would often personally demonstrate \u2014 in the nude \u2014 how to use a vibrator to orgasm during her early sexual consciousness-raising workshops in New York. I am woman, hear me roar indeed.Back in the day, though, attaining a Vibrator of One\u2019s Own was tricky. The leering male gaze of the typical \u201cadult\u201d store was, at best, off-putting to most women. Amazon, where sex toys, like fresh produce, are just a mouse click away, was still a glimmer in Jeff Bezos\u2019 eye. Enter Dell Williams, who after being shamed by a Macy\u2019s salesclerk while checking out a Hitachi Magic Wand, founded in 1974 the mail order company Eve\u2019s Garden. That was quickly followed by Good Vibrations, the first feminist sex toy storefront; it\u2019s great fun to read the back story of Good Vibes\u2019 late founder, Joani Blank, along with radical \u201csexperts\u201d like Susie Bright and Carol Queen.The authors of \u201cVibrator Nation\u201d and \u201cBuzz\u201d each put in time observing how sex toys are sold, so have firsthand insight into the industry. Whose take will hold more appeal depends on the reader\u2019s interests: In \u201cBuzz,\u201d Hallie Lieberman offers a broader view, taking us back some 30,000 years, when our ancestors carved penises out of siltstone; moving on to the ancient Greeks\u2019 creative use of olive oil; the buzzy medical devices of the 19th century (disappointingly, doctors\u2019 notorious in-office use of vibrators as treatment for female \u201chysteria\u201d is urban legend); and the impact of early-20th-century obscenity laws \u2014 incredibly, sex toys remain illegal in Alabama \u2014 before digging deeply into more contemporary influences. In addition to feminist retailers, Lieberman braids in stories of men like Ted Marche, whose family business \u2014 employing his wife and teenage children \u2014 began by making prosthetic strap-ons for impotent men; Gosnell Duncan, who made sex aids for the disabled and was the first to expand dildo production beyond the Caucasian pink once called \u201cflesh colored\u201d; the Malorrus brothers, who were gag gift manufacturers (think penis pencil toppers); and the hard-core porn distribution mogul Reuben Sturman, who repeatedly, and eventually disastrously, ran afoul of the law. Although their X-rated wares would supposedly give women orgasms, unlike the feminist-championed toys they were sold primarily as devices that would benefit men. Much like the era\u2019s sexual revolution, in other words, they maintained and even perpetuated a sexist status quo.\u201cVibrator Nation\u201d focuses more narrowly on women-owned vendors, wrestling with how their activist mission bumped up against the demands and constraints of the marketplace. Those early entrepreneurs, Comella writes, believed nothing less than that \u201cwomen who had orgasms could change the world.\u201d As with other utopian feminist visions, however, this one quickly splintered. Controversy broke out over what constituted \u201csex positivity,\u201d what constituted \u201cwoman-friendly,\u201d what constituted \u201cwoman.\u201d Was it politically correct to stock, or even produce, feminist porn? Were BDSM lesbians invited to the party? Would the stores serve transwomen? Did the \u201crespectable\u201d aesthetic of the white, middle-class founders translate across lines of class and race? If the goal was self-exploration through a kind of cliteracy, what about customers (of any gender or sexual orientation) who wanted toys for partnered play or who enjoyed penetrative sex? Could a sex store that sold nine-inch, veined dildos retain its feminist bona fides? Dell Williams solved that particular problem by commissioning nonrepresentational silicone devices with names like \u201cVenus Rising\u201d from Gosnell Duncan, the man who made prosthetics for the disabled. Others followed suit.Even so, Comella writes, the retailers struggled to stay afloat: Feminist stores refused, as a matter of principle, to trade on customers\u2019 anxiety \u2014 there were none of the \u201ctightening creams,\u201d \u201cnumbing creams,\u201d penis enlargers or anal bleaches that boosted profits at typical sex stores. Employees were considered \u201ceducators,\u201d and sales were secondary to providing information and support. What\u2019s more, Good Vibrations in particular was noncompetitive; Blank freely shared her business model with any woman interested in spreading the love.Consumer culture and feminism have always been strange bedfellows, with the former tending to overpower the latter. Just as Virginia Slims co-opted the message of \u201970s liberation, as the Spice Girls cannibalized \u201990s grrrl power, so feminist sex stores exerted their influence on the mainstream, yet were ultimately absorbed and diluted by it. In 2007, Good Vibrations was sold to GVA-TWN, the very type of sleazy mega-sex-store company it was founded to disrupt. Though no physical changes have been made in the store, Good Vibrations is no longer woman-owned. Although the aesthetics haven\u2019t changed, Lieberman writes, the idea of feminist sex toys as a source of women\u2019s liberation has faded, all but disappeared. An infamous episode of \u201cSex and the City\u201d that made the Rabbit the hottest vibrator in the nation also portrayed female masturbation as addictive and isolating, potentially leading to permanent loneliness. The sex toys in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d were wielded solely in service of traditional sex and gender roles: A man is in charge of Anastasia Steele\u2019s sexual awakening, and climax is properly experienced through partnered intercourse. Meanwhile, the orgasm gap between genders has proved more stubborn than the pay gap. Women still experience one orgasm for every three experienced by men in partnered sex. And fewer than half of teenage girls between 14 and 17 have ever masturbated.At the end of \u201cBuzz,\u201d Lieberman makes a provocative point: Viagra is covered by insurance but vibrators aren\u2019t, presumably because while erections are seen as medically necessary for sexual functioning the same is not true of female orgasm. Like our feminist foremothers, she envisions a new utopia, one in which the F.D.A. regulates sex toys to ensure their safety, in which they are covered by insurance, where children are taught about them in sex education courses and they are seen and even subsidized worldwide as a way to promote women\u2019s sexual health.In other words: We\u2019ve come a long way, baby, but as \u201cVibrator Nation\u201d and \u201cBuzz\u201d make clear, we still may not be coming enough.Peggy Orenstein is the author of \u201cGirls & Sex\u201d and a new book of essays, \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Princess.\u201dAdvertisement"}

None of the metrics on their own reliably can predict the direction of stocks, but when markets are freaking out and much is a blur, well-chosen indicators can steady the nerves and clarify the mind.The most important indicator right nowIt\u2019s the 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price. A higher yield reflects greater inflation fears among investors \u2014 and a higher likelihood of that interest rates are going up.Stock investors fear higher interest rates for two main reasons:\u2022 Most immediately, they make stock valuations look less attractive\u2022 In the longer term, they can eventually slow economic growth.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has retreated to 2.83 percent Monday, while United States stocks are trading higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all up more than 0.5 percent.Adding to the funThe government inflation figures come out on Wednesday.The valuation questionThe recent volatility in the stock market has stirred up the valuation debate. Put more directly, did the declines take stock prices down to level where they no longer look expensive?Still, history shows why that might not be the case. In 1997, the rule of 20 gave roughly the same answer as we have now, but stocks kept zooming higher. (Of course, that bull run did not end well. By 2001, the stock market was down below 1997 levels.)If you find the debate over valuation unsatisfactory ...There are also technical indicators, which look at how traders react to a wide selection of market measurements. One of the most interesting right now is the 200-day moving average on the S.&P. 500.But at one point Friday, it looked like that was where things were heading. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, or 2539, before recovering and closing the week above 2619, up 1.5% on the day.The 200-day moving average\u2014the continually updated average price of the past 200 days\u2014is considered a strong measure of investor sentiment. If the S&P 500 had continued to fall below the average, it would have conveyed real bearishness. The S&P 500 hasn\u2019t closed below that moving average in 408 trading sessions, going back to around the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, according to LPL Financial.\u2014 Peter EavisIt really is a remarkable achievement by Fuji. Without putting up any cash, they will acquire majority control and ownership of a venerable American icon. In exchange, we \u2013 the existing Xerox shareholders \u2013 will receive (1) an additional, indirect 25% interest in a Fuji subsidiary that just last year disclosed a $360 million accounting scandal caused by a \u201cculture of concealment\u201d and Fuji\u2019s failure to have adequate management systems and (2) a one-time special dividend financed with our own assets.The backstoryAt the end of last year, Mr. Icahn launched a campaign to unseat the Xerox\u2019s board, and late last month, he and Mr. Deason pressured the company to explore a deal \u2014 including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture.Xerox said it \u201cconsidered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the \u2018best path to create value\u2019 for the company.\u201d\u2014 Stephen GrocerHere are some of Mr. Tan\u2019s comments:On concerns the deal won\u2019t win regulatory approval and Broadcom\u2019s offer of an $8 billion breakup fee if it doesn\u2019t:\u201cYou know, I\u2019m kind of a frugal guy. You think I would sign up to pay $8 billion if there\u2019s even a second thought?\u201dOn if Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders don\u2019t vote for a majority of Broadcom\u2019s slate on March 6:\u201cThis is a binary proposal. If at least a majority of our slate does not get in on March 6, then I guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen. We will walk.\u201dOn Qualcomm\u2019s $110 a share offer for NXP Semiconductors, which has gotten pushback from NXP investors:\u201cNXPI will not solve Qualcomm\u2019s problems.\u201dOn the possibility that Qualcomm increases its bid for NXP Semiconductors:\u201cIf Qualcomm raises the price on NXPI, we have made it very clear, it\u2019s a clear transfer of value from Qualcomm shareholders to NXPI shareholders.\u201d\u201c$110 is a full and fair price for NXPI.\u201dHere\u2019s what the media banker Reed Phillips told Joe Pompeo of Vanity Fair:Time, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, and Entertainment Weekly are the hot properties, he said, noting that suitors are most likely to be rich trophy buyers, former media executives, and possibly other publishers. Private equity, not so much, \u201cexcept maybe for some firms that would do distress deals,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cStrategic buyers or wealthy individuals are gonna win out.\u201cWho could be a buyer? Some of the names that Mr. Pompeo identified:\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe numbers\u2014 Stephen GrocerGeneral Dynamics will pay $40.75 a share in cash, up 32 percent from CSRA\u2019s Friday closing price.Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics\u2019 chairman and C.E.O., said of the deal:CSRA\u2019s management team has created an outstanding provider of innovative, next-generation IT solutions with industry-leading margins. We see substantial opportunities to provide cost-effective IT solutions and services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.The contextThe deal came as President Trump has pushed for higher defense spending since taking office. Last week\u2019s budget deal added billions for military programs.The advisers\u2014 Chad BrayAfter leaving the White House as deputy national security adviser for strategy, Ms. Powell is going to academia. She will become a non-resident senior fellow for the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School.Nicholas Burns, the faculty director of the Belfer Center\u2019s Future of Diplomacy Project, said in a statement:\u201cDina Powell is one of our country\u2019s finest public servants. ... Combined with her deep private sector background, Dina will be a source of ideas and inspiration for our students.\u201dMany had been wondering where Ms. Powell would go after her tenure in the Trump administration. Before joining the White House, she had been a fast-rising executive at Goldman Sachs, where she oversaw the firm\u2019s impact investment business.Before that, she had been an official in the George W. Bush administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe markets flyaround\u201cWe cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain \u2014 one that delivers over a quarter of our advertising to our consumers \u2014 which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency.\u201dOn infrastructureDon\u2019t look for more specifics from the Trump administration, including on how its initiative will be funded. Republican lawmakers are wary of more spending: The government funding bill that Mr. Trump signed last week will push the budget deficit toward $1 trillion.On the budget proposalMore on the lawsuit by Brooks Barnes and Willie Neuman of the NYT:Eric Soufer, director of communications and senior counsel to Mr. Schneiderman, said the attorney general\u2019s office considered asking a judge for a temporary restraining order that could block the sale but opted not to and filed the civil rights lawsuit instead. He added that the office reviewed the proposed terms of the sale and that they did not include a victims compensation fund.The misconduct flyaroundMore from Conor Dougherty of the NYT:\u201cAs a businessperson in San Diego, if you\u2019re not following this you\u2019re living in a cave,\u201d said Jason Hughes, chief executive of Hughes Marino, a commercial real estate brokerage.And Mr. Hughes added, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re our flag.\u201dThe deals flyaround\u201cMy job as Uber\u2019s C.E.O. is to set the course for the future of the company: innovating and growing responsibly, as well as acknowledging and correcting mistakes of the past.\u201dUber ended a legal fight with a $245 million stock payout to Alphabet, less than it originally offered as a settlement.

{"Headline": "In N.R.A. Fight, Delta Finds There Is No Neutral Ground", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 Delta Air Lines, one of Georgia\u2019s largest private-sector employers, is among the glossiest corporate jewels in the state, contributing billions of dollars a year to the economy. Its hundreds of daily flights in and out of Atlanta\u2019s airport are the main reason Georgia\u2019s capital can brag, with justification, that it is a truly international city.But prestige, boosterism and corporate coddling \u2014 all cherished concepts in Georgia \u2014 took a back seat this week to the national debate over gun control. In the wake of the Florida school shooting, the airline announced it was ending a promotional discount with the National Rifle Association, and suddenly found itself in the rare position of being openly dressed down \u2014 and potentially punished \u2014 by Republicans who control the statehouse.The conservative backlash highlighted the challenge confronting corporations around the country that are struggling to cater to both ends of America\u2019s increasingly distant political and cultural poles.As pressure from social media and advocacy groups has intensified, and calls for boycotts mount, more than a dozen companies have severed business ties with the N.R.A. since the massacre in Parkland, Fla. Just as quickly, a counteroffensive arose from gun supporters excoriating the companies for their stance, forcing business leaders to navigate the treacherous ground where social responsibility, ideology and financial impact converge.Delta did not respond on Tuesday to Mr. Cagle\u2019s threat or amplify its stance regarding the N.R.A. In a statement over the weekend, the company said its decision to stop offering discounted fares to the N.R.A. \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.\u201dAs of Tuesday afternoon, the jet-fuel tax break, while opposed by Mr. Cagle and some other conservative Republicans, had not yet been stripped out of a broader Senate tax bill.\u201cWe are very clear that, when we set pricing strategy or look to adjust pricing, it is not based on political positions or points of view,\u201d Patrick Fitzgerald, the company\u2019s senior vice president, integrated marketing and communications, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cBut we do have a very clear corporate position in terms of gun safety and school safety.\u201dIn Georgia, the debate has been surprisingly fiery, even in a state long defined by tensions between the liberal metropolis and conservative countryside, and between the values of global corporate culture and those of Southern Republicans.State Senator Josh McKoon said in an interview Tuesday that he was put off by Delta\u2019s assertion that it was trying to remain neutral on the guns issue, when it had taken positions on other social topics in the past.\u201cIt just came off as very disingenuous,\u201d Mr. McKoon said of Delta\u2019s statement.Referring to Mr. Cagle\u2019s pushback, Mr. McKoon said, \u201cI think he captured the sentiment and the feeling of a lot of Georgians,\u201d who, he said, were frustrated \u201cwith Delta weighing in on an issue that has nothing to do with the topic of transportation, for sure.\u201dBut Mr. Massell, the former mayor who is president of the Buckhead Coalition, an influential Atlanta business and civic group, called the entire debate \u201cembarrassing.\u201d He said that he feared the threat against Delta would scare away Amazon, the online retail giant that has listed Atlanta among the finalists for its second headquarters.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in blackmail, and I\u2019m sorry to use such a dirty word, but that\u2019s almost what it tastes like,\u201d said Mr. Massell, a Democrat who served as mayor from 1970 to 1974. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. That\u2019s not Georgia\u2019s image. That\u2019s backwoods stuff that doesn\u2019t belong at all.\u201dIn subsequent decades, the city, which was founded as a railroad hub, invested heavily in its airport, and pushed a message that it was more socially tolerant than other Southern cities like Birmingham. It was a winning combination. Today, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest in the world, and Delta employs more than 33,000 Georgia residents.When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.Michael Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business and faculty director of the Center for Social Impact, said in an interview that \u201cDelta has every right to tell legislators, \u2018We\u2019re not of a mind to do your bidding.\u2019 They could easily pack their bags and move away from Atlanta and go to Dallas.\u201d\u201cAtlanta and Georgia and the business community usually try to work together and Delta is a huge employer in this state,\u201d said another former Atlanta mayor, Shirley Franklin. \u201cSo the relationship is damaged, if nothing else.\u201dA broader concern, shared by some liberals, conservatives and members of the Georgia business community, is that gun control may now join other hot-button cultural topics that may damage the state\u2019s reputation among national and global corporations that do not adhere to the same conservative Southern values as the state legislature.In the last few years, the legislature has taken up a number of prominent bills that critics say would allow for discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed one of them, a so-called religious liberty bill, in 2016, after some of the state\u2019s most prestigious and powerful companies \u2014 including Delta, Home Depot and Coca-Cola \u2014 openly opposed the measure.Mr. Deal, a Republican, will soon leave office because of term limits. Mr. Cagle, a leading candidate to replace him, is among a number of Republican hopefuls who say they will continue to support the legislation, which would have strengthened legal protection for opponents of same-sex marriage.Mr. McKoon, a Republican who is leaving the upper chamber to run for secretary of state, said that he had long opposed the jet-fuel tax break on the grounds that it seemed like a handout for a politically connected industry.Mr. McKoon was a vocal supporter of the 2016 religious liberty bill that Mr. Deal vetoed. He said that when that legislation failed, he issued a warning, saying that liberals would continue pressuring companies to embrace progressive social positions.He warned, he said, that \u201cthe next logical step would be to attack gun rights. And I think we are seeing the beginning of that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information provided by a consulting firm working for Delta Air Lines, misstated the airline\u2019s estimate of its economic impact on Georgia. It is $43.5 billion, not $435 billion.Advertisement"}

While radio bulletins regularly report on abducted millionaires, the poor disappear in other ways and no one cares. Injustice is made apparent as the authorities are shown demolishing shantytowns, seemingly at random.Assuming several different identities, at times something of a compassionate superheroine, Horacia bides her time among the lower depths, befriending squatters and street people. Notable among these garrulous characters is Hollanda, a transgender prostitute (the romantic idol John Lloyd Cruz, like Ms. Santos-Concio, a known star cast against type). Horacia nurses Hollanda, subject to epileptic seizures and beaten nearly to death, back to health. In one unexpected bit of business, their drunken duet of \u201cSunrise, Sunset\u201d segues into her rendition of another Broadway show tune, \u201cSomewhere.\u201d Like her character, Ms. Santos-Concio is full of surprises.

The precisely placed camera rarely moves \u2014 and when it does, as with tracking shots exploring the parties and tawdry forms of entertainment on the local beach, the sense of release is in some ways comparable to Horacia\u2019s own.The climate of \u201cCasa de Lava\u201d is ripe and melancholy. The hospital where Mariana brings Le\u00e3o was once a leper colony; the island was a penal settlement for the exiled enemies of Portugal\u2019s dictatorship. Even as some Europeans stay on, one of whom (Edith Scob) is the widow of a former prisoner, the local residents are compelled to leave, looking for work in Portugal. \u201cNot even the dead can rest here,\u201d somebody says.\u201cCasa de Lava\u201d (which was never commercially released in the United States and has been issued on disc by the adventurous and estimable new label, Grasshopper Film) is laconic and oblique. The action is hauntingly cryptic. Mariana\u2019s motives and actions resist easy interpretation, although Ms. Medeiros, an actress with many expressions who, for most of the movie, wears the same outfit (a short, flimsy red tunic), is never less than convincing. Her vivid presence is matched by that of Cape Verde\u2019s volcanic landscape. Few movies have a stronger sense of place \u2014 or placelessness. The narrative is ravishingly tangled. As the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum writes in notes that accompany the disc, \u201cEach beautiful composition \u2014 that is to say, each shot \u2014 tells a separate story.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Albertsons Is Buying Rite Aid. Walmart\u2019s Stock Falls. There\u2019s a Common Rival.", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe supermarket operator Albertsons said Tuesday morning that it would buy the remnants of the Rite Aid drugstore chain. By the end of the day, Walmart saw its stock drop by more than 10 percent on weak profit.Both can blame Amazon.An old-line grocer, Albertsons is striving for reinvigoration in a retail landscape being upended by e-commerce competitors and discount food stores. But it can be difficult for any company, no matter how strategic its deal-making, to pull off a revival in this environment.The retail stalwart, Walmart has been trying to build its online presence as it moves to fend off Amazon. But even deep pockets don\u2019t guarantee success in an increasingly digital landscape.Amazon is the omnipresent foe, in whatever realm that Albertsons or Walmart plays in. The e-commerce giant wants to dominate the grocery store business, while also eyeing the health care industry.\u201cIt\u2019s the battle of the old generation versus the new generation,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. \u201cAnd right now the companies that are gaining share is the new generation.\u201dThe deal for Rite Aid puts Albertsons directly in the middle of two major pushes by Amazon.Albertsons plans to rebrand its in-house pharmacies under the Rite Aid name, and to continue operating some stand-alone Rite Aid stores. The bet is that the increased foot traffic to the in-house pharmacies will bring more customers to Albertsons\u2019 food aisles, where they will pick up a rib-eye steak or a bunch of bananas on their way out.Amazon\u2019s entry into the grocery business could hurt Albertsons and similar chains whose greatest asset may be the convenient locations of their stores. If Amazon increases its home delivery of fresh food, that convenience may not be as appealing.Conventional grocers like Albertsons are also feeling pressure from chains like Trader Joe\u2019s, which is known for its affordable high-quality products, and Wegmans, a growing regional chain that has built a cultlike following.\u201cGrocery is being hit by multiple factors,\u201d said Gerald Storch, the former chief executive of the retailer Hudson\u2019s Bay.The pharmacy business, too, is undergoing major changes, with the nation\u2019s largest operators of drugstores pursuing mergers to control costs and increase profits.For Albertsons, the Rite Aid deal is just the latest step to draw in more customers.Originally founded by Joe Albertson in Boise, Idaho, in 1939, Albertsons grew primarily across the West. In 2013, it was acquired by a group of investors led by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for about $3 billion.Its biggest deal came in 2014 when Cerberus agreed to buy Safeway, another grocery chain whose roots lie in Idaho, for $9.2 billion. A planned public offering of the company\u2019s stock in 2015 never took place.The Rite Aid deal provides Albertsons\u2019 investors with a way of finally going public after investing billions of dollars. Under the deal\u2019s terms, Rite Aid shareholders would get $1.83 in cash and one share of Albertsons stock, or 1.079 shares of Albertsons stock, for every 10 shares of Rite Aid they owned.Walmart\u2019s biggest challenges are tied to its own plans to compete with Amazon.Walmart spent heavily acquiring online retailers like Bonobos, Jet.com and ModCloth. Investors have largely been willing to forgive the company\u2019s softening profits as long as the investments resulted in increased sales.But Wall Street is getting impatient. In announcing the fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Walmart said its online sales had grown 23 percent in the United States during the three-month period that ended Jan. 31. That was less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters.\u201cWalmart got a late start to the internet game, and they are still suffering for it,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, of Customer Growth Partners.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 There have been far blacker Mondays.\u2022 Kenneth C. Griffin is growing concerned about inflation.\u2022 The Fed\u2019s regulatory action against Wells may have some bite.\u2022 Broadcom puts more pressure on Qualcomm\u2022 How worried should JPMorgan clients be about health care?\u2022 How much more will Wells Fargo have to do?Measured by points, those are steep drops \u2014 the biggest on record for the indexes. The previous largest point declines for each benchmark came in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.But Monday\u2019s plunge was far less impressive on a percentage basis. The Dow\u2019s fall ranked as its 100th biggest, while the S. & P. 500\u2019s slide was the 127th biggest in the index\u2019s history, according to S & P Dow Jones Indices.Here is how Monday\u2019s sell-off stacks up against two other major tumbles.But points are not the best way to compare the magnitude of a stock index\u2019s declines across eras. As the stock market has risen, big point moves have translated into increasingly smaller percentage changes. The Dow and the S. & P. 500 have more than doubled from their closes on Sept. 29, 2008.\u201cBlack Monday\u201d was a petrifying moment \u2014 an even bigger decline in both points and percentage than the stock market crash of 1929. But unlike the 1929 crash, the slide in 1987 did not contribute to a wider economic slump. The stock market recovered its losses by early 1989.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Peter EavisAs the U.S. stock markets look wobbly for the first time in nearly two years, at least one major investor is sounding a bearish tone.In a Jan. 31 letter to investors, Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago hedge-fund firm Citadel, wrote that even though the broader economic backdrop continues to be positive, he sees several warning signs that could turn stock prices downward.The end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy is one factor, Mr. Griffin wrote, that could pressure stocks. But the prospect of inflation, or a rapid rise in the prices of goods and services, is making him especially nervous.\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the nascent signs\u201d of rising inflation in a variety of countries, he wrote. As a result, he added, money managers at Citadel, which runs a variety of hedge funds, are \u201ccarefully positioning\u201d for a surprise, sharp upturn in inflation.Mr. Griffin added that he is also concerned about geopolitical risks, writing that his money managers need to be able to handle negative events if they do occur, \u201cincluding a trade policy misstep or a military conflict.\u201d He did not elaborate.In an interview with CNBC in November, Mr. Griffin said the stock market was in the \u201cseventh inning\u201d of a rally. He said through a spokesman on Monday that he still thinks there are several innings to go before a downturn begins and that he is more bearish on bond prices than stocks at the moment.\u2014 Kate KellyWith 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.The numbers\u202275 percent of companies are reporting earnings above estimates, above the five-year average.\u2022 Companies that are beating estimates are doing so by a 4 percent margin, below the five year average.\u202280 percent of companies have reported revenue above estimates, a record high.\u2022 All 11 sectors are reporting earnings growth.Wells Fargo\u2019s stock is down more than 7 percent Monday, suggesting that investors believe the growth cap will have some bite. With the economy strengthening and interest rates rising, banks can expect to earn higher profits as they make more loans and suffer fewer losses from defaults. Indeed, this optimistic scenario has helped send bank stocks on a tear in recent months. Now, the question is to what degree Wells Fargo will have to sit out the good times.Wells Fargo executives on Friday suggested that the cap would have limited financial impact, saying it would reduce this year\u2019s net profits by $300 million to $400 million, which works out at less than 2 percent of 2017\u2019s earnings. One reason the earnings hit might be small is that the bank can stay within the cap by selling short-term, lower-risk investments that don\u2019t earn much. Another way the bank intends to limit the negative impact is by reducing the amount of deposits on which the bank pays out a relatively high interest rate.Crucially, Wells Fargo said that it hopes to increase the size of its loan book. The hope is that, by shedding the low-risk investments, the bank will create the room to make more mortgages, credit card loans and loans to businesses, while staying within the limit.But it may not turn out to be as straightforward as that.The growth cap comes after a lackluster year for Wells, which reduced its loans 1 percent last year, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent at Bank of America. Investors waiting for catch-up growth at Wells may have to wait still longer. Also, much depends on whether Wells Fargo can now satisfy the Fed\u2019s concerns. Any indication that the bank is struggling to comply with the regulator\u2019s demands could set off more turmoil at the bank. There is also a possibility that the tactic of shedding of low-risk investments while making more loans could increase the overall risk of Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet.Brian Kleinhanzl, a banks analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote on Sunday that the Fed\u2019s action will \u201cmean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,\u201d adding, \u201cWells will also have to maintain the balance sheet while other banks are growing, and we view this as defensive versus peers.\u201d\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 A takeover price of $82 a share, up from its original offer of $70\u2022 A \u201csignificant\u201d breakup fee if a deal were to be halted for antitrust reasons\u2022 A \u201cticking fee\u201d that Broadcom would pay in cash if a deal took more than a year to closeIt said the new \u201cbest and final\u201d offer would be withdrawn if Qualcomm either pushed its annual shareholder meeting back from March 6 (when Broadcom hopes to unseat the entire board) or if it paid more than $110 a share for NXP Semiconductor.Other cryptocurrencies are falling as well. Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin are all down Monday.How far can Bitcoin fall?Simon Tobler, a trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told Bloomberg: \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold the $8,000 level, Bitcoin may fall to $5,000, where the next big support is. The market is lacking big buyers.\u201dMore from Anna Wilde Mathews, Dana Cimilluca and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:In a reflection of the sensitivity of the subject, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon hit the phones Tuesday to assuage clients\u2019 concerns, people familiar with the matter said. So did some of the firm\u2019s health care bankers, who get paid handsomely to help clients with mergers and other deals and worry the move could cost them business.More from Emily Flitter, Binyamin Appelbaum and David Enrich:The settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.From her interview with Judy Woodruff:\u201cI don\u2019t want to label what we\u2019re seeing a bubble \u2014 as a bubble.\u201cBut I would say that asset valuations generally are elevated, and this is a characterization that we have offered up, for example, last summer in our monetary policy report.\u201d\u2022 Getting bigger by merging with another media company doesn\u2019t solve CBS\u2019s problems.

{"Headline": "Businesses Look at Washington and Say, \u2018Never Mind, We\u2019ll Do It\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisCan private businesses solve public policy problems better than the government? It\u2019s a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House.There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success \u2014 a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school \u2014 there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be.In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dJoining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care?In announcing they would try, they delivered an implicit rebuke of the complex and costly American health care system, suggesting that the best minds in business could do better.\u201cCompanies are now thinking much more about how to solve larger social problems,\u201d said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. \u201cWhen Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, three leaders in their industries, looked around, they realized that health care is a big issue facing them all.\u201dTheir efforts stem from a feeling that, with partisan bickering and constant campaigning consuming Washington, the onus is on businesses to fill the void left by an ineffective government.The notion that big business might shape government policy is nothing new, of course. Lobbyists have been working to sway lawmakers for decades, and the corporate world was an influential force in the tax overhaul passed last year.Yet for the most part, these efforts were narrowly aligned with a company\u2019s self-interest, usually in the form of lowering taxes and loosening regulations. And rarely have business leaders tried to assume operational control of a government function, let alone something as complex and unwieldy as health care.In recent years, however, more chief executives have begun speaking out on issues that at first glance have little to do with the bottom line, including immigration policy, climate change and gay rights.\u201cThe lack of leadership on the national political level has left this vacuum,\u201d said Kathleen Clark, a professor at the Washington University Law school. \u201cFortunately, there are some business leaders who see that there\u2019s a role for them to play.\u201dThe most vivid expression of this new willingness to speak out came last summer after white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Trump equivocated in his response to the violence.Chief executives may seem like unlikely ethical leaders; Wells Fargo, Equifax, Uber and many more companies have faced questions from Congress about practices that have harmed consumers and in some instances cost taxpayers billions of dollars.But companies have also been wading into moral debates for decades. General Motors and Pepsi pulled out of South Africa during the apartheid era. Apple, Disney and Xerox were early in extending health care benefits to gay and lesbian couples.Similar efforts by chief executives today recall \u201can earlier era of corporate statesmanship,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a fellow at New America, a research and policy institute. \u201cA lot of these business leaders viewed a business as having a somewhat broader public mission.\u201dNow, he said, thanks to \u201cthe rise, over the last 15 years, of the importance of social responsibly and social mission, there is a broad movement in business.\u201dEven Amazon\u2019s much-publicized efforts to select a city for a second headquarters could, in a roundabout way, influence local policymakers. Given that the company is unlikely to set up shop in a state with socially conservative laws that might alienate some employees, \u201cAmazon could have an effect not just on prices but on what legislators pass,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.George Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has been promoting democratic ideals around the globe. And Mr. Zuckerberg, through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, is working on ambitious long-term projects involving science, education and justice.There is a big difference, though, between supporting social causes and research and operating a sprawling public works system. Critics will contend that some of these efforts smack of arrogance, and that businesses ought to stay in their lane and focus on offering excellent products and services, not meddle in public policy.\u201cThere is this hubris, thinking that they can do it better,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.There is also a certain irony to the fact that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan said the new company they had formed would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dThe profit motive, after all, is what leads to efficiency and innovation, according to conventional business school wisdom. Operating as a nonprofit \u201cflies in the face of the logic of the capitalist economy,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.It most likely will take years to determine if the three companies can make good on their promise of building a better health care system. Even if they succeed, the rewards may be limited to their employees \u2014 a large figure, but a small portion of the American work force.Nonetheless, the companies\u2019 push is among the most audacious efforts by the private sector to date, and Mr. Dimon did not shy away from the scope of their ambition.\u201cThe three of our companies have extraordinary resources,\u201d he said on Tuesday when the initiative was announced. \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Most Afghans Can\u2019t Read, but Their Book Trade Is Booming", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Nuts come in from Iran and fresh fruit from Pakistan, even though Afghanistan grows both in abundance. Years of bloated foreign aid budgets have produced high salaries, destroying local industries. As a result, about the only thing the country does not import is opium.And books.In a turbulent, troubled society, curling up with a book has become the best tonic around.Unsurprisingly, Afghanistan\u2019s book publishers have capitalized on this. What is more noteworthy is that a major piece of Afghan socioeconomic development is happening without direct foreign aid or foreign advisers.\u201cIt\u2019s an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led process,\u201d said Safiullah Nasiri, one of the four brothers who run Aksos, a book publisher that also operates several bookstores in Kabul. His remark was a deliberate play on international community jargon about shifting to Afghan control of institutions dominated by Westerners.\u201cIt\u2019s really an exciting time in the book world here,\u201d Mr. Nasiri said. \u201cPublishers are all trying to find new books to publish, young people are trying to find new books to read, writers are looking for publishers. It\u2019s a very dynamic atmosphere. And it\u2019s something independent, with no foreign assistance.\u201dKabul, the capital of Afghanistan with a rapidly growing population of more than five million, now has 22 book publishers, many with their own presses, or using the presses at local printing houses. Scores of others are scattered throughout the country\u2019s 34 provinces, even in war-torn areas like Helmand and Kandahar.In the past year, especially, many publishers have been expanding, opening up distribution centers across the country and underwriting either their own bookstores or providing consignments to independent bookstores. Kabul has 60 registered bookstores, according to the government.In the years after the American-led invasion, cheaply printed and brazenly pirated books from Pakistan were as dominant as that country\u2019s fruits and vegetables in the markets of Kabul.Foreign aid underwrote the school system, so the textbook business jump-started the book publishing industry. Because millions of textbooks had to be printed in a short period of time, Aazem and a few other companies invested in their own presses, which went largely idle once the school publishing season was over. Then the new publishers began translating Western books from English into Dari and Pashto, the country\u2019s two main languages.Other publishers sprung up, renting the bigger companies\u2019 presses.\u201cThere was this huge pent-up demand from so many years without new books,\u201d said Dr. Ajmal Aazem, a pediatrician whose father founded the publishing house that bears their name. The Aazem company is publishing books as fast as it can, limited only by a shortage of qualified translators from English into local languages. Aazem\u2019s 2017-18 goal is to print three new titles a day, 1,100 a year \u2014 a huge number for any publisher.The publishing house is festooned with life-size posters of recent book covers, and the bookshop is full of volumes in artfully arranged helical piles or displayed on the walls with English and Persian versions opening from right and left, side by side. The floor in the middle of the sales room has been raised to accommodate the presses on the floor below, making a sort of platform with comfortable armchairs.Piracy remains endemic. On a recent day, even some of the titles in Aksos\u2019 own busy, flagship bookstore were pirated copies of popular books.Publishers are worried. \u201cOn a lot of our books, we\u2019ll sell 1,000 copies, and the pirates will sell 4,000 copies of the same book at lower prices,\u201d Dr. Aazem said. \u201cThe government needs to do more to stop this.\u201dGovernment officials have started enforcing the country\u2019s long-ignored copyright laws, according to Sayed Fazel Hossain Sancharaki, who is in charge of publishing at the Ministry of Information and Culture. \u201cIn the last four months we\u2019ve had four or five copyright cases,\u201d he said. One photocopy shop was closed recently by the government for running off copies of printed books.Realizing that \u201cThe Envoy,\u201d the 2016 memoir by Mr. Khalilzad, the Afghan-American who was the United States ambassador to both Afghanistan and Iraq, would be a big seller here, Mr. Aazem rushed to acquire the Dari and Pashto rights. He was determined to offer a better-quality book at a narrow markup and flood the market before the pirates could do so. But Aksos managed to print a Pashto version first, without rights to it, selling 1,000 copies in three days, he said.Mr. Nasiri, the owner of Aksos, which is also translating a new title every week or so, denied that his company printed pirated books. And he, also, complained about piracy. \u201cWe do have copyright law in Afghanistan, but no one seems to know that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, serious problem.\u201dAksos recently began commissioning original books, too, including \u201cBaghdadi Pir,\u201d a historical novel in Pashto about a British spy in the 1920s during the time of King Amanullah.Mr. Nasiri admitted that his bookstores stock many pirated volumes, even if they do not pirate books themselves.\u201cWe are actually against that, but since almost all books are pirated, we have no option but to accept pirated copies and sell them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do that, it will make business hard for us. This is happening all over Asia.\u201d\u201cWe invested heavily in that book and printed it beautifully, then kept the cost as low as possible to defeat the pirates,\u201d Dr. Aazem said. Promotional posters were distributed to bookstores, showing the avuncular Mr. Spanta, and billboard space and airtime were purchased to advertise it.\u201cAfghan Politics\u201d was out for about a month, however, when an electronic file of the book began circulating on Afghan social media accounts.Furious, the publishers at Aazem closed their doors in protest, hanging black curtains in all the windows and idling the presses until the government promised to pursue book pirates. They\u2019re still waiting.Jawad Sukhanyar and Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Based the novel by Ian McEwan, \u201cAtonement\u201d has the elegance and sweep of a classic wartime romance, in which the emotion intensifies with each falling bomb. But it\u2019s also a literate period piece about the tragic ramifications of one falsely witnessed moment.The worlds of \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d and Wright\u2019s 2007 drama, \u201cAtonement,\u201d intersect on the beaches of Dunkirk, which the earlier film renders in one celebrated tracking shot that captures the chaos, misery, surreality and defiant hope of British soldiers awaiting an evacuation that may never come.

Produced for HBO and the BBC, \u201cThe Gathering Storm\u201d catches up with Churchill six years earlier, when he was plugging away on a biography on the Duke of Marlborough at his home in Chartwell, in rural Kent.\u201cDarkest Hour\u201d opens as Churchill succeeds Neville Chamberlain as British prime minister, amid fierce debate over whether to seek a treaty with Nazi Germany. Produced for HBO and the BBC, \u201cThe Gathering Storm\u201d catches up with Churchill six years earlier, when he was plugging away on a biography on the Duke of Marlborough at his home in Chartwell, in rural Kent.As the title suggests, the film is about Churchill\u2019s growing alarm over German rearmament under Adolf Hitler and his difficult return to relevance, aided by government officials like Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache) who share his concerns and reject the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi). Albert Finney won an Emmy for his dyspeptic Churchill \u2014 as did Brendan Gleeson\u2019s Churchill in the lesser 2009 sequel, \u201cInto the Storm\u201d\u2014 and Vanessa Redgrave lends fine support as his wife, Clemmie, whose faith in her husband sometimes wavers dramatically.As the title suggests, the film is about Churchill\u2019s growing alarm over German rearmament under Adolf Hitler and his difficult return to relevance, aided by government officials like Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache) who share his concerns and reject the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi).

Their stout refusal to give up recalls the well-to-do characters in William Wyler\u2019s \u201cMrs. Miniver,\u201d whose cushy lives in a village outside London are ruptured by encroaching German forces.In \u201cDarkest Hour,\u201d Wright and his screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, granted themselves the poetic license to imagine a scene in which Churchill rides the tube, where he surveys ordinary Londoners about staying in the war.

But \u201cMrs. Miniver\u201d depicts another aspect of the home front in this story of a decent, loving family that shows courage and resilience when duty calls. The father (Walter Pidgeon) adds his boat to the evacuation effort at Dunkirk, the mother (Greer Garson) squares off with a German pilot who crash-lands in her garden, and their son (Richard Ney) leaves his fianc\u00e9e behind to enlist in the Royal Air Force. Tragedy inevitably arises, but the family and community stand firm, even when surrounded by wreckage.Wyler went on to make the definitive coming-home drama, \u201cThe Best Years of Our Lives,\u201d four years later.

For all of Wright\u2019s cinematic brio, \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d takes place almost wholly in tight quarters, to the point where a side journey to the London Underground feels like a respite. The third in a biographical trilogy that includes \u201cTaurus,\u201d about Vladimir Lenin, and \u201cMoloch,\u201d about Hitler, Alexander Sokurov\u2019s \u201cThe Sun\u201d (first released overseas in 2005) takes place in Japan during the waning days of World War II, as Emperor Hirohito (Issey Ogata) prepares not only for surrender but also for renouncing his perceived divinity.Films about world leaders of any kind, particularly those in times of war, are often chamber pieces, set in the suffocating corridors of power where decisions are made in isolation.

But while Sokurov maintains the extreme austerity of his previous work, \u201cThe Sun\u201d allows for blessed moments of culture-clash humor, as when Hirohito meets a boorish Gen. Douglas MacArthur and puzzles over his gift of Hershey bars.Filming through filters that seem coated in ash, Sokurov emphasizes the human qualities of a greatly diminished man as he putters around a bunker in the Imperial Palace, awaiting his inevitable humbling.

In this hugely underrated gothic horror film from Francis Ford Coppola, Oldman is transformed from a dashing 15th century conqueror to a centuries-old creature of the night, but the effects don\u2019t smother a performance that\u2019s suffused with bloody terror and romantic woe.Much has been made of the four-hour makeup sessions that turned the gaunt Oldman into a jowly Churchill, but it\u2019s not as if Oldman hadn\u2019t put in the time before.

Murnau\u2019s \u201cNosferatu\u201d or Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog\u2019s \u201cNosferatu the Vampyre\u201d have played up the grotesque menace of the living dead, but Oldman and Coppola\u2019s interpretation is more haunting and sad, as the Count attempts to reclaim a lost love for eternity. Oldman is the standout in an unsteady ensemble, and he\u2019s supported by Coppola\u2019s ravishing visual conceit, which flashes back to early cinema through Michael Ballhaus\u2019s old-fashioned in-camera effects and looks forward with Eiko Ishioka\u2019s avant-garde costume design.Past Draculas like Max Schreck in F.W.

Director Tom Hooper never met a wide-angle shot he couldn\u2019t frame distractingly, but the back-and-forth between Firth and Rush bristles with tension and wit.The heart of the film is the relationship between King George, known informally as \u201cBertie,\u201d and Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian who has experience in ironing out speech defects but no formal or medical expertise.

{"Headline": "Judge Deals AT&T a Setback: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Judge deals AT&T a setback in fight with Justice Department\u2022 Billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen lost a bid to seal a sex discrimination lawsuit against his investment firm.\u2022 Corporate leaders are discussing whether the finance industry can help regulate gun sales.\u2022 Walmart\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations.\u2022 Facebook is still facing blowback for an executive\u2019s tweets about Russian electoral meddling.\u2022 Qualcomm\u2019s revised bid for NXP raises questions about Broadcom\u2019s pursuit of the company.On Tuesday, a judge ruled that AT&T was not entitled to those documents, saying the companies had not \u201cmade a credible showing that they have been especially singled out.\u201dAT&T has argued that the Justice Department has unfairly singled out its proposed merger with Time Warner partly to stay in favor with the White House. President Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner\u2019s news network, CNN, and said before the election that the deal should be stopped.The bigger pictureCecilia Kang of the NYT: For the first time, and after much protest, public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of the chief executive. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed nearly eight years ago, required the disclosure, and firms are now disclosing it in proxy reports for 2017.Companies, lobbyists and some compensation experts spent years criticizing the rule, arguing that it revealed little about pay trends and was of little use to shareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning think tank, on Tuesday noted that Honeywell was the first United States corporation to release the ratio. The company\u2019s C.E.O., Darius Adamczyk, had a total pay package of $16.8 million in 2017, which was 333 times the pay of the median employee.The rule allows certain companies to exclude some foreign employees from the calculation of the ratio. Honeywell excluded workers from several countries where pay is most likely lower than in the United States. \u201cThe 333:1 ratio that Honeywell is reporting most likely would be even wider if Honeywell took all its workers into account,\u201d the Institute said.\u2014 Peter EavisA federal judge in Manhattan, in a brief order, rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Mr. Cohen and his firm, Point72 Asset Management, to temporarily seal a complaint filed last week by Lauren Bonner, an employee of the firm. Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer had asked the judge to seal the lawsuit, which alleges the firm underpays female employees and fosters a hostile workplace for women, pending the resolution of another motion to push the matter into arbitration.Judge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the request to seal the entire complaint was \u201cnot narrowly tailored\u201d and was inconsistent with the \u201cpresumption of public access\u201d to court records.Lawyers for Mr. Cohen had sought to seal the order because it contained details of other employees\u2019 compensation packages. The lawsuit also detailed a testosterone-fueled \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d atmosphere in which men commented frequently on women\u2019s bodies and belittled their abilities.\u2014 Matthew GoldsteinAndrew writes:More from the column:There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products. Just this month, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America banned the use of their cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.To be clear: Those three banks won\u2019t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle \u2014 the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex.The United States Treasury Department is flooding the market with debt. On Tuesday, the government sold $179 billion worth of debt.Bloomberg reports:\u201cConcerns about the U.S. borrowing cap had forced the Treasury to trim the total amount of bills it had outstanding, but that\u2019s no longer a problem and the government is now busy ramping up issuance. Financing estimates from January show that the Treasury expects to issue $441 billion in net marketable debt in the current quarter and the bulk of that is likely to be in the short-term market.\u201dThat\u2019s been a regular question since the tax overhaul was signed into law last year. Analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note over the weekend shed some light on the answer.\u2022 \u201cCompanies have pointed to a modest increase in investment as one destination for the incremental cash flow from tax reform. Consensus estimates for 2018 capex have increased by $17 billion (3 percent) since the passage of tax reform.\u201d\u2022 Last month 39 S.&P. 500 companies increased their dividend, while for the first since 2012 no companies cut their payments.\u2022 Buying back shares remains a priority of companies, Goldman writes. Over the past 2 \u00bd months, S.&P. 500 firms have announced $171 billion of buybacks, $67 billion of which has come this year, a 22% increase from the same period in 2017.In the same note, Goldman also took a closer look at this earnings season.By many measures, corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in the past decade. Goldman points out:\u2022 Companies in the S.&P. 500 are set to report that profit grew 15 percent last quarter. That\u2019s the fastest pace since 2011.\u2022 The percentage of companies beating estimates is at its highest level since 2010. The percentage beating sales forecast is at its highest since 2004.But the stock reaction to S.&P. 500 companies either beating or missing expectations \u201chas been muted relative to history.\u201dThe reason? Investors are more focused on tax reform and earnings forecasts for 2018, Goldman writes. Analysts have raised their 2018 earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 by 7 percent so far this year.Some contextHigher profit margins because of the lower corporate tax rate are driving much of the increase in this year\u2019s earnings forecast. A point that becomes clearer by looking at 2018 sales estimates. Analysts have increased their revenue forecasts by only one percentage point and much of that increase comes from higher oil prices boosting forecasts for energy companies.Remember when the company said that it was changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea and shift its corporate focus to virtual currencies?\u2022 Long Blockchain has named a new C.E.O., Shamyl Malik.\u2022 It plans to spin off its beverage division into the publicly traded Long Island Brand Beverages by June 30, and the company\u2019s last C.E.O., Philip Thomas, will be on the new business\u2019 board.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cWe\u2019re making real progress putting our unique assets to work to serve customers in all the ways they want to shop.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedIn real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.The tech flyaroundThe new offer may have come at an opportune time: I.S.S., the influential proxy adviser, recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for four of Broadcom\u2019s six board nominees. (But that too falls short of Broadcom\u2019s goals. The company\u2019s C.E.O., Hock Tan, has said he would walk away if the entire slate wasn\u2019t elected.)It and other hedge funds stand to be big winners from Qualcomm\u2019s raised offer.The deals flyaroundRichard Gelfond, chief executive of IMAX, the large-format movie exhibitor, which played \u201cBlack Panther\u201d in more than 60 countries, championed Disney for delivering \u201ccontent that is compelling on its face but also bridges the gap between different cultures, and ultimately is a reflection of the shared values of moviegoers all over the world.\u201dSolutions discussed at a recent conference included hiring security, setting up \u201cduress wallets\u201d to fool hostage takers, and keeping Bitcoin fortunes secret.Critics\u2019 corner\u201cIn this case, we were not talking about politics.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Maybe the meal-kit industry isn\u2019t dead yet.\u2022 Blackstone names Jonathan Gray as president and C.O.O.\u2022 Broadcom just moved the goal posts in its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm.\u2022 How market volatility has helped the Federal Reserve.\u2022 A lawsuit peels back the curtain at Point72.\u2022 More on the Trump infrastructure plan.\u201cIn this context, I don\u2019t think it would be a good strategic move to forgo the upside in the business from here. In fact, we recently deployed more capital as we see a more attractive opportunity set.\u201dWall Street watchers should ask:Goldman\u2019s first-quarter earnings could offer clues.What Blue Apron reported\u2022 For the fourth quarter, the company reported a 13 percent year-on-year drop in revenue, to $187.7 million \u2014 less than analysts had expected.\u2022 It also reported a $39 million loss for the quarter, again a smaller loss than expected.\u2022 Both the cost of goods sold and marketing expenditures were down from the year-ago period.\u2022 The company\u2019s customer rolls dropped 15 percent year-on-year to 746,000, though the company said that was to be expected from the lower marketing spend.\u2022 The average orders per customer and revenue per customer each rose a tiny bit.Blue Apron\u2019s ability to hold the line on marketing expenses was probably the most promising sign, though that was in part because management was also focused on improving operations at the company\u2019s distribution center in Linden, N.J.The HelloFresh perspectiveHere\u2019s what its C.E.O., Dominik Richter, told me last week about why the meal-kit business isn\u2019t doomed, necessarily:\u2022 His company has managed to make its marketing profitable, with every dollar spent turning into $3 in sales.\u2022 Though the company overall has run a loss \u2014 93 million euro, or $115 million, in the 2016 fiscal year \u2014 it has shown profitability in some of its markets. Mr. Richter contended that the company could become profitable this year. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we need to strive for or put a lot of effort into,\u201d he said.\u2022 He added that he doesn\u2019t see supermarkets selling their own meal kits as true competitors, running counter to investor fears that the combined Amazon/Whole Foods portends doom for smaller competitors. \u201cWe have more in common with Chipotle or a fast-casual chain,\u201d he said.The tale of the tapeBlue Apron\u2019s shares are down 66 percent since their debut. HelloFresh\u2019s are up 23 percent since they started trading.\u2014 Michael de la MercedToday that became a reality.Mr. Gray, 48, joined Blackstone straight out of college in 1992. He has led Blackstone\u2019s real estate group since its creation in 2005.Mr. James, 67, joined Blackstone in 2002 as vice chairman and C.O.O. He was named president in 2006.\u201cI have had a wonderful 15 years at Blackstone so far and still savor every minute of it. One of my most important responsibilities is succession, and I am blessed to have a spectacular leader and investor like Jon Gray to whom I can hand the reins,\u201d Mr. James said.The Federal Reserve chairman took his position this year facing plenty of economic factors that could stoke inflation, including:\u2022 Resurgent global economies\u2022 Years of cheap and plentiful credit\u2022 Joblessness falling to multiyear lows, making it easier for workers to get a raise or a bonus, which could push up companies\u2019 costsThen the Fed\u2019s job got harder. Congress passed a large tax cut that will add a jolt of stimulus to an economy that no longer needs extra juice. The stock market loved it and kept zooming higher.But turbulence hit. On Feb. 5, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted over 1,100 points, or 4.6 percent.That brought some much-needed caution\u2022 Investors in the stock market, down 7.6 percent from its high, now know the party can\u2019t go on uninterrupted.\u2022 People are having a real debate about inflation.In other words, nose-diving stocks did Mr. Powell a favor: They threw some cold water on the animal spirits that Congress whipped up.The notes of cautionThe best scenario for the Fed is that the rate hikes forecast for this year are enough to also limit the stimulus from the tax overhaul.Meanwhile, to finance the deficit, the Treasury Department now has to sell more billions of dollars of extra bonds. The huge new government demand for credit could push up interest rates in the markets. The Fed may be fine with that, given that it is expected to raise interest rates this year. But if interest rates in the bond market spike higher than investors expect, or the Fed is happy with, Mr. Powell would face his first big challenge as Fed chairman.\u2014 Peter EavisIn its prime, Chipotle Mexican Grill positioned itself as the paragon of clean, casual, cool dining, a darling of Wall Street, a restaurant industry innovator.Basically, nothing like Taco Bell.How the tables have turned. Chipotle has spent the past few years struggling to recover from a string of food safety crises, steady abandonment by its clientele and a plunging stock price. For help, the chain is turning to the quick-serve cousin many once thought was inferior.Shares of Chipotle are up 12 percent after hours.\u2014 Tiffany HsuBroadcom announced on Tuesday that it is seeking only a majority of the chip maker\u2019s board seats in next month\u2019s shareholder vote.\u201cIf at least a majority of our slate does not get in on March 6, then I guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen,\u201d he said. We will walk.\u201dBoth companies are expected to meet on Wednesday for the first time in months.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMondelez said that Debra Crew, the Reynolds American chief executive, and Peter May, Trian Fund president, will be named to the board the same day as Mr. Peltz steps down.\u2022 Just one of 125 portfolio managers is a woman.\u2022 Women were often excluded from meetings.\u2022 For several weeks last year, a white board in one executive\u2019s office had \u201cpussy\u201d written on it.Mr. Cohen himself isn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing, and Point72 denied the allegations.The misconduct flyaround\u2022 Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Dulles International Airport\u2022 The George Washington and Baltimore Washington parkways\u2022 The Washington AqueductThe thinking behind the planAn interesting point about infrastructure investmentThe big question: Can private investors fill in the $1.3 trillion required to fulfill the White House\u2019s vision?Here\u2019s a recounting of what Mr. Zuckerberg told employees last Thanksgiving about the company\u2019s responsibility, from Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstein of Wired:According to one attendee, the remarks came across as blunter and more personal than any they\u2019d ever heard from Zuckerberg. He seemed humble, even a little chastened. \u201cI don\u2019t think he sleeps well at night,\u201d the employee says. \u201cI think he has remorse for what has happened.\u201dThe tech flyaround\u2022 If Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders don\u2019t vote for a majority of the directors that Broadcom has nominated for its target\u2019s board. \u201cI guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen,\u201d he said.\u2022 If Qualcomm raises its bid for NXP Semiconductors beyond $110 a share. \u201cWe have made it very clear, it\u2019s a clear transfer of value from Qualcomm shareholders to NXPI shareholders,\u201d he said.The deals flyaroundAn earlier version of this briefing misstated the age of Hamilton \u201cTony\u201d James, Blackstone\u2019s executive vice chairman.

{"Headline": "Why We May Soon Be Living in Alexa\u2019s World", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtMy wife and I were just settling into bed one night when Alexa, the other woman in my life, decided to make herself heard.Without being summoned, the Amazon Echo Dot at my bedside \u2014 one of the half-dozen devices that Alexa inhabits in our house \u2014 lit up its spectral blue ring, as if it had heard its triggering wake word, \u201cAlexa.\u201d But instead of offering help with some household chore, the voice assistant began to wail, like a child screaming in a horror-movie dream.\u201cHuh,\u201d I said to my wife when it was over. She said something less kind.But here\u2019s what\u2019s really strange: By the next morning, we had forgotten all about it.It is a measure of how thoroughly Amazon\u2019s voice assistant has wormed herself into our lives, and into much of the culture beyond, that I never considered unplugging her after the scream. Instead I chalked the incident up to a harmless bug \u2014 one of the many mysteries of living with an artificial intelligence life form that can be summoned at a breath. (An Amazon representative offered to investigate, but said the company had never heard of such a thing happening before and didn\u2019t think Alexa was even capable of making such a sound.)Something bigger is afoot. Alexa has the best shot of becoming the third great consumer computing platform of this decade \u2014 next to iOS and Android, a computing service so ubiquitous that it sets a foundation for much of the rest of what happens in tech.It is not a sure path. Amazon could screw this up, and rivals like Google have many cards to play to curb Alexa\u2019s rise. Amazon\u2019s strategy \u2014 something like a mix between Google\u2019s plan for Android and Apple\u2019s for the iPhone \u2014 is also unusual. And there are lingering social concerns about voice assistants and, as I discovered, their sometimes creepy possibilities. How many people, really, are willing to let an always-on device in their house?Despite this, Alexa\u2019s ubiquity is a plausible enough future that it is worth seriously pondering. In an effort to do so, I recently dived headlong into Alexa\u2019s world. I tried just about every Alexa gadget I could get my hands on, including many not made by Amazon, such as an Alexa-enabled pickup truck, to see what life with her will be like once she\u2019s everywhere.What I found was a mess \u2014 many non-Amazon Alexa devices aren\u2019t ready for prime time \u2014 but an inviting one. Late-night shrieks notwithstanding, one day very soon, Alexa or something like it will be everywhere \u2014 and computing will be better for it.\u201cWe had a spectacular holiday,\u201d Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, said when I called last month to chat about the assistant\u2019s future.Amazon is famously cagey about sales numbers, but Mr. Limp braved a slight disclosure: \u201cWe\u2019ve said we\u2019ve sold tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices, but I can assure you that last year we also sold tens of millions of just Echo devices. At that scale, it\u2019s safe to now call this a category.\u201dMr. Limp\u2019s distinction is confusing but important. At Amazon, Alexa lives in two places. She is part of a device category, the Echo smart speaker, which now comes in a variety of permutations, from the $49 Echo Dot to the screen-bearing Echo Show, which sells for $229. (These prices are merely guidelines; in its bid for ubiquity, Amazon often offers steep discounts, with the Dot selling for $29 during last year\u2019s holidays.)But like Google\u2019s Android operating system, Alexa is also a piece of software that Amazon makes available for free for other device makers to put into their products.Alexa is spreading so quickly that even Amazon can\u2019t keep track of it. Mr. Limp said that as he wandered the floor at the CES electronics trade show in Las Vegas this year, even he was surprised by the number of different Alexa devices.\u201cTo me, that says the strategy is working,\u201d he said.There are some costs to this strategy, which prizes speed over polish. The universe of Alexa-enabled products is shaggy. Many third-party devices get low reviews on Amazon. Many don\u2019t include some of Alexa\u2019s key functions \u2014 I tested devices that don\u2019t let you set reminders, one of the main reasons to use Alexa. Technical limitations also prevent non-Amazon devices from taking advantage of some of Alexa\u2019s best new features, like the ability to call phones or other Alexas (creating a kind of home intercom system).Mr. Limp said Amazon was aiming to fix these limitations, but conceded that its strategy necessarily led to some low-end devices. \u201cYou\u2019re right, sometimes the ramifications of this will be that some devices will be out there that aren\u2019t perfect,\u201d he said.But there are also advantages to Alexa\u2019s model for ubiquity. Imagine if you could gain access to your smartphone on just about any screen you encountered. Move from your phone to your TV to your laptop to your car, and wherever you went, you\u2019d find all your apps, contacts and data just there, accessible through the same interface.That model isn\u2019t really possible for phones. But because Alexa runs in the cloud, it allows for a wondrously device-agnostic experience. Alexa on my Echo is the same as Alexa on my TV is the same as Alexa on my Sonos speaker.And it\u2019s the same even on devices not in your home. Ford \u2014 the first of several carmakers to offer Alexa integration in its vehicles \u2014 lent me an F-150 pickup outfitted with Alexa. The experience was joyously boring: I called up Alexa while barreling down the highway, and although she was slower to respond than at home, she worked just the same. She knew my musical tastes, my shopping list, the apps and smart-home services I had installed, and just about everything else.It was the best showcase of the possibilities of always-on voice computing. In the future, wherever you go, you can expect to talk to a computer that knows you, one that can get stuff done for you without any hassle.This is not the best outcome for the future; it would be better for all of us if the next computing platform didn\u2019t come from one of the current tech giants, and if start-ups didn\u2019t have to rely on Amazon or Google for this key piece of tech.But that seems unlikely. If Alexa is headed for ubiquity, it\u2019s good that Google may be, too.Advertisement"}

It can\u2019t manage health care. It can\u2019t master infrastructure. It can\u2019t fund itself for more than tiny increments of time. It can barely stay open. It shut down briefly on Friday for the second time in three weeks. Maybe it should just stay closed for good.Let corporations pick up the slack! In fact they\u2019re doing that already, with an innovation and can-do ambition sorely absent in Washington.It was also a roaring, blazing sign of our times, in which the gaudy dreams and grand experiments belong to the private sector, not the public one, and in which the likes of Musk or Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos chart a future for our species beyond our stressed-out planet. NASA no longer leads the way.Lehane noted that democratic governments are designed to proceed with caution, but the pace of change in a digital world of automation and, now, artificial intelligence is brisker than ever. The nimbleness of corporations gives them an edge over hoary, complacent institutions, including those in higher education. Corporations\u2019 creep into that sphere is looking more and more like a sprint.\u201cI think enterprises like Amazon and Google are going to build universities that teach coding and things the nation needs,\u201d Margaret Spellings, the president of the University of North Carolina System, recently told me. Spellings was education secretary under President George W. Bush.Corporations have long been engines of innovation, sources of philanthropy and even laboratories for social policy. But the situation feels increasingly lopsided these days. I\u2019m struck, for example, by the intensity of conversation over the last year about what Facebook and its algorithms should do to stanch the destructive tribalism in American life. It\u2019s true that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s monster has badly aggravated that dynamic, in part by allowing its platform to be manipulated by bad actors. But so has Washington, and we seem less hopeful that it\u2019s redeemable and likely to shepherd us to a healthier place.But companies\u2019 primary concern isn\u2019t public welfare. It\u2019s the bottom line. I say that not to besmirch them but to state the obvious. Their actions will never deviate too far from their proprietary interests, and while tapping their genius and money is essential, outsourcing too much to them is an abdication of government\u2019s singular role. What\u2019s best for Amazon and what\u2019s best for humanity aren\u2019t one and the same.\u201cWhether they do it in the collective interest or in their own is very much in question,\u201d Summers told me. \u201cI use as a parable for a lot of things what happens in developing countries, where the urban electric system doesn\u2019t work well, and therefore the businesses start building their own generators to take care of themselves, and therefore there\u2019s no longer a constituency or pressure to fix the existing electricity system, and meanwhile the society is falling apart.\u201dThere may be something for all of us in Musk\u2019s rocket launch. But there\u2019s definitely a whole lot more in it for Musk.Advertisement"}

She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free \u2014 at least for now.These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. \u201cOuch, that\u2019s not good,\u201d it might say. \u201cHope your ankle feels better soon.\u201d If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company\u2019s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man \u2014 unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.Microsoft\u2019s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. \u201cIt is a problem if we can\u2019t get this in front of real users \u2014 and have them tell us what is right and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints \u2014 and bad press \u2014 Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines \u2014 easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted \u201cchatbots\u201d that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.\u201cIt is more powerful,\u201d said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. \u201cBut it is more dangerous.\u201dIt may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type \u201cwinne tonight drink resttaurant,\u201d it might respond with: \u201ci\u2019m not a fan of wine.\u201d  It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.When Microsoft\u2019s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue. In this case, the system knows enough about the world to identify Adele as a singer.ResponseRankshe's a singer1i don't know who adele is.2she is a singer3lana del rey4i don't know who she is but she is a singer5i don't know who she is but she's a singer6i don't know, i'm not a fan of adele7lana del ray8i don't know who she is, she's a singer9who is adele10i don't know who she is. she's a singer11i don't know who she is but she's a good singer12i don't know who she is. i'm not a fan of adele13i don't know who she is but she is a very good singer14i don't know who she is. she is a singer15i don't know her name. she's a singer16i don't know her name, she's a singer17she's not a singer18i don't know, i've never heard of her before19you don't know her20i don't know her name21i don't know, i've never heard of her22katy perry23i don't know who she is but i don't know her name24i don't really know who she is but i don't know her name25But researchers must also deal with the unexpected. Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude \u2014 or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems \u2014 general dialogue \u2014 is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. \u201cThere is a huge technical barrier here. We really don\u2019t know how to build a personal assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.\u201dIn the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.\u201cWe need people to forgive us when we screw up,\u201d he said. \u201cPushing forward is going to involve some screw-ups.\u201dChat animations are based on data from Microsoft and draw from 50 possible responses for each interaction.Illustrations by Minh UongAdvertisement"}

Nine percent! Communism ten percent. Gonorrhea eight percent. We\u2019re right in the middle.\u201dAnd he appealed to their anger at Washington. The \u201csystem is rigged,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI can tell you that access is purchased, that votes are bought and paid for, that outcomes are determined before you have a chance to call your member of Congress or senator.\u201dThe crowd cheered, they hooted, they left saying things like \u201che was great\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201dBefore Beaumont, Mr. O\u2019Rourke spoke to town halls this month in Lufkin and Woodville, deeply conservative places where Democrats are rarely seen. \u201cIt takes guts to come to this area,\u201d one woman in Woodville said. The man who introduced him in Lufkin had just one request, that he refrain from swearing, an admonition that Mr. O\u2019Rourke heeded in Lufkin but not in Beaumont.Mr. O\u2019Rourke is favored to win his party primary next month and challenge Mr. Cruz. But his odds in November are beyond long. No Democrat has won a statewide office in Texas since 1994, the year before Amazon sold its first book.By the calculations of Mike Baselice, a Republican pollster in Austin, demographic changes might make Texas competitive in 2032, certainly not in 2018. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s quest, he said, is \u201csame book, different chapter\u201d of other Democratic hopefuls. \u201cThis is not a level playing field here.\u201dIt has been so bleak for Democrats in Texas that they define victory in terms of the size of their losses. A running joke in Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s speeches is that he has almost convinced his mother, Melissa, a Republican, to vote for him.If the hill weren\u2019t steep enough, Mr. O\u2019Rourke also has refused to hire outside consultants or pollsters, and he will only accept contributions from individuals. He has no interest in using big data. When he tells this to Democratic colleagues in the House, some have simply turned and walked away from him, unable to take him seriously.But there is power in the giant-killer narrative and signs that his anti-campaign playbook campaign is working. He raised $2.4 million in the last quarter, and gets applause when he notes that was $500,000 more than Mr. Cruz took in.He has a restless energy that has put him in 217 of Texas 254 counties, driving tens of thousands of miles, fueled by bad coffee and Hostess cupcakes that supporters bring him.In Lufkin, he was greeted with chants of \u201cBeto, Beto, Beto.\u201d His campaign took in $1,258 in checks and cash dropped into a large jar.\u201cI think he can win. I think he can inspire Texans,\u201d said Susan McCulley, adding, \u201cwe\u2019re not just mad, we\u2019re scared.\u201dAnother supporter, Ferryn Martin, said, \u201cIn 2010, the Tea Party was mad. This year, we are mad.\u201dMr. O\u2019Rourke tries to tap into that emotion. He livestreams almost every aspect of his campaign \u2014 the coffees, the town halls, \u201cbowling with Beto,\u201d stops at Whataburger, the drives between stops, which often include calls to voters and activists and from his wife, Amy. Driving with his left forearm and right elbow on the steering wheel, he asked her about the science fair projects of their three children.His theory of the case is that he can make the sale in rural Texas in part simply by showing up. If he can cut down Mr. Cruz\u2019s margins there and generate energy in urban precincts and suburbs, he can become the first Democrat since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 to win a Texas Senate seat.Democrats in Texas have long been saying that the demographic changes sweeping the state, fueled by a surge in the Latino population, would eventually make the state two-party competitive, but even some of the more optimistic forecasts don\u2019t have that happening until 2024. Still, there are other factors at work that add to their hopes. The number of college-educated residents in the state increased by 20 percent from 2006 to 2016, according to Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer. Rural areas are losing population while urban and suburban areas are gaining.\u201cIf one was able to figure out how to turn out the Latino vote and the African-American vote, that could change things pretty dramatically,\u201d Mr. Potter said. \u201cThe issue is how far-off in the horizon it is.\u201dBut President Trump, who carried the state by nine percentage points, is complicating conventional analysis. \u201cAll things being equal, if there wasn\u2019t a Trump, it would be in the mid 2020s until the state would get competitive,\u201d said Russ Tidwell, a Democratic consultant who has worked in the state for decades. \u201cBut Trump makes other things possible.\u201dAnd Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign is all about a sense of the possible.His biography does not have any of the bootstraps appeal of a Lyndon Johnson, or even Mr. Cruz, the son of immigrant parents. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s family was well-to-do in El Paso. Born Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke, he has been known as \u201cBeto\u201d from infancy. His voice shows no hint of a Texas accent until his says his first name and sounds like he is speaking Spanish \u2014 which he does, fluently.He was sent to Woodberry Forest boarding school in Virginia, then Columbia, where he was captain of the crew team. He played in a punk rock band, hauled expensive art and enjoyed the wanderlust that a young man from a wealthy family can afford. He went back to El Paso and started a technology company, then ran for City Council before winning his House seat in 2012, defeating an incumbent.In the House, he has hardly left a footprint. He did not vote for Representative Nancy Pelosi to be the Democratic leader, and Mr. O\u2019Rourke, 45, thinks his party in Congress needs fresh leaders, which is one reason he supports term limits.Mr. Cruz, who did not respond to a request to discuss the race, has never been as popular as Republicans like former governors George W. Bush or Rick Perry, but he has been tactically adroit and plays well to more conservative voters. He has an uneasy alliance with Mr. Trump that started with the president calling him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d during the primaries and has evolved into invitations to the White House.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is an emotive approach, Mr. Cruz\u2019s one of cold-eyed precision.\u201cI don\u2019t think he is a flash in the pan,\u201d William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute at Rice University said of Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cHe\u2019s young and fresh, and he\u2019s just intrinsically so much more attractive than Ted Cruz for voters who don\u2019t already have their minds made up.\u201dMr. O\u2019Rourke knows Mr. Cruz is a skilled debater, a proven fund-raiser and a candidate who showed in his presidential campaign that he could leverage analytics into millions of votes. And the congressman has vulnerabilities. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has been arrested twice, once for a college prank, a second time, in 1998, for what he called the \u201cunforgivably\u201d bad decision to drive after \u201chaving too much to drink.\u201d Both charges were dismissed.His mother receives fund-raising solicitations from Mr. Cruz, who calls her son a \u201cNancy Pelosi liberal,\u201d no doubt a preview of things to come.But Mr. O\u2019Rourke also will use Mr. Cruz\u2019s well-observed ambition against him, and said that the incumbent\u2019s real goal is another White House run. He cites a letter that Mr. Cruz sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds, Republican of Iowa, talking about visiting all of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties.\u201cI know he hasn\u2019t been to all 254 of Texas\u2019 counties,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said.Texas is so vast that it is nearly impossible to travel the entire state the way that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has chosen to, largely by car, over state highways and rural roads, but he seems undeterred and drives most of the miles himself, with aides in passenger seats.Over lunch at the Lufkin BBQ, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said his campaign strategy was in part drawn from the 1968 presidential campaign of his political hero, Robert F. Kennedy, long on hope and aspiration.Mr. Kennedy was not driven by \u201cpolls or consultants, but he really seemed to be grounded in the things that he found important,\u201d he said, adding that he often seemed to be going directly against the advice of what was going to be popular.Those seemed to be the words of a long-shot, a candidate with nothing to lose.Advertisement"}

Let us know how in the comments._________Amy Krouse Rosenthal, a prolific children\u2019s book author, memoirist and public speaker who, dying of cancer, found an extraordinarily large readership this month with a column in The New York Times titled \u201cYou May Want to Marry My Husband,\u201d died on Monday at her home in Chicago. She was 51.The cause was ovarian cancer, which she learned she had in September 2015, her agent, Amy Rennert, said.The column has drawn almost four and a half million readers online.\u201cI want more time with Jason,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI want more time with my children. I want more time sipping martinis at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. But that is not going to happen. I probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet. So why I am doing this?In the video below, you can learn about one of her \u201csocial experiments\u201d:__________For most teenagers, Mr. Green needs no introduction.The sold-out show put on full view Mr. Green\u2019s uncanny knack for channeling the voice of marginalized but smart, self-identifying nerds, a gift he has turned into a YouTube empire. The core of his online presence is the VlogBrothers channel, where once a week he and Hank exchange slightly manic but humorous and sincere riffs on science and life.He and his brother also use the Internet to raise money for charity and broadcast \u201cThe Lizzie Bennet Diaries,\u201d a video adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d They also teach what they describe as advanced courses aimed at high school students online.The followers of the VlogBrothers call themselves Nerdfighters \u2014 not because they fight nerds but because they \u201cun-ironically\u201d and \u201cpassionately\u201d embrace being smart and having eccentric interests.In addition to \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d Mr. Green is the author of three other young adult novels, and while he says that a Venn diagram of his fans of his novels and of his video enterprises might show only a 40 percent overlap, it is big enough that one drives traffic to the other with \u2014 in VlogBrother parlance \u2014 awesome results.Preorders pushed \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d to the top of the sales lists on the Amazon and Barnes & Noble Web sites after Mr. Green announced its title to VlogBrother fans in June 2011. Penguin pushed the release date up by six months to last January. The book, about two teenagers dealing with cancer, now has 950,000 digital and print copies and has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 52 weeks.Esther had thyroid cancer, as Hazel does in the book, and was dependent on an oxygen tank. Green got to be friends with her online, and later visited her in person. Green is careful to say that Hazel \u2014 whose middle name is Grace \u2014 is not Esther, but Esther\u2019s father and sister have spoken, appreciatively, of how much Green\u2019s creation reminds them of her. Esther died in 2010, at the age of sixteen. \u201cI could not have written it without her friendship,\u201d Green said, adding that \u201cthere is definitely something weird about her not being here to give her blessing or not.\u201d_________\u2022 What can readers, and writers, learn from stories of those who are confronting their own mortality?_________As students read and discuss, they might take notes using one or more of the three graphic organizers (PDFs) we have created for our Text to Text feature:_________\u201cHow many dead people do you think there are?\u201d\u201cLike, how many fictional people died in that fictional movie? Not enough,\u201d he joked.\u201cNo, I mean, like, ever. Like, how many people do you think have ever died?\u201d\u201cI happen to know the answer to that question,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are seven billion people, and about ninety-eight billion dead people.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d I said. I\u2019d thought that maybe since population growth had been so fast, there were more people alive than all the dead combined.\u201cThere are about fourteen dead people for every living person,\u201d he said \u2026 \u201cI did some research on this a couple years ago,\u201d Augustus continued. \u201cI was wondering if everyone could be remembered. Like, if we got organized, and assigned a certain number of corpses to each living person, would there be enough living people to remember all the dead people?\u201d\u201cAnd are there?\u201d\u201cSure, anyone can name fourteen dead people. But we\u2019re disorganized mourners, so a lot of people end up remembering Shakespeare, and no one ends up remembering who he wrote Sonnet Fifty-five about.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.After a while he said, \u201cIs it any good?\u201d\u201cThe poem?\u201d I asked.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cStill perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cRead to me.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t really a poem to read aloud when you are sitting next to your sleeping mother. It has, like, sodomy and angel dust in it,\u201d I said.\u201cYou just named two of my favorite pastimes,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, read me something else then?\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I am so in the mood for poetry. Do you have anything memorized?\u201d\u201c\u2018Let us go then, you and I,\u2019\u201d I started nervously, \u201c\u2018When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table.\u2019\u201d\u201cSlower,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m in love with you,\u201d he said. He was staring at me and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, and I\u2019m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I\u2019m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we\u2019re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we\u2019ll ever have, and I am in love with you.\u201d\u201cAugustus,\u201d I said again, not knowing what else to say. I felt like everything was rising up in me, like I was drowning in this weirdly painful joy, but I couldn\u2019t say it back. I couldn\u2019t say anything back. I just looked at him and let him look at me until he nodded, lips pursed, and turned away, placing the side of his head against the window._________By the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him.Jason? He knew a year later.I have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but I\u2019m going to create a general profile for Jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days.First, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes.The following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way.He is a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him \u2014 or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes \u2014 know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape.If our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy. On the subject of food \u2014 man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening\u2019s meal.Jason loves listening to live music; it\u2019s our favorite thing to do together. I should also add that our 19-year-old daughter, Paris, would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else.When I was working on my first memoir, I kept circling sections my editor wanted me to expand upon. She would say, \u201cI\u2019d like to see more of this character.\u201dOf course, I would agree \u2014 he was indeed a captivating character. But it was funny because she could have just said: \u201cJason. Let\u2019s add more about Jason.\u201d_________2. In her essay, Ms. Rosenthal shares lots of small personal details that make her husband the \u201cextraordinary\u201d man she knows. She mentions his socks, his cooking, his humorous arrangements of utensils. How do these seemingly tiny details contribute to the overall effect of this essay for you as a reader? What can you learn about good writing from her use of specific detail?3. In both passages, one person is sure of their love before the other. What challenges does it create in relationships when two people are not ready to say \u201cI love you\u201d to each other at the same time?5. Ms. Rosenthal writes: \u201cI have been married to the most extraordinary man for 26 years. I was planning on at least another 26 together.\u201d This is markedly different than the brief time Hazel and Augustus share together in \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars.\u201d Had a terminal illness not been part of their shared experience, do you think Hazel and Augustus would still have had the qualities to last as a couple? What details in the story suggest that they have or do not have the qualities of an enduring love?_________Learning From Other Works About Facing DeathAs a class, create a library or classroom display, or an annotated bibliography of selections, perhaps even summarizing some of the best advice or insights from each. In what ways does confronting death change our perspective on life in the present? What can we learn from those living in the face of a terminal illness?I am a passionate advocate for educating teenagers to be responsible about their sexuality. And I believe it is past time for us to educate them also about death, an equally important stage of life, and one for which the consequences of poor preparedness are as bad, arguably worse. Ideally this education would come early, well before it\u2019s likely to be needed.I propose that we teach death ed in all of our high schools. I see this curriculum as a civic responsibility. I understand that might sound radical, but bear with me. Why should death be considered more taboo than sex? Both are a natural part of life. We may think death is too scary for kids to talk about, but I believe the consequences of a bad death are far scarier. A death ed program would aim to normalize this passage of life and encourage students to prepare for it, whenever it might come \u2014 for them, or for their families.Do your students agree? Why do they think such a curriculum might be needed, and what do they imagine it could look like?_________Reading Book Reviews, Writing Book ReviewsWhether they have read the books in question or not, invite them to see how Times reviewers have written about them. All but his first novel, \u201cLooking for Alaska,\u201d has been reviewed here:If students have already read the book, invite them to consider how they would rate it. What are its strengths? Are there weaknesses they would point to? Would they recommend it to others? As they read the review, ask students to classify the opinions as positive or critical. Some may be ambiguous, such as these statements from Jennifer Senior\u2019s review of \u201cTurtles All the Way Down\u201d:Over all, how would they characterize the critic\u2019s opinion of the book \u2014 positive, negative or somewhere in between? With which of the critic\u2019s points do you agree? With which do you disagree? Did the review impact your opinion of the book in any way?_________Adapting a Beloved Novel for the Screen_________Honoring the Important People in Your LifeWho has been that person for you?Here is how we framed it:If you could write a speech, a poem, a song, even a dating profile of a loved one so that others could know what makes him or her so special, what would you say?What are the stories about this person that are truly worth telling?Several students wrote in with their thoughts. For instance, Mia O from Arizona wrote:My best friend, Ray. Always there for me and somehow always knows how to make it seem like even the sun is smiling. I love the living heck out of her, everything she is amazes me. She is my absolute sunshine. I love the way she talks about Eyewitness and Voltron, her nerdy tendencies make her one of the cutest people I\u2019ve ever met in my whole life. She doesn\u2019t get really dressy but her t-shirts and sweatpants make up for it. She really can make me laugh up a storm, and it the greatest when I\u2019m having a bad day. She makes my heart beat a hundred miles a minute, and her soul keeps me warm. I love her so so much.__________John Green and \u201cTurtles All the Way Down\u201dMr. Green\u2019s latest novel, \u201cTurtles All the Way Down,\u201d debuted in October 2017 and, like \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d was an immediate best seller. On the surface, the book is about two friends\u2019 attempt to solve a mystery for a cash reward. But as with his other novels, the book also tackles weightier material. The book\u2019s narrator, the 16-year-old Aza Holmes, suffers from terrible anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. Much of the novel is spent inside Aza\u2019s head as she navigates typical teenage preoccupations as well as debilitating anxiety and uncontrollable thoughts.Like the novel\u2019s narrator Aza, Mr. Green has struggled with severe anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder for as long as he can remember:As he got older, he was able to keep his anxiety in check, with the right mix of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. But every once in a while, uncontrollable thoughts can overwhelm him.As students watch the video and read the article, encourage them to note ways in which Aza\u2019s experience and thoughts echo those of the author. To get started, students might focus on excerpts from the book like the following. What parallels can they find in what Mr. Green says about his own experience?On how language fails to capture abstract feelings, like pain:[During a session with Dr. Karen Singh, Aza\u2019s therapist]\u201cYou often try to understand your experience through metaphor, Aza: It\u2019s like a demon inside of you; you\u2019ll call your consciousness a bus, or a prison cell, or a spiral, or a whirlpool, or a loop, or a \u2014 I think you once called it a scribbled circle, which I found interesting \u2026 One of the challenges with pain \u2014 physical or psychic \u2014 is that we can really only approach it through metaphor. It can\u2019t be represented the way a table or a body can. In some ways, pain is the opposite of language.\u201dOn romanticizing mental illness:You hear a lot about the benefits of insanity or whatever \u2014 like, Dr. Karen Singh had once told me this Edgar Allan Poe quote: \u201cThe question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence.\u201d I guess she was trying to make me feel better, but I find mental disorders to be vastly overrated. Madness, in my admittedly limited experience, is accompanied by no superpowers; being mentally unwell doesn\u2019t make you loftily intelligent any more than having the flu does.On the \u2014 often-unrealistic \u2014 expectation that illness is something you overcome:I wanted to tell her that I was getting better, because that was supposed to be the narrative of illness: It was a hurdle you jumped over, or a battle you won. Illness is a story told in the past tense.On intrusive thoughts:I have these thoughts that Dr. Karen Singh calls \u201cintrusives,\u201d but the first time she said it, I heard \u201cinvasives,\u201d which I like better, because, like invasive weeds, these thoughts seem to arrive at my biosphere from some faraway land, and then they spread out of control.After they\u2019re done, you might ask students some of these questions:\u2022 To write authentically about the experience of living with obsessive compulsive disorder, was it necessary for Mr. Green to have lived with the mental illness himself?\u2022 Is it helpful for readers to know about an author\u2019s personal connection to the content of a novel? Or is there a case to be made for separating a work from the author\u2019s experience?\u2022 Mr. Green\u2019s editor called the book an \u201cunbelievable act of translation.\u201d Do you agree that the book \u201cgives readers a glimpse of what it\u2019s like to suffer from mental illness\u201d? If so, how is this accomplished?\u2022 If you were writing a novel, would you model the main character after yourself in any way? Why or why not?__________Read, Kids, ReadI\u2019m incessantly asking my nephews and nieces what they\u2019re reading and why they\u2019re not reading more. I\u2019m reliably hurling novels at them, and also at friends\u2019 kids. I may well be responsible for 10 percent of all sales of \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d a teenage love story to be released as a movie next month. Never have I spent money with fewer regrets, because I believe in reading \u2014 not just in its power to transport but in its power to transform.Mr. Bruni goes on to talk about the intensity of connection one can feel to a favorite novel. He writes:That observation brought to mind a moment in \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d when one of the protagonists says that sometimes, \u201cYou read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\u201dBooks are personal, passionate. They stir emotions and spark thoughts in a manner all their own, and I\u2019m convinced that the shattered world has less hope for repair if reading becomes an ever smaller part of it.What books do your students feel this way about? Invite them to share the titles that they have loved over the course of their lives \u2014 including those read to them as children. Together, challenge them to come up with a list of books that they think \u201call living humans\u201d should read, along with explanations for why. Or, have them interview school community members of all ages about the books that have meant the most to them, then post the list on the school\u2019s website, in the school library or newspaper, or make it part of an email home to parents._________Suzanne Zimbler, a former New York City public and charter-school teacher and editor at Time Inc., contributed to this lesson plan.We regularly create lesson plans about teaching literature with The New York Times. Here is what we have now, and the collection is always growing:_________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Makes Its Special A.I. Chips Available to Others", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Monday, the internet giant said it would allow other companies to buy access to those chips through its cloud-computing service. Google hopes to build a new business around the chips, called tensor processing units, or T.P.U.s.\u201cWe are trying to reach as many people as we can as quickly as we can,\u201d said Zak Stone, who works alongside the small team of Google engineers that designs these chips.And these days, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are not just big internet companies. They are big hardware makers.Right now, Google\u2019s new service is focused on a way to teach computers to recognize objects, called computer vision technology. But as time goes on, the new chips will also help businesses build a wider range of services, Mr. Stone said.At the end of last year, hoping to accelerate its work on driverless cars, Lyft began testing Google\u2019s new chips.Using the chips, Lyft wanted to accelerate the development of systems that allow driverless cars to, say, identify street signs or pedestrians. \u201cTraining\u201d these systems can take days, but with the new chips, the hope is that this will be reduced to hours.\u201cThere is huge potential here,\u201d said Anantha Kancherla, who oversees software for the Lyft driverless car project.T.P.U. chips have helped accelerate the development of everything from the Google Assistant, the service that recognizes voice commands on Android phones, to Google Translate, the internet app that translates one language into another.They are also reducing Google\u2019s dependence on chip makers like Nvidia and Intel. In a similar move, it designed its own servers and networking hardware, reducing its dependence on hardware makers like Dell, HP and Cisco.This keeps costs down, which is essential when running a large online operation, said Casey Bisson, who helps oversee a cloud computing service called Joyent, which is owned by Samsung. At times, the only way to build an efficient service is to build your own hardware.\u201cThis is about packing as much computing power as possible within a small area, within a heat budget, within a power budget,\u201d Mr. Bisson said.Typically, engineers train these algorithms using graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which are chips that were originally designed for rendering images for games and other graphics-heavy software. Most of these chips are supplied by Nvidia.In designing its own A.I. chips, Google was looking to exceed what was possible with these graphics-oriented chips, speed up its own A.I. work and lure more businesses onto its cloud services.At the same time, Google has gained some independence from Nvidia and an ability to negotiate lower prices with its chip suppliers.\u201cGoogle has become so big, it makes sense to invest in chips,\u201d said Fred Weber, who spent a decade as the chief technology officer at the chip maker AMD. \u201cThat gives them leverage. They can cut out the middleman.\u201dThis does not mean that Google will stop buying chips from Nvidia and other chip makers. But it is altering the market. \u201cWho\u2019s buying and who\u2019s selling has changed,\u201d Mr. Weber said.Over the years, Google has even flirted with the possibility of designing its own version of the chips it buys from Intel.Mr. Weber and other insiders question whether Google would ever do this, just because a C.P.U. is so complex and it would be so much more difficult to design and maintain one of these chips. But at a private event in San Francisco last fall, David Patterson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who now works on chip technologies at Google, was asked if the company would go that far.\u201cThat\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a nice problem to have.Neglected in the public discussion is yet another strategy, with large potential benefits for every company and for the nation as a whole: investing in human capital. Lost in the noise was Boeing\u2019s announcement that it will spend $100 million on work force development, training and education, and Disney\u2019s investment of $50 million to cover tuition payments for its hourly employees.Until recently, most corporate training programs focused on communicating company policies, building the company\u2019s \u201cculture\u201d and complying with legal mandates to provide instruction on sexual harassment, nondiscrimination and industry-specific regulatory requirements. Company leaders and promising younger executives were often given access to high-quality executive education programs.But most employees looking to upgrade their skills and qualifications had to go back to school. Those who remained on the job while attending classes part time could get up to $5,250 annually in tax-free tuition reimbursement from their employer. Most large companies have maintained such programs for decades, but less than 1 percent of the work force participates.Today, thanks to online technology, there has been stunning improvement in both the quantity and quality of learning opportunities available to employees. The largest platforms offer thousands of courses from more than 200 of the world\u2019s best universities, as well as state-of-the-art content from top technology companies. Many Fortune 500 companies are testing the use of such courses to develop the skills of their employees, and a few have begun large-scale deployment, offering customized courses to help employees gain competency in emerging fields such as big data, machine learning, deep learning and the internet of things.Less esoteric subjects \u2014 like digital marketing, project management, and managing people and teams \u2014 have also proved popular among employers. These courses typically cost less than 10 percent of what it would cost to take the same courses in a face-to-face, on-campus setting.The tax cut has given companies an opportunity to invest in the future. So, to America\u2019s chief executives: Don\u2019t spend it all on buybacks and bonuses. Invest in plants, equipment and research.

{"Headline": "The Case Against Google", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "FeatureCritics say the search giant is squelching competition before it begins. Should the government step in?Supported byIn the years that followed, those overlapping enthusiasms led to cohabitation, a raucous wedding and parallel careers at big technology firms. The thing is, though, when you\u2019re young and geeky and fall in love with someone else young and geeky, all your nerdy friends want you to set them up on dates as well. So Adam and Shivaun, who took Adam\u2019s last name after marriage, approached the problem like two good programmers: They designed a dating app.The app was known as MatchMate, and the idea was simple: Rather than just pairing people with similar interests, their software would put together potential mates according to an array of parameters, such as which pub they were currently standing in, and whether they had friends in common, and what movies they liked or candidates they voted for, and dozens of other factors that might be important in finding a life partner (or at least a tonight partner). The magic of MatchMate was that it could allow a user to mix variables and search for pairings within a specific group, a trick that computer scientists call parameterization. \u201cIt was like asking your best friend to set you up,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cSomeone who says, \u2018Well, you probably think you\u2019d like this guy because he\u2019s handsome, but actually you\u2019d like this other guy because he\u2019s not as good-looking, but he\u2019s really funny.\u2019\u2009\u201dWithin computer science, this kind of algorithmic alchemy is sometimes known as vertical search, and it\u2019s notoriously hard to master. Even Google, with its thousands of Ph.D.s, gets spooked by vertical-search problems. \u201cGoogle\u2019s built around horizontal search, which means if you type in \u2018What\u2019s the population of Myanmar,\u2019 then Google finds websites that include the words \u2018Myanmar\u2019 and \u2018population,\u2019 and figures out which ones are most likely to answer your question,\u201d says Neha Narula, who was a software engineer at Google before joining the M.I.T. Media Lab. You don\u2019t really care if Google sends you to Wikipedia or a news article or some other site, as long as its results are accurate and trustworthy. But, Narula says, \u201cwhen you start asking questions with only one correct answer, like, Which site has the cheapest vacuum cleaner? \u2014 that\u2019s much, much harder.\u201dFor search engines like Google, finding that one correct answer becomes particularly difficult when people have numerous parameters they want satisfied: Which vacuum cleaner is cheapest but also energy-efficient and good on thick carpets and won\u2019t scare the dog? To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.Soon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?As far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.Froogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201dAdam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.The Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.In a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.At the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.In its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201dStandard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201dIn 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201dThe Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.For decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.Consider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.What eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.The Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.\u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201dGoogle executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.One way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201dLeft unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.Shivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.As the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.But they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.Then there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201dThe more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201dTradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)Shivaun and Adam filled notepads with the names of companies that had complained about Google\u2019s tactics \u2014 eJustice, a vertical-search engine for legal information; NexTag, the fellow price-comparison site; BDZV, a group of German newspapers. They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.\u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.Google responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201dThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.Along the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.Even when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.By the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201dReback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201dIn public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.In the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.And most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201dMicrosoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.Or consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201dIt was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.The implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.\u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201dSome legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201dThose are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.Rather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.Put differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.For the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201dOne of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kentucky Rushes to Remake Medicaid as Other States Prepare to Follow", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 With approval from the Trump administration fresh in hand, Kentucky is rushing to roll out its first-in-the-nation plan to require many Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or train for a job \u2014 even as critics mount a legal challenge to stop it on the grounds that it violates the basic tenets of the program.At least eight other Republican-led states are hoping to follow \u2014 a ninth, Indiana, has already won permission to do so \u2014 and some want to go even further by imposing time limits on coverage.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said Thursday that addressing entitlement spending is \u201cwhat you need to do to fully deal with this debt crisis,\u201d though Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader from Kentucky, said he has ruled out doing so this year.As Kentucky pushes forward, many who work with the poor are worried that the thicket of new documentation requirements in Medicaid will be daunting for low-income people, who may have little education and struggle with transportation, paying for cellphone minutes and getting access to the internet. Not only that, they note, but the new rules will add the type of administrative costs and governmental burdens that Republicans tend to revile.On a recent rainy Monday, Bill Wagner, who runs primary care clinics in poor neighborhoods here, listened tensely as a state health official explained how the state would enforce the complex and contentious new rules.The 20 hours a week of work, job training or volunteering? Ten regional work force boards will monitor who complies, said the official, Kristi Putnam.The monthly premiums of $1 to $15 that many will now owe? The managed care companies that contract with the state will collect them.The \u201crewards dollars\u201d that many will need to earn to get their teeth cleaned or their vision checked? They\u2019ll be tracked through a new online platform, where Medicaid recipients will also be expected to upload their work, volunteer or training hours.\u201cI know it sounds a little bit complicated,\u201d Ms. Putnam conceded as the group meeting with her, which has overseen efforts to enroll Louisville residents in health insurance in the Obamacare era, jotted notes. Someone heaved a sigh.After four years of signing up thousands of people for coverage under the health law\u2019s expansion of the Medicaid program, Mr. Wagner told the room, \u201cWe\u2019re shifting our focus from helping people gain coverage to helping people keep it.\u201dThe rationale of Gov. Matt Bevin and other supporters is that Medicaid was created for the most vulnerable citizens \u2014 those who aren\u2019t only poor, but pregnant, elderly, children or disabled \u2014 and that for everyone else, working or otherwise engaging in their community will provide dignity and better health. About 500,000 Kentuckians have joined the Medicaid rolls under the Obamacare expansion, and the state estimates some 350,000 will be subject to the new work rules.While the work requirement is unprecedented in the history of Medicaid, Mr. Wagner and others say they\u2019re just as concerned about other new rules that will be confusing and hard to follow. For example, many adults who don\u2019t pay their small premiums can be locked out of Medicaid for six months, unless they complete a financial or health literacy course. Others will lose access to dental and vision care.Mark Lee Coleman, a diabetic who was visiting a busy clinic run by Family Health Centers, the nonprofit network that Mr. Wagner heads, one recent morning, had heard next to nothing about the new rules. He needed refills on his medications; his blood sugar level had climbed so high without them that he risked falling into a diabetic coma. But first Mr. Coleman needed help figuring out why his Medicaid coverage had been canceled late last year, even before the new rules kicked in.A counselor at the clinic called the state Medicaid office and found out Mr. Coleman, 49, had forgotten to report a change in income last July, when he switched from a higher-paying job at an Amazon warehouse to a less physically demanding job as a parts driver for Pep Boys, the automotive chain. After she helped him email a pay stub to the office, his coverage was set to be reinstated within a few days.Once Kentucky\u2019s new rules take effect this spring and summer, Mr. Coleman will also have to report a monthly tally of his work hours to keep his coverage.He now works 20 hours a week, but he has neuropathy, a numbness and tingling in his hands and feet, and sometimes has trouble walking. Should he cut back his hours, he\u2019d either have to try to get classified as \u201cmedically frail,\u201d which would exempt him from the work rule, or lose his coverage.\u201cThat\u2019s not bad, to tell you the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re working, that\u2019s good for your health.\u201dAs he spoke, he gulped water from a bottle he kept refilling \u2014 his extreme thirst a sign of his health crisis. Kara Peers, a case worker at Family Health Centers, tried to gauge what other challenges he and his wife and four children might be facing that could interfere with his ability to manage his disease.\u201cWhat about food, sir?\u201d she asked.\u201cAh, we\u2019re kind of low,\u201d he replied.\u201cUtilities \u2014 are you able to pay the bill?\u201d\u201cIt can be tough.\u201dHe left with a month\u2019s worth of medications \u2014 three for diabetes, one for high blood pressure, paid for by the clinic \u2014 and the reassurance that his Medicaid would soon be reinstated. Melissa Mather, the communications director at Family Health Centers, said she worried that patients like him, who already stumble over Medicaid\u2019s paperwork requirements, will be more lost under the new rules. She and Mr. Wagner are also worried about their homeless patients, who will be subject to the rules unless they meet the federal definition of \u201cchronically homeless\u201d and get an exemption.\u201cThis is a very, very big concern from my perspective \u2014 talking about the complexity of these changes when a lot of the folks we deal with have lives that are in chaos already,\u201d she said.For now, there are more questions than answers, as state workers like Ms. Putnam hustle to iron out all the details, let alone explain them. Sarah and Matt Burress got Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act after Mr. Burress left a factory job to start his own business. The new coverage may have saved Mr. Burress\u2019s eyesight \u2014 though only 29, he was diagnosed with glaucoma when he went for a routine eye check shortly after becoming insured in 2016.Now he\u2019s worried about keeping his coverage because he runs his own small lawn care business, working irregular hours with a hiatus that lasts all winter.\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard how it will work for seasonal self-employed workers,\u201d said Ms. Burress, who works part time as an office manager. \u201cDo his clients have to say, \u2018Yeah, he mowed my grass this week?\u2019 Part of it feels like they\u2019re trying to catch you, by burying people in paperwork and making it a huge inconvenience.\u201dShe added that she and her husband plan to remain on Medicaid only until his business starts turning a profit. \u201cThis was never meant to be our permanent fix,\u201d she said, not the \u201cdead-end entitlement trap\u201d that Mr. Bevin rails against.\u201cI\u2019m wanting to go back to work, but if I was told, \u2018You have to go back,\u2019 I do think that would step up my anxiety,\u201d Ms. Penney said. \u201cVolunteering would be less pressure, but you would still want to be consistent and reliable.\u201dCaring full time for a child or other family member can also count toward the work requirement, as can going to school full time, though neither will apply to Ms. Penney.She expects she will find a way to pay the new premiums she\u2019ll owe under the plan \u2014 $4 a month \u2014 but predicts it will mean going without other necessities at times. (She is poor enough under the new rules that if she fails to pay them, she will lose access to dental and vision coverage but not be dropped from coverage altogether.)\u201cI was at the store yesterday, looking in my wallet and going, \u2018Do I have enough money for dog food?\u201d she said. \u201cThe thought of taking on even one more expense feels overwhelming.\u201dFor Kimberly Dandridge, who overcame breast cancer and addiction to crack cocaine earlier in her life, Medicaid is a bridge while she works toward a job that comes with benefits. Ms. Dandridge, 53, works 30 hours a week as an administrative assistant, and said she would have no trouble meeting the premium and work requirements \u2014 but could relate to those who might.\u201cI remember there was a time I was just down, in the gutter, so low and broken,\u201d she said. \u201cIf people like that need medical attention, just let them get it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the insurance status of Sarah and Matt Burress before getting Medicaid. They had insurance through a job Mr. Burress had prior to starting his own business, although their coverage did not cover vision care. Additionally, the article misstated Mr. Burress\u2019s medical diagnosis. He was diagnosed with glaucoma after getting Medicaid, not advanced glaucoma. Finally, it misstated when Mr. and Mrs. Burress enrolled in Medicaid. They enrolled in 2016, not 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Good Were the Paydays for Bank Chiefs \u2026 and Shareholders?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHappy Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The heads of Citi and Goldman took home healthy pay raises last year.\u2022 Qualcomm didn\u2019t categorically say no to Broadcom\u2019s latest offer.\u2022 What financial regulation could look like post-Brexit.\u2022 Look who bet big on a pick-up in volatility...Peter Thiel.\u2022 R.I.P., BTFD?\u2022 Kraft Heinz is due for a big deal.\u2022 U.S. Bancorp\u2019s big fine.The good times that returned to Wall Street after President Donald Trump got elected are now flowing into the pockets of the big banks\u2019 C.E.Os:Are those paydays justified?Let\u2019s take Mr. Corbat.Citigroup\u2019s stock rose 25 percent in 2017, a lot more than the 16 percent posted by the KBW Bank Index. Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations.Citi\u2019s underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years.The message from Citi\u2019s board seems to be that, since the bank\u2019s performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbat\u2019s pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street.But on other yardsticks, the awards can seem highCiti may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bank\u2019s return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of America\u2019s was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan.And the makeup of the compensation mattersC.E.O.s\u2019 compensation is made up of different types of pay:\u2022 Cash salaries and cash bonuses\u2022 Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future.The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is.Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 The decision starts a maximum 75-day clock for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to decide whether to approve or oppose the deal, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Chinese investors have faced heightened scrutiny from Cfius. Since president Trump took office, a half a dozen Chinese deals have fallen apart because of concerns raised by CFIUS, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Raising the breakup fee for antitrust reasons beyond $8 billion. That amount, which represents an already high 6.6 percent of the total deal price, still isn\u2019t high enough for Qualcomm. \u201cA breakup fee in the range proposed by Broadcom does not come close to compensating for those risks,\u201d Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm\u2019s chairman, writes in a letter to Broadcom\u2019s chief, Hock Tan.\u2022 Make unspecified other commitments meant to assuage antitrust regulators.\u2022 Clarify what Broadcom\u2019s intentions are for Qualcomm\u2019s big licensing business.More from Mr. Jacobs\u2019s letter:Our board is open to further discussions with Broadcom to see if a proposal that appropriately reflects the true value of Qualcomm shares, and ensures an appropriate level of deal certainty, can be obtained.If the two sides can\u2019t reach an agreement, then matters may come down to a vote on Qualcomm\u2019s board on March 6. Remember that Broadcom is seeking six of 11 board seats, down from its initial target of unseating all directors.\u2014 Michael de la MercedBritain\u2019s government is often criticized for not clearly communicating the type of deal it wants to strike with the European Union as it prepares to leave the bloc.The dilemma Britain faces.Post-Brexit, Britain\u2019s banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them to operate in any E.U. country with few restrictions. Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.Hence the new plan.The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems.

And it suggests that a monitoring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set up.Will the E.U. agree to the plan?The bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation.

{"Headline": "\u2018Night of the Living Dead\u2019: Zombies Restored to Their Full Beauty", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingOn Feb. 13, just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day, the Criterion Channel on FilmStruck debuted \u201cNight of the Living Dead,\u201d George A. Romero\u2019s 1968 horror classic. The posting is notable for several reasons.For another, this is the second time Criterion has put up a film on the site the same day as its release on physical media, in this case a two-disc Blu-ray on the Criterion Collection label. (The first time this happened was with \u201cDesert Hearts,\u201d released and posted last November.)Some skeptics online who haven\u2019t seen the restoration ask \u201chow good can the new version look?\u201d After all, \u201cLiving Dead\u201d is one of the original low-budget horror movies that morphed into a classic. The answer lies in part with just how bad the versions you can watch on Amazon Prime look. There\u2019s one with a \u201cFisher Klingenstein Films\u201d logo before the opening shot. The image is blurry, with the whites far too bright, washed-out and lacking in detail. A \u201c50th Anniversary\u201d edition, touting the movie as \u201cNow Available in 1080p High-Definition-2K HD transfer from a rare film print\u201d may well be as advertised. Yet however \u201crare\u201d the print from which the version was scanned, it wasn\u2019t in very good shape. A lot of scratches and blotches, and overly high contrasts that deepen the blacks into nothingness while distorting the whites. We shall not even speak of the colorized version.These various iterations exist because the movie\u2019s original distributor failed to copyright it. Once it went into the public domain, anyone with a print of the movie could distribute it anywhere, produce video versions, and more, free. The creators of the movie didn\u2019t make any money. The Film Foundation and MoMA allowed Image Ten, the original company behind the film, founded by the director, Mr. Romero, the producing brothers Gary and Russell Streiner, and the writer John Russo, among others, to register a copyright for this restoration. And Janus Films and its sister company Criterion licensed the movie from Image Ten. So this is the only edition of the film that yields revenue to all its original creators.And it does, in fact, look amazing. \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d broke new horror ground with its story of a group of strangers trying to work together to fend off a mysterious attack by risen corpses determined to feast on the living. Its influence is felt on just about every zombie movie since. Yes, it was a low-budget picture, but it was made by artists who knew what they were doing.The restoration doesn\u2019t make the movie look slick, but it gets the true, sharp contrasts of the cinematography. This imbues much of the movie with what was then recognized as a documentary-style realism, which bolsters the emotional power of the tale. When I interviewed Mr. Romero about the restoration, he said, with affection in his voice: \u201cThe movie\u2019s pimples do show. There\u2019s a copy of the script visible in one of the frames! I won\u2019t tell where. It will be a little challenge for the fans to spot it.\u201dOn a recent viewing of the restoration, I was able to spot it \u2014 although for a while I didn\u2019t think I would, so engrossed was I, even after probably dozens of viewings. I won\u2019t reveal its exact whereabouts, except to say it\u2019s after the movie\u2019s 75-minute mark.And the FilmStruck/Criterion Channel presentation also offers some supplements that are on the Blu-ray package. There\u2019s a nearly half-hour video featuring the filmmakers Frank Darabont, Guillermo del Toro and Robert Rodriguez, expounding on the movie\u2019s influence. You can also watch \u201cNight of Anubis,\u201d a 16-millimeter \u201cwork print\u201d of \u201cLiving Dead\u201d under a different title. It\u2019s raggedy looking and only minimally different in content to the finished film, but it\u2019s of interest to fans who want to peer into the filmmakers\u2019 process; Russell Streiner, one of the film\u2019s producers, who also plays the memorable role of Johnny, who has the car keys, gives a thorough introduction to the supplement.So yes \u2014 the FilmStruck/Criterion Channel \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d is the one to see. And it is, in the parlance of Criterion, \u201cdirector approved\u201d \u2014 Mr. Romero, who died in July 2017, did sign off on this version. You will not be disappointed to see the movie as he intended.Advertisement"}

That includes individuals trying to make a statement, activist organizations sensing a shift in sentiment, informal parents\u2019 clubs, marketing executives, niche media groups, celebrities and shooting survivors.Unlike hundreds of other boycotts that barely registered with consumers, the current effort has \u201ctaken on significant symbolic purpose\u201d and speed, said Lawrence B. Glickman, a history professor and boycotts expert at Cornell University.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a concerted thing \u2014 it just took off and took on a life of its own,\u201d Professor Glickman said. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning \u2014 nothing like this has ever happened before with the N.R.A. as far as I know.\u201dThe #BoycottNRA hashtag, the unofficial unifier of the movement, was trending on Twitter on Friday and appeared more than 10,000 times in a single four-hour period on Monday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet.The hashtag has floated around social media since before the Sandy Hook massacre in late 2012, usually bubbling up after high-profile mass shootings only to quickly fade after failing to inspire much action.After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14, two dozen tweets mentioned the hashtag, followed by three dozen more the next day.\u201cThen the floodgates were open,\u201d said Judd Legum, who founded ThinkProgress. \u201cLots of people began moving very, very fast.\u201dThe pressure on companies to cut ties with the N.R.A. soon began sprouting up from various sources.The pair hoped for 5,000 signatures. By Tuesday afternoon, they had more than 200,000.\u201cWe know we\u2019re not going to change this epidemic of gun violence overnight, but this is one of those things people can do right now while we wait for the slow wheels of government to take action,\u201d Mr. Chase said.When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.So far, Amazon has not issued any comment related to the N.R.A.Some companies have resisted calls to sever business relationships with the N.R.A. On Monday, FedEx said that while it disagreed with the N.R.A.\u2019s policies on semiautomatic firearms, it would continue to offer discounts to the group\u2019s members.Many N.R.A. supporters have also vowed not to patronize the brands that ended relationships with the gun group.Still, the boycott effort \u2014 parts of it organic, parts of it carefully orchestrated \u2014 was an impressive show of force against the gun lobby.The organization has more than 100,000 active volunteers it can quickly mobilize to create graphics, send email blasts and fan out over social media.But after Parkland, Moms Demand Action adopted hashtags that others had created and cheered on campaigns that others had organized.\u201cThe more the merrier \u2014 it\u2019s been a cumulative effort of different groups within the same space, all putting pressure on the N.R.A.,\u201d Ms. Watts said. \u201cWhat this has shown is that it doesn\u2019t have to be any one specific group or person \u2014 it\u2019s more about the overall noise than any single hashtag.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Artificial Intelligence Is Edging Its Way Into Our Lives", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArtificial intelligence is here \u2014 and it\u2019s bringing new possibilities, while also raising questions. Do these gadgets and services really behave as advertised? How will they evolve in the years ahead? How quickly will they overhaul the way we live and change the way we do business?A month after the Chinese electronics giant Huawei suffered a big setback in its quest to sell its high-end smartphones to Americans, the company\u2019s chief for consumer devices, Richard Yu, said he was still optimistic about Huawei\u2019s prospects in the United States.\u201cWe have won global consumers\u2019 trust, in over 170 countries,\u201d Mr. Yu said at the New Work Summit. \u201cWe very strictly protect consumers\u2019 privacy.\u201dAt the conference on Tuesday, Mr. Yu said that Huawei had no ties to the Chinese government. \u201cWe are a globalized company, just headquartered in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not part of any government. We have to be a company that is independent from every country.\u201dMike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, offered a glimpse of how the social network is applying artificial intelligence to ward off bad actors and keep its platform free of toxicity.Calling the fight against rules violators a \u201ccat and mouse game,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that Facebook\u2019s A.I. efforts had succeeded at certain types of content moderation, such as image classifier algorithms that find and automatically remove nude photos and videos.Now on Facebook, he said, \u201cthe vast majority of nudity and pornography reporting is automatic.\u201dBut the company has since added thousands of human content moderators and struck partnerships with human fact-checking organizations. Mr. Schroepfer implied Facebook has learned that A.I. alone would not do the trick, given the sophistication of bad actors who find ways around the platform\u2019s filters.Mr. Schroepfer also said that human judgment would be required in certain situations, like a comment (\u201cnice jacket\u201d) that could be either an earnest compliment or a sarcastic insult, depending on the context. And when it comes to some of Facebook\u2019s thornier problems, like trying to enforce consistent hate speech policies, human intervention may always be necessary.Michael Kratsios, a deputy chief technology officer at the White House, said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that regulators should get out of the way of advances in emerging technologies.He cited progress toward a repeal of some regulations on commercial drones, such as rules prohibiting them from flying at night.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s key to get ahead of those regulatory hurdles,\u201d said Mr. Kratsios, who previously worked as chief of staff to Peter Thiel, the libertarian venture capitalist. These regulations, he said, are \u201cputting us at a disadvantage.\u201dUnlike some experts who believe China is poised to dominate the A.I. age, Mr. Kratsios said he wasn\u2019t worried about overseas competition. The United States, he said, has a \u201c30-year head start\u201d in A.I. development.Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, blasted companies like Facebook on Tuesday for addicting children to their products and renewed his calls for more government regulation of the tech industry.Mr. Benioff compared a new Facebook Messenger product for children to candy cigarettes, which he used to pretend to smoke as a boy.\u201cWhat do you think they were trying to get us to do with those?\u201d Mr. Benioff asked onstage at the New Work Summit. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is any different now. They\u2019re focused on the addictive nature of these user interfaces. At some point, we have to say, \u2018Hold on.\u2019\u201dSilicon Valley is nearing the point where moral lines will have to be drawn by the government since the industry is not regulating itself and does not seem to be guided by a \u201cstrong hand of ethics,\u201d he said.There is a \u201ccrisis of trust,\u201d he added, that will become a \u201ctidal wave\u201d among American consumers who are growing wary of tech giants.\u201cI\u2019m trying to protect our industry,\u201d said Mr. Benioff, whose company sells access to business software over the internet. \u201cIf companies aren\u2019t able to regulate themselves, they should have external regulations.\u201dOne of the solutions he suggested was to move decision-making away from algorithms and back toward humans. He cited Facebook\u2019s decision to disband its trending news curation team as an example.\u201cFacebook had a team promoting, sorting and focusing stories, 100 curators that they removed and put an algorithm in their place, and that started the downward spiral that they\u2019re in today,\u201d Mr. Benioff said.He also spoke about the recent ban on kegs of beer at Salesforce offices after he recently stumbled across one while visiting a company he had acquired.Fei-Fei Li, a chief scientist at Google and a Stanford professor, has called on technologists to take a more \u201chuman centered\u201d approach to the creation of artificial intelligence. On Tuesday at the New Work Summit, Ms. Li said that researchers must work to ensure that A.I. embodied human qualities and that it would ultimately operate alongside humans, not replace them.\u201cI often tell my students not to be misled by the name \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 \u2014 there is nothing artificial about it,\u201d she said. \u201cA.I. is made by humans, intended to behave by humans and, ultimately, to impact humans lives and human society.\u201dAt Stanford, Ms. Li was instrumental in the recent rise of \u201ccomputer vision\u201d systems that can recognize people and objects entirely on their own. At Google, she is working to package and sell these and other systems as cloud computing services, delivering the latest A.I. technology to a wide range of businesses.But she said that as Google and other internet giants pushed these techniques forward, academia and the government must help ensure that A.I. evolved into something that enhanced our humanity, created as many jobs as it replaced and operated in safe and predictable ways.In particular, Ms. Li said, academic institutions can help ensure that computer scientists work alongside social scientists in building this new breed of technology.\u201cA.I. has outgrown its origin in computer science,\u201d she said.Ultimately, said Ms. Li, who was born in China, A.I. reflects the people who build it more than other technologies do. For that reason and others, she said, A.I. researchers must work in a way that spans not only many industries but many cultures as well.Tuesday\u2019s first speaker at the New Work Summit was Kai-Fu Lee, who used to lead Google in China and knows a thing or two about American tech giants in China. His prognosis about whether companies like Facebook will ever be able to crack the world\u2019s largest internet market?\u201cThe American products are simply uncompetitive in the China market,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who is now chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on Chinese technology. Even if internet titans from the United States could operate in China, he said, the local competition means they would have a hard time thriving.\u201cMessenger is a much worse product than WeChat,\u201d he said, referring to Facebook\u2019s messaging app and Tencent\u2019s ubiquitous app for chatting, social networking, making payments and other tasks.\u201cAmazon in China is substantially worse than Taobao, JD and Tmall,\u201d he said, referring to three leading Chinese e-commerce sites. And, he said, \u201cApple Pay is much narrower and much harder to use than WeChat or Alipay.\u201dMr. Lee sees other issues that augur against a big Facebook or Google renaissance in China. Multinational companies tend not to hire local managers to lead their China operations. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned about winning in the local market,\u201d he said.Last year, the Chinese government unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030, vowing to create a domestic industry worth $150 billion. This manifesto read like a challenge to the United States, and in many ways it echoed policies laid down by the Obama administration in 2016.John Krafcik, chief executive of the self-driving car company Waymo, took the stage at the New Work Summit on Monday night and spoke out for the first time since his company reached a settlement last week with Uber in a lawsuit over trade secrets that riveted Silicon Valley.\u201cWe were really happy with the outcome that we engineered,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in that case talking about the hardware, but the extra benefit we got from that suit was the ability to understand and ensure that Uber wasn\u2019t using any of our software.\u201dHe called the software Waymo\u2019s \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\u201cThis was a really special case with a really special set of circumstances,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cFor us, this was always about, and really just about, the fact that we needed to ensure Uber wasn\u2019t using our trade secrets.\u201d He added that he did not foresee Waymo suing other former employees.Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s chief executive of its consumer business, which includes its e-commerce operations, doesn\u2019t often make public appearances. But on Monday night, he joined the New Work Summit to discuss the internet retailer\u2019s move into artificial intelligence.His key message: A.I. is everywhere, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will take our jobs.\u201cIf you look at the evolution of technology over the course of decades, tech doesn\u2019t eliminate work; it changes work,\u201d Mr. Wilke said.Amazon has also embedded A.I. throughout the company, he added, with technologists working together with people who run businesses. The company is using machine learning and deep learnings, which are different flavors of A.I., to upgrade internal algorithms, he said.As A.I. technology barrels ahead in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s also starting to pick up steam as a political issue in Washington.So he\u2019s proposing a universal basic income plan called the \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d which would give every American adult $1,000 a month to guarantee them a minimum standard of living while they retrain themselves for new kinds of work.If there are many more white men than black women in the system, for example, it will be worse at identifying the black women. That appears to be the case with some popular commercial facial recognition software.Advertisement"}

But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval.However, Fox\u2019s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast\u2019s opportunity.Whom to thank for the Comcast bidCritics\u2019 cornerMarket reactionComcast investors don\u2019t seem pleasantly surprised.

Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval.Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit.A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump.\u201cIn gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.\u201d(F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.)Update from the hearingIn this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond.He followed the careful path outlined above.

{"Headline": "Can We Really Scrub Carbon Dioxide From the Atmosphere?", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:This week: Are we ready to remove carbon dioxide from the air? Would drone deliveries help or hurt the environment? And will Canada push the United States on climate change?What are the leading/viable technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere?Removing carbon dioxide that is already in the air is seen as a potential way to combat global warming. There are various approaches, lumped together as \u201cnegative emissions technologies\u201d to distinguish them from technologies that reduce or eliminate emissions from power plants and other sources.In theory, reducing the concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere might be one way to keep the world under the two-degree Celsius target for warming established by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. But in practice, removing carbon dioxide is far from simple. There are major questions about scale, cost, speed and energy requirements. In most cases, the carbon dioxide that was removed would have to be buried underground indefinitely \u2014 and carbon storage technologies have only been deployed on a small scale so far.There are five major approaches to carbon dioxide removal:\u201cMy first impression was that if you were really going to do this, it would be a terrible idea for the environment,\u201d said Joshuah Stolaroff, an environmental scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and the lead author of the study. \u201cSo I was somewhat surprised that the results were mixed the way they were,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are opportunities for drones to save energy and emissions.\u201dWhile drones could consume less energy per package than diesel-powered delivery trucks, additional warehouses would be needed to service those drones, negating at least some of the environmental benefits. To blanket the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, researchers estimated that 112 warehouses and way stations would be needed to house products and drones. Those spaces would need to be cooled and heated, releasing further emissions.\u201cIf you want to properly consider the impacts of drones, you have to consider the whole life cycle,\u201d Dr. Stolaroff said.In every scenario, however, researchers found that getting something delivered by a drone would be better for the environment than driving to a store to pick it up yourself. \u201cTaking your whole two-ton steel vehicle four miles round trip to get an item is way worse,\u201d unless you can complete multiple errands on the same trip, Dr. Stolaroff said.While drone delivery has yet to be rolled out on a mass scale, Amazon said in a statement that it was committed to offering a delivery option that would \u201cbenefit both customers and the planet.\u201d\u201cWith drone delivery,\u201d Dr. Stolaroff said, \u201cwe have an opportunity that we don\u2019t usually have with new technology, which is to consider their impacts before they are widely deployed.\u201dCatherine McKenna, Canada\u2019s environment minister, was in New York last week to discuss ocean health and climate change with city officials and business leaders. We had a chance to talk about the Group of 7 meeting of leaders of major industrialized nations, to be held in Charlevoix, Quebec, in June.Last year in Italy the Group of 7 meeting was a flash point on climate change. The Trump administration refused to join the other six nations in reaffirming a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the Paris agreement. Ms. McKenna told me she hopes to avoid another such split with the United States, but she said her country won\u2019t back down on its commitment to the accord. Here\u2019s a portion of our interview, edited and condensed for clarity.How big a deal is climate change going to be at the G-7?Climate change, oceans and energy are our top priorities. It is really important. We understand that you need to keep the momentum on climate action. Oceans are a real focus for the prime minister. He really is looking for something along the lines of a zero-waste charter. And I think there\u2019s a lot of momentum with that. We\u2019ve had good discussions with the U.S. There\u2019s interest in doing something on plastics. We know that we may have more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, which is a really sad state for the ocean.Are you actively looking for environmental areas that are not climate change where you can find some common ground with the Trump administration? I think plastics is certainly one where we need to be doing a lot more, and there is some appetite in the United States. Look, clearly in Canada climate change is a top priority. I\u2019m the first minister of energy and climate change, and we\u2019ve been very active domestically and internationally, so we\u2019re not going to shy away from that.Last year the G-7 negotiations were quite antagonistic on climate change. Do you anticipate the same dynamic? I\u2019m certainly hopeful not. We certainly learned some lessons there. Will Canada insist on affirming the Paris agreement in a Group of 7 joint statement?Spending all your time negotiating a communiqu\u00e9 as opposed to just moving forward and talking about action is probably not where you necessarily want to be. I\u2019m more interested in how we get serious action. Climate change is the biggest issue we face and we\u2019re going to continue having conversations about it. I\u2019m always hopeful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Banks Could Control Gun Sales if Washington Won\u2019t", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookFor the past year, chief executives have often talked about the new sense of moral responsibility that corporations have to help their communities and confront social challenges even when Washington won\u2019t.Here\u2019s an idea.What if the finance industry \u2014 credit card companies like Visa, Mastercard and American Express; credit card processors like First Data; and banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo \u2014 were to effectively set new rules for the sales of guns in America?Collectively, they have more leverage over the gun industry than any lawmaker. And it wouldn\u2019t be hard for them to take a stand.PayPal, Square, Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms.\u201cWe do not believe permitting the sale of firearms on our platform is consistent with our values or in the best interests of our customers,\u201d a spokesman for Square told me.The big financial firms don\u2019t even have to go that far.If Mastercard were to do the same, assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card system.To be clear: Those three banks won\u2019t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle \u2014 the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex.Visa spokesmen did not reply to several emails seeking comment. A spokesman for Mastercard sent a boilerplate statement that expressed \u201cdisgust with recent events, including last week in Florida.\u201d\u201cOur payments network is governed by standards that have been established over time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cChief among these is that we do not and will not permit merchants to engage in unlawful activity on our network.\u201d He said the company would continue to talk to customers and lawmakers about its policies.If Visa and Mastercard are unwilling to act on this issue, the credit card processors and banks that issue credit cards could try. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which issues credit cards and owns a payment processor, has talked about how he and his bank have \u201ca moral obligation but also a deeply vested interest\u201d in helping \u201csolve pressing societal challenges.\u201d This is your chance, Mr. Dimon.And here\u2019s a variation on the same theme: What if the payment processing industry\u2019s biggest customers \u2014 companies like McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Apple, Amazon, AT&T, CVS and others that regularly talk about \u201csocial responsibility\u201d \u2014 collectively pressured the industry to do it? There\u2019s a chance that some of the payment processors would stop handling gun sales. Perhaps their voices would help push one of the banks to step out and lead?Is all of this a pipe dream? Maybe, but I spent the last 72 hours calling and emailing a handful of chief executives to discuss these ideas. None wanted to speak on the record, because it\u2019s a hot-button topic. But all applauded the idea and some said they had already been thinking about it. A few, I discovered later, called their peers to begin a conversation.At least two executives said a reason that they haven\u2019t been more outspoken yet is that they fear reprisals from the N.R.A. and other gun supporters \u2014 not just in the form of boycotts that could affect their bottom line, but also actions that could imperil the safety of their employees.Perhaps the biggest stumbling block to an approach like this are companies like Walmart, which has huge sway over the financial industry. While Walmart stopped selling assault rifles in 2015, it might look askance at any policy by a bank issuer or credit card company to limit the kinds of products it sells.Critics of using the finance industry to influence gun sales might argue that such a move would be discriminatory against gun retailers. But gun sellers are not a protected class, like age, race, gender, religion or even political affiliation. This would be a strictly commercial decision.Another critique is that it is impossible to prevent every shooting, no matter how guns are restricted. And the banks\u2019 actions would affect millions of their own law-abiding customers, effectively dictating what they can and cannot buy.The most troubling aspect of having the finance industry try to restrict gun sales is that it would push the most dangerous guns into an untraceable world where sales would depend on cash. That\u2019s true. All things considered, though, it would make it considerably harder to even find such guns.There are other sectors of the finance industry that could step up. For example, Lloyd\u2019s of London is the favored insurance company for gun shows. It could pull out.None of this is a panacea. But it\u2019s a start. It takes leadership and courage \u2014 exactly what these executives say they have. If they don\u2019t want to back up their words with actions, the next time there\u2019s a school shooting that prompts a conversation about gun companies, it should also include the financial complex that supports them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Qualcomm in Play, San Diego Fears Losing \u2018Our Flag\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "The world\u2019s No. 1 maker of smartphone chips is the area\u2019s biggest employer and benefactor, a role threatened by Broadcom\u2019s $121 billion takeover bid.Supported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 For corporate success, no story in San Diego is as good as the story of Qualcomm. The company was founded in a living room and became the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphone chips, one of the area\u2019s largest employers and its chief corporate benefactor.People here are so accustomed to everything that comes with being Qualcomm\u2019s home that they\u2019re having a hard time imagining the city without that distinction. But suddenly that\u2019s the prospect they are confronting.\u201cAs a businessperson in San Diego, if you\u2019re not following this you\u2019re living in a cave,\u201d said Jason Hughes, chief executive of Hughes Marino, a commercial real estate brokerage.Mr. Hughes is something of a microstudy in how deeply Qualcomm has embedded itself into the region. In a recent interview at his downtown office, he ticked off various leases his brokers had secured for Qualcomm, as well as the dozens of start-ups that have grown up around it \u2014 along with law firms, banks, furniture dealers and architects that all get an outsize portion of their business from the local giant. His company once handled a lease for a health equipment manufacturer that outfitted the employee gyms that dot Qualcomm\u2019s sprawling campus.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019re our flag,\u201d Mr. Hughes said.Qualcomm and the Jacobs family also form the bedrock of giving to local charities and arts and educational institutions. A little over a decade ago, Mr. Hughes was brought in to rescue a children\u2019s museum and had to line up donors to help pay off its debt. \u201cThe first people I went to were Joan and Irwin Jacobs,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Jacobs and his wife.Qualcomm, by contrast, prides itself on an inventive corporate culture in which employees who\u2019ve been granted patents are given special business cards with the word \u201cinventor\u201d in the lower right corner.\u201cBroadcom is not rewarding people for going out and making speculative bets,\u201d Mr. Rasgon said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather wait and buy the winner, so these are fundamentally different cultures.\u201dOn a recent morning, as short-sleeved employees had periodic meetings in an outdoor courtyard, the security desk at Qualcomm headquarters was playing a reel of commercials promoting the company\u2019s hidden role behind the smartphone revolution. (\u201cInvention comes first.\u201d \u201cWe make the technology that makes every smartphone awesome.\u201d)That message is reinforced at a winding company museum that starts with exhibits on early technologies like briefcase phones and progresses to flip phones, smartphones, tablets and GoPro cameras. The displays chart how Qualcomm chips have enabled companies from Silicon Valley and elsewhere to cram ever more pictures, videos, songs and tweets into our pockets.Qualcomm\u2019s takeover battle is coming at a sensitive time for the San Diego ego. While the city is one of America\u2019s innovation powerhouses and a hive of start-up activity and venture capital investment, it has had less success in attracting big companies \u2014 or, for that matter, keeping the growing companies it creates.\u201cWe think of ourselves as a very innovative community that does a lot of start-ups and creates the companies of tomorrow,\u201d said Jerry Sanders, mayor of San Diego from 2005 to 2012 and now chief executive of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe have a pretty good idea that once they get a certain size, they may be gone.\u201dQualcomm was the exception. Mr. Jacobs, the original chief executive, moved to San Diego in 1966 to join the faculty of the University of California, San Diego. Two years later, he founded his first company, Linkabit, a consulting firm that did contract research to help clients like NASA solve deep-space telecommunications problems and later started designing and building circuit boards, chips and other components.As Linkabit grew, it attracted engineers from powerhouse institutions like M.I.T. and Stanford to the San Diego area. And as the university grew, Linkabit started finding more of its engineers locally. One built off the other, and suddenly there were the embers of a telecommunications cluster that today drives a little under a quarter of San Diego\u2019s economic output, said Mr. Cunningham of the research institute.And just as Silicon Valley\u2019s ecosystem can be traced to a chain of events that saw employees leave one company to form another, so can Qualcomm\u2019s. Linkabit engineers moved on to seed new companies in the area. Mr. Jacobs departed in 1985 and soon got together with a group of former colleagues to create a company centered on quality communications, or Qualcomm for short.Despite the anxiety here, it helps to remember that industrial development is more alchemy than science. Aside from a few basic ingredients \u2014 an educated populace, a good university and a reputation as a nice place to live \u2014 economists have almost no idea why industries coalesce around some cities instead of others, at least until they have done so.But more than any one big company, economists say, a location\u2019s greatest asset is its ability to maintain whatever dynamics keep new companies forming. And Qualcomm has helped to create a critical mass of engineers and investment that is now baked into the region.\u201cCities are incubators for new ideas, but when the idea gets sufficiently mature, it moves on,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who studies cities. \u201cThe important thing is that San Diego keeps on churning out new success stories and never becomes too dependent on any one company.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted the name of one agency involved in a report estimating the indirect economic effects of Qualcomm employment on San Diego. In addition to the San Diego Workforce Partnership, the study was by the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to End the Scam of Flying Pets", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne day, we may all owe a debt of gratitude to Dexter the peacock.At Newark Airport last weekend, a woman tried to board a United Airlines flight with Dexter. She described him as her emotional-support animal. But given that peacocks are large birds and there is not much evidence of their therapeutic benefits, United said no, Dexter could not board.If you spend any time on planes, you\u2019ve probably noticed the surge of animals. There have been pigs, monkeys, turkeys, snakes and oh-so-many dogs, often sprawled across crowded cabins. Delta alone flies about 250,000 animals a year \u2014 not even counting those tucked inside carry-on bags or checked in cargo holds \u2014 more than double how many it flew in 2015.I\u2019m not going to claim that flying pets are one of the country\u2019s biggest problems right now. That\u2019s a high bar, after all. But I do find this situation to be a fascinating case study of how mass cheating can become acceptable \u2014 and how decent people can make decisions that are more selfish than they realize. It is one of the downsides of a modern culture that too often fetishizes individual preference and expression over communal well-being.The trouble started when pet owners realized that they could game the system, because airlines did not require much proof of medical need. By claiming one, people could bring an animal on board without putting it in a carry-on bag and without paying a fee that typically runs $125.Once animals became more common on planes, the trend fed on itself. Pet owners figured that if other people were cheating the system, they might as well too. A cottage industry sprung up in service of low-level fraud. For $30 on Amazon, you can buy a bright-red dog vest that reads, EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. With a quick web search, you can find a therapist to diagnose you long-distance. Fill out a form, and suddenly you\u2019re certified as having an illness that requires animal attention.The last few weeks may have brought a turning point. First Delta and then United \u2014 following L\u2019Affaire Dexter \u2014 announced stricter rules, requiring certification of animal training. Ultimately, I hope the Department of Transportation creates a fairly strict uniform rule for all airlines. (It should also ensure safe conditions for animals in cargo holds, which would make people comfortable with checking their pet.)The whole bizarre situation is a reminder of why trust matters so much to a well-functioning society. The best solution, of course, would be based not on some Transportation Department regulation but on simple trust. People who really needed service animals could then bring them on planes without having to carry documents.Maybe a trust-based system will return at some point. But it won\u2019t return automatically. When trust breaks down and small bits of dishonesty become normal, people need to make a conscious effort to restore basic decency.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s review the week\u2019s tech news.All this got me wondering: What\u2019s the point of cable TV anymore?For a time, cutting the cord was one of those hipster affectations that came with sacrifices. A kind of asceticism was implied in the name. The cord, the familiar cable bundle of yore, required paying a whole lot for a bunch of bad TV you\u2019d never watch, just so you could have very convenient access to the handful of shows you sometimes did watch.Then along came DVDs and the internet, and now you could unbundle \u2014 you\u2019d pay a lot less for just the things you really wanted to see, provided you were O.K. hazarding some minor inconveniences.But as Netflix keeps driving trucks of money to TV\u2019s top producers \u2014 it plans to spend $8 billion on new content this year \u2014 the script has flipped. More and more, it\u2019s the people who haven\u2019t cut the cord who are missing out. Today, if you subscribe just to regular TV and don\u2019t bother with Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other online services, you\u2019re missing some of TV\u2019s biggest and most acclaimed shows. Plus, you\u2019re paying more.Cable subscriptions have been declining for years, and last year the decline accelerated. But the YouTube expansion shows that cutting the cord keeps getting easier, and the Netflix deal shows how non-cable services keep getting more attractive. This suggests an even faster pace of decline for cable. The bottom is going to fall out of the market, probably very soon.Chrome, Google\u2019s popular web browser, can now block ads. This seems weird because Google is the internet\u2019s largest advertising company. So how does an advertising company design ad-blocking software? Very, very carefully, it turns out, in a process rife with conflicts.So Google\u2019s new ad blocker is designed to block some ads, not all of them. The software will eliminate a dozen types of ads that the company deems intrusive or disruptive. But most ads, including most from Google, would skate through just fine.It\u2019s an interesting fight, but it may also be an irrelevant one. What\u2019s unclear is whether Google\u2019s limited ad blocker will stem the rising popularity of more restrictive ad blockers. For many people who hate online ads, it could already be too late for half measures.The New York Times\u2019s tech reporting team is gathering in San Francisco this week for a team-building offsite.

{"Headline": "Stocks Fall to End a Bad Week, and a Boom Begins to Look Shaky", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe optimism helped lift stock markets ever higher, extending the boom into its ninth year.Now, investors are suddenly skittish.On Friday, stocks tumbled by more than 2 percent, propelling the market to its worst week in two years.In recent weeks, the shift in sentiment has played out across the world\u2019s largest financial markets. As stocks have sold off, Treasury yields have surged. The dollar has slumped.\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate concern, when inflation spikes up a little bit, that people should evaluate how is this going to affect profits and how is this going to affect the Fed,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe market is becoming more vigilant around these concerns, and that\u2019s good and that\u2019s healthy.\u201dSince stocks began climbing during the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, their rise has been supported by some of the lowest global interest rates seen since World War II. To jump-start growth, central bankers around the world slashed interest rates and took other steps to push down yields on safe government bonds.Their goal was to incentivize investors to put their cash to work in the economy \u2014 for example, by buying corporate stocks and bonds \u2014 rather than stashing it in the relative safety of government bonds. The theory is that the fresh flood of capital would make it easier for companies to raise money, invest in their businesses and hire workers. Central banks wanted to heal their economies.They have healed.For the first time since the financial crisis of 2008, the world\u2019s largest economies are growing in unison. The United States and China led the way, but the expansion now includes Europe, long mired in a debt crisis, and perennially laggard Japan.Given the strength of the global economy, central banks, led by the United States Federal Reserve, have started to remove some of the supports that helped supercharge stock and bond prices over the last decade. The Fed started raising rates two years ago. And with the robust jobs report on Friday showing the fastest wage growth in years, some think the pace of rate increases could quicken.Average hourly earnings for United States workers were 2.9 percent higher in January than the previous year, the fastest annual increase in years. Although a welcome development for workers, economists often view rising wages as an early indication of inflationary pressure. If faster price increases do begin to emerge, the Fed could try to head them off with more aggressive rate action.Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve\u2019s departing chairwoman who had her last working day on Friday, was viewed by some as being more concerned about measures of weakness in the job market than by the risk of rising inflation, and therefore more willing to keep rates low. Her successor, Jerome H. Powell, will face different challenges as the Fed charts a new course in raising interest rates.Interest rates that are set every day in the global bond markets are already leaping higher, in anticipation of central bank rate increases later this year. On Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 a widely used gauge for overall interest rates \u2014 rose to more than 2.8 percent, the highest level since early 2014.Rising rates have myriad consequences, including making it more expensive for companies and individuals to borrow money, like for buying a home or a car. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.2 percent, up from less than 4 percent at the end of 2017.The stock markets this week have reflected the jitters.The energy sector was especially hard hit, with energy giants ExxonMobil dropping 5.1 percent and Chevron falling 5.6 percent on Friday after reporting lackluster earnings. The energy sector of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 6.4 percent during the week, the biggest drop of all industrial sectors in the benchmark.Health care stocks did not fare much better. Express Scripts, Cigna and UnitedHealth Group, among others, were battered Tuesday after Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway announced they were teaming up to create a health care company for their employees.Tech stocks, which have been a crucial driver of the broader market rise, also slipped. Apple reported record-breaking profit late Thursday, but the company disappointed investors with a weaker-than-expected sales forecast. Its shares sank roughly 4.3 percent on Friday, worse than the broader market.That is not to say the market is collapsing. The S.&P. 500 fell 3.9 percent this week. Still, it remains close to historic highs and 21 percent above where it stood a year ago, after another year of solid economic growth.The United States economy expanded by a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2017. That is below the pace of some past expansions \u2014 the economy grew at around 4 percent annually in the late 1990s. But it is enough to keep creating significant numbers of jobs, including 200,000 in January.The economic expansion should be a comfort to investors. Higher revenue allows companies to offset rising costs, such as workers\u2019 pay, if inflation picks up. The tax cuts are also expected to help bolster growth.\u201cIf we start to see growth slowing and inflation acceleration, that\u2019s when I get concerned,\u201d said Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. \u201cAs long as growth continues to improve, a little bit more inflation that we\u2019re seeing now is fine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone X shows.\u2014 Peter EavisWith the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation.They may want to keep fretting, though.Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday. Stocks moved higher. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index closed up 1.2 percent and is now just 3.2 percent off the high it reached just before its plunge at the start of this month.\u2014 Peter EavisBut the two remain far apart on price.From the statement accompanying the letter:The Qualcomm Board believes the meeting led to further progress toward a possible negotiated transaction on key issues other than price. The Board authorized providing Broadcom with a mark-up of Broadcom\u2019s previously released draft merger agreement that, if agreed to by Broadcom, would resolve all issues between the two companies other than price.ButBroadcom reiterated in the February 23 meeting that its reduced $79.00 per share proposal is its best and final proposal. The Qualcomm Board is unanimous in its view that each of Broadcom\u2019s proposals, including its prior $82.00 per share proposal, materially undervalues Qualcomm, and the Board encourages Broadcom to enter into mutual due diligence and price negotiations.Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle tweeted:Rick Jeffares, a candidate for lieutenant governor and former Georgia state senator, weighed in with:Writes Ms. Josephs:After its tweet announcing the end of the NRA discounts, Delta said in a statement that the \u201cdecision reflects the airline\u2019s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings\u201d and that it was taken \u201cout of respect for our customers and employees on both sides.\u201dThe airline added that \u201cit continues to support the Second Amendment.\u201dHe certainly sees the need.Berkshire\u2019s goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions. We certainly have the resources to do so. At year end Berkshire held $116.0 billion in cash.But will he have the opportunity?Mr. Buffett bemoaned the sky-high purchase prices that \u201cproved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017.\u201dCritics\u2019 cornerOther highlights from the letter\u2022 Mr. Buffett railed against a new accounting rule that will affect future quarterly and annual reports. The change requires companies to include in earnings the gains and losses on stocks they hold but have not sold. Because Berkshire holds $170 billion of stocks, the impact on Berkshire\u2019s bottom line could be significant.Peter Eavis of The Times notes:RelatedMichael Kives, a longtime Hollywood agent at Creative Artists Agency who has consulted and represented Mr. Buffett \u2014 as well as Mikhail Gorbachev, Katy Perry and Jessica Alba, among others \u2014 is striking out on his own with a new firm, K5. It will provide advisory services for companies \u201cacross media, sports, technology, finance, politics, and a variety of other industries,\u201d according to an announcement expected to go out later today.\u2014 Chad BrayTalks about a sale to a group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet have collapsed. The group had offered to pay about $275 million for the company, plus the assumption of $225 million in debt.\u201cLate last night, you returned to us an incomplete document that unfortunately does not keep your promises,\u201d it said in a letter. \u201cThat is regrettable, but not in our power to change.\u201dThe board, which includes Bob Weinstein, accused Ms. Contreras-Sweet\u2019s team of failing to provide funding to keep the studio operating while the deal was completed and said she had proposed new sale conditions that meant the transaction would take much longer to close.The context The change comes after an outside review of behavior within the stock-picking unit and reports of sexual harassment allegations.More from the WSJ\u2019s Sarah Krouse and Kirsten Grind:Stock picking has been under unprecedented pressure in recent years as investors have poured money into low-cost index-tracking funds. The star-manager system helped fuel careers of top fund managers at the family-run firm, but it also created a system in which portfolio managers wielded outsize power over analysts, more than a dozen current and former employees said.What does this mean for corporate social responsibility?More on gun controlThe rush by Republicans in Congress to overhaul U.S. tax law before the end of last year has complicated planning for individual taxpayers.Here\u2019s Jeffrey C. LeSage, vice chairman for the Americas of KPMG\u2019s tax practice:This is anything but tax simplification. I don\u2019t personally see us coming back to the rates that we\u2019ve had, historically, on the corporate side. On the individual side, who knows?\u201dThe Washington flyaround The ruling Communist Party\u2019s decision to open a path to a third term for Mr. Xi heightened a sense of resentment in China among academics, lawyers, journalists and business executives.

{"Headline": "A Crazy Idea for Funding Local News: Charge People for It", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe plan, for any would-be entrepreneur brave enough to try it, goes like this: Hire some very good journalists; just one or two are O.K. to start. Turn them loose on a large metropolitan area \u2014 try San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston or any other city going through waves of change, and whose local press has been gutted by digital disruption.Have your reporters cover stuff that no one else is covering, and let them ignore stuff that everyone else is covering. Don\u2019t do movie reviews, stock market analysis, Super Bowl coverage or anything else that isn\u2019t local. Instead, emphasize coverage that\u2019s actionable, that residents deem necessary and valuable for short- and long-term planning \u2014 especially an obsessive focus on housing and development, transportation, education and local politics.Package it all in a form that commands daily attention \u2014 probably a morning email newsletter \u2014 and sprinkle it with a sense of community, like offline and online networking events for readers.How will you fund all of this? This is the most important part: Shun advertising. Instead, ask readers to pay for it with real money \u2014 $5 or $10 a month, or perhaps even more. It will take time, but if you build it right, you just might create the next great metropolitan news organization.This plan may sound simplistic, almost like a joke. Wait, Sherlock, your big idea is to create a really good product and charge people money for it? Haven\u2019t people tried this before?Less than you might think. The short history of digital media is lousy with advertising, which promotes all the wrong incentives for online news \u2014 volume over curation, aggregation over original coverage, speed over accuracy.Yet few entrepreneurs have jumped on the subscription bandwagon for local news. The reluctance makes sense; local markets are by definition small, and journalism is expensive.But after studying Ms. Lessin\u2019s and Mr. Thompson\u2019s methods, I suspect there\u2019s a market for subscription-based local coverage. Someone just has to build it.How? Consider Ms. Lessin\u2019s plan for The Information, the tech news service she started in 2013 after spending eight years at The Wall Street Journal. Back then, online subscriptions seemed antiquated; many companies had experimented with charging users, but most had failed to win large numbers of subscribers, and the big money in media was in ad-supported sites aiming for rapid expansion through viral traffic.\u201cPeople thought no one would pay for news, especially tech news,\u201d Ms. Lessin told me last month. \u201cThe problem was the news business hadn\u2019t been focused on a key question: How do I deliver a differentiated product that people would pay for?\u201dHer idea for differentiation was to charge a lot for The Information \u2014 a subscription is $399 a year, close to what The Wall Street Journal charges for print delivery \u2014 but she would offer readers quality instead of volume.The Information publishes just two or three stories a day, often scoops and analysis, including a handy daily roundup of the most important stories in tech that day.Mr. Thompson\u2019s overhead is low: He is the only writer of Stratechery, which has become required reading among tech executives and many others in the industry. He declined to divulge any subscriber numbers, other than to say he\u2019s doing very well.A high-priced subscription site may well have a natural audience ceiling. Ms. Lessin declined to divulge her subscriber base but said it was \u201csignificantly north of 10,000,\u201d which is lower than the audience for many ad-based digital publications.Sure, there are reasons to be skeptical that this model could work in local news. Many subscribers to The Information and Stratechery think of the publications as a business expense \u2014 they work in tech or finance, wealthy industries that will pay just about anything for business intelligence.Yet there are striking overlaps between what those publications do and what a subscription-based local news start-up would look like. For one thing, a lot of those wealthy people also live in undercovered urban and suburban areas; if they\u2019re paying for news about tech, wouldn\u2019t they also pay for in-depth investigations into their kids\u2019 school district, their city\u2019s mayoral race or the traffic clogging their commute?There\u2019s also the opportunity to pay for a sense of community. The Information \u2014 through the Slack chat service, conference calls and in-person meet-ups \u2014 constantly brings subscribers together to talk about the industry. A local news start-up could do the same, selling not just news but a sense of belonging.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the subscription news business, you\u2019re not selling articles,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Why do they pay?\u201cNews happens in tech every day, and I do the thinking for them,\u201d he said. A subscription-based local news business would offer the same value: \u201cYou\u2019re selling people a feeling of being informed, of being good citizens \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re selling.\u201dNow we just need someone to build it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ryan Murphy Heads to Netflix in Deal Said to Be Worth Up to $300 Million", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe streaming giant Netflix has won yet another battle against old Hollywood.On Tuesday night, Netflix announced that it had poached the hit-making producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox.The five-year deal is worth as much as $300 million, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. That would be one of the biggest deals ever made for a television producer.While the agreement will come as a disappointment to the studio where Mr. Murphy has spent most of his career, it also delivers a serious blow to the Walt Disney Company, which reached a deal in December to acquire most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion.Mr. Murphy\u2019s contract with Fox expires in the summer, and he will make the move to Netflix in July.The prolific producer behind \u201cGlee,\u201d \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d and the anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d Mr. Murphy would have been a key piece in the expanded Disney empire, and Fox executives made several attempts to keep him in the corporate family. Amazon also courted him seriously, which played a role in driving up the price for the 52-year-old writer, director and producer from Indianapolis.\u201cThe history of this moment is not lost on me,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in a statement. \u201cI am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me.\u201dThe moment was certainly right for someone like Mr. Murphy to find himself in the final months of a contract. The Hollywood economy is buzzing, with fast-moving digital disrupters taking on the studios that have been dependable providers of mass entertainment since the silent-movie era.The upshot is that proven show runners and big stars are in an enviable bargaining position.A factor in Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to join Netflix was the uncertainty brought on by the agreement between Disney and Fox. He had close working relationships with Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox; Dana Walden, the chairwoman of Fox\u2019s TV group (and the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children); and John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX network, a cable channel under the Fox banner.If the Disney-Fox deal wins governmental approval, as expected, it is not a sure thing that those executives will stay in their roles. Mr. Rice said at the Code Media conference on Tuesday that he didn\u2019t know whether he would remain with the company after the planned merger went through.The exclusive, five-year deal for the high-profile producer is yet another coup for Netflix. In addition to signing Ms. Rhimes last summer, the company has brought aboard Dave Chappelle, David Letterman, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler with lucrative deals.Mr. Murphy did not have his hands tied at Fox, which allowed him to push boundaries. And he did not lack for respect: The first season of the FX anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson,\u201d for which Mr. Murphy served as an executive producer, was a huge hit with critics and won nine Emmys. The Netflix deal, though, will allow him potentially bigger budgets and gives him the latitude to try movies, television or even documentaries.In his statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Murphy expressed his gratitude toward Netflix\u2019s chief executive officer, Reed Hastings; its chief content officer, Ted Sarandos; and its vice president for original content, Cindy Holland.\u201cI am awash in genuine appreciation for Ted Sarandos, Reed Hastings and Cindy Holland at Netflix for believing in me and the future of my company, which will continue to champion women, minorities and L.G.B.T.Q. heroes and heroines,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am honored and grateful to continue my partnership with my friends and peers at Fox on my existing shows.\u201dIn his own statement, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cRyan Murphy\u2019s series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history. His unfaltering dedication to excellence and to give voice to the underrepresented, to showcase a unique perspective or just to shock the hell out of us, permeates his genre-shattering work.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s vast slate at Fox will not disappear overnight. All future seasons of \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFeud\u201d will continue to air on FX. His procedural drama, \u201c9-1-1,\u201d which is only six weeks old and is becoming something of a sleeper hit, will continue on Fox. And his new drama about the 1980s New York vogue scene, \u201cPose,\u201d with a largely transgender cast, will proceed at FX.Mr. Murphy began his career as a journalist before moving into television script writing. His first show, \u201cPopular,\u201d on the WB, didn\u2019t last long but has become the source of cult fascination. \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d one of the earliest successes for FX, gave Mr. Murphy his first hit and transformed FX from a crusty basic cable outpost into a premier entertainment destination. In 2009, when Mr. Murphy brought some Broadway pizazz \u2014 along with an affection for misfit adolescents \u2014 to Fox\u2019s prime-time lineup with \u201cGlee,\u201d he entered the top ranks of show runners.Throughout his career, he has shown a penchant for taking the stuff of camp and making it popular. No one expected an eight-hour limited series about the rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis \u2014 \u201cFeud,\u201d on FX \u2014 to be a hit, but it was.Mr. Murphy signaled his restlessness last month, at the Television Critics Association media event in Los Angeles, when he expressed angst over his future. For years, he said, he thought he would \u201cliterally be buried on the Fox lot.\u201d Once Rupert Murdoch made the decision to sell the company, however, Mr. Murphy was not so sure.He approached Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, with a question that suggested his discomfort with his new corporate trappings:\u201cAm I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in \u2018American Horror Story\u2019?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Cut Ties to the N.R.A., but Find There Is No Neutral Ground", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWithin hours of announcing its decision to end a credit card relationship with the National Rifle Association, the First National Bank of Omaha found itself thrust into the center of the resurgent national gun debate.Its Twitter and Facebook pages were flooded with comments. Some customers applauded the 160-year-old bank\u2019s decision. Others said they would take their business elsewhere.In the aftermath of the deadly school shooting in Florida last week, businesses were making the same financial and moral calculus, quickly discovering that there is no neutral ground. As pressure mounted across various social media platforms on Friday, a number of corporations, including several car-rental companies, MetLife insurance, Symantec security software and the car pricing and information site TrueCar, abruptly announced plans to cut ties with the organization.Over the last couple of years, social media has become the preferred vehicle for the rise of consumer activism, turning the everyday purchase of dresses or shoes or, now, renting a car or buying insurance, into a form of protest or demonstration of ideology.For companies like MetLife that are caught in the middle of these angry social media storms, actions tied to divisive social issues can be a lose-lose proposition. A year ago, Nordstrom first faced calls for a consumer boycott because it carried the Ivanka Trump line of clothing. But it quickly drew another round of boycott cries from the other side of the ideological spectrum when it quietly stopped selling her products.Marketing experts say it\u2019s difficult to determine whether calls for boycotts can truly have an impact on a company\u2019s business. Rather, they say, once-angry customers either forget or move on to the next event or debate.\u201cMemories fade. The intensity of the feelings that people have on this subject right now will feel different one month or five months from now,\u201d said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.And after a gunman used an accessory called a bump stock in a mass shooting in Las Vegas last October, two retailers, Walmart and the outdoors store Cabela\u2019s, removed the products from their websites.But in the days since the Florida school shooting, the push for boycotts and meaningful change has mobilized faster than with previous mass shootings. Professor Schweitzer noted that reflected the fact that the survivors are teenagers who are well versed in the usage and power of social media.Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.Leading retailers including Cabela\u2019s, Walmart and Bass Pro Shops also came under renewed boycott calls on Twitter for selling guns or sponsoring N.R.A. events. The retailers did not respond to emails seeking comment.\u201cNorth American and Allied Van Lines no longer have an affiliate relationship with the N.R.A. effective immediately,\u2019\u2019 the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have asked them to remove our listing from their benefits site.\u201dEven companies that do not have ties to the N.R.A. nevertheless rushed to distance themselves from the group. Wyndham Hotels said in a statement that it ended its relationship with the trade group in late 2017. Best Western Hotels & Resorts tweeted to dozens of customers that it \u201cdoes not have an affiliation with and is not a corporate partner\u201d of the N.R.A.With lists of companies circulating widely, Facebook users swarmed the profiles of Avis, MetLife and others, announcing their plans to end their patronage and switch to competitors.Rob Bradford, a designer who travels frequently, said Friday morning he would take the $600 he spends each year renting vehicles from Avis to competing rental companies if Avis did not disavow the N.R.A.\u201cI know that boycotts work, especially in the age of social media,\u201d he said. \u201cI will go out of my way to avoid businesses associated with that group even if that means spending more money.\u201dBy Friday afternoon, Avis Budget Group, which owns the car rental companies Avis and Budget, said it had decided to end its discount partnership with the N.R.A., effective on March 26, according to a representative.Late Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, which calls itself the largest privately owned bank holding company in the country, said that it would not renew its contract with the trade group to issue an N.R.A.-branded credit card.The card had been advertised as \u201cthe official credit card of the N.R.A.,\u201d and cardholders were offered a $40 credit with their first purchase.But the move drew strong, even extreme, reaction on the bank\u2019s Facebook page.\u201cYou are doing the right thing by dropping the NRA,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cThey are a hate group with blood on their hands. Thank you for walking away from them.\u201dBut the opposing viewpoint was evident as well. \u201cI discontinued my account with you last night for discontinuing the relationship with the NRA,\u201d another user wrote. \u201cI will encourage all NRA members and gun supporters to do the same.

The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge. But that\u2019s OK \u2013 persuading customers to pay more arguably requires as much genius as getting people to adopt the technology in the first place.\u201dAmazonCritics cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:Amazon.com is going gangbusters.

Over time, that could sully the company\u2019s image.AlphabetCritics cornerJennifer Saba of Breakingviews:Alphabet is stuck at the letter G. The holding company of Google was created to safeguard against conventionality and let moonshot ideas, like self-driving cars, flourish. Almost three years in, it\u2019s basically still just Google. Which means, in turn, that the A in Alphabet stands mainly for advertising.It wouldn\u2019t hurt Alphabet to put more energy into revenue sources that don\u2019t start with a G.Why now\u2022 Walt Disney\u2019s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.Critics cornerTara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly:\u201cCBS isn\u2019t safe from the industry\u2019s broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom won\u2019t provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities. Those synergies may amount to some $500 million based on what past deals have yielded, according to Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. That could create quite a lift for CBS\u2019s earnings.\u201dBelinda Johnson is moving up. Laurence Tosi is moving out. And don\u2019t expect the company to go public this year.Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company\u2019s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis.Between the linesThe context The company lineHere\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson:\u201cShe takes critical functions that might be seen as constraints in other companies, and clears a path so they can become competitive advantages and facilitate the growth of the business.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies:\u201cHaving worked with Belinda over the years and at Airbnb, I have been consistently impressed by her ability to anticipate issues and leverage strategic opportunities. She combines technical expertise with great care for her colleagues.\u201dAnd here\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi:\u201cHe helped Airbnb establish a rigorous financial discipline, aided our expansion into new businesses including into luxury rentals, which is now one of our core businesses, and helped us develop new and innovative ways to grow Airbnb and our businesses.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSome of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook.Facebook\u2019s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe.The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook\u2019s future growth. The company\u2019s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe\u2019s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States\u2019, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.That\u2019s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin\u2019s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg.The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday.More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex.\u201cThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,\u201d said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. \u201cIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.\u201dThe digital money flyaroundDetails, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point.The contextWhile a potential joint venture between Alphabet and Aramco isn\u2019t necessarily connected to the latter company\u2019s IPO, if a deal is struck before the offering, advisers to the company could pitch the pact as a way for investors to bake in technology valuations.It isn\u2019t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company \u2014 and therefore command a higher multiple \u2014 but it\u2019d be interesting to see bankers make that argument.\u2014 Stephen GrocerFrom the release:\u201cI am excited to join NEA because they understand how to work with visionary entrepreneurs to build successful technology and health care enterprises,\u201d Immelt said. \u201cI have a passion for these sectors and I am eager to work with NEA and its partners to develop great businesses, nurture talented leaders and grow diverse teams.\u201dand:\u201cJeff is deeply knowledgeable about the complex global innovation landscape we\u2019re operating in today and he understands how businesses must evolve to compete and win in that environment, particularly across industrial and medical technologies,\u201d said Scott Sandell, Managing General Partner, NEA.(Worth noting: Mr. Immelt\u2019s successor at G.E. is struggling to turn that company around. See below.)\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s where our colleague Peter Eavis says investors should focus:Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Today\u2019s a big day for tech earningsThe Treasury secretary argued that the cuts would eventually pay for themselves, but conceded that it wouldn\u2019t happen this year.The policy flyaroundAnalysts\u2019 takes:\u2022 Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch write, \u201cThis shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.\u201d\u2022 Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \u201cIn short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell\u2019s first press conference.\u201d\u2022 Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton said, \u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation.\u201dAnalysts over at Deutsche Bank think so. They wrote in a research note yesterday:As the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), G.E. increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.G.E. is the last survivor of the index\u2019s 12 original components from when it started in 1896, and has been in it continuously for more than 110 years.\u201cWe will be looking at how the company, from the board on down, handles the allegations,\u201d said Karen Wells, who directs the investigations and enforcement bureau at the state gambling commission.She said allegations in the settlement agreement weren\u2019t disclosed before the commission granted Wynn a license in September 2014, or at any point before The Wall Street Journal report.Shares in Wynn Resorts fell more than 3 percent yesterday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Falcon Heavy, in a Roar of Thunder, Carries SpaceX\u2019s Ambition Into Orbit", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. \u2014 From the same pad where NASA launched rockets that carried astronauts to the moon, a big, new American rocket arced into space on Tuesday. But this time, NASA was not involved. The rocket, the Falcon Heavy, was built by SpaceX, the company founded and run by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.\u201cIt seems surreal to me,\u201d Mr. Musk said during a news conference after the launch.The launch of this turbocharged version of the workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which has been carrying cargo to space for years, marks an important milestone in spaceflight, the first time a rocket this powerful has been sent into space by a private company rather than a government space agency.The rocket carried a playful payload: Mr. Musk\u2019s red Roadster, an electric sports car built by his other company, Tesla. Strapped inside the car is a mannequin wearing one of SpaceX\u2019s spacesuits. They are expected to orbit the sun for hundreds of millions of years.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of silly and fun, but silly and fun things are important,\u201d Mr. Musk said.The success gives SpaceX momentum to begin developing even larger rockets, which could help fulfill Mr. Musk\u2019s dream of sending people to Mars. To do that, he has described a new-generation rocket called B.F.R. (the B stands for big; the R for rocket) that might be ready to launch in the mid-2020s.The near-flawless performance of the Heavy on Tuesday \u201cgives me a lot of confidence we can make the B.F.R. design work,\u201d Mr. Musk said.He added that he hoped the launch would encourage other companies and other countries to aim for more ambitious goals in space.\u201cWe want a new space race,\u201d he said. \u201cRaces are exciting.\u201dFor now, the Heavy will enable SpaceX to compete for contracts to launch larger spy satellites, and some experts in spaceflight are encouraging NASA to use private rockets like the Heavy instead of the gigantic and more expensive rocket, the Space Launch System, that is currently being developed in part to take astronauts back to the moon.\u201cIt basically gives them another tool in their toolbox for accomplishing the space community\u2019s goals,\u201d said Phil Larson, an assistant dean at the University of Colorado\u2019s engineering school who previously worked as a senior manager of communications and corporate projects at SpaceX.SpaceX successfully launched its newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, in February.Although delayed by high-altitude winds, the countdown proceeded smoothly, without any of the glitches that have bedeviled other maiden launches of new rockets.The Heavy roared to life, a plume of smoke and steam shooting sideways from the launchpad. It rose from the pad, with an impossibly bright glare of 27 engines beneath it.About 15 seconds later, a thunderous roar, traveling at the speed of sound, rolled over the spectators.Just over three minutes after it blasted off, the most suspenseful part of the flight was over, as the boosters dropped off and the second stage continued into Earth orbit.Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads at Cape Canaveral. In the past few years, SpaceX has figured out how to routinely bring a booster stage back in one piece to fly again on future flights.The one blemish on the mission was that the center booster, which was to set down on a floating platform in the Atlantic, slammed into the water instead, because some of the engines failed to ignite for the final landing burn.Since 2010, the company has been sending the smaller Falcon 9 rocket into orbit, deploying satellites and carrying cargo to crews aboard the International Space Station. The company has disrupted the global launch business with its lower prices and reusable boosters.The Falcon Heavy is capable of lifting 140,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit, more than any other rocket today. Because all three boosters are to be recovered to fly again, a Falcon Heavy launch costs not much more than one by the company\u2019s existing rocket, Mr. Musk said. SpaceX lists a price of $90 million for a Falcon Heavy flight, compared with $62 million for one by Falcon 9, a bargain in the context of spaceflight.Mr. Musk estimated that his company had spent more than half a billion dollars on Falcon Heavy and said that the program was almost canceled three times.SpaceX has booked coming Heavy flights for Arabsat, a Saudi Arabian communications company, and the United States Air Force.However, the market for the Heavy is smaller than what Mr. Musk envisioned when he announced development of the rocket in 2011. Back then, he expected that SpaceX\u2019s launches would be evenly split between Falcon 9s and Heavies.But the development of the Heavy took years longer than anticipated \u2014 the central booster had to be redesigned to withstand the stresses of the powerful side boosters \u2014 and with advances in miniaturization, the trend is toward smaller satellites. SpaceX also boosted the capability of the Falcon 9, which now can launch many of the payloads that would have originally required a Heavy.In addition to its central booster, the Falcon Heavy was equipped with two additional side boosters that essentially tripled its power at liftoff. While the Heavy uses many of the same components as the Falcon 9, Mr. Musk had cautioned that failures during a test flight would not be surprising. In particular, he worried about complex buffeting of air flowing past the boosters, which is difficult to predict even with the most sophisticated computer simulations.In the past year, SpaceX has tabled many of the plans for future development of the Heavy. The company had intended to use the rocket to launch one of SpaceX\u2019s capsules, known as the Dragon, without people, on a mission to land on Mars. That was scrapped last summer.Instead, SpaceX is focusing its efforts on the B.F.R. It would be a two-stage rocket: a powerful booster to provide lift out of Earth\u2019s gravity and then a spaceship on top for interplanetary missions. The full vehicle would not be ready until the 2020s, but Mr. Musk said he had \u201caspirational\u201d hopes to begin short hopper tests of the spaceship portion next year.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article gave the wrong name for an asteroid mining company.

{"Headline": "Walmart\u2019s Online Sales Growth Lags as It Confronts Challenges", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart has been making big investments in its online business as it tries to adapt to the shifting preferences of global shoppers and to keep pace with its rival Amazon.But Walmart\u2019s online sales growth hit a speed bump in the company\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter, which included the critical holiday shopping season. Online sales grew 23 percent in the United States during that three-month period, the company reported on Tuesday, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters.Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said \u201coperational challenges\u201d at the company\u2019s fulfillment centers during the holidays were responsible for some of the slowdown.Walmart said that a large influx of electronics, toys and other seasonal items had made it difficult to fulfill sales of everyday products.The slowdown reflects a broader challenge at Walmart, which has dominated the retail industry for decades with its extensive store network but is now playing catch-up in the e-commerce realm with Amazon, which captures half of all online spending.\u201cWe are building a business,\u201d Mr. McMillon said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. \u201cWe are learning something new.\u201dDespite the slower pace of online growth, Walmart\u2019s total sales increased 4.1 percent, to $136.3 billion, during the quarter, which ended Jan. 31.That was not enough to impress Wall Street. Walmart shares dropped nearly 9 percent in early morning trading.On a per-share basis, Walmart earned $1.33 in the fourth quarter, short of the $1.37 that analysts had expected. Operating income fell 28 percent, to $4.5 billion.Walmart has expanded its e-commerce offerings by purchasing Jet.com and the online clothing retailers Bonobos and Modcloth. Analysts have nonetheless questioned how Walmart plans to integrate the acquisitions into a cohesive online retail strategy.On Tuesday, the company said it would focus its broad push for new customers on Walmart.com and not Jet, a less-recognizable brand tailored to more urban, higher-income customers.Walmart spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet in 2016. At the time, it was the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company, although it was not clear how the two brands would mesh. \u201cJet will go through adjustment, but it will grow again,\u201d Mr. McMillon said on Tuesday.Walmart\u2019s lagging growth online was not entirely unexpected given that the Jet acquisition was responsible for the large growth rates of previous quarters. But Mr. McMillon acknowledged that the fourth-quarter slowdown \u201cwas a bit more than we planned.\u201dTo increase growth again \u2014 Walmart said it expected online sales to rise 40 percent over the next year \u2014 the company is accelerating its web-based grocery business, increasing the number of stores where customers can order food online and pick it up in stores. Walmart is also experimenting with home delivery in the United States and in Asia, where it recently signed a partnership with the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten to deliver groceries.Still, finding ways to integrate Walmart\u2019s stores with its e-commerce strategy is costly. Last week, Walmart announced that it would offer members of its Sam\u2019s Club unit free shipping of online orders for an annual fee of $100.As part of that effort, Walmart said it would convert a Sam\u2019s Club store in Memphis into an e-commerce distribution center and planned to open more such centers elsewhere in the United States in the coming year.The company closed a total of 63 Sam\u2019s Club stores during the fourth quarter, affecting more than 9,000 workers. Walmart said that it would try to find new positions for as many of the employees as possible, but that some would probably end up out of work.The restructuring at Sam\u2019s Club was among the factors that drove profits down for the quarter. Even without the restructuring and other one-time charges, the company said, operating income would have fallen for the quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Life on an Island: Silence, Beauty and a Long Wait for the Ferry", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "On remote islands off the coast of Maine, small bands of residents stay through the long winter. They embrace the emptiness and a frontier sensibility.Supported byMATINICUS, Me. \u2014 The snow had begun falling overnight, and fell throughout the day, draping the towering pines and the lobster traps, stacked up on land for the winter, in blankets of white.She checked his blood pressure, which she pronounced \u201cso good, it\u2019s boring.\u201d She listened to his heart, which was ticking just fine, almost in rhythm with his many clocks. Mr. Hoadley is something of a clock aficionado, and he keeps his timepieces on daylight saving time, which in winter is an hour ahead of everyone else.Why?\u201cBecause I can,\u201d the impish Mr. Hoadley declared from his nautically themed front parlor.Being able to do exactly as he pleases \u2014 and have health care come to him \u2014 are big reasons Mr. Hoadley stays here, 22 miles out in the North Atlantic.Mr. Hoadley, who has lived the past 30 years on the island, is part of a band of devoted denizens who would not live anywhere else.The rocky sea islands reflect Maine\u2019s independent character. They are steeped in rich history and are cherished by the many Down Easterners who visit in the summer. But the band of full-time residents has diminished.The number of Maine islands where people live year-round has dwindled to just 15 today, from a high of about 300 a century ago. This winter, only 20 people are living on Matinicus.State agencies and nonprofit organizations have tried to stem the loss of year-round populations by giving islanders guarantees of a certain number of lobster licenses, grants for affordable housing, and upgrades to their internet speed.The populations of the islands closest to mainland towns have increased in recent decades. But the more remote outer islands, like Matinicus, have struggled.Still, for some people, the remoteness is the appeal.\u201cWe had been to other islands in Penobscot Bay, and they were too crowded,\u201d said Robin Tarkleson, 60, the Matinicus postmaster, who has lived here year-round for nine years. \u201cThis one didn\u2019t have anything. That was the big attraction.\u201dOther draws: freedom, quiet, beauty, the opportunity to live off the grid, and a frontier sensibility.There are no gas stations, but then, there are not a lot of places to drive.\u201cI last filled up my gas tank in May,\u201d Laura Livingston, 58, who runs a small dairy farm here, said recently. \u201cI think I have half a tank left.\u201dMost islanders catch lobsters for a living. Like many lobstermen, Chris Hodgkins, 30, who lives in the island town of Frenchboro, 30 miles northeast of Matinicus, spends the winter repairing his traps, painting his buoys and cleaning his ropes.And reveling in the stillness.\u201cHave you ever heard the absolute silence?\u201d he asked.To him, the down side of island life is how few young, single women seem to want to try it.The economics of island life can also be tricky.Boom or bust, island living is never easy, especially in winter.Life is dictated by the weather and the ferry, which stops at Matinicus, the farthest flung of the inhabited islands, only once a month. The island has an air strip, and residents can regularly fly to the mainland, weather permitting, but a round trip costs $100.Everything costs more, because it has to be shipped in, including food, fuel and workers like plumbers, whose bills include travel time.With so few people living on the island, most residents wear several hats. Eva Murray, 53, a writer, is also an emergency medical technician, the registrar of voters and the operator of the recycling center. In summer, she runs a bakery out of her house.\u201cAll of those things that people expect to be handled by a big agency \u2014 whether the phone company or solid waste \u2014 it\u2019s us,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no \u2018they.\u2019 \u201dFor the ever-fewer year-round island residents, though, these are not hardships, just life as it is.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful place to live \u2014 and I\u2019m glad not everyone wants to live here,\u201d said Ms. Tarkleson, the postmaster, who said she and her husband love winter sports and spend much of their time outdoors.If an emergency arises, she said, \u201cthe first thing we do is look at the sky and ask ourselves: Is it flyable?\u201d If a plane cannot land, she said, you either find a fast lobster boat or just \u201chunker down.\u201dMs. Daley has been the Sunbeam\u2019s nurse for 17 years, and has built up relationships with many of the islanders.She makes home visits on the islands and sees patients for routine procedures like flu shots. Using specialized equipment, she also conducts telemedicine sessions from the boat with doctors from the mainland, tackling physical ailments and mental health issues, including depression, addiction and even marriage counseling.Douglas Cornman, another Sunbeam crew member, is the boat\u2019s director of island outreach and its chaplain. He tries to combat the islanders\u2019 feelings of isolation, publishing an anthology of their creative writing, counseling island students on the transition to mainland high schools, and officiating at weddings and funerals. Last summer, he presided over a renewal-of-vows ceremony for Kim and Gary Peabody, held on the deck of the Sunbeam at sunset.Despite a tendency of visitors to romanticize island life, year-round residents reject any suggestion that it is simple.\u201cAnyone who thinks it\u2019s simple is delusional,\u201d said Natalie Ames, 48, who grew up on Matinicus. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the part to fix your kitchen sink, you don\u2019t have the part. There\u2019s an ocean between you and the mainland, and you have to plan ahead.\u201dMs. Ames moved off the island when one of her children needed continuing medical care. But her partner still lobsters on Matinicus, and she said she was eager to rejoin him.\u201cI\u2019m part of the island,\u201d she said. \u201cIt pulls me back again and again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The prices were different. So were the outcomes. Amazon and Walmart are battling to dominate the grocery market, fueling a price war that could rearrange where America shops for food.While the 365 line of stores was launched before Amazon\u2019s acquisition, the vibe of the new Brooklyn store seems in keeping with Amazon\u2019s consumer-first approach. The store is easy to navigate and pushes its private-label, and less expensive, 365 brand products. Wherever possible, we bought 365 brand items, including steak, hamburger, salt, pepper and olive oil. Many of the items were organic, and the eggs came from cage-free chickens. That helped drive up the prices. The grand total: $45.17Next, we went to the Walmart Supercenter in Secaucus, N.J., and bought almost entirely from Walmart\u2019s Great Value brand, which offers few organic options.That bill came to $27.18One ingredient that drove that difference: Whole Foods\u2019 organic shredded Cheddar cost nearly three times as much as the Walmart brand, which was not organic. The price of a dozen eggs at the two stores was comparable.For the highly unscientific taste test, we served the meatballs in the New York Times newsroom on Friday afternoon. The taste testers were not told whether they had chosen a Whole Foods or a Walmart meatball until after they voted.Some said the Whole Foods batch had too much bacon flavor. Others found the steak bits in the Walmart meatballs too chewy. When the votes were tallied, the Whole Foods meatball prevailed.But by the end of the day, the distinctions seemed to fade.

Employment at technology firms has grown three times faster in New York City than in the rest of the private sector, adding more than 50,000 jobs since the end of the recession in 2010, according to a report by the state comptroller.\u201cThe modern tech sector began on the West Coast when it was about developing new technology and programming,\u201d said Scott Rechler, chairman of RXR Realty, a Google landlord at Pier 57, a new mixed-use space on the Hudson River that is scheduled to open this year. \u201cIt\u2019s now about the implementation and application of technology. And that\u2019s presented an opportunity for New York, the business capital of the world. The talent pool is here.\u201dNeither side has made clear what Google\u2019s plans for the building are, and whether the popular food market will stay in place. But getting rid of tenants with leases would be a long-term process.At the end of 2017, tech firms accounted for 29.3 million, or 8 percent, of the 398 million square feet of office space in New York City, according to CBRE, a real estate company. In a snapshot of recent tech-sector activity, those companies have leased or renewed leases for 21 million square feet of office space in the last 10 years alone. If telecom companies are included, that number jumps to 26.8 million.Nine years ago, tech firms had only 17.6 million square feet of office space, or 5 percent of the office market.The tech firms generally prefer industrial spaces to the brass and glass towers of Midtown. Chelsea Market, where Google already leases 400,000 square feet of space, is a former factory building with expansive floors.Amazon has taken office space in what was once a warehouse at 450 West 33rd Street, although the owner, Brookfield, recently gave the building a face-lift and glass walls.Facebook has grown substantially at 770 Broadway, a landmark cast-iron building that was once a department store, on an entire block bounded by Eighth and Ninth Streets, between Broadway and Lafayette Street.But that trend may be changing, said Mary Ann Tighe, a broker and chief executive of CBRE in the New York region. When companies grow and need a more robust infrastructure, she said, some tech firms are migrating to traditional office towers.Salesforce, the cloud computing company based in San Francisco, moved its three Manhattan offices into a 41-story skyscraper at 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue. The Salesforce logo replaced the MetLife branding atop the building.And Spotify, the music streaming company, is moving from 620 Sixth Avenue and several other locations into nearly half-a-million square feet at the 4 World Trade Center skyscraper in Lower Manhattan.But it was Google that prompted real estate brokers, landlords, city officials and economists to sit up and take notice of the burgeoning tech sector a decade ago.In 2006, the company moved into 111 Eighth Avenue, a massive onetime shipping terminal, with tenants that included Verizon, Sprint, Web MD and BarnesandNoble.com. The building sat atop a high-powered fiber artery snaking along Manhattan\u2019s West Side. Employees used Razor scooters to navigate the blocklong corridors lined with work spaces, commissaries with free drinks and granola, and massage and game rooms.Google became a siren for other, smaller tech firms to move to the neighborhood, which was beginning to shrug off its industrial roots.In 2010, Google bought the building, also from Jamestown, for $1.8 billion, a breathtaking sum at the time. Not so long ago, blue-collar tenants had paid a very modest $6 per square foot for space there.But Google\u2019s need for space continues unabated. The company has been unable to dislodge the other tenants at 111 Eighth Avenue as quickly as it had hoped. The company has leased large blocks of space nearby, at Pier 57; at 85 10th Avenue, another former Nabisco cookie factory, between 15th and 16th Streets; and at Chelsea Market.Facebook has about 5,000 employees now in the Chelsea neighborhood, occupying a total of 900,000 square feet.Owning Chelsea Market would enable the company to create a campus akin to its headquarters in California, albeit one that is more vertical. Chelsea Market, like 111 Eighth, has been a front-runner in the evolution of the Chelsea neighborhood from an industrial zone to an area known for inexpensive space for food producers, restaurants and office tenants, and now as a tech-sector hub.An earlier version of a chart with this article misstated the number of tech workers in San Francisco in 2013. It was 79,000, not 7,900.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Connections: 50 Teenagers Suggest Creative Ways to Link Classic Texts to the World Today", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContestsSome texts came up so often that, if you\u2019re a teacher currently working with any of them, you could do worse than to search this post to find the many and varied ways students see their resonance. \u201cBrave New World,\u201d \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d \u201cThe Prince,\u201d \u201c1984,\u201d \"Othello\u201d and \u201cMacbeth\u201d are in that category.Certain issues in the news also appeared in all kinds of contexts. The #MeToo movement reminded students of literature like \u201cJane Eyre\u201d and \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d but one student also thought Newton\u2019s first two laws of motion applied, while another saw an analogy to the rock cycle in geology. Participants discovered that fake news is old news, with clear parallels in the plots of \u201cThe Crucible\u201d and \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d President Trump was compared to literary characters including Macbeth and Grendel, and his policies were invoked in examining topics as varied as \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d and the Indian Removal Act.Below, in alphabetical order, is a list of winners, runners-up and honorable mentions, including full essays by our top eight winners. All told, the list represents the work of 50 students, more than we usually call out in our contests. But not only were there simply that many ideas we wanted to honor, we also think the variety and originality of the choices speak for themselves: Any future student who wonders what school-assigned reading has to do with \u201cthe real world\u201d only has to look at this list to see how easy it is to answer that question.Is it really possible to control how people think? Today we are inundated with media from the moment we wake up: images, text messages, news stories. In school, students read articles, novels, and textbooks. If we took all of these stimulants away, would we still be able to think for ourselves, or would we lose the motivation to do so?This theme is one at the forefront of Ray Bradbury\u2019s novel, \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d which I recently read for my Literature class. The story examines a dystopian society where books have been banned completely. The average people in this story seem to lack emotional complexity; they have no desire to read because they have been taught that books made people upset. In the novel, there are a few people who question the status quo, but the majority of people live in a state of blissful ignorance.Though the novel is meant to depict a contemporary society that Bradbury could not have predicted, there are elements of its narrative that are uncannily similar to our world. Specifically, the mindset of our leaders. Following the mandate from the president disallowing the use of seven scientific words by the CDC in budget documents, I read an article in the New York Times called \u201cThought Control, Trump-Style\u201d published on December 18, 2017. The Trump administration has almost completely erased any trace of the LGBT+ community on government websites and banned the phrase \u201cclimate change\u201d from use by the Department of Agriculture. This virus has infected so many establishments that its ban on seven words in budget documents pales in comparison.Why are our leaders seeking to control the media we consume? Even the controversy of \u201cfake news\u201d is an attempt to restrict the press we see to only one side of the story. Our government has become a Mind Flayer of sorts: it sees itself as a superior race of thinkers and feels a need to dominate other beings to the point of mind control. This evil and fantastical government is what Ray Bradbury was trying to warn against in his novel. Complacency only breeds complacency. Congress will surely be more effective in passing legislation that Republicans are in favor of if the only news consumed by the American public leans to the far right, but what good does it do us as a society to all agree?American democracy is predicated on freedom of speech and the desire to seek knowledge. The very idea of precluding this information is a threat to our republic. It is scary to think that Bradbury saw signs of today\u2019s society almost seventy years ago. Perhaps even scarier is how many people in today\u2019s society have failed to become Guy Montags. It would be difficult to find someone who does not agree with the dangers presented in this book, but, unfortunately, it is not hard to find someone who agrees with the thought control of America\u2019s own Mind Flayer.If complacency breeds complacency, will deliberate minds produce deliberate actions?Stauffer\u2019s story begins her freshman year of college, when she remembers this paralyzing fear. She recalls going from a confident student; optimistic about the year, to a terrified, voiceless wreck. Her high school education had prepared her for the coursework but not the reality her actions impacted her future, and could possibly mean failure. Stauffer became so petrified that she stopped eating and participating in classes, dropped courses, lost weight, and eventually dropped out of college altogether. She\u2019d failed, and her worst fear had become a reality.Yet, somehow this wasn\u2019t as crushing as she thought it would be. Stauffer moved home, and inadvertently started seeking out education the same way Thoreau did: through experience. She found that the hands on experience of ballet and yoga studios and a nonprofit organization furthered her education more than any college course ever could. Eventually Stauffer found a way to finish her degree at the New School, a collection of universities that offered credit for real-life experience instead of academic courses. She went from the lowest point in her life to one of the highest, and all she had to do was fail.The moral is clear: there are gaps in our education system, and because of these gaps students aren\u2019t adequately prepared for their own futures. In his book Walden, Thoreau elaborates on the ideas Stauffer touches on in her article. As stated before, he believed learning through experience was exponentially better than a in classroom. When a rigid curriculum with expectations is set in place, students aren\u2019t given the same hands on learning as they would be without one. Just as Stauffer embraced this learning style in the New School, Thoreau did so in Walden Woods. For that is all Walden really is; Thoreau learning from nature by immersing himself in it, instead of seeing it on the pages of a book. A quote from Walden most fitting is as follows, \u201cWe boast of our system of education, but why stop at schoolmasters and schoolhouses? We are all schoolmasters, and our schoolhouse is the universe\u201d (Walden 10/15/1859.)Most of the literature I have explored in my English classes have been novels and plays with sophisticated language and complex storylines, but this semester we read an eye-opening essay about racism\u2013 \u201cWhite Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\u201d by Peggy McIntosh\u2013which finally made me realize that what my teachers say is true: the things we read and discuss do apply to the real world.I read Charles Blow\u2019s editorials regularly. The effect of his words is sharp and impactful. When I came across \u201cChecking My Male Privilege\u201d after the deluge of sexual harassment accusations came out in Hollywood and Washington, the connection was obvious.In \u201cUnpacking the Invisible Knapsack,\u201d McIntosh emphasizes how in our society, white privilege is so lethal because its beneficiaries are \u201ccarefully taught not to recognize [it].\u201d How can racism be eradicated if the people with advantages don\u2019t even know they have them? Unless white people recognize all the ways our quality of life can be so much higher simply because of the color of our skin, we will forever have this invisible pack full of assets and protections secured tightly on our backs.If we apply the same logic McIntosh uses in her essay to our discussions about sexual harassment in America, it\u2019s easy to see that most men are also conditioned to evade any blame whatsoever for the injustices so many women face. Just like the white people who attribute their success to their own merit and turn a blind eye to their privileges, the men who focus on the \u201cgood guys\u201d who don\u2019t grope or whistle or slap are choosing to overlook the privilege of physical dominance. It seems simple, but men can enjoy the luxury of knowing that a vast majority of the time, women don\u2019t have the physical superiority to victimize or overpower men for unwanted sexual behavior.In cases of both sexism and racism, privileges hurt both those without and with the privileges. White people might not condone racism, but their blindness to privilege leads them to believe that racism may not be as bad as the underprivileged make it seem. As Blow writes, it\u2019s extremely difficult to understand how bad something is if you never experience it firsthand, and so listening to people with fewer privileges is one of the best tools we can use to evaluate the state of discrimination black people and women are immersed in.Beneath the shimmery surface of American ideals, from John Winthrop\u2019s iconic imagery of the country as a \u201ccity upon a hill\u201d to the twentieth century metaphor of a \u201cmelting pot\u201d accepting all cultures, nationalities, and ethnicities, recent events reveal the underlying racism of a nation claiming to be \u201cpost-racial.\u201d In George Yancy\u2019s \u201cWill America Choose King\u2019s Dream or Trump\u2019s Nightmare?\u201d the professor illustrates how Trump\u2019s offensive and racist statements pertaining to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations highlight America\u2019s deceptive fa\u00e7ade as a beacon for civil liberty. A classic piece of American literature, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald unveils the flaws of high society during the Roaring Twenties, a period of both economic prosperity and unrivaled income inequality, through the narration of Nick Carraway. Reflecting current news, \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d showcases how harsh reality is often hidden under a superficial exterior.After moving to Long Island, Carraway optimistically believes in the American dream of working hard to be rewarded and achieve upward mobility. However, his encounters reveal the faults of the rich whose lifestyles and wealth are so widely admired. Tom Buchanan, a Yale graduate from a prominent family, has more than enough wealth to transport his polo ponies across the country while owning an elaborate mansion framed by French windows and half an acre of fresh roses. Despite Buchanan\u2019s dignified appearance and prestige, Carraway uncovers the truth of his racism, domestic violence, and immorality. At his own dinner party, Buchanan recommends a book claiming the importance of the dominance of the white race. That same night, a woman reveals his infidelity and the fact that everyone in town is aware of it. Not only is the man unabashedly unfaithful, but he frequently leaves bruises on his wife and breaks his mistress\u2019s nose during a disagreement. Meanwhile, the vanity of his wife and mistress is undeniable since Buchanan\u2019s exuberant wealth was the subject of their attraction. The sole genuinely magnanimous rich character, Jay Gatsby, is delusional and dependent on illegal means to maintain his lavish lifestyle.Although written nearly a century later, Yancy\u2019s op-ed examines the same theme of reality contradicting American ideals. Ever since the Declaration of Independence affirmed equality for all men and the United States emerged as the land of liberty, the nation claimed to be a republic of moral justice and equality. Yet on January 11, President Donald J. Trump revealed the contradictory truth when he made a racist and derogatory statement condemning immigrants from several nonwhite countries. The representative of the United States allegedly using \u201cshithole\u201d to describe the homelands of foreign immigrants is contemptuous and clearly inconsistent with America\u2019s image of acceptance and tolerance.In \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d Fitzgerald warns readers against accepting society at face value, a lesson that Yancy emphasizes as well. To learn from the misplaced optimism of Nick Carraway, Americans today must remain unaffected by the country\u2019s idealistic rhetoric of freedom and equality to speak out against our president\u2019s bigotry, rather than silently accepting the unjust reality of racism.Mark Twain was friends with abolitionist Frederick Douglass, yet he permitted grotesque drawings of escaped slave Jim in \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d Twain was a benefactor for African American students, yet he depicted Jim as helpless and inferior in the \u201canti-slavery\u201d satire. Twain clearly had conflicting views regarding African Americans. In his New York Times op-ed, \u201cThe Other Inconvenient Truth,\u201d author Charles Blow states, \u201cJust because one abhors violence and cruelty doesn\u2019t mean that one truly believes that all people are equal\u2026 Entertaining the notion of imbalance-that white people are inherently better than others in any way- is also white supremacy.\u201d Blow invents the term \u201csoft white supremacy\u201d to describe these beliefs. This concept offered me a way to navigate Twain\u2019s puzzling attitudes towards African Americans in Huck Finn.When reading Twain\u2019s classic with my AP English class, I was confused as to why the text wasn\u2019t resolutely anti-slavery. In the novel, protagonist Huck and Jim travel down the Mississippi to escape their lives in St. Petersburg, Missouri. It takes over 300 pages for Huck to realize Jim is a human being, and even then Huck infantilizes Jim by offering the grown man \u201chelp.\u201d In the book\u2019s last ten controversial chapters, Jim becomes subservient to Huck and Tom, refusing to stand up for himself even when made to complete ridiculous tasks. Jim\u2019s behavior in these chapters led me to suspect Twain believed slaves were too unintelligent and submissive to stand up to adolescents. Although Twain depicted Jim as a true human being, giving this book its \u201canti-slavery\u201d reputation, subtleties in Huck\u2019s and Jim\u2019s attitudes make me wonder if Twain \u201centertained notions of imbalance\u201d even though he didn\u2019t openly show it.Most importantly, Blow showed me that \u201csoft white supremacy\u201d still plagues our current times, most notably in the executive branch of our government. In 2011, Trump said President Obama needed to show his birth certificate to prove he was American-born. When announcing his Presidential candidacy, Trump stated Mexicans were drug dealers, criminals, and rapists. Trump said of the white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville that violence had taken place \u201con many sides.\u201d No, he didn\u2019t openly support the supremacists, but yes, he didn\u2019t really condemn them either. Recently, Trump called Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas,\u201d actively belittling her and Native Americans simultaneously.I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Blow speak on January 7th and his words continued to enlighten my understanding of white supremacy. Passive white supremacy, he said, is more deadly than open white supremacy because these feelings can increase exponentially when sparked. Those who turn a blind eye to hateful events are the ones who allow extremism to grow.I was disappointed that in the end of Twain\u2019s novel, Huck knows his Southern society has the wrong views about slavery yet he decides to turn his own blind eye. Huck\u2019s choice to escape to the West and ignore these issues on the final page is symbolic of the actions many in our country take today.It can be a terrifying thing to see decades of the pent-up rage of an oppressed person finally let out against their oppressor. This is the case in William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d when the Jewish moneylender Shylock brings his nemesis and lifelong tormentor, the Christian merchant Antonio, to court over an unpaid loan. The punishment, as agreed upon between the two men as a condition of the deal, is that Shylock may remove a pound of Antonio\u2019s flesh. But before Shylock exacts this cruel retribution, a friend of Antonio\u2019s makes a fascinating appeal in his favor. Portia claims that the true sign of strength is not the ability to take revenge, but to show mercy. Mercy, she says, \u201cblesseth him that gives, and him that takes \u2026 \u2018tis mightiest in the mightiest\u201d (Shakespeare IV.i.183-84). In June of 2017, half a millennium after Shakespeare\u2019s fictional court case, the Louisiana state legislature seemed to realize the same thing as Portia when they passed a series of unexpected but widespread criminal justice reform laws which aim to dramatically reduce the prison population and lower recidivism rates. Both instances show that the ability to have mercy gives the person in power an unparalleled opportunity to do good, and ultimately, to benefit themselves.At its surface, the Louisiana reform package could appear purely as an act of mercy: an attempt to help those who have fallen victim to the state\u2019s brutal justice system. On some level, this is all it is; surely there were legislators for whom this was their sole motivation. But whether intended or not, Louisiana stands to receive enormous gains from this package \u2013 it truly is \u201ctwice blest.\u201d As well as expanded parole and prison alternatives, which aim to help those convicted, the state expects to see an improvement in public safety and save over $180 million. The monetary benefits from this merciful outreach will help the state in ways that would never be thought of as connected to improving an inmate\u2019s life.However, conservative politicians, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, fail to see this link. They maintain that the best way to keep law and order among their constituents is to wield their power like a sword, striking down any who violate that peace. But Portia reminds us that mercy is what makes a ruler truly powerful; she calls it \u201can attribute to God himself\u201d (Shakespeare IV.i.190). Sessions and others must reject this easy show of power by way of force and cruelty in the justice system, choosing instead a path that will benefit disadvantaged citizens and show the people that they are worthy of the power we grant them. In this time of political distrust, the American people could use an indication that our politicians are capable of the \u201cawe and majesty\u201d that Portia speaks of (Shakespeare IV.i.186). I am certain that if they chose to show mercy, we would know beyond a doubt that they are worthy of leading us.I stumble upon a New York Times article, \u201cJudge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees,\u201d that makes me wonder if Hawthorne, the literary genius, is wrong.The article explains a recent case in which a judge, James Robart, lifted a Trump administration ban after hearing a compelling argument that Muslim refugees struggle to reunite with family members who have already legally settled in the U.S. due to discriminatory policies of the U.S. refugee program. Governmental lawyers counter-argued that the ban was necessary because it was in interests of national security.I sit at the breakfast table wondering if xenophobia was always that pronounced in the United States. It appears to me that xenophobia underlined the governmental lawyers\u2019 arguments; an attorney called the ban \u201creasonable and appropriate.\u201d I do not understand how a ban that targets certain groups, specifically Muslims, can be \u201creasonable.\u201d I ask my father, who grew up in an Italian immigrant household if he recalls facing immense oppression. He says no. I often hear people casually declaring that Muslims should not be allowed in the U.S. because they will bomb our cities. When did Muslim refugees become synonymous with terrorism? The answer: recently. How may you ask? The death of our shadows.Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d explores the concept of the shadow-self. The character Pearl is praised because she possesses no shadow. Hawthorne suggested that our world would be a better place if we did not have shadows, meaning our dark parts would be exposed to society. We live in Hawthorne\u2019s world, and it is not one of sublime beauty, rather it is one of chaos and disgust.With recent changes in administration, more people have become comfortable vocalizing xenophobic, along with homophobic, racist, and sexist, thoughts. It has become more common to witness politicians share their dark, most discriminatory, comments to gain support. Those thoughts are normalized, causing the death of our shadows.Shadows barricade impertinent comments and prevent xenophobia from manifesting itself into discriminatory policies like the ban seen in the New York Times article. Although Judge James Robart partially lifted the ban, part of it still exists, along with other similar policies. He\u2019s combating xenophobia, while others do little to eradicate discriminatory policies. By doing nothing, a shadow-less world exists. Perhaps if we had shadows, a ban would not exist to prevent Muslim families from reuniting. A Muslim father can watch his daughter blow out the candles on her birthday cake, and a Muslim mother can applaud when her son receives his high school diploma. But they can\u2019t.Hawthorne is wrong. His envisioned world has its perils. It allows xenophobia to persist, causing the unjust discrimination of certain groups like the Muslim refugees mentioned in the article \u201cJudge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees.\u201d We can live again in Hawthorne\u2019s imperfect world, where shadows exist, even finding it to be not so imperfect. A shadow can only exist with light; there is no light in a shadow-less world.In the New York Times article, \u201cCareers for Women in Technology Companies Are A Global Challenge,\u201d writer Alina Tugend discusses the similarities and differences for women around the world working in the tech field. Tech companies in the United States suffer from a male-dominated, \u201cbro\u201d culture that gives a cold shoulder to female coworkers. In other places, such as the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, the problem lies with class differences, leading to the alienation of middle-class and poor women. The article sums that, while the execution of these issues vary around the world, the underlying effect is still the same: women have a much harder time entering and remaining in the tech field.The lack of female representation in STEM is not new. While there are many factors that lead to this problem, the one with the deepest consequence is negative stereotypes planted at a young age.In psychology, we learned about the idea of stereotype threat: a phenomenon in which people are reminded of negative stereotypes of a group they belong to and hence perform on given tasks conforming to those stereotypes. In 1997, researcher Steven Spencer applied this idea to classrooms and discovered that equally intelligent women performed worse on a math exam than their male counterparts after being told that the test showed gender differences. This characterization evoked the negative stereotype of women\u2019s lack of math skills and led them to under-perform on the exam. In contrast, he found that if, before the test, participants were led to believe that both parties performed equally, women\u2019s scores were similar to the men\u2019s. Additional research post Spencer\u2019s experiment has further supported this idea, proving that negative stereotypes in gender as well as race and ethnicity reduces the performance of individuals.This institutionalized idea that women are not as capable of performing mathematical or technical tasks as well as men is deeply rooted in our culture, starting in elementary schools all the way to professional work settings. Learning about stereotype threat was eye-opening because it allowed me to see the deeper effects of the way we teach children about careers and how it differs in males and females. Dr. Spencer\u2019s experiment involved one math exam; however, the negative stereotypes about women\u2019s lack of technical skills are prevalent universally. The most corrosive part of this narrative is that men are lead to believe these same ideas, so in the future they are equally as unwelcoming of women, a disheartening reality reflected in our companies today.It is vital that we start debasing these myths and start encouraging women from young ages to be open about any career. Most importantly, we need to teach both men and women such values, so that men can also live in a world where the idea of women being empowered to work in any field is a standard, a world in which creativity and innovation need no gender classification._________ Whether heroes take the form of a mighty Anglo-Saxon warrior or a fierce Amazonian princess, the people who rise up to lead us out of the shadows of death are cultivated by the trials they face and the hope for a brighter future that we project upon them which are often rooted in the injustices we experience.A lot can be learned from the prisoners in the Stanford Prison Experiment. Despite the fact that they were innocent, not actual prisoners deserving of punishment, as the simulation progressed they increasingly accepted their abuse without protest. Of course while there are many factors contributing to the silence of sexual assault victims (social pressure, and the fear of losing their jobs among them), it is also true that many of these factors stem from the victim\u2019s powerless role, which is similar to the silence of the prisoners in Zimbardo\u2019s experiment. While the issue of sexual misconduct is complex and it is impossible to pinpoint any one cause, the findings of the SPE shed a startling light on the effect power has on both the victims and perpetrators of such a widespread epidemic.In the world we live in, fake news is becoming a threat to credibility. With the assistance of the Internet, no one can be completely sure what they are reading is accurate...During the Salem Witch trials in which The Crucible took place, news of witchcraft had spread like ivy. Accusations against Goody Proctor and Rebecca Nurse were the talk of the town not only in Salem, but also in neighboring towns. However, in the 1600\u2019s, people were not very educated and did not have much sense of the world; the majority of the townspeople of Salem and the neighboring towns believed everything they heard about witchcraft.Over the course of recent weeks, my AP World class has been conducting a mock trial to try Genghis Khan for being an uncivilized tyrant... As I did more research, not only for the trial but for a more personal understanding, I came across a New York Times article titled \u201cWhat Experts Know About Men Who Rape\u201d which went on to describe a study that took place to understand the science and psychology behind men that raped...Much like Genghis Khan, these men wanted power, especially if their sexual offenses were violent or aggressive. I believe that Genghis Khan was on a power trip and violated these poor innocent women to demean their societies and to show that he had enough power to do so.In the day and age of wealth, where consumerism is ubiquitous, it\u2019s become acceptable to compulsively fill desires through material gains, such as new clothes or electronics. After all, if we have the capability to harmlessly buy whatever we desire, then what\u2019s wrong with instant satisfaction?The problem is that we constantly reward ourselves, which in turn causes us to feel less grateful for items we receive. Just like the inhabitants of Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, we seek products to provide short bursts of satisfaction and often ignore more wholesome alternatives. Similar to the imaginary civilians in Brave New World, we are surrounded by consumables that are marketed for being quick: Amazon Prime, faster internet, minute-microwave rice, etc. Even subpar TV dinner can seem more attractive than a home cooked meal because of its immediate nature. However, better things come to those who wait.Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison\u2019s bildungsroman centered around an unnamed black protagonist (written to be symbolic of any black man), should not be relevant today. Ideally, Invisible Man should serve as a dated reminder of America\u2019s dark racial history; unfortunately, its underlying themes remain just as prevalent in today\u2019s world as they were when Ellison first released the novel 66 years ago. Charles M. Blow\u2019s Op-Ed \u201cA Rebel, a Warrior and a Race Fiend\u201d particularly highlights the similarities between the nameless protagonist\u2019s struggles and the deeply-embedded racism that still plagues modern America. Blow uses the racially-charged language of President Donald Trump towards black professional athletes to make a broader point about the \u201cracial inequities fused to the DNA of power in this country.\u201d The similarities drawn between Ellison\u2019s work, written in an overtly racist America, and Blow\u2019s contemporary opinion piece convey a depressing message regarding the glacial rate of social progress.Why is this [#MeToo] happening now? Why are all of these women all of a sudden sharing their stories? These questions seem to puzzle many, yet there is a simple answer: Newton\u2019s first two laws of motion can easily explain the growth of the #MeToo movement. Newton\u2019s first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force...While the initial force is debatable - whether it be President Trump\u2019s locker room talk, the growing women\u2019s rights movement, or simply women banding together against Harvey Weinstein - it is evident that a strong force had pushed this moment into action. The once silenced women now gained courage and support to speak up; this cause which was once at rest, is now in motion and will remain in motion.The unequal power dynamic that can exist between the oftentime male offender and female victim in these situations has been a pattern that has existed for generations, going as far back as Shakespearean times. This discussion of male power exerted over women plays out in Othello as we watch high-ranking, socially-influential men manipulate this power dynamic in their favor. As we see the mistakes of Venetian society, we remember our own as well.My junior year lit class focused on Shakespeare\u2019s Troilus and Cressida and the explicit objectification of women present throughout the play. The romance between idealistic Troilus and rational Cressida abruptly ends when Cressida is sold off forcefully to the enemy troop. In the fourth act however, the Greek soldiers welcome Cressida to the camp by doting her with compliments and kisses. The soldiers refer to her as \u201cmy fair lady\u201d and \u201csweet lady\u201d, neglecting the fact that they had ripped her out of her home and relationship against her will. This polite diction makes readers believe that Cressida is enjoying her time at the Greek camp, and we oversee the emotional torture she was forced to endure.Similar to Shakespeare\u2019s play, the reference to the sex slaves as \u201ccomfort women\u201d and \u201chalmonies\u201d impose a positive connotation on a subject that dare not be taken lightly, as we sometimes come to disregard the injustices these women endured.Considering that this play was written in the sixteenth century, during the Renaissance period, it is surprising and even baffling, that it is more relevant now than ever before. Today, everybody wants to be famous. Everyone wants to be noticed, loved and desired by everyone else. They want to raise eyebrows and swivel heads the moment they walk into a room and be important enough to make people stop chewing their food at the mention of their name.In Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play, Faustus\u2019 unbridled ambitions tragically lead to his downfall. After twenty-four years of enjoying all worldly pleasures, Lucifer along with his armada of devils drag Faustus into Hell for eternity as he cries out gut-wrenchingly.Sinking into pillows with a pair of fuzzy socks hugging my feet and the delicious aroma of cacao permeating the air, I lost myself in the world of \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Beyond the ball gowns and fancy cars, a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washed over me, and it wasn\u2019t due to the fact that I spent most of winter break in a similar position: curled up in bed, sipping hot chocolate. The real explanation was much less pleasant, as I realized that the same issues F. Scott Fitzgerald was commenting on in 1925 still exist today. We live in a society suffering from a severe lack of authenticity. There is no substance beneath our shiny exterior of purported principles. Maybe some of our historical documents provide a gilded barrier between what we say we represent and what we actually are. The article \u201cThe Heartbeat of Racism is Denial\u201d addresses this disparity between our stated beliefs and the reality of our condition.This poem describes a teacher who largely downplays the brutal and gruesome truths within history and even changes some history in order to protect the children\u2019s innocence. He describes the Ice Age as \u201cThe Chilly Age\u201d (3) and teaches that the \u201cEnola Gay dropped one tiny atom on Japan\u201d (12-13). This seems harmless and appears to keep the children happy and in a world of white picket fences, but the children in the poem are later on the playground \u201ctormenting the weak and the smart\u201d (15-16). The teacher\u2019s simplistic and inaccurate accounts of history is producing adverse effects on the children- information that is necessary for their educational growth and development has been kept from them, thus breeding ignorance, hatred, and violence.This same phenomenon is happening in current times as books are being banned from schools. This is a robbery of information, as most books that are banned include great lessons for children about the world and themselves.In Intuto, Peru, Amadeo Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda is the last man to speak the language of Taushiro, a language dating back centuries from the jungles of the Amazon. He hasn\u2019t had anyone to speak the language with, and it is highly likely that the language and culture will die with him. The last person Amadeo has spoken with in his native language was his brother, Juan, who died, along with his parents and others in his village, due to diseases such as malaria. Now that he is the last one, there is pressure on Amadeo to retain his culture and language....Learning a foreign language and learning the culture of another country will always have tremendous benefit, in all aspects of life and careers. We should never force someone to be in the position Amadeo is now in; we should work to maintain cultural diversity in order to benefit society and future generations.At the end of stories with important messages, there is a silence that speaks. Danish writer Karen Blixen\u2019s short story, The Blank Page, teaches this profound lesson. An old woman relays the advice her grandmother gave when teaching how to tell stories, \u201cWhere the storyteller is loyal...there, in the end, silence will speak.\u201d ...While in this tale the reluctance to represent every story comes from a place of shame, there are numerous reasons why some stories don\u2019t get told.These days, with access to thousands of news stories at any given moment, people have a nearly endless choice of what narratives to follow. In Nicholas Kristof\u2019s article My Worst Columns he writes about his least \u201cclicked on\u201d pieces for the New York Times website. All of his \u201cworst columns\u201d feature stories of injustice or of situations needing humanitarian attention. These are stories with a silence that speaks, but not that many people have ever read them....When Americans avoid reading stories that place, as Kristof puts it, \u201c...a spotlight on injustice or humanitarian need,\u201d they never get the silence that speaks, and choose instead brash, superficial noise. This is the narrative of 2017 America which focuses on the distracting, at-home crisis of Trump and disregards issues of worldly injustice.Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen 2000% in 2017; the newfound attention associated with this rise has brought record traffic levels to many cryptocurrency exchanges, many of them buckling under the pressure of thousands of market orders during highly volatile periods of trading. This meteoric and unsustainable rise has drawn many comparisons to famous speculative bubbles throughout history, but the most commonly referenced is the Tulip Mania experienced in 17th century Holland....While the comparison between Tulip Mania and Bitcoin may seem reasonable at first, given the unprecedented rise in bitcoin price combined with the hyper-speculative nature of Bitcoin itself, what sets bitcoin apart from the Tulip Bubble is its utility and widespread distribution. Unlike a Tulip a Bitcoin can be fractionalized, making it accessible to common folk even as the price increases. It can also be traded throughout the globe near-instantaneously using the blockchain, an incorruptible cloud based ledger system that records transactions in real time, all while continuously analyzing itself for errors...The comparison between Bitcoin and Tulip Mania is overblown and irresponsible for the press to be touting as it is a poor comparison to the history behind Tulip Mania.A recent opinion editorial piece titled \u201cMueller\u2019s Facts and Trump\u2019s Make-Believe\u201d discusses Donald Trump\u2019s contempt for the truth, especially in regards to maintaining his power, and how other political figures are influenced by his words and actions. This piece was written by Roger Cohen, published on December 5, 2017, and gives a general synopsis of the current state of Trump\u2019s presidency. However, it conveys the leader of the United States as a delusional, lying, and power driven similar to how Shakespeare conveyed Macbeth in his 17th century drama, Macbeth. The only difference between Cohen\u2019s portrayal of Trump and Shakespeare\u2019s portrayal of Macbeth is, Macbeth is a fictional character while Trump is actually the President of the United States.The motivations behind the Chinese Exclusion Act and President Trump\u2019s executive order are shockingly similar. Both were designed to limit the immigration of one particular ethnic group so those immigrants did not take jobs from the American population. But unlike the Chinese Exclusion Act, the president\u2019s executive order faced harsh criticism and was challenged in court on several occasions. It was repealed and replaced with another, less harsh version based on similar principles, which has again been challenged several times in court, eventually making its way up to the Supreme Court .Despite similarities between the two laws, the American people have learned a lot in the last 136 years. We\u2019ve learned that immigration doesn\u2019t hurt the economy - it might even help it. We\u2019ve learned that, true to American beliefs, the color of a person\u2019s skin or the religion they practice does not matter. In a time when increasing diversity and the equality of all people under the law is considered a good thing, Americans are unafraid to speak out for what they believe in and against what they don\u2019t.__________________Thank you, as always, to the teachers and students who took the time to participate.

{"Headline": "Russians Bought Bank Accounts From California Man, Mueller Says", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a lucrative business. For several years, Richard Pinedo, a Southern California computer science major, would open bank accounts in his name and sell them online to shadowy purchasers for cash. In other cases, he served as a middle man, buying accounts in other people\u2019s names and flipping them on the internet.The operation was illegal, \u201cdesigned to circumvent the security features of large online digital payment companies,\u201d according to court papers. The company Mr. Pinedo set up, Auction Essistance, brought in tens of thousands of dollars between 2014 and December 2017.Some of that business, it now appears, was done with a Russian operation that used social media platforms to sow political discord around the 2016 presidential election.The connection was apparently unwitting. Mr. Pinedo\u2019s lawyer, Jeremy I. Lessem, said in an interview that Mr. Pinedo had no knowledge of his clients\u2019 identities or motivations and \u201caccepted full responsibility\u201d for his actions. Mr. Pinedo had no connection to Mr. Trump, his company or his campaign, the lawyer said.\u201cTo the extent that Mr. Pinedo\u2019s actions assisted any individuals, including foreign nationals, with interfering in the American presidential election, it was done completely without his knowledge or understanding,\u201d Mr. Lessem said.In a rare statement, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, backed up that assessment. He said that prosecutors had \u201cno evidence and there is no allegation he was a witting participant in the Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. elections and political processes.\u201dA knock at the ranch-style home where Mr. Pinedo lives in suburban Santa Paula went unanswered on Friday.According to prosecutors, Mr. Pinedo obtained thousands of bank account numbers by registering accounts in his own name or buying them in the names of others online.Many of the accounts used stolen American identities, the authorities said. Though Mr. Pinedo \u201cwas not directly involved in the registration of these accounts using stolen identities,\u201d they wrote, \u201che willfully and intentionally avoided learning about the use of stolen identities.\u201dAnd though he did not know the precise identity of his Russian clients, Mr. Pinedo \u201cfrequently\u201d bought and sold account numbers with people he knew were outside the United States, the prosecutors said.Several of those account numbers were ultimately sold to Russians involved in the election influence operation, the documents show. They were used by the Russians to open PayPal accounts and allowed the Russians to get around company security measures meant to verify the identity of account holders.The PayPal accounts were then used to make purchases, including on social media accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based operation at the center of the Russian disinformation campaign. In total, the Russians obtained and used 14 bank account numbers between June 2016 and March 2017. It is unclear how many were purchased from Mr. Pinedo.\u201cSome PayPal accounts were used to purchase advertisements on Facebook\u201d promoting fake social media accounts created by the Russians, the papers said.Their goal, as has now been well documented, was to sow discord in the American political process. And it included efforts designed to aid the presidential candidacy of Donald J. Trump and hurt that of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\u201cWe offer services that will enable you to get back onto eBay or Amazon ranging from pre-made eBay & Paypal accounts or verification tools,\u201d the site said. \u201cWe guarantee our accounts are legitimate and not hacked or stolen like most other sellers offer.\u201dAt the time he was running Auction Essistance, Mr. Pinedo also appears to have been working as a marketing director of SEO Distortion, a digital marketing company, according to a LinkedIn page bearing his name that was taken down late Friday. According to that profile, Mr. Pinedo received an associate degree in computer science from Ventura College in 2009.\u201cRicky Pinedo is not your typical person who has a love for technology or is computer crazed,\u201d it reads. \u201cHis ever-changing need for more advanced challenges and goals had spawned the beginning of starting a company that hones in on bringing businesses to the world wide web.\u201dLouis Keene contributed reporting from Santa Paula, Calif.

{"Headline": "The Many Meanings of Black Panther\u2019s Mask", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChadwick Boseman, who plays Black Panther in the film, had already witnessed said crossover, he said in the same interview: \u201cI\u2019ve seen little white kids dressed up as T\u2019Challa. I\u2019ve seen pictures, and I\u2019ve seen it in person.\u201dBlack Panther costumes \u2014 whether the character\u2019s full raiment or just his claws and mask \u2014 are on toy store shelves (and, of course, on Amazon) in anticipation of the film\u2019s Feb. 16 release. At best, the character get-ups speak to the enthusiastic embrace of a black superhero. At worst, they could be perceived as an unwitting form of cultural appropriation, which has in recent years become a subject of freighted discourse.What does that dual significance mean for children? And, perhaps more urgently, what does it mean for the parents who will buy the costumes for them?\u201cAs parents, or even as the people creating costumes, we need to be very aware of what that says,\u201d said Brigitte Vittrup, an associate professor of early childhood development and education at Texas Woman\u2019s University. \u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of black superheroes, so this is a really important thing, especially for black kids growing up.\u201dMany parents are split on how Black Panther\u2019s blackness should figure into their children\u2019s relationship to the character. Some argue that placing racial boundaries around expressions of fandom is unnecessary.\u201cI\u2019m actually wondering now what it might be like for that parent who\u2019s not of color if his kid comes home and says, \u2018I want to dress up like Black Panther,\u2019\u201d said Katrina Jones, 39, the director of human resources at Vimeo. \u201cWhen I look at it, I see no reason why a kid who\u2019s not black can\u2019t dress like Black Panther. Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201dMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201dConsequently, some parents have felt pressure to hammer home Black Panther\u2019s heroism through the lens of race.\u201cI\u2019m conflicted,\u201d said Evan Narcisse, a senior writer for the website io9. He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism. And it\u2019s like, \u2018Can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that. By not mentioning it, by not talking about it, we\u2019re essentially preserving the status quo.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bringing a Personal Touch to Plus-Size Fashion", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurship\u201cI hadn\u2019t intended for retailing to be a career choice,\u201d Ms. Boujarwah said. \u201cBut when I was in business school, I realized that my formative experiences were shared with millions of women. It was a call to arms for me. This was a problem for many women that I could play a role in.\u201dThe scarcity of larger sizes stems from a deeply rooted stigma in the fashion industry \u2014 many designers either ignore or reject requests to offer their styles above a certain size. There are also manufacturing complications: Progressing from size 2 to 12 can be a simple matter of scale, but larger sizes often require a separate pattern to account for different proportions and entail more fabric, raising the production cost.\u201cWe\u2019re getting bigger, but the business hasn\u2019t gotten bigger,\u201d Marshal Cohen, a retail industry analyst at the NPD Group, said.\u201cWhile Walmart and Amazon could be formidable competitors, this customer wants a company that understands her, and isn\u2019t just selling to everyone,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\u201cWe became interested in apparel because of the size of the market and the need,\u201d Ms. Hunsicker said.In the Gwynnie Bee model, women who wear sizes 10 to 32 receive regular shipments of clothing. Once it\u2019s worn, no laundering is required; clients simply return the options to the company for a fresh selection. If the customer loves an item, she can buy it, Ms. Hunsicker said.In contrast, Eloquii is a reincarnation rather than a start-up. The company was originally a brick-and-mortar retailer owned by the Limited, which, despite protests from a loyal customer base, shut down the brand in 2013, Ms. Chase said.The founder and chairman, John Auerbach, who has held a number of e-commerce positions, bought Eloquii\u2019s assets from Sun Capital in 2013, including intellectual property and the customer list. Ms. Chase joined the same year. The company has already been through two rounds of venture capital financing, and now has backing of close to $40 million, Ms. Chase said.Most of these businesses are focused on online customers, but some are experimenting with physical stores. Eloquii has opened three, in Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; and Washington. Two of them are pop-ups.Most physical stores with plus-size apparel do not \u201coffer a great experience,\u201d Ms. Chase said, so Eloquii is focusing on fitting-room aesthetics and other amenitiesGwynnie Bee had a pop-up store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan that \u201cwent really well,\u201d Ms. Hunsicker said, adding that her company is trying to determine what role a store plays in its business model.A bigger challenge for the companies is finding inventory. Designers have become more accommodating, spurred both by an untapped market and the desire to appear inclusive. But entrepreneurs are not waiting for manufacturers to make the first move.New York Fashion Week, which officially began Thursday, offers an opportunity for these entrepreneurs to get noticed. Dia took out a full-page ad in The New York Times during New York Fashion Week last February, encouraging designers to look anew at the market with the line \u201cFashion she can\u2019t wear is becoming a bit unfashionable.\u201d The gamble paid off: Ms. Boujarwah said the ad had led to two new lines, one with Ms. Wilson, the actress, and the other with the designer Nanette Lepore.Entrepreneurs are learning to be more flexible, too. For instance, Gwynnie Bee will add smaller sizes to its lineup after determining that designers would be more willing to work with it if it offered a wider range. The site, Ms. Hunsicker said, will include only items that are available in all sizes.Yet fabrication remains a hurdle for some. As a result, founders like Ms. Boujarwah of Dia, which counts Sequoia Capital among its investors, are designing their own products. Similarly, Ms. Hunsicker said Gwynnie Bee had, \u201cfor a number of vendors, taken on a lot of pattern design,\u201d in addition to offering the site\u2019s private label clothing.\u201cIt\u2019s their aesthetic and vision, and we\u2019re helping to make it fit,\u201d she said.\u201cWe were adamant about building a luxury brand and bringing the best designers we could, including Michael Kors, Zac Posen, Badgley Mischka, Monique Lhuillier and Prabal Gurung,\u201d Ms. Retzer said.Most of the companies do not yet offer intimate apparel, although Eloquii plans to offer lingerie in the future. To reach that market, Deborah A. Christel, a co-author of the study on women\u2019s sizes, left her position as an assistant professor at Washington State University to start a company that would encompass all sizes for lingerie.Ms. Christel said her company, Kade & Vos, would begin selling next summer. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that one day, women\u2019s clothes will just be women\u2019s without referring to plus size,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

From 2008 through 2012, Tucker\u2019s companies extended approximately five million loans to customers across the country, while generating more than $2 billion in revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. Most of this money flowed through accounts that Tucker maintained at the Bank.USB employees responsible for servicing Tucker\u2019s ongoing account activity disregarded numerous red flags that Tucker was using the tribes to conceal his ownership of the accounts. For example, Tucker spent large sums of monies from accounts in the names of Tribal Companies on personal items, including tens of millions of dollars on a vacation home in Aspen and on Tucker\u2019s professional Ferrari racing team.U.S. Bancorp said on Thursday that it had put in place measure to improve its anti-money laundering controls.

The cause? Fears the economy was heating up, which would lead to a pickup in inflation and Federal Reserve raising rates faster than anticipated.But in the week since the S.&P. 500 has stage a comeback. The index is up 7.6 percent and on pace for best week since 2014, according to Bloomberg. In fact, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 2 percent the past two days despite the latest inflation data coming in much higher than expected.So what happened to those concerns about inflation? One explanation for why stock investors shrugged off the inflation data was a very weak report on retail sales. Investors seemed to take that as evidence the economy is not overheating and that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a very slow pace.Two weeks ago when the sell-off started, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow forecast for first-quarter G.D.P. fell to 3.25 percent from 5.4 percent two weeks ago.\u201cWhile it does appear that inflation is accelerating, it appears much less likely that the economy is really taking off and forcing the Fed into a more aggressive rate hiking cycle,\u201d write the strategists over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The bigger pictureA rising rate environment is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks. Jodie Gunzberg, the head of United States equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, points out that since 1971 the S&P 500:ProPublica\u2019s article centers on the bureau\u2019s handling of investigations into Wells Fargo. It reports that Mr. Mulvaney ordered restrictions on the accessing of personal data of Wells Fargo customers, a move that hampered the bureau\u2019s investigations. An exemption on the freeze was later granted to enforcement staff looking into Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance business. But ProPublica added:Mulvaney\u2019s order has had effects beyond enforcement, hampering the bureau\u2019s efforts to monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer protection rules and conduct research on financial products, according to several staffers. The freeze has even stymied state attorneys general, according to two C.F.P.B. staffers and one attorney for a state office.The tax overhaul requires funds to hold onto investments for three years to qualify for the lower rate. They\u2019ve been getting around it by creating single-member LLCs in Delaware to receive carried interest payouts.More from Miles Weiss of Bloomberg:Four LLCs have been created under the name of Elliott Management Corp., the hedge-fund giant run by Paul Singer. More than 70 have been established under the names of executives at Starwood Capital Group Management, the private-equity shop headed by Barry Sternlicht.The headline reason is his belief that Silicon Valley is too intolerant of conservatives and libertarians. But there\u2019s an interesting second reason in the article (emphasis added):The WSJ reports that Mr. Thiel will spend at least a bit more time working on a non-tech endeavor: a right-leaning media organization. He will still be involved in Founders Fund, the V.C. firm he co-founded, as well as stay on the boards of Facebook, the data consultancy Palantir and other tech companies.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cMy goal is to make it so the next generation grows up in a world where cancer is managed just like the common cold, and the body\u2019s natural regenerative engine remains empowered throughout our lives,\u201d said Dr. Hariri.Celgene, United Therapeutics, Sorrento Therapeutics, Human Longevity, the Dreyfus Family Office and Section 32 took part in the series-A funding.In other health care deal newsWhy? The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation report was higher than expected. But weaker retail sales tempered those fears \u2014 at least for equity investors.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeTo some, the bond market is a particularly prescient predictor of economic trends. So is it picking up on an inflationary surge that the Federal Reserve likely will take too long to recognize?But the overheating fears may be overdone. Yesterday\u2019s January inflation report was hardly conclusive. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that the January increase \u201cprobably overstates the underlying trend.\u201dStill, even though there are reasons to believe that while the U.S. economy is breaking out of its recent rut \u2014 thanks to big tax cuts and a revival of the global economy \u2014 it may not be as vibrant as it looks.The economic flyaroundNestl\u00e9 added that its future is likely to contain more deals in the several-hundred-million range of the Blue Bottle Coffee takeover. \u201cThe sweet spot is in small to mid-sized deals, but we don\u2019t want to rule out anything,\u201d its C.E.O., Mark Schneider, said.The deals flyaroundHe also offered this ambition: \u201cI want you to be able to take an Uber and get into the subway \u2014 if the trains are running on time, you\u2019ve got real-time data \u2014 get in the subway, get out and have an Uber waiting for you for right now. Or know that there\u2019s a bike right there for you that gets you where you\u2019re going in the fastest manner.\u201dWhether the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C. are the best venues for this type of regulation is something Congress will have to decide. Neither agency has experience in overseeing virtual currencies, so assigning responsibility to one (or both) will require increased appropriations to develop rules and effective oversight.\u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.

Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.\u2019s rule.The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: \u201cCourts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition\u2014tell the S.E.C.\u2014Congress imposed.\u201d By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers.One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don\u2019t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.\u2019s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation.\u2014 Peter J. HenningWhy?There didn\u2019t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish.Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday\u2019s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on.In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained.\u2014 Peter EavisBroadcom\u2019s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders. From the news release:Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS\u2019s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP\u2019s activist stockholders.Let\u2019s take a look at the math\u2022 Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price.\u2022 Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn\u2019t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year.The bet on the shareholder meetingBroadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm\u2019s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees.A Qualcomm representative didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe deals flyaroundLittle in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey\u2019s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cIf these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place.During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter.The tower would be the first major project under New York City\u2019s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area.Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software.Here\u2019s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor\u2019s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: \u201cWe are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.\u201dGlassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants.Skadden\u2019s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.The judge overseeing the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T\u2019s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not \u201cmade a credible showing\u201d that the White House had singled it out for retribution.The decision puts a crimp in AT&T\u2019s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal.AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list \u2014 but could call him during the trial if needed.The trial begins March 19.Symptom A: Albertsons buying Rite Aid to gain scale and enter the pharmacy businessSymptom B: Walmart\u2019s online sales growing just 23 percent in the fourth quarter, after it splashed out on Jet.com, Bonobos and more\u201cIt\u2019s the battle of the old generation versus the new generation,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. \u201cAnd right now the companies that are gaining share is the new generation.\u201dCritics\u2019 cornerElsewhere in Amazon newsFrom Peter Eavis:For the first time \u2014 and after much protest \u2014 public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of their C.E.O.s.

{"Headline": "Advertisers Eschew Politics for Humor in Super Bowl Commercials", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Cindy Crawford, Peter Dinklage, Morgan Freeman and Jeff Bezos were among the famous faces featured in ads during the game.As the Super Bowl headed into its final quarter, the ads continued to fluctuate between funny and somber. The N.F.L.\u2019s own ad featuring the New York Giants\u2019 Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. re-enacting moves inspired by the movie \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d was a hit, as was Amazon\u2019s Alexa ad, which included Cardi B, Rebel Wilson and the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a humanitarian theme that is running through the spots,\u201d said Margaret Johnson, chief creative officer of the agency Goodby Silverstein & Partners, which created the Doritos-Mountain Dew ad. \u201cThat and humor seem to be the two themes of the night.\u201dWhile there were no commercials connected to the #MeToo movement, some still saw progress when it came to the role of gender in Super Bowl ads.\u201cI was just thinking that one thing I haven\u2019t seen are those ads that objectify women, which is refreshing,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cAnd guess what? There\u2019s still funny stuff on the air. We\u2019re making progress.\u201dStill, some wished that there was more humor.\u201cIt\u2019s really a pretty lame year,\u201d said Marianne Malina, president of the agency GSD&M in Austin, Tex. \u201cWhen the TV promos for the Olympics and \u2018The Voice\u2019 and the N.F.L. and Justin Timberlake overshadow a lot, that says everything.\u201dMs. Malina pointed out that that was a shift from the political tone of last year.\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting insight into just the level of risk that people are comfortable with right now,\u201d Ms. Malina said. \u201cLast year, people had a very strong response, and now, a year later, people are confused. Everyone\u2019s trying to get their head around all the things that are going on, so you can see how maybe the risk dial goes down.\u201d\u201cBut in reality,\u201d she added, \u201cthe risk dial maybe needs to go up.\u201dVerizon was among the brands that took a somber route. Its ad showed images of rescue situations and carried the voices of people thanking emergency workers, ending with the words: \u201cThey answer the call. Our job is to make sure they can get it.\u201d\u201cIn a culture and a climate where it\u2019s hard to find any kind of positive news out there at the moment, it felt like something we wanted to really lean into and take on a very different message,\u201d said Andrew McKechnie, Verizon\u2019s chief creative officer.The blowback was swift for Ram after the carmaker used a sermon given by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as the voice-over for one of its ads.The general sentiment: Did it really just use Dr. King\u2019s words about the value of service to sell trucks?\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong mistake to make given everything that\u2019s going on in the U.S. right now,\u201d said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. \u201cThere\u2019s so much emotion right now around race in this country that this was a high-risk move, and clearly it\u2019s not going over very well.\u201cI think it was well intentioned, but they\u2019re going to have a lot of explaining to do,\u201d Mr. Calkins added. \u201cThey did not release this ahead of time, so they went for the surprise. They got that, but at the same time, they now have a big problem with feedback and people being upset.\u201dRam approached Dr. King\u2019s estate about using his voice in the commercial, said Eric D. Tidwell, the managing director of Intellectual Properties Management, the licenser of the estate.\u201cOnce the final creative was presented for approval, it was reviewed to ensure it met our standard integrity clearances,\u201d Mr. Tidwell said in a statement on Sunday night. \u201cWe found that the overall message of the ad embodied Dr. King\u2019s philosophy that true greatness is achieved by serving others.\u201dFiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S. said in a statement: \u201cWe worked closely with the representatives of the Martin Luther King Jr. estate to receive the necessary approvals, and estate representatives were a very important part of the creative process every step of the way.\u201dThe Super Bowl regularly draws elaborate schemes from advertisers, and this year is no exception. Tourism Australia \u2014 the Australian government agency responsible for attracting international visitors to the country \u2014 decided last April that it would buy a Super Bowl spot as part of a broader campaign geared toward drawing more visitors from North America.The form it took: a big movie campaign for \u201cDundee,\u201d a sequel to the movie \u201cCrocodile Dundee,\u201d starring the actors Danny McBride and Chris Hemsworth.\u201cWe did a scan around things like the Grammys and the Academy Awards and other sporting events like the N.B.A. Finals and the World Series, but the event that really stops this country is the Super Bowl,\u201d said John O\u2019Sullivan, the managing director of Tourism Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s such a spectacle, right? If you look at it from a foreigner\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s this massive event which I think surpasses things like the Grand Slams in tennis and the Champions League final.\u201dNorth America is the second-most-valuable market for Australian tourism after mainland China, and one that the agency has decided to focus on in the last six months, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said. While many people want to visit Australia, he said, the trick for the country is moving up from a \u201cbucket list\u201d destination to a place that people will go in the near future.The concept for the campaign was created by the ad agency Droga5, whose founder, David Droga, is Australian. Content tied to the pretend movie will morph after the Super Bowl ad and will continue to use Danny McBride and Chris Hemsworth, Mr. Droga said.\u201cThe beauty is there\u2019s also a lot of content that moves with Chris and Danny that\u2019s sort of them exploring the country as friends \u2014 as an Aussie showing around a mate,\u201d he said.Mr. Droga also noted that the campaign for \u201cDundee\u201d benefited from the support of \u201cAussiewood\u201d stars like Mr. Jackman and Ms. Robbie, who worked on it for \u201cnothing.\u201d\u201cIf we had to pay commercial rights for those people,\u201d then it \u201cwould be the most expensive ad in the Super Bowl maybe ever,\u201d he said.One final Super Bowl connection: Mr. O\u2019Sullivan noted that he spent a year of high school in Lebanon, Pa., making him a Philadelphia Eagles fan.\u201cTypically, you see the great work is front-loaded, and I guess my hope is that the better work is coming,\u201d Wendy Clark, the chief executive of DDB North America and a former marketing executive at Coca-Cola, said at the start of the game\u2019s second quarter. \u201cAt the end of the day, a Super Bowl ad is about epic, over-the-top production value,\u201d and the first quarter \u201cwas a little quiet in the end.\u201dStill, Ms. Clark was a fan of the Tide ad and the Doritos-Mountain Dew ad featuring Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman lip-syncing to Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes.\u201cThe complete flip to Morgan Freeman, it\u2019s just so good,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a surprise aspect there, and it\u2019s really enjoyable watching those two characters rap \u2014 the complete 180 is fantastic.\u201dShe added, \u201cFunctionally, you\u2019re also thinking, \u2018Oh, my God, I would eat those together.\u201dTide drew the laughs heading into the second quarter with a meta commercial starring David Harbour (\u201cStranger Things\u201d) that showed a slew of setups for other ads before interrupting itself with, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a Tide ad.\u201d\u201cI want to see how they bring it to life and on social,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cI assume they\u2019re going to comment on every single ad now from their handle.\u201d (That\u2019s @Tide on Twitter.)Stella Artois ran a commercial featuring Matt Damon urging people to buy limited-edition chalices in order to give years of clean water to people in developing countries through a partnership with Water.org, which works for safe water and sanitation. That was joined by a somber commercial from Budweiser, set to the song \u201cStand by Me,\u201d focused on the company\u2019s efforts to deliver cans of water to people affected by natural disasters.\u201cMillennials like brands that link themselves to a social cause,\u201d Charles R. Taylor, a professor of marketing at the Villanova University School of Business, said. \u201cWhat Stella Artois is doing with Water.org, I think, is really smart.\u201dPringles is running its first Super Bowl ad, starring the comedian Bill Hader, as it tries to popularize the notion of \u201cstacking\u201d chips with different flavors to arrive at a new, artificially flavored snack. (And, presumably, to encourage people to buy more than one pack of the chips at a time.)Yuvraj Arora, a senior vice president of marketing at Kellogg, explained how to use the process to approximate the taste of chicken wings. \u201cYou take barbecue Pringles, buffalo ranch Pringles and ranch Pringles and you get a chicken-wing-like experience without the mess,\u201d he said.Mr. Arora noted that the way the millennial generation interacts with food, especially on social media, was an inspiration for the idea.\u201cFood is so central to millennials\u2019 lifestyle,\u201d he said. \u201cAll around, you see there\u2019s mashups, new flavor experiences and a number of unique flavors.\u201dIn an era of cord-cutting and ad-skipping, the Super Bowl is a sweet salve for the nation\u2019s marketers. There\u2019s no bigger stage for advertisers \u2014 last year\u2019s game drew more than 111 million viewers \u2014 and that\u2019s why they\u2019re willing to shell out millions of dollars to be on it for 30 seconds.Last year, commercials with social and political messages stole the show, but this year\u2019s crop of advertisers seemed to steer clear of such commentary and aimed for laughs and nostalgia.\u201cI\u2019m a little bit surprised,\u201d Charles R. Taylor, a professor of marketing at the Villanova University School of Business, said. \u201cSome of the best ads over the last 10 years have focused on female empowerment, like the Audi daughter ad.\u201dWomen are generally much less visible in Super Bowl ads than men, even as Nielsen data shows that women were 47 percent of the audience for last year\u2019s game. Mr. Taylor, who recently studied Super Bowl ads from 2008 to 2017, found that 76 percent of the commercials showed a man as a principal character, while 43 percent featured a woman as a principal character.Susan Credle, the global chief creative officer at the agency FCB, said Super Bowl advertisers may be \u201cconcerned about looking opportunistic versus supportive.\u201d And humor, she noted, was particularly appealing given the social and political climate.\u201cSometimes when the world is troubled or America is feeling a little \u2014 well, I wouldn\u2019t say it was an up 2017 for everybody \u2014 I think there is a tendency to want to balance out the energy,\u201d Ms. Credle said. \u201cLightheartedness and a little fun and joy is probably a good antidote to the reality that we\u2019re sitting in.\u201dFans of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d have been buzzing about a commercial for Doritos and Mountain Dew that stars the actors Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman, as well as the musicians Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes. The brands, owned by Pepsi, cast Mr. Dinklage to represent fire, for a new spicy Doritos flavor, while Mr. Morgan plays ice for a new kind of Mountain Dew.Greg Lyons, the chief marketing officer of Pepsi\u2019s North American beverage unit, said the casting was not a reference to Mr. Dinklage\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d character, who advises a queen who owns dragons. The actor, he said, is \u201cfiery on his own.\u201dMr. Lyons said, \u201cHe was in \u2018Elf\u2019 \u2014 he was pretty fiery in that as well.\u201dWhile it has never been easier for advertisers to reach vast numbers of people around the world, thanks to the internet, the lure of the Super Bowl is the one huge audience it provides. Advertisers spent a combined $534 million on ads before, during and after the game last year, according to the research firm Kantar. The company said that the roughly $5 million a 30-second commercial cost last year compared to $2.5 million for 30 seconds in the National Football Conference championship game and $1.9 million for the same time in the Academy Awards.\u201cIt\u2019s a finite amount of inventory,\u201d Gibbs Haljun, managing director of media investment at GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP. \u201cThere\u2019s only one game, it\u2019s only on once a year, the ratings are relatively stable and it is what it is.\u201dStill, it appeared that NBC was selling at least some spots down to the wire, as illustrated by a last-minute buy from Wix.com that the company announced on Friday. In January, Wix.com was promoting its decision to sit out of this year\u2019s game and arranging press interviews with its chief marketing officer about alternative plans for the money.NBC said in an email late Friday that it had sold all of its ads for the game.The network, which is owned by Comcast, has had the dual challenge this year of selling ads for both the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics, which will begin on Friday.\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time that occurred,\u201d Mr. Haljun said, \u201cso this is kind of an odd challenge for them and continues to make the negotiations a little more interesting and robust.\u201dJason M.

{"Headline": "The Economy Is Getting Hotter. Is a Productivity Boom Next?", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe it\u2019s not a coincidence.This idea should excite both conservatives and liberals.For years, McKinsey researchers have tried to understand what drives productivity growth from the ground up. They\u2019ve studied how innovations that enable a company to make more goods and services per hour of labor spread across the economy. \u201cWe have always looked at this from the supply side to a large extent,\u201d said James Manyika, a partner at the firm and a co-author of the study. \u201cYou look at companies and the introduction of technology and business processes, the adoption of best practices. We\u2019ve always kind of assumed away the demand side of the equation.\u201dProductivity growth in the United States was 3.8 percentage points lower in the period from 2010 to 2014 compared with the 2000-2004 period. Part of that, McKinsey found, was a result of the information technology boom of the 1990s \u2014 which paid continuing productivity dividends into the first years of the 21st century \u2014 having run its course. But 1.1 percentage points of the drop was due, in its analysis, to aftereffects of the financial crisis. Those effects sapped even more productivity growth, 1.3 percentage points, from the British economy.Take the auto industry. Automobile production in the United States fell 50 percent from 2007 to 2009, meaning the sector had tremendous excess production capacity in the ensuing years even as the sector recovered. \u201cCompanies could fulfill a lot higher demand without having to make any new investments,\u201d said Jaana Remes, a McKinsey partner and a co-author. \u201cTypically the newest technology is implemented in the latest factories. People don\u2019t upgrade a factory that can fulfill demand perfectly well.\u201dOr consider how this dynamic might apply in the restaurant industry (or retail, or tourism).The basic technology for self-serve kiosks has been around for years. But when the unemployment rate was at its post-crisis highs, employers could have their pick of good workers at relatively low prices. Now, with the jobless rate at 4.1 percent, good workers are harder to find. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, companies have been more open to installing technology that may have a significant upfront cost and require reworking how a restaurant is organized, but allow more sales without hiring more workers.\u201cA consequence of a really tight labor market is a higher turnover rate,\u201d said Liah Luther, marketing manager at Nextep Systems, a Michigan company that sells self-ordering kiosks to restaurants, casinos and corporate facilities. \u201cOnce you eliminate the need for extensive training on a point of sale system, you can focus on soft skills like customer service, and reduce the cost of turnover.\u201dThe optimistic case for both productivity and overall economic growth goes like this: For the last several years, a lack of demand and plenty of spare capacity of both workers and equipment made businesses complacent and unwilling to invest in new equipment, software or new ways of doing things that might allow more output per hour of labor.Now, with companies having a harder time finding qualified workers and with demand for their products rising, they\u2019ll have no choice but to re-engineer how they work to try to increase productivity. Higher productivity will in turn make it easier to justify higher wages, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of higher economic growth.There are some risks to that rosy forecast, which Ms. Remes and Mr. Manyika warn about.They see a great deal of potential from digitization of businesses that have been slow to embrace the lessons of the cutting-edge companies in their industry. But this might be slow to generate the kinds of big productivity gains that are possible.Even as more retailers adapt to an age of digital commerce and learn from Amazon, for example, they may in the near term end up simply doubling up traditional retail and e-commerce-focused workers, making such companies less productive rather than more. \u201cUnless displaced labor can find new highly productive and high-wage occupations, workers may end up in low-wage jobs that create a drag on productivity growth,\u201d the McKinsey researchers wrote.So it\u2019s not worth pulling out Champagne bottles for productivity yet. First we have to see if the theory holds up \u2014 that a tighter economy will feed into higher capital investment and experimentation by businesses about finding new efficiencies. Then we have to see whether that feeds into a virtuous cycle in which more productivity creates more growth and vice versa. And then we have to hope that it turns into wage gains for workers who haven\u2019t seen many of them in the last decade \u2014 or else it just may not last.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s talk about tech.The HomePod reviews are in, and the verdict is: It\u2019s middling!Apple\u2019s smart speaker was originally due to ship last year. Now, after a delay and lots of speculation that it would face a rough go against Amazon\u2019s Echo, Apple\u2019s device is finally on sale.But most reviewers appraising the device this week suggested that it was best to wait. There are some interesting features in HomePod, but it has a long way to go to beat the competition.What doesn\u2019t it do well? Pretty much everything else, reviewers said. It\u2019s expensive \u2014 $349 versus $85 for an Echo. It\u2019s locked into Apple\u2019s music service, while competing systems let you play songs from a variety of sources.And most frustratingly, it\u2019s not very smart. Where Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s devices can answer a variety of questions and perform lots of different tasks (like order up an Uber or Lyft), HomePod\u2019s brain, Siri, needs evolution. Brian was particularly upset that the device kept playing music he didn\u2019t like. And for Nilay, the biggest complaint was that HomePod couldn\u2019t set two timers at once \u2014 basically table stakes in the smart speaker game.None of these are fatal. Siri is a cloud-based service, which means Apple can keep improving it from afar. Echo, too, wasn\u2019t so great to begin with. So I wouldn\u2019t count Apple out. The smart assistant war has barely started.Travis Kalanick took the stand, drank a whole lot of water, offered his thoughts on greed and Google, and introduced the world to the crazy lexicon of tech bros: \u201cunpumped,\u201d \u201cangsty\u201d and, most mysteriously of all, \u201claser is the sauce.\u201dAt the heart of the case is one question: Did Uber steal trade secrets from Waymo, Google\u2019s self-driving car spin-off, when it purchased Otto, a self-driving company founded by former employees of Waymo?The trial is expected to go on for weeks, but early on, Waymo seemed to score some wins. Kalanick conceded that during a \u201cjam sesh\u201d with Anthony Levandowski, the former Waymo engineer alleged to have stolen its secrets, he discussed the key technology at issue in the case, laser sensors. That\u2019s apparently when Kalanick jotted a note that included his conclusion that \u201claser is the sauce\u201d \u2014 it suggested Levandowski had convinced Kalanick of the importance of Waymo\u2019s tech.I\u2019m sure Uber\u2019s lawyers were unpumped about that.Here\u2019s something noteworthy from social media land. Snap and Twitter have long appeared at a disadvantage to the 800-pound social media gorilla, Facebook, and the smaller companies\u2019 financial results often proved it.There\u2019s some serious stuff here. This is the biggest rocket ever launched by a private company, and it paves the way for an even-larger rocket planned by Musk, called B.F.R., which could help realize Musk\u2019s dream of colonizing Mars.

{"Headline": "After Settling With Uber, Waymo Faces Bigger Challenges", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow for Waymo, which grew out of Google\u2019s seminal autonomous vehicle project and is nearly a decade into an effort that aims to change the very nature of transportation, a much bigger fight looms outside the courtroom.Waymo\u2019s competition extends well beyond Uber \u2014 and a good part of that competition is directed by engineers it used to employ. Much of the artificial intelligence technology that has come out of Waymo\u2019s work and from research run by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is now available from other sources, making it easier for companies, even start-ups, to compete.\u201cWaymo may have a technical advantage,\u201d said Jason Doran, who helped run the delivery service Sidecar and joined General Motors when the carmaker acquired the start-up. \u201cBut they have to figure out a business model.\u201dIt is not uncommon for a tech pioneer to miss out on becoming the company that cashes in on the technology it has been working on. The industry is littered with stories of people with a great idea that someone else turned into a great business.The concept for the databases used by most of the world\u2019s big corporations came out of IBM. But another company, Oracle, turned that software into a big business. Researchers at the Silicon Valley lab of Xerox famously pioneered the technology that went into many of Apple\u2019s computers.And executives at Alphabet would certainly remember that Google was hardly the first internet search engine. It was just better than anything that came before it.Other than an ownership stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, that came with settling the lawsuit, Waymo has not made substantial money from those years of research.That is worth noting, because so many of the companies competing with Waymo are relying on the brainpower of its former employees. Dave Ferguson, a former Waymo engineer, oversees a start-up called Nuro, which is building a driverless car for shipping and delivering goods. Chris Urmson, a longtime Waymo engineer, is the chief executive of a start-up called Aurora. Brian Salesky, a third Waymo engineer, is now at Argo, an autonomous vehicle start-up backed by $1 billion in funding from Ford Motor.The question was whether he took trade secrets with him. Waymo accused Uber of conspiring with Mr. Levandowski to steal its trade secrets and feed them into a driverless car project already underway inside the ride-hailing company. With Friday\u2019s settlement, Uber has promised that its cars will operate without the help of Waymo\u2019s intellectual property.There are other issues for Waymo. Unlike Ford, General Motors or Toyota, Waymo does not manufacture and sell cars. Unlike Uber and Lyft, it does not operate a vast ride-hailing services where it could readily deploy vehicles equipped with its own self-driving technology.As the big automakers and the ride-hailing companies accelerate their self-driving projects, Waymo may need to find a way of inserting itself into these efforts or to build and operate a new self-driving service of its own.\u201cThere\u2019s the self-driving tech. But you also have to scale that tech. And you have to offer a service that people really want to use,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cYou have to get all of that right.\u201dWaymo executives were not available for interviews for this article. John Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, is scheduled to speak on Monday evening at a conference on artificial intelligence hosted by The New York Times.\u201cWaymo has the partnerships and technology needed to launch the world\u2019s first self-driving service this year,\u201d a Waymo spokesman said in a statement, pointing to how the company has fully self-driving cars on some public roads, has secured vehicles from Fiat Chrysler and has partnered with Avis, AutoNation, Lyft and others. \u201cAfter years of research and development, Waymo is now focused on operations and deployment.\u201dWhen Waymo was still operating under Google, its head start in this race was obvious. Google began testing its self-driving prototypes on public roads in 2010, and this is what set off so many other efforts.\u201cThis is profoundly important,\u201d said Mr. Urmson of Aurora, which is supplying self-driving technology to Volkswagen, Audi and Hyundai. \u201cWe can build on top of that revolution.\u201dThese techniques are spreading across the industry. And anyone can immediately tap into enormous amounts of computing power through cloud services operated by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and, yes, Google.Many car manufacturers believe they will eventually catch up because they can deploy so many more cars equipped with sensors that can record real-world activity.\u201cWhat the car companies have is the potential to harvest more data than anyone else,\u201d Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, the Silicon Valley research and development operation created by the Japanese car company, said in an interview last fall. \u201cIt may be this that matters the most.\u201dWaymo is unlikely to manufacture its own cars. But it may end up running its own self-driving service. Alphabet recently led a $1 billion investment in Lyft, and it could deploy its driverless cars through this existing ride-hailing option. Waymo is also running a private trial of its cars near Phoenix, and it has long hinted that it will offer some sort of undefined public service in the area.Operating this kind of service is no small thing, and some question whether Waymo is equipped to do so. \u201cThis is where the Ubers and the Lyfts have an advantage,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.He cautioned that the departures from Waymo may have an unintended consequence for the entire industry: Many smart people are needed in the same place to figure things out.\u201cYou need to have a lot of the best minds together to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my fears is that we have spread the field a little thin. As a result, we have actually slowed down the speed with which we can solve this problem.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz.Advertisement"}

In the years and decades to come, the lab hopes to create a database of fundamental knowledge that humans take for granted but machines have always lacked.\u201cTo make real progress in A.I., we have to overcome the big challenges in the area of common sense,\u201d said Mr. Allen, who founded the software giant Microsoft in the 1970s with Bill Gates.But these machines struggle with other basic tasks.

When confronted with heavy traffic or unexpected situations, driverless cars just sit there.A.I. \u201crecognizes objects, but can\u2019t explain what it sees.

The core index, which excludes food and energy, also came in above forecasts, prompting Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan, to describe it as \u201chotter than Hades.\u201dWhile the stock market shrugged off the jump in inflation, bond markets got a bit of a jolt. The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note rose above 2.9 percent on Wednesday, well above the 2.4 percent at which it finished last year.Indeed, the index overshot expectations because two items \u2014 clothing and medical services \u2014 had very strong increases, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. Clothing was due for a big rebound because it seemed to lag a lot in recent months, Pantheon asserted. As for medical services, the jump there came from hospital costs, which Pantheon described as \u201cvery erratic.\u201dThe analysts at Hoisington Investment Management have in recent years highlighted stubborn weaknesses in the United States economy, and the firm still sees significant problems.

These days, the locus has shifted to far quieter places, where computers are in charge.The transition has been years in the making, but its effect has been on full display over the past week. After propelling the market to historic highs, passive investment strategies \u2014 which follow a simple set of rules and are carried out by sophisticated computer programs, not humans \u2014 are among the factors fueling the market\u2019s recent plunge.This is the new reality of today\u2019s stock market: Funds that track financial indexes have become a dominant force, and they can act as accelerants, adding momentum to the market\u2019s rise and fall.This week, as markets shuddered, exchange-traded index funds were responsible for 38 percent of total stock trading on some days, an astonishing figure given that these funds were just a curiosity 10 years ago. Indexing giants like BlackRock and Vanguard now own vast swaths of the market and are the largest shareholders in just about all the major companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.In many ways, this stampede toward passive investing \u2014 in which people put their money into funds that track indexes and broader market themes as opposed to relying on human stock pickers \u2014 is uncharted territory.

They now own close to 40 percent of stocks in the United States, according to research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Unlike mutual funds, E.T.F.s are listed on public exchanges, which makes many of them very easy to trade even if the securities they hold may not be. On Thursday, for example, the second most actively traded security in the equity market was a BlackRock fund that invests in large companies in emerging markets.There was a lot to keep an eye on.BlackRock, which manages $6 trillion overall, is the leading issuer of exchange-traded funds, with $1.3 trillion under management. But as the market fell and trading in BlackRock funds accelerated, there was little sign of panic or emotion among the E.T.F. specialists at the firm.They fielded phone calls from clients and let the computers do their work.Martin Small, who oversees United States-based E.T.F.s at the firm, said the high share of E.T.F. trading was positive for the markets. That is because on days when fearful investors want to sell, large, easy-to-trade E.T.F.s serve as a critical release valve.\u201cEverything worked,\u201d Mr. Small said. \u201cVolumes were higher and more people were watching, but our funds did what they were supposed to do.\u201dInvesting on the basis of what machines, as opposed to humans, do has been a trend in financial markets for years. What\u2019s different now is that so much money has poured into a specific type of computer-driven trading.From cost-conscious millennials to the world\u2019s largest pension and sovereign wealth funds, E.T.F.s have become a preferred investment choice. In addition to all the major stock and bond indexes, they enable investors to get a piece of the action in arcane areas like junk bonds, bank loans and stocks in Pakistan. There is even an E.T.F. that tracks companies that make whiskey.The popularity of E.T.F.s has concentrated unparalleled financial power in BlackRock and Vanguard, the two biggest providers of index funds and E.T.F.s. Together, they sit on $10.5 trillion in assets and control 65 percent of the 1,700 exchange-traded funds that exist.Relying on sophisticated computer programs, they funnel investor money into the stocks and bonds that make up indexes around the world. As the flows have grown in volume, much of these funds have gone toward index heavyweights like Amazon, Apple and Facebook, pushing their valuations ever higher.Active fund managers \u2014 human stock pickers \u2014 will be marginalized, the argument goes. And that could cause harm, because they are the ones who buy when others sell. So when stocks suddenly plummet, there will be fewer funds to step in, extending the fall.An analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein even compared passive investing to Marxism, in its sweeping conformity and its degradation of the independent-minded, active investor.\u201cFor years, this has been an E.T.F. market \u2014 its robots buying stocks just as they were programmed to do,\u201d said Steven Bregman of Horizon Kinetics, a firm that hunts for undervalued stocks. \u201cBut so much money has gone into just a few hundred stocks. Everyone owns the same stuff. So when they want to get out, who are they going to sell to?\u201dCompounding these worries is the rise of algorithm-driven trading strategies at large hedge funds. They get their buy and sell signals not from a human but from indexes that measure sharp swings in the market. Earlier this week, they were big sellers when the so-called VIX index \u2014 a measure of anticipated market volatility \u2014 skyrocketed.E.T.F. proponents argue that their industry\u2019s growth is just the latest stage of the stock-indexing revolution that began in the early 1970s. That was when John C. Bogle founded Vanguard and began to launch index funds.So when stocks sank this week, he barely glanced at his trading screens. Whether the market goes up or down does not matter to him because the computers control his suite of exchange-traded funds \u2014 not him.\u201cIf the market goes down 4 percent, I don\u2019t even care,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cThat is the beauty of systems. Once you build it, there is literally nothing left to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Couples today date online and bank online. They don\u2019t mind putting in their assets and liabilities into a computer. They\u2019re do-it-yourselfers.

Her husband of 15 years said he wanted a divorce in January 2017, moved out the next day and then did nothing to initiate the legal proceedings.In February 2017 Ms. Jacobson visited a mediator. \u201cI nearly died when I found out how expensive it was,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a $5,000 initial fee. I thought, Maybe I can\u2019t afford to get divorced.\u201d(Her spouse declined to be interviewed on the record.)Ms. Jacobson\u2019s favorite part of the site is the progress tracker: a yellow series of icons that shows the percentage of progress made in each category, from Basic Info to \u201cThe Deal,\u201d as if losing weight on a diet. \u201cI used to laugh at conscious uncoupling,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said. \u201cBut now I understand the concept of trying to undo something meaningful in a respectful way. This allows us to do it in a financially feasible way.\u201dJonathan, 50, a small-business owner in the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles, who did not want to give his last name because he owns a business with his soon-to-be-ex, is a few months away from his divorce. (California has a mandatory six-month waiting period.)He and his wife of 19 years have two children and two homes. She met another man, and after trying what he calls a \u201clove triangle\u201d Jonathan decided they should split. Then it was a matter of how to do it.\u201c\u2018The War of the Roses\u2019 divorce was not for me,\u201d he said. He too visited a mediator, but his wife didn\u2019t show up to the appointment, instead calling in by phone. A longtime friend of Ms. Wasser, he signed up.He likens the site to California\u2019s online defensive-driving classes. \u201cYou can\u2019t rush through it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to put a level of effort in.\u201dHe also wanted a divorce that wouldn\u2019t be drawn out and thought the platform would be faster than lawyers or mediators. \u201cI\u2019d like to date again,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are women telling me they won\u2019t date me until I\u2019m divorced. I want to live my life.\u201dIt\u2019s Over Easy offers a directory to paying users with listings for movers, health-insurance brokers, child therapists and more. \u201cYou need people to help you rewrite your will,\u201d Ms. Wasser said, \u201cin case you die in probate. You need self-tanners so you can get ready to date again, and co-parenting counselors to tell you how to handle parent-teacher conferences.\u201dSo far there have been two completed divorces (both in California), with others awaiting processing by the court. The spring may bring a new wave of customers eager to be divorced by the end of the calendar year: any payer of spousal support who completes a divorce after Dec. 31, 2018, will no longer be able to claim the support as a deductible expense, thanks to the new tax bill.Lest one think the site\u2019s primary market will be millennials with no children or significant assets, on its first day 30 percent of users were 35 to 44, according to analytics provided by the company, and 22 percent were 45 to 54.

But as the leaders of the country\u2019s most influential gun advocacy group kept quiet after the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla., that claimed 17 lives, a furious debate played out on NRATV, the organization\u2019s online video channel. Its hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons, media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a \u201cdeep state\u201d campaign to undermine President Trump.Critics of the N.R.A. say that they have observed a shift in the organization\u2019s tone since Mr. Trump was elected that is much more pugilistic, and that NRATV is where the most outrageous commentary occurs. This change, they say, seems to reflect the fact that like many organizations on the right, the N.R.A. believes it has to guard against complacency among its members with a friendly president in the White House.\u201cThere\u2019s no boogeyman in the White House now to make people afraid of,\u201d said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. \u201cSo they have to make us afraid of one another, and that is how they will market guns in an age when they have a president beholden to them.\u201d The channel has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics today, with hosts and guests who are closely allied with Mr. Trump. Few news media operations seem as in sync with the political sensibilities of the Trump era. And they often side with Mr. Trump in divisive cultural disputes \u2014 some of which have potent racial undercurrents \u2014 like his feuding with Black Lives Matter activists and the professional football players who knelt during the national anthem.Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to discuss the media effort, the size of its online audience or its programming in the wake of the Parkland shooting. As a matter of policy, he said, the N.R.A. does not discuss proprietary matters. The N.R.A.\u2019s practice is to keep a low profile after mass shootings, as it did after the massacres in Newtown, Conn., and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. But it was always quietly talking to its members, first by email and later on NRATV, said Danny Barefoot, a partner at Anvil Strategies, an ad agency and communications company that has worked with gun control groups. \u201cIn those moments, the goal isn\u2019t to disseminate mass information and persuade a lot of people, \u201d Mr. Barefoot said. \u201cThe strategy is to be a messenger to the N.R.A.\u2019s own people.\u201d Eli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy, a site that delivered progressive political videos to targeted audiences on Facebook, said that while videos produced by NRATV after a shooting might not go viral, they helped viewers \u201cfeel they\u2019re part of a community, led by a news source that speaks to them.\u201dNRATV can galvanize members in the wake of a shooting in part because the N.R.A. has coached its followers to believe that the organization is the only credible source for news and information on any gun issue or controversy. \u201cIf it can topple us, it gets a direct path to the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Stinchfield told viewers this week from the organization\u2019s studio in Dallas. \u201cThey will stop at nothing to put us out of business.\u201d\u201cPeople could just as easily call for restrictions on the first amendment,\u201d Mr. Holton said. \u201cThey could say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make it illegal to report on those school shootings because we all know, I mean, there\u2019s no doubt that the media circus that takes place every time one of these things happens causes more school shootings.\u201d Advertisement"}

To them, this place is \u201csachamama,\u201d a Quechua word roughly meaning \u201cmother jungle,\u201d the sacred heart of the area that produces the flora and fauna on which the groups depend.These indigenous people are part of a larger community dispersed across the landscape during the rubber boom at the turn of 20th century. They are the descendants of the few who survived slavery, torture and genocide, which took tens of thousands of lives.Over the past two decades, indigenous federations living around Yaguas have been working to protect the land. They educated scientists and conservationists about its geography and biology, and convinced the government that the land was worth saving.In the Amazonian lowlands of Yaguas National Park, different types of rivers that contain distinct forms of aquatic life mix during the rainy season as forests flood. This unusual cocktail of river waters produces biodiversity; more than 300 species of fish have adapted to forest life.One species, not yet named, grows no bigger than your thumb and has only been found dwelling in subterranean tunnels. Dr. Hidalgo hopes to return to the park soon to confirm whether it\u2019s new to science.But with some 3,000 plant, 600 bird and more than 150 mammal species, there are far more than fish in Yaguas.Often elusive in heavily hunted areas, tapirs in Yaguas seem to remain more visible. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this many tapirs in one place,\u201d said Dr. Vriesendorp. They are sometimes found in the forest, eating salty mud to extract its minerals.But their presence in Yaguas suggests that the aquatic ecosystem is still healthy, which is important given that the park contains the headwaters of a tributary to the Amazon.A team led by the Frankfurt Zoological Society is hoping to get an estimate of the otter population, determine if there are any otter-human conflicts, and eventually assess whether mercury from small, illegal gold mining operations has entered the food chain.If future proposals are successful, three-quarters of the Putumayo River will become a vast, unfragmented corridor for wildlife across northern Peru. And it could also be important as the world aims to reduce carbon emissions.Keeping the carbon in the ground is critical, although it will prove challenging in remote Yaguas and surrounding areas with fewer restrictions.\u201cFor now, Yaguas is safe, but in the 20 years I\u2019ve been working in the Amazon, I\u2019ve learned the hard way that today\u2019s remoteness is tomorrow\u2019s access,\u201d said Gregory Asner, an ecologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science.But for now, many are celebrating.\u201cPeople don\u2019t create national parks every day,\u201d said Dr. Vriesendorp. \u201cIt really is a big deal.\u201d_____An earlier version of this article misstated the corner of Peru in which Yaguas National Park is found.

{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Online Growth Surges, Even as It Looks Offline", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Alibaba Group, the Chinese online shopping giant, has become so big that it is looking for growth by forging into new territory: the offline world.Alibaba has snapped up stakes in grocers and in an electronics chain over the last three years, a perhaps counterintuitive series of moves for a company that helps consumers in China buy products with their smartphones. In part, the push is driven by the eventual maturation of its online business.For now, however, online shopping still rules the roost.Alibaba on Thursday reported a one-third rise in profit for the three months that ended in December, on revenue that rose by more than half. The revenue growth rate was its slowest in a year but still came in better than expected.Still, a pullback in growth is inevitable for a company with Alibaba\u2019s reach.The company has lifted its recent results by offering more and better services to the vendors on its platforms. But it is also eyeing the 84 percent of physical goods sales that still take place offline in China.Alibaba has been pouring cash into experiments in what its founder, Jack Ma, calls \u201cnew retail\u201d: a kind of teched-up re-envisioning of how people shop in store. In particular, it hopes to gather more detailed user data, which could help it offer more personalized services and ads to its customers online and off.\u201cSome of Alibaba\u2019s \u2018new retail\u2019 initiatives have shown quite promising signs of initial success,\u201d said Jialong Shi, an analyst with Nomura, singling out Hema. Still, he said, \u201cthese initiatives may require a few more years of incubation before we can see profits.\u201dAnother challenge: Tencent, Alibaba\u2019s biggest rival, is getting into fresh food and traditional retail, too.Tencent is the world\u2019s largest video game company. It also runs WeChat, China\u2019s most popular messaging and social media app.For now at least, analysts do not expect Alibaba and Tencent to end up owning rival alliances of stores. Tencent primarily seems to want to create more opportunities for people to use its mobile payment service, WeChat Pay. It is also hunting for new clients for its cloud computing business.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to imagine that Tencent would fully own and operate a supermarket on its own,\u201d Mr. Shi of Nomura said.For both Alibaba and Tencent, though, creating more points of contact with their customers helps them amass more user data. This is one reason the companies are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, which helps them make sense of the boatloads of user information they are hauling in every minute.\u201cThey not only have the largest data sets, but they have data sets tied to customers that they can identify,\u201d Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research, said. \u201cThe potential for A.I.-led monetization growth, we think, is still at a very early stage.\u201dAlso on Thursday, Alibaba said it would acquire a one-third stake in the parent company of Alipay, one of China\u2019s two main online payment services. The two sides agreed in 2014 to give Alibaba the right to acquire the stake. The two companies used to be one until Mr. Ma took the Alipay operations out and formed a separate company.Advertisement"}

For Black History Month, we have selected 28 essential films from the 20th century pertaining to African-American experiences. These aren\u2019t the 28 essential black-themed films, but a calendar of suggested viewing. We imposed a chronological cutoff in an effort to look back at where we were and how we got to here.Race movies disappeared shortly after World War II, and soon the mainstream industry turned toward social issues. Yet even as the civil rights movement gathered force, black characters and their experiences were seen through a white lens, often myopically. Consider this sobering fact: Between 1948 (when Micheaux\u2019s last film appeared) and 1969 (when Gordon Parks\u2019s \u201cThe Learning Tree\u201d arrived on the big screen), almost no movies directed by African-Americans were released commercially in the United States.Our selections for subsequent decades are exclusively the work of black directors. For the later 20th century, we have chosen titles that represent waves and countercurrents: Blaxploitation, the independent film scenes in Los Angeles and New York in the \u201970s and \u201980s, the flowering of commercial and independent movies in the \u201990s. There are comedies and crime stories, historical epics and slices of ordinary life, socially conscious dramas and sublimely silly comedies.

{"Headline": "Amazon to Test a New Delivery Service for Sellers", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon is planning to test a program this year that would replace some delivery services now done by United Parcel Service and FedEx.Under the new service, known inside the company variously as Ship With Amazon and Shipping With Amazon, company couriers would pick up products from businesses that sell goods through the internet retailer and deliver that merchandise to Amazon warehouses. Now, those goods are delivered to the warehouses by UPS, FedEx and other companies.Amazon\u2019s test, which could start in several months, will probably include only a handful of independent Amazon sellers in Los Angeles. Eventually, the test could encompass more delivery services handled by established carriers. A person briefed on the program, who asked for anonymity because the plans are confidential, provided details about the project.When asked about the program, Amazon said in a statement, \u201cWe\u2019re always innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on Amazon to create faster, lower-cost delivery choices.\u201dIn the initial trial of the service, the person briefed on the plan said, Amazon will still rely on its current network of couriers, like UPS, FedEx and the Postal Service, to get orders from its warehouses to customers.Depending on how the test goes, though, the service could expand to include more sellers in more areas and allow sellers that do not store their inventory in Amazon warehouses to ship orders entirely through Amazon\u2019s own delivery network, bypassing other carriers. In the long term, Amazon could also make the service available to merchants that sell on sites besides Amazon.Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, declined to comment about Amazon\u2019s plans or whether the company\u2019s shipping volume with UPS had changed. He pointed out, however, that UPS reported 8 percent revenue growth and a 4.5 percent increase in package volume in the United States last year.\u201cUPS continues to support Amazon and all other valued customers,\u201d he said.Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, compared what Amazon was doing in shipping to what it had done in the corporate technology market with Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. Slowly over time, Amazon has added more and more features to the service, but they are still well short of the offerings from established providers like Microsoft.\u201cI think Amazon is going to find different areas within the logistics and transportation space where it can be maybe more effective or efficient than what FedEx and UPS can do,\u201d Mr. Sebastian said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trying to establish a full competitor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sam\u2019s Club Makes E-Commerce Push With Amazon Prime Competitor", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, the warehouse club, which is a unit of Walmart, revealed more details about its strategic shift \u2014 one that is based, predictably, on increasing its e-commerce sales.Shoppers who pay $100 a year for a Plus membership will have free shipping on almost any item, Sam\u2019s Club said. The perk is the company\u2019s attempt to catch up with Amazon\u2019s wildly successful Prime service, which also offers free shipping for about the same annual fee.The company also said it was converting a former Sam\u2019s Club store in Memphis into a fulfillment center for online orders, and planned to open other e-commerce facilities in Florida, California, the Chicago area and the Northeast in the coming months.The changes are part of a broader strategy that Sam\u2019s Club executives said involved closing underperforming stores and focusing on core customers \u2014 typically a family making $125,000 a year that lives in the suburbs and may own a small business.The company is also reducing its membership levels from three to two: the Plus membership and the $45 Club membership, which includes discounts on services like flat tire repairs.Sam\u2019s Club executives said in a call with reporters that it was still too early to say how many of the thousands of workers who had been displaced by store closings would find new jobs at the company.Last month, social media erupted when shoppers showed up at Sam\u2019s Clubs around the country that had been closed without warning. On the same day, Walmart announced that it was raising starting wages and handing out bonuses. The timing of the announcements prompted criticism that the retailer was trying to distract from the bad news at its Sam\u2019s Club operation; the company said they were unrelated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Aims for Affluent Customers With Online Mattress Brand", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart is starting its own mattress and bedding brand that will be sold exclusively online, part of the giant retailer\u2019s effort to bolster its e-commerce business.The new line, which will include items like pillows and throws, will be sold through a separate website, AllswellHome.com, but it will not be immediately available on the company\u2019s flagship website Walmart.com or in its roughly 4,700 stores.The new offering \u2014 which Walmart describes as an \u201cInstagram-worthy dream bed\u201d \u2014 aims at the more affluent and digitally savvy customer that the retailer has been making a big push to reach in recent years.Previously, the company sought to tap this market with a string of acquisitions of e-commerce brands like Bonobos, which sells hip men\u2019s clothes.But the mattress and bedding venture represents the first digitally native, or online only, brand that Walmart has developed internally.\u201cThis is how great brands get built,\u201d said Andy Dunn, a founder of Bonobos and senior vice president of digital brands at Walmart. \u201cWe are thinking about how we win the future.\u201dThe Allswell venture, which goes live next month, comes as concern mounts on Wall Street about Walmart\u2019s e-commerce performance.On Tuesday, Walmart\u2019s stock cratered after the company reported that e-commerce sales growth had slowed considerably in its fiscal fourth quarter, which included the holiday shopping season.The company blamed operational glitches in its fulfillments network for some of the problem. But the pronounced slowdown, after several quarters of blistering online growth, caused analysts and investors to question whether there were deeper issues with Walmart\u2019s online strategy.The company has spent handsomely on its online efforts, including the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com in 2016, which at the time was the largest price paid for an e-commerce company. It also bought Modcloth, the e-commerce clothing brand, and Moosejaw, which sells outdoor gear.These investments are part of Walmart\u2019s response to its rival Amazon, which continues to dominate online retail.The bet with the mattress and bedding line is that women, in particular, will be drawn to the convenience and premium style of the new brand, which is carefully curated on the website.Walmart is offering two mattresses \u2014 one soft version and one firm. They range in price from $495 for a twin to $1,035 for a king.In recent years, there has been a boom in upstart mattress sellers like Casper and Leesa, which have sold their products primarily online. Their success showed that many customers were willing to buy a mattress without trying it first in a store.But even some of these companies have teamed up with large conventional retailers like Target and Pottery Barn to offer their mattresses in stores. Amazon also sells mattresses and bedding.Arlyn Davich, who founded an online service that helps lower-income people with financial planning and nutrition, will run the Allswell bedding line for Walmart.Allswell will allow customers a 100-day trial of the mattress and will not charge for returns, a standard practice for online mattress sellers.The retailer will also haul away a shopper\u2019s old mattress when the new one is delivered for a $50 fee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Tax Cuts Hurt This Manufacturer. It Kept On Lobbying.", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLATHAM, N.Y. \u2014 By noon on Wednesday, the snow was ankle-deep in the parking lot and the workers had abandoned the factory floor at Plug Power to escape the storm. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells meant for forklifts in Amazon or Walmart warehouses sat half-finished in steel casings.The empty plant was a weather fluke, but to the 300 employees in this town outside Albany, it might have been an omen of the company\u2019s fate, which was resting in the hands of Washington lawmakers.The $1.5 trillion tax bill President Trump signed into law last year failed to extend a crucial tax credit for fuel-cell makers such as Plug Power, putting the company\u2019s domestic future in jeopardy. As workers drove home that afternoon to ride out the storm, a flurry of hope was swirling as Congress hashed out a bipartisan budget deal that company leaders hoped would reinstate the fuel-cell tax credit.An extension of the credit would allow Plug Power\u2019s executives to continue their recent expansion in the United States. Without it, the 20-year old company would shift resources to China and Germany, potentially leaving the workers here out in the cold.The giant tax bill ushered in the most significant changes to the tax code in decades, with the aim of helping businesses grow and flourish. But Washington has a long history of picking winners and losers through the tax code \u2014 even in bills meant to simplify it \u2014 and Plug Power\u2019s experience demonstrates just how much power Congress wields over companies who build businesses based in part on policy decisions.For more than two years, Plug Power\u2019s president and chief executive, Andy Marsh, had spent a chunk of his working hours advocating a long-term extension of the credit. The company spent more than $750,000 during that period to lobby Congress. Early in the day on Wednesday, Mr. Marsh said he was 65 percent certain the tax credit would make it into the budget deal. Around lunchtime, he put the odds at 35 percent.While Mr. Marsh prepared to follow his workers out the door, his chief operating officer, Keith Schmid, took a visitor on a last walk across the now-silent plant.\u201cI\u2019m a little spooked by how quiet it is today,\u201d he said.An hour later, his reprieve arrived. Congress cut a deal to extend the credit.For years, Washington has set tax policy in fits and starts, creating targeted tax breaks for particular industries and often setting them to expire, to minimize the projected loss to federal revenues. Yet those credits are routinely extended on a temporary basis, creating a maddening dance for companies who struggle to plan and invest for the long term.Economists generally agree that the process is detrimental to companies and the economy. Expiring tax breaks give companies an incentive to plow money into lobbying to retain those preferences, rather than putting that money toward research and development, worker training or other investments that might improve their productivity. Free-market purists also contend that targeted tax breaks distort markets, propping up firms that otherwise might fail, just because they have government connections.But try as they might, policymakers in Washington cannot quit the short-term credit game.In 2005, President George W. Bush signed a law that created a 30 percent credit for investing in fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to create an electric current. Congress extended the credit twice after that. But it eventually set the credit, along with similar incentives for solar, wind and other clean energy sources, to expire at the end of 2016.Industry lobbyists worked hard to prevent the expiration, and in 2015, lawmakers extended some solar and wind credits but allowed the fuel cell credit to die as scheduled.The industries whose credits expired never stopped working to get them back. Some members of Congress took up their cause, such as Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York, who drafted a bill to reinstate \u2014 and gradually phase out \u2014 the energy credits that had been \u201corphaned\u201d by the 2015 bill.Mr. Reed nearly succeeded in getting those extensions attached to the sprawling tax bill that Republicans sped through Congress last fall. But his provision was dropped from the bill as it moved through the Senate, and thus never made it to Mr. Trump for his signature.The disappearance of the credit threatened the domestic expansion of Plug Power, a company founded in the late 1990s in the midst of the tech boom, whose stock briefly topped $1,000 a share. The bubble popped, the firm\u2019s shares sunk to single digits and the company burned through money, seeking a marketable use for its fuel cells, which cost more than conventional competitors but emit nothing but water as a byproduct. Mr. Marsh took over in 2008 and finally steered the firm into what has become a profitable niche: replacing the large batteries that power forklifts in warehouses.Forklifts that run on fuel cells do not need to swap out batteries every shift, like those that run on lead-acid batteries. They plug into a fuel station that looks like a gasoline pump, connect a few hoses and quickly fill up with hydrogen. Plug Power has found a growing market in selling or leasing those fuel cells to Amazon, Walmart, Kroger and B.M.W., among others, and it has begun piloting fuel-cell powered delivery trucks in China and around Albany.When the credit expired, Mr. Marsh said, the price of buying one of the company\u2019s fuel cells immediately jumped 30 percent for customers. Some of those customers, he added, have budgets set aside for alternative energy spending \u2014 and in those cases, solar and wind projects, which still were backed by credits, were suddenly more attractive.The recent tax law compounded the problem, because it made it more expensive for Plug Power to get financing. When the law was signed in December, Mr. Marsh said one of his lenders called and told him his borrowing costs were going up.\u201cWe just want a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Marsh said on Wednesday. He occasionally checked his phone for updates from his lobbying team in Washington. He loves the Albany region and hopes to expand here, he said, but he noted that China and Germany loomed as attractive markets, and said the company would more aggressively explore expansion there \u2014 and perhaps resource relocation \u2014 if the tax credit did not return.\u201cWe have a business plan if it goes one way, and a business plan if it goes the other way, and we\u2019ll execute what makes sense,\u201d Mr. Marsh said. \u201cI don\u2019t get paid to be nervous.\u201dIn Washington, the lobbying team had little ability left to sway the outcome. Trade groups representing Plug Power and other energy companies had pressed for two years to extend the credit, as had the lobbyists on contract for the company. They had lined up powerful allies for the measure, including Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the minority leader. The lobbyists spent Wednesday mostly trying to scare up news from the closed-door negotiations in the Capitol to see if their work had paid off.At midday, Mr. Marsh was told that the fuel cell credit was not yet in the bill, but discussions were ongoing. Around that time, executives decided to send Plug Power workers home to escape the snow.Word finally arrived from Washington later that day about the deal: The credit was in the budget deal, retroactive to 2017 and phased down through 2022. The industry had gotten exactly what it wanted \u2014 at least for now. Mr. Marsh, in an email, said that he was excited and thankful: \u201cIt is time for our sales team to let our customers know that our products are now available with the tax credit, and go push sales and growth in the U.S.\u201dMany conservative groups protested the inclusion. Several groups in the powerful Koch network sent a letter to congressional leaders, saying the budget deal had \u201copened the floodgates to massive increases in government spending and corporate welfare for powerful and well-connected special interests.\u201dSome of those interests fared better than others: Most of the 48 \u201ctax extenders\u201d tucked into the budget deal \u2014 including special tax treatment for race horse owners and timber companies \u2014 were one-year extensions retroactive for 2017 only. Congress will presumably take them up again in future negotiations.The deal passed the Senate and House early on Friday morning, after a brief but contentious debate. Mr. Marsh was off to Argentina for vacation, but he reported that the roads had been cleared around Albany, and the factory floor was humming again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spanish Artwork Denounced Political \u2018Persecution.\u2019 It Was Ordered Removed.", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Whether by law or intimidation, Spain has become a country where the risks of free expression have quietly mounted in recent years.On Wednesday, the chill entered the realm of contemporary art, when Madrid\u2019s main exhibition center ordered that a work labeling Catalonia\u2019s separatist leaders as political prisoners be removed from an international arts fair.The exhibition center, known as Ifema, is controlled by the regional and local governments of Madrid, though it remains unclear who exactly decided to order the removal of the work, \u201cContemporary Spanish Political Prisoners,\u201d by the artist Santiago Sierra.The exhibition center said in a statement that it had vetoed the piece \u2014 a series of blurred facial images \u2014 because it would undermine the \u201cvisibility\u201d of other works at the fair, known as Arco, which opened this week.The decision comes as other artists have landed in legal trouble for works seen as insulting Spain\u2019s political and royal establishment, or deemed to glorify terrorism and other acts of violence.On Tuesday, the Spanish Supreme Court upheld a prison sentence of three and a half years for Josep Miquel Arenas Beltr\u00e1n, a rapper, on charges of insulting the monarchy and condoning terrorism in lyrics that include imagery of violence against authorities.The artist, who performs under the name of Valtonyc, said he would appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, saying he was being made \u201ca political prisoner,\u201d a notion not easily dismissed in a country whose history includes fascist dictatorship.\u201cIn my home and my gallery, nobody can luckily get me to take down anything, but this is a public space,\u201d she said. Of the attention caused by Wednesday\u2019s order, she added jokingly, \u201cI have the gallery since 1980 and I\u2019ve never been as popular as this morning.\u201d\u201cContemporary Spanish Political Prisoners\u201d includes the partially obscured portraits of Catalan politicians jailed since late last year while awaiting trial on charges of sedition and rebellion for leading the northeastern region\u2019s drive to break from Spain.Beside the portraits of Catalan politicians, Mr. Sierra\u2019s work also shows blurred images of several other people prosecuted under contentious circumstances in recent years.That case was part of a shift under the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which introduced a much criticized public security law in 2015 intended to control the spread of mass protests during the financial crisis.The government also strengthened an existing law against inciting terrorism and violence, raising the prison sentence for first-time offenders and leading to the prosecution of several people for offensive messages posted on social media, as well as some rappers and comedians.The exhibition center did not point to any violation of law in saying that Mr. Sierra\u2019s work was being removed. As host of the fair, the center said it had a duty to avoid \u201cdiscourses that deviate attention away from the whole of the fair.\u201dBut the director of the fair sought to distance himself from the order, saying it was not his decision, and politicians started squabbling on Wednesday over whether Mr. Sierra\u2019s work should be reinstalled.In a statement, the artist\u2019s studio suggested that the \u201ccensorship\u201d of the work vindicated Mr. Sierra\u2019s efforts to denounce a clampdown on freedom of expression in Spain.\u201cThis decision seriously damages the image of this international arts fair and of the Spanish state itself,\u201d it said. \u201cActs like this one give sense and reason to a work like this one, which precisely denounced the climate of persecution that cultural workers have been suffering in recent times.\u201dAttempts at suppressing works can prove counterproductive, though. In one case, a judge halted distribution of a book that linked the former mayor of a northwest town to drug trafficking after the official sued the author, Nacho Carretero, and disputed the accusation. The book has shot up Amazon\u2019s best-seller list in Spain.While Ms. de Alvear, the director of the gallery, was pleased at the attention she got, she said the fuss was misplaced.\u201cSpanish people really shouldn\u2019t be so political,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is only a work of art, and everybody should be free to think whatever they want about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

By owning the rest of Sky, 21st Century Fox would be better positioned to take on the likes of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming giants.In 2011, Mr. Murdoch was forced to withdraw a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky as a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain. The scandal eventually led to the closing of The News of the World, the first newspaper Mr. Murdoch acquired in Britain in the late 1960s.21st Century Fox had hoped to complete the Sky deal before the Disney sale was finalized. But Comcast\u2019s move just adds uncertainty to an already complicated process.Disney, which declined to comment on Comcast\u2019s proposal, must now decide how much it cares about Sky. It is also not clear if Disney would want to end up being partners with Comcast, in the event that Comcast wins majority control of Sky and Disney ultimately has Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake.Comcast has circled 21st Century Fox in the past. Last year, the cable giant was in preliminary talks to buy the entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the minority stake in Sky. Disney ultimately prevailed.At the very least, Comcast has most likely made it more expensive for 21st Century Fox to buy all of Sky. Under the terms of its proposed bid, Comcast said, it would pay 12.50 pounds, about $17.50, a share in cash. That would represent a premium of 13 percent over its closing price on Monday and is about 16 percent above 21st Century Fox\u2019s current offer of \u00a310.75.On Tuesday, shares of the British broadcaster jumped by nearly one-fifth. The stock surge suggested investors expected 21st Century Fox to back away or come back with an even better offer.Comcast shareholders seemed less pleased. The company\u2019s stock price dropped more than 6 percent in midday trading, to about $37. Disney shares fell 4 percent, to about $105.50, and Fox shares declined 2.6 percent, to about $37.80.An influential media analyst, Craig Moffett, who follows Comcast for MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note that the Sky offer had positive aspects, including offering Comcast\u2019s entertainment unit, NBCUniversal, broader distribution in Europe.Still, \u201cComcast will have to twist themselves into knots to explain why satellite distribution won\u2019t be just as obsolete in Europe as it already is in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Moffett said. \u201cPerhaps worst of all, this morning\u2019s bid doesn\u2019t really put to rest the idea that they might still try a topping bid for Fox\u2019s U.S. assets, including the rest of Sky\u201d if the Justice Department ends up approving AT&T\u2019s takeover of Time Warner.\u201cThe notion that Comcast might make a topping bid for Fox has weighed heavily on Comcast shares,\u201d he added.For either Comcast or Disney, Sky offers a platform for international expansion.\u201cWe look at Sky as a media company: Sky News, Sky Sports, Sky Movies,\u201d Brian L. Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous presence in the content creation, not just the distribution.\u201dIn a research note on Tuesday, Polo Tang, a UBS analyst, said that Sky could be \u201cstrategically interesting\u201d to a variety of bidders, given its content and its broadcast and streaming distribution network. It also recently retained the rights to the Premier League at a lower cost than analysts had expected.Mr. Tang said that the benign outcome of the Premier League auction potentially \u201cgives Fox scope to raise its offers.\u201dComcast said it was seeking control of more than half of Sky\u2019s shares with Tuesday\u2019s offer but was ultimately interested in acquiring all of the British broadcaster.Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s the largest momentum swing in history \u2014 and it\u2019s not particularly close.\u201dThe bigger pictureThe cause of one of the most turbulent weeks in recent memory appeared to be widespread expectations that the global economy is improving and that growth would accelerate in the near future.That has led to fears that interest rate increases could cheapen the value of certain kinds of investments.More on the markets and economyNearly 70 percent of S.&P. 500 companies have reported results so far, and profits are on pace to grow 14 percent, according to FactSet. Analysts expected earnings to rise 11 percent at the end of the fourth quarter.\u2022 If that growth rate holds up, it would mark the third quarter of double-digit earnings growth in the past four.\u2022 All 11 of the S.&P. 500\u2019s sectors are reporting higher profits, and five sectors have reported double-digit gains.\u2022 74 percent of companies are announcing earnings above Wall Street estimates.\u2022 79 percent are reporting sales above forecasts.\u2022 S.&P. 500 companies that generate more than 50 percent of their sales abroad are on pace to report a 17.4 percent increase in their bottom lines. For those that get the majority of their revenue from within the United States, earnings are set to rise 12 percent.Nearly a year after Waymo first accused the ride-hailing company of plotting to steal important self-driving car technology, the two companies have settled their courtroom fight.After four days of arguments in Federal District Court here, Uber agreed to provide Waymo with 0.34 percent of its stock.

The government saw Mr. Lee as so pivotal to its Olympic dreams that after he was convicted of tax evasion in 2008, the country\u2019s president then pardoned him expressly so he could resume lobbying for Pyeongchang.So extraordinary is the overlap between Samsung, South Korea and the Pyeongchang Games it is unlikely to be repeated, say IOC members and Olympics experts. Mr. Lee\u2019s lobbying and Samsung\u2019s close involvement are now considered inappropriate by some Olympics experts and voters.After Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even in the shadow of Facebook and Google, Peter Eavis writes:The tech flyaroundAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "NASA Budgets for a Trip to the Moon, but Not While Trump Is President", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInstead, it aims to give the private sector a greater role, according to a budget proposal to be released on Monday.The administration is also looking to end American payments for the International Space Station by 2025. The space station is currently scheduled to operate through 2024, but the expectation was that it would be extended through at least 2028.The budget numbers were confirmed by a person who was not authorized to talk publicly about them.In future years, the administration would like NASA\u2019s spending to drop to $19.6 billion and stay flat through 2023. With inflation, NASA\u2019s buying power would erode, effectively a budget cut each year.A NASA spokesman said he could not discuss the budget proposal until it was released.The proposal is just an opening bid. Congress decides the final spending numbers, sometimes adjusting them or ignoring a president\u2019s priorities. But an administration\u2019s wishes are often incorporated.Additionally, no one has been nominated for the No. 2 position, deputy administrator.\u201cI hope that those reports prove as unfounded as Bigfoot,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness, said on Wednesday during a Federal Aviation Administration conference on commercial space transportation.He decried \u201cnumbskulls\u201d at the Office of Management and Budget in the White House for coming up with the idea. \u201cAs a fiscal conservative, you know one of the dumbest things you can do?\u201d he said. \u201cCanceling programs after billions in investment when there is still serious usable life in it.\u201dThe same conference was attended by Scott Pace, the executive secretary of Mr. Pence\u2019s space council. While he did not discuss details of the budget, Mr. Pace suggested that money needed to be freed up for new initiatives.For NASA to push human spaceflight further, he said, \u201cthe kinds of commitment of resources that traditionally we\u2019ve done in low-earth orbit, we can direct some of that toward deeper space exploration.\u201dThe budget proposal promises \u201ca seamless transition to the use of future commercial capabilities,\u201d and allocates $150 million in 2019 to encourage commercial development in low-Earth orbit.The administration proposes $900 million for this goal through 2023. If structured like earlier NASA public-private partnerships, like the ones for carrying cargo and crew to the space station, the money would be split between two or more companies.By contrast, the United States has spent close to $100 billion building and operating the International Space Station.But space experts so far do not see how that would be viable economically because NASA currently spends $3 billion to $4 billion a year.\u201cI haven\u2019t really seen anyone talking about that,\u201d said Tommy Sanford, the executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group representing many of the new space companies. \u201cI think that\u2019d be difficult.\u201dMr. Sanford said the federation was concerned about setting a specific end date. He said it would be better to define benchmarks that commercial alternatives would need to achieve before the International Space Station is retired.In recent years, more companies have started using the station in areas like pharmaceutical research and manufacturing of fiber optical cable.\u201cIf we abruptly end that, without a smooth transition plan,\u201d John Elbon, vice president and general manager of space exploration at Boeing, said at last week\u2019s conference, \u201call that investment will be for naught.\u201dFor a greater focus on the moon, the budget plan describes investing in commercial companies to develop and fly robotic landers to carry experiments and other payloads to the moon.Those companies could include Moon Express and Astrobotic Technology, two companies originally created to compete for a $20 million grand prize in the Google Lunar X Prize. The X Prize Foundation conceded last month that none of the remaining competitors would be able to reach the moon before the prize expires on March 31. Both companies still plan to head to the moon in the next couple of years.In addition, Blue Origin, a space company started by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has proposed a larger lander called Blue Moon that could deliver several tons of cargo to the surface of the moon.Efforts to increase research and development aimed at next-generation space technologies for a range of human and robotic missions, one of the priorities of the Obama administration\u2019s space policy, would be refocused on nearer-term development on moon missions.For astronauts, the goal is still to reach \u201cthe vicinity of the moon\u201d in 2023. That is the current schedule for the first crewed launch of the Space Launch System, which would fly around the moon but not land.Under the proposed timeline, work on a lander would not start until that year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ground Control to Major Mom", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI Was MisinformedMy mother, who has dementia, has wanted to travel to Mars for some time now, and for a day or two it looked like she might be getting her chance, metaphorically speaking. Her heart was not working well, her breathing was labored, there was a call from the nursing-home doctor, who brought up the subject of hospice.This happened the same week Elon Musk was sending a red sports car with a make-believe driver into space.\u201cMy mother no longer seems to be as crazy as she once did,\u201d I tell my friend Herb. \u201cHer insanity is converging with Elon Musk\u2019s. She and a Tesla may be blasting off at the same time.\u201dMy mother\u2019s crisis is averted by antibiotics. The next day I am at the nursing home with videos of the Falcon Heavy SpaceX launch because, like I say, space travel is Ma\u2019s thing.\u201cDoes this Elon Musk know about me?\u201d Ma says, because in the Ma universe, even before the stroke and the dementia, life revolved around Ma.\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Ma,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s been very busy, getting this thing up there. They shot it up from what used to be Cape Kennedy. You remember we went there once?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll write him a letter and tell him I want to go,\u201d Ma says.The mysteries of the human brain \u2014 I am talking about Ma\u2019s now, not Elon Musk\u2019s. Before her stroke three years ago, my mother was an adventurous traveler, going to the Amazon, the Nile, the Gal\u00e1pagos. Now she\u2019s planning on being among the first visitors to Mars, although lately she\u2019s been worrying about the flight taking off without her. My brothers and I tell her that won\u2019t happen, Mars isn\u2019t ready for tourism.But distinguishing fantasy and reality is harder these days, so here I am at the nursing home, showing Ma the photo of Elon Musk\u2019s red Roadster in space, with a guy who for all she knows could be Buzz Aldrin at the wheel.\u201cNow remember, this isn\u2019t a real person, Ma,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a mannequin in a spacesuit. The car isn\u2019t actually going to Mars, it\u2019s going to be circling the sun like Mars and Earth. We\u2019re in the same orbit.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Ma says.This was Mom\u2019s medical condition when I got the call from the nursing home doctor: Bronchitis, the chronic obstructive lung disease getting worse, shortness of breath, and of course her longstanding heart disease and diabetes. There was also a discussion about whether hospice or hospital was preferred.\u201cDo you believe we\u2019re looking at the beginning of a dying situation here?\u201d I had asked.\u201cNo,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking at a change of status, and it could go either way.\u201dI do think it\u2019s the beginning of the end for my mother \u2014 not this week or even this month, but I do see a sharper downward trajectory. My mother is sleepier these days, more likely to zone out, more anxious. We do not discuss her death, but I know she believes in some sort of afterlife. I do not.Still there seems to be an image associated with death, of an ascension upward, which many people share. I experienced it years ago myself. I had had an abortion, the psychological aftermath of which was not as simple as I thought it would be, and when I got home, sleeping off the anesthesia, I dreamed of a large cinder, a life that had been snuffed out before it had the opportunity to happen, shooting through space.Why was that image of a snuffed-out life moving through space? Why wasn\u2019t it buried in the ground? I understand that nobody wants to dwell on the decay and rot that is a certainty, but why does so much death imagery have to do with moving skyward? One could almost believe there was a biological memory dating to the big bang:Wowza! Did you see that magnificent galactic explosion? I can\u2019t help thinking it\u2019s the beginning of something big. My mother the galaxy. From star stuff I came and to star stuff I shall return. But first, I\u2019d like to grow a face and see Paris. My mother was active in two synagogues when she lived in Florida, and one of the things she did was prepare bodies for burial. It\u2019s not disturbing, she told me; it\u2019s an honor. You wash them, you dress them in a shroud, you sit with them until they\u2019re buried so they\u2019re not alone. That traditional Jewish burial was what I figured Ma would want for herself.It occurs to me now, however, with Ma\u2019s Mars fixation, that she might, when the time comes, enjoy being cremated and shot into space. \u201cEnjoy\u201d probably isn\u2019t the word, but you know what I\u2019m saying.But I can\u2019t see discussing this with Ma. The days are over when she talked about death as another adventure. She is suggestible now, vulnerable to unhappy stories \u2014 the other day it was \u201cKing Kong.\u201d She didn\u2019t say what upset her, but what could it be other than the tragic, persecuted Kong, furry as the kittens and puppies Ma sometimes thinks sleep with her, in his death spiral off the Empire State Building.And of course, there\u2019s that problem with dementia; who\u2019s in charge, Pre-Stroke, Adventure Travel Ma or Nursing Home Ma?Actually, the person who is in charge is me. I am my mother\u2019s medical advocate, I will have the final word about how it will end, in a hospital or hospice: in a nest of tubes or with a hospice musician playing show tunes? With me telling Ma that Mars is not ready for tourism, or saying I got a call from Elon Musk and he has readied a rocket just for her?I lean toward a journey that will take her toward the stars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Workers Slack Off, the Wristband Will Know. (And Amazon Has a Patent for It.)", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 What if your employer made you wear a wristband that tracked your every move, and that even nudged you via vibrations when it judged that you were doing something wrong?What if your supervisor could identify every time you paused to scratch or fidget, and for how long you took a bathroom break?Amazon, which rarely discloses information on its patents, could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.In theory, Amazon\u2019s proposed technology would emit ultrasonic sound pulses and radio transmissions to track where an employee\u2019s hands were in relation to inventory bins, and provide \u201chaptic feedback\u201d to steer the worker toward the correct bin.The aim, Amazon says in the patent, is to streamline \u201ctime consuming\u201d tasks, like responding to orders and packaging them for speedy delivery. With guidance from a wristband, workers could fill orders faster.Critics say such wristbands raise concerns about privacy and would add a new layer of surveillance to the workplace, and that the use of the devices could result in employees being treated more like robots than human beings.Current and former Amazon employees said the company already used similar tracking technology in its warehouses and said they would not be surprised if it put the patents into practice.Max Crawford, a former Amazon warehouse worker in Britain, said in a phone interview, \u201cAfter a year working on the floor, I felt like I had become a version of the robots I was working with.\u201dHe described having to process hundreds of items in an hour \u2014 a pace so extreme that one day, he said, he fell over from dizziness.\u201cThere was no time to go to the loo,\u201d he said, using the British slang for toilet. \u201cYou had to process the items in seconds and then move on. If you didn\u2019t meet targets, you were fired.\u201dHe worked back and forth at two Amazon warehouses for more than two years and then quit in 2015 because of health concerns, he said: \u201cI got burned out.\u201dMr. Crawford agreed that the wristbands might save some time and labor, but he said the tracking was \u201cstalkerish\u201d and feared that workers might be unfairly scrutinized if their hands were found to be \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d\u201cThey want to turn people into machines,\u201d he said. \u201cThe robotic technology isn\u2019t up to scratch yet, so until it is, they will use human robots.\u201dMany companies file patents for products that never see the light of day. And Amazon would not be the first employer to push boundaries in the search for a more efficient, speedy work force. Companies are increasingly introducing artificial intelligence into the workplace to help with productivity, and technology is often used to monitor employee whereabouts.Initially, more than 50 out of 80 staff members at its headquarters in River Falls, Wis., volunteered.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Would a Qualcomm Takeover Be Bad for San Diego?", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, an economics reporter based in California. Qualcomm is not just a big employer. The company and its co-founders have showered San Diego with hundreds of millions of dollars in charitable donations. Irwin Jacobs, Qualcomm\u2019s co-founder and original chief executive, has his name on buildings across town.Still, there is not much San Diego can do to influence Qualcomm\u2019s future. While cities spend millions trying to lure new companies and attract big investments like Amazon\u2019s newest headquarters, takeover battles are purely corporate affairs. San Diego\u2019s civic boosters and economic development agencies have resigned themselves to spectating.\u201cWe\u2019re getting flooded day in, day out from San Diegans wondering what we are doing about Qualcomm,\u201d said Mark Cafferty, chief executive of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation. \u201cBut in reality, this is major shareholder stuff that we as a region aren\u2019t going to solve by holding a rally and saying how great Qualcomm is.\u201dBut how much do big companies actually matter to a city? Not as much as small companies.Big companies certainly have their benefits. They are generous philanthropists and tend to have more stable employment, so they help cities weather downturns. But over the past 50 years economists have shown that urban growth is much more highly correlated with the prevalence of small companies, suggesting that entrepreneurship is more important than big employers for a city\u2019s long-run prosperity, according to Edward Glaeser, an economics professor at Harvard who studies cities.The good news for San Diego is that it has entrepreneurship in spades. The city is a center of start-up activity and venture capital investment, so while it does not have big recognizable companies \u2014 like Los Angeles does with its Hollywood studios or San Francisco with its tech giants \u2014 in the long run, Qualcomm or no Qualcomm, the city seems to be doing just fine.\u201cWe\u2019ve lived under the shadow of L.A. and San Francisco for a long time,\u201d said Jerry Sanders, the city\u2019s mayor from 2005 to 2012 and now chief executive of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe have chosen a different path. Small business and smaller organizations are the ones that have made their way in San Diego, and I think that we take great pride in that.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Think you are bad at math?

{"Headline": "A Good Health Care Deal, but Only for Some", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHere\u2019s the good news about the announcement this week that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase are forming a new company to cover health care for their employees: If you\u2019re one of the million-plus people who work at these companies, or a family member of one, you\u2019re likely to get cheaper, better health care pretty soon.Here\u2019s the bad news: If you\u2019re one of the approximately 300 million other Americans, you might not see savings for a long time, if ever. And in the short term at least, you could be hit by bigger medical bills.Together, these three behemoth corporations will be able to wrest great deals and discounts in their negotiations from hospital systems, drug manufacturers, medical device makers and doctors\u2019 groups. These are likely to be better deals than what lesser companies can wrangle.Now, with Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon forming a new health care company, employers will have an intimidating proxy warrior in their battles over the $3 trillion United States health care market.Medicare, by law, is not allowed to negotiate discounts on drug prices. But you can bet Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire will. Millions of American companies do not have the power, knowledge or data to drive down prices charged by labs or hospitals. But this new company most likely will.Recent history shows that when the medical system loses income from one sector (in this case, three huge corporations), it is adept at making up for it in another. As the Goliaths wrestle over how much they should pay or be paid, the Davids \u2014 small companies, individuals who purchase their own insurance and the uninsured \u2014 are often left footing the bill.Those bills can be astronomical, like $5,000 for an M.R.I. scan or $100,000 for knee replacement surgery. Hospital systems argue that they have to charge such prices because government insurers \u2014 Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 don\u2019t pay enough to cover their costs. Medicare disputes that. And \u201ccovering their costs\u201d is a fungible calculation that can include multimillion-dollar executive salaries.Commercial insurers negotiate down from those high prices. But while good negotiators can get great deals, others will miss out. And the uninsured often get bills \u2014 and collection notices \u2014 asking them to pay the highest prices of all.The pharmaceutical industry knows it will need Amazon to deliver drugs. Hospitals might want Chase to finance equipment purchases. And who would dare alienate Warren Buffett, who has called health care costs \u201ca hungry tapeworm on the American economy\u201d? The three titans are also likely to insist that the best hospitals \u2014 the Sloan Ketterings and Cleveland Clinics \u2014 be available to their workers.Yes, they may use technology in smarter ways to benefit patients. This might include home monitoring of heart rhythms and blood sugar; diagnosing via telemedicine and iPad; delivering prescription medicines to doorsteps; and bringing medicine into the 21st century with online billing and payment. They may also be able to provide employees some degree of pricing transparency so that they can make better choices.In doing so they will probably be able to reduce the high administrative costs associated with our health care system, an estimated 25 percent of hospital spending, and give patients more control of their care.How can the rest of us get in on the deal? If the new health care company permits outside firms and individuals to buy into whatever they create, that could set off a revolution. That new company would, essentially, become a novel insurer \u2014 although one that is cheaper, more efficient and patient-friendly. And that could be good for the entire health care system.But what if the three corporations try to turn their health care company into a profit center? This week\u2019s announcement said the new company is \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d That doesn\u2019t quite say \u201cnonprofit.\u201d If the long-term game plan of the Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire offshoot is to function as a business that is sold to the rest of us to please shareholders, then we may end up pretty much back where we started. And that is not where we want to be.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How to kill off a bank quietly.\u2022 Snap just lost nearly $2 billion in market value.\u2022 The new tax law is having implications beyond America\u2019s borders.\u2022 The Supreme Court helps define what a whistle-blower must do.\u2022 Newell Brands named three new directors as it fights with Starboard Value.\u2022 Broadcom and Qualcomm are getting feistier in their deal fight.The Trump administration has mostly taken a softer stance toward Wall Street, but on Wednesday, it suggested a regulatory change designed to make life harder for the big banks.This approach rests on turning pre-existing debt owed by a bank\u2019s holding company into new equity at the subsidiaries where the bank does all its business. The theory: If a reassuringly large amount of new equity were created at the subsidiaries, the banks\u2019 creditors and trading partners would feel protected and not withdraw. Indeed, the Treasury says this would eliminate the incentive for counterparties to run.\u2014 Peter EavisEarlier this week analysts at Citi became the latest to downgrade the stock over the negative reaction.Mark May of Citi wrote:\u201cWhile the recent redesign of its flagship app could produce positive long-term benefits, the significant jump in negative app reviews since the redesign was pushed out a few weeks could result in a decline in users and user engagement, which could negatively impact financial results.\u201dEuropean banks with significant operations in New York and other parts of the United States have seen multi-billion dollar hits on their results in the fourth quarter as a result.Changes in corporate tax rates have forced European lenders \u2013 and their American counterparts \u2013 to recognize so-called deferred tax assets at the end of last year.But, the pain is expected to be short term as most banks, including Barclays and UBS, anticipate the tax rate for their United States operations will be lower future.As earnings season edges toward a close, here is the impact on some of Europe\u2019s largest lenders:\u2022 Barclays reported an annual loss of 1.9 billion pounds, or about $2.7 billion after it took a series of charges, including \u00a3900 million related to tax changes in the United States. \u201cGiven the group\u2019s substantial U.S. operations, this is expected to result in a reduction of the group\u2019s effective tax rate in 2018 and future periods to mid-20 percent,\u201d the bank said on Thursday.\u2022 Credit Suisse reported a loss of 2.13 billion Swiss francs, or about $2.3 billion, in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 2.23 billion francs in income tax expenses related to the reassessment of its deferred tax assets.\u2022 Deutsche Bank reported a full-year loss of 497 million euros, or about $612 million. John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief executive, said: \u201cOnly a charge related to US tax reform at the end of the year meant that we had to post a full-year after-tax loss.\u201d\u2022 HSBC reported a pretax profit of $17.2 billion for 2017, but took a charge of $1.3 billion to reflect a reevaluation of its deferred tax balances.\u2022 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said its profit was dragged down in the quarter after it was hit by restructuring charges related to its French retail banking network and the impact of tax reforms in France and in the United States.\u2022 UBS fell to a loss in the fourth quarter as a result of a writedown of 2.87 billion francs on deferred tax assets.Keep an eye out for Standard Chartered when it reports its annual results next week.The bank, which is based in Britain, but makes most of its money in Asia, has been recently touting its ability to serve the North American market.\u2014 Chad BrayThe case stems from a lawsuit filed by a would-be whistle-blower, Paul Somers, who says he was fired from Digital Realty Trust in 2014 after complaining internally about accounting irregularities, among other matters.

It applied a simple analysis: \u201cCourts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition \u2014 tell the S.E.C. \u2014 Congress imposed.\u201d By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistle-blowers.What Newell said of the move:These actions are part of Newell Brands\u2019 ongoing refreshment process on behalf of shareholders designed to build a board with the best mix of skills, expertise and experience to support the Newell Brands\u2019 leadership team in accelerating shareholder value creation.\u2014 Michael de la MercedRay Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, thinks so.Last week, Mr. Dalio said: \u201cThe risks of a recession in the next 18-24 months are rising.\u201dDuring an appearance Wednesday at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics, Mr. Dalio said:\u201cI think we are in a pre-bubble stage that could go into a bubble stage ...

Tronc is likely to use the sale proceeds to pay down its debt.\u2014 Sydney EmberAfter days of sometimes wild moves in stock markets, investors on Wall Street refocused on the ongoing strength in the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A sometimes-panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated through the day, and the S.&P. 500 ended Tuesday\u2019s session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs.Investors appeared to reassess whether the previous day\u2019s violent decline\u2014the S.&P. suffered its worst decline since August 2011\u2014reflected actual fundamentals or was merely a long-overdue outbreak of investor jitters.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk higher, as measures of volatility\u2014the ups and downs of stock prices\u2014hit historically low levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop in which growth and inflation remained lackluster, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But the peaceful climb ended over the past week amid worries that solid economic growth in the United States and abroad could be showing early signals of growing inflation pressure. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data\u2014such as the U.S. jobs report on Friday\u2014showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.The Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became the latest prominent company to report solid earnings amidst the market turmoil. The strong numbers support the belief that plunging stock markets do not reflect weakness in the real economy.Disney made $1.89 per share in the last three months of 2017, after excluding a tax benefit. That number is 22 percent higher than the $1.55 per share earnings in the same period of 2016. It is also well in excess of the $1.61 per share that Wall Street analysts had forecast for the latest quarter.Disney did best in its parks and resorts business, which reported $1.35 billion of operating income, which was 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period. The earlier period\u2019s results were somewhat depressed by the impact of Hurricane Matthew, Disney said. In its press release, the company noted that higher profits at its domestic parks and resorts were driven by an increase in guest spending and an increase in attendance, which underscores consumers\u2019 willingness to spend more. On the other hand, the company said parks and resorts are dealing with higher labor costs and other expenses. That may not be lost on investors who are starting to see inflation as a threat to stock prices.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Numbers\u2022 Snap reported revenue rose 72 percent to $285.7 million, easily exceeding the $252.9 million expected by analysts.\u2022 The company lost 13 cents per share, below estimates of 16 cents a share.\u2022 Snap added 8.9 million daily active users for a total of 187 million, compared to the 184.2 million estimated.The ContextSnap\u2019s shares have struggled since its initial public offering in March 2017. The stock fell below its I.P.O price of $17 a share last summer and has remained below that level since. If Snap\u2019s after-hours gains hold up on Wednesday, the stock will be on the cusp of crossing back over its I.P.O. level.The stock market\u2019s slide over the past week has given investors plenty of anxiety.Stocks have lost roughly $4 trillion in value. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 endured their worst point declines in their histories Monday and their largest percentage drops since 2011. C.B.O.E. Volatility Index surged more than 100 percent Monday, the biggest increase in its history.But there are reasons investors shouldn\u2019t get too concerned.Strategists over at Goldman Sachs wrote:\u201cThe stock market correction appears to be more technical and positioning-driven rather than fundamentally-based.We believe the fundamental drivers of the equity market remain intact and reiterate our S&P 500 year-end 2018 forecast of 2850.\u201dHere\u2019s a video of the launch:When stock markets are plunging, sober-minded investors try to gauge the underlying strength of bellwether companies, to see whether all the selling is justified.That is why many eyes will be on the earnings of the Walt Disney Company, which reports after the close of regular trading Tuesday. If the company releases stronger-than-expected results for the three months through the end of December, it will reinforce a general sense of optimism about corporate America .Stellar results from Disney would add to a strong earnings report on Tuesday from General Motors, which helped push the company\u2019s shares 3 percent higher. Micron Technology, a large maker of computer chips, on Monday upped its outlook for the current quarter. Its shares soared 7.7 percent on Tuesday.Though Disney is not a high growth company, its results offer insight into the strength of consumer spending. As a result, if the company reports earnings that are below the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, it may add to the unease among investors..Of course, a lot more companies are going to have to report strong earnings to convince investors to jump back into the stock market. One of the reasons that stocks rallied in recent months is that analysts are expecting a 20-percent plus jump in profits in 2018, an eye-popping rise. The more large companies that hit their numbers in this earnings season, the more likely the stock market will find a floor.\u2014 Peter EavisAt a hearing of the Senate banking committee on Tuesday, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama asked the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the market turmoil.\u201cIs this perhaps more than an ordinary correction?\u201d Mr. Shelby asked.Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C. said that he could not tell what had caused the big declines, but he said that the market infrastructure had held up well under the strain of heavy trading.\u201cAs I sit here today, there\u2019s nothing that came out of this that concerns me,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the C.F.T.C. said that his staff had a late night on Monday checking in with all the exchanges, and had not heard anything that concerned them.\u201cThe system worked as it was designed to do,\u201d he said.\u2014 Nathaniel PopperFollowing a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that he has been in touch with market participants this week and that they are reacting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems. He said it was possible that algorithmic trading was partially responsible for the recent volatility in the stock market.\u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said.Despite that volatility, it does not appear that the Trump administration is ready to give up on the stock market as a measure of its success.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been looking at the long-term impact of the stock market, it\u2019s still up over 30 percent since the election and we continue to think American is a great place to do business,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with companies\u2019 response with more and more investments in the U.S.\u201dAsked about the roiled stock market at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the Trump administration was not concerned and that it remains focused on the long-term trajectory of the economy.\u201cWe are very focused on long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we have enacted, including tax reform are very positive for long-term economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He said that he was closely monitoring for orderly market functioning and that there were \u201cno systemic issues\u201d that were reported to him.\u201cI\u2019m happy to report I got the green lights,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The Treasury secretary said that given how much the market has rallied in the last year, he does not think the recent drop in prices raises financial stability concerns.Asked if the Trump administration will take the blame for the recent drop in stocks after taking credit for the rally, Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\u201cI think we\u2019ll still claim credit for the fact that it\u2019s up over 30 percent since the election,\u201d he said of the stock market.\u2014 Alan RappeportWhen stock markets sell off as they have the past two trading sessions, there is often more than one cause. But one popular trade is taking a lot of blame for Monday\u2019s plunge: short volatility.Investors had piled money into exchange-traded products designed to rise when the C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, falls. The VIX, known as the market\u2019s fear gauge, measures how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead. Those wagers paid off handsomely, rising 180 percent last year as the VIX plumbed historic lows.That quickly reversed Monday. The VIX surged 117 percent in its biggest one-day jump on record and two short volatility exchange-traded product \u2014 VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange Traded Note, XIV, and Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Inverse ETN \u2014 endured heavy selling.From Barclays:\u201cIn our opinion, the significant spike in the VIX index and futures yesterday was technical in nature and does not necessarily indicate a true increase in risk perception.\u201dFrom Morgan Stanley:\u201cThe near bankruptcy of the inverse VIX ETPs will be a very negative headline, and the several billion dollar loss for holders, largely retail, will scare some out of the market or force liquidations of other products to raise cash.\u201dFrom Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research:\u201c Assuming volatility-related ETFs really are a market structure \u201cAchilles heel\u201d, this will take days if not weeks to play out, and there could be other problems waiting in the wings.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u2022 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 5 percent.\u2022 Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 4.7 percent.\u2022 The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was down 2 percent.\u2022 Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d the VIX, is at its highest level in two and a half years.More from Ben White of Politico:\u201cThis is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,\u201d said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. \u201cUntil now, Trump\u2019s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed. Now she\u2019s out the door and volatility is back.\u201dInvestors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down.\u201cCryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,\u201d said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThe combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large.\u201dExpect more give-and-take between the two sides of Congress:\u201cI think everyone understands that this will probably end up being a Ping-Pong situation, and we\u2019ll see where the ball lands,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida.Elsewhere in policyMore from Alex Sherman of CNBC:An unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney\u2019s bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox\u2019s Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox\u2019s assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast.Elsewhere in the deal world\u201cI talked to women engineers at Uber who were getting invited to strip clubs and bondage clubs in the middle of the day. The middle of the day! And often they would go because that\u2019s just what everyone was doing.\u201dThe misconduct flyaroundThe venture firm, which has invested in the likes of Groupon, Dollar Shave Club and Nutanix, has closed both its 12th venture fund, at $800 million, and its latest side fund for later-stage deals, at $450 million.

Now it\u2019s imitating through acquisition, spiriting away the likes of Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes to its well-remunerated plane.The history of TV is one of upstarts and competitors, and my first instinct was to liken Netflix to something like cable, which rose as a serious competitor to broadcast TV in the 1980s.But there\u2019s an important difference between cable channels and Netflix (besides whom you write your check to). Cable channels have brands. That was what made them different from broadcast networks, which tried to be, and had to be, everything. Cable channels had specialties and sensibilities: CNN was news; ESPN was sports; HBO was adult sophistication (give or take an \u201cEntourage\u201d).A cable brand might evolve \u2014 Bravo went from an arts channel to the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d channel \u2014 but the idea was to offer a specific aesthetic to a specific audience.Something for everyone \u2014 that was the ethos of broadcast TV in the old three-network era. The obvious analogy, then, is that Netflix isn\u2019t cable at all; it\u2019s a broadcaster, pitching a big tent.That business imperative had aesthetic results: It gave us family sitcoms and comfort-food cop dramas. It\u2019s less true today, in the era of smaller audiences \u2014 but it\u2019s still much more true of NBC than, say, of IFC.Netflix, on the other hand, is breathtakingly broad and microscopically niche at the same time. It\u2019s selling a platform to everyone, but by providing products for very specific tastes.Netflix assumes a future in which we\u2019re watching our faves on our own screens, rather than gathering around an electronic fireplace \u2014 and as long as the monthly payment clears, it\u2019s all the same to the company. It\u2019s less a big tent than a Dothraki tent city, to borrow a metaphor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dWhat does this mean for Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes? Maybe not much at all. They were both powerful producers with a lot of freedom who will now have a lot of freedom and more money.Mr. Murphy was, in a way, the Netflix-iest of producers to begin with: He\u2019d made everything from a broadcast network sitcom (\u201cThe New Normal\u201d) to an action show (\u201c9-1-1\u201d) to a marquee cable drama (\u201cFeud\u201d) to an HBO film (\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d). He may be able to branch out even more, but he was hardly fettered.What Ms. Rhimes does at Netflix will be interesting. She\u2019s the consummate network TV producer, having essentially defined the current voice of ABC with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201dShe might do something very different with the license of streaming \u2014 but if she doesn\u2019t, that will fit in all the same at Netflix, which resurrected the broadcast favorite \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d with much the same tone, give or take a few curse words. One curious thing about Netflix is that every sensibility \u2014 niche and mass, G-rated and NSFW \u2014 exists on the same platform and the same plane.What I do care about is whether Netflix can nurture original, distinctive art, especially if it continues growing into a huge, all-encompassing alterna-TV.And I worry whether it can do that when derivation is the business strategy itself: selling people new versions of things they already like. It\u2019s fine that Netflix can toss around enough money to reactivate David Letterman. But does it have the kind of culture that could discover a new David Letterman?It may be that Netflix\u2019s approach means more competence and fewer out-and-out stinkers. And I have no reason to believe that Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes will become any less creative because Netflix backed up a money truck.But if Netflix is truly becoming a parallel TV universe, I hope its algorithm finds room for the experimental and untried. It\u2019s hard to be groundbreaking when your whole purpose is to take people where they\u2019ve already been.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Reports Mixed Earnings and a Full Project Pipeline", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 \u201cPardon our pixie dust.\u201dWhen the Walt Disney Company undertakes construction projects at its theme parks, it displays signs with that message as a promise of the magic to come.Disney reported mixed quarterly earnings on Tuesday as losses associated with the development of the planned streaming services \u2014 the first of which, arriving in the spring, will involve ESPN and cost $4.99 a month \u2014 hurt Disney\u2019s cable television division, where operating income fell 1 percent to $858 million. Disney\u2019s movie studio also reported weaker results, as did the company\u2019s consumer products business.On the bright side, operating income increased 21 percent, to $1.35 billion, at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts because of higher attendance and ticket prices at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland Paris, among other properties. (Disney is expected in the coming week to increase ticket prices again, particularly for peak vacation times, as a way to spread out attendance.) Disney Cruise Line also had a strong quarter.Analysts, however, were focused on Disney\u2019s various growth plans during a post-earnings conference call, peppering Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, with questions about the company\u2019s $52.4 billion offer for 21st Century Fox assets last month. He had few specific answers.\u201cWe don\u2019t really have any update on the regulatory front,\u201d Mr. Iger said, adding that he intends to be \u201cpatient\u201d as antitrust officials scrutinize the acquisition. Mr. Iger did say that he had met with several Fox executives in recent weeks, \u201cgaining insight that will be invaluable when it comes to integrating our organizations.\u201dWhen the conversation turned to ESPN Plus, Disney\u2019s sports streaming service, Mr. Iger emphasized that users would be able to personalize their experience. ESPN Plus will exist inside the ESPN app, which is being rebuilt.For its first fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 30, Disney had net income of $4.42 billion, or $2.91 a share, compared with $2.48 billion, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier. Most of the increase was attributable to a $1.6 billion one-time tax benefit associated with the rewrite of the federal tax code. Excluding the tax benefit, Disney had per-share results for the quarter of $1.89. Revenue totaled $15.35 billion, a 4 percent increase.Analysts had predicted per-share profit of $1.61 and revenue of $15.45 billion. Disney shares increased about 3 percent in after-hours trading, to $109.28.The company\u2019s vast television division, Disney Media Networks, has been buffeted by subscriber declines at ESPN, a problem that continued during the quarter as more people cut cable and relied on streaming services like Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. Advertising revenue at ESPN also dropped; Disney cited a timing shift in college football playoff games as one reason. Lackluster ratings at Disney-owned ABC also caused headaches for Disney Media Networks, which reported a 12 percent decline in operating income, to $1.19 billion.Disney\u2019s movie studio had operating income of $829 million, down 2 percent from a year earlier. Box office successes in the quarter included \u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d which collected $852.7 million worldwide (26 percent more than \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d took in a year earlier). But Walt Disney Studios suffered from weaker home entertainment results \u2014 \u201cCars 3\u201d did not sell as well on DVD as \u201cFinding Dory\u201d did a year earlier.An earlier version of this article misstated the price of Disney\u2019s shares following after-hours trading. The price was $109.28, not $106.17.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon and Apple Gush Over Holiday Sales", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 For Apple and Amazon, the holidays are the time to shine, the period when shoppers have the greatest appetite to buy their devices and, in Amazon\u2019s case, anything else that can be stuffed into a box and delivered to homes.During the final few months of last year, neither disappointed.\u201cOur 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,\u201d Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said. \"We don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often \u2014 expect us to double down.\u201dAmazon, a company once known for routinely posting losses, more than doubled its profit thanks to strong growth in its cloud computing division and a newer business for the company \u2014 advertising. It also benefited from a large gain resulting from changes to the United States tax code.For the quarter that ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, net income rose to $1.86 billion, the highest profit in its history and more than double the $749 million from a year earlier. A big part of the increase, $789 million, came from the tax benefit. Revenue jumped 38 percent to $60.45 billion from a year earlier.Amazon\u2019s shares soared nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the results. \u201cAmazon\u2019s best-in-class large-cap growth story remains unchanged,\u201d Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, wrote in a research report.While Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter.Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier.By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion.Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices.Apple, in contrast, is without equal in making profits from tech hardware.For the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter.\u201cCustomer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call.Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones.The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones.Apple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps.Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units.But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season.Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that in light of the new tax code, the company would announce plans for its repatriated cash, including dividends and buybacks, in April.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Brian X. Chen from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philadelphia\u2019s First Step to a Platform of Innovation", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetPHILADELPHIA \u2014 On the west side of this city\u2019s main Amtrak station sits an empty lot. But soon, it will be transformed into a public park filled with lawns, walkways and even redwood trees, in the first stage of one of Philadelphia\u2019s biggest real estate projects.The 1.3-acre park, to be known as Drexel Square, kicks off a 20-year, $3.5 billion development that aims to create a hub for technology and life-sciences companies called Schuylkill (pronounced SKOO-kul) Yards. Not only will the project fill in an underused section of real estate, it is also intended to develop business opportunities for research coming out of Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania, both just a few blocks away.The developer of Schuylkill Yards, named after the river that separates it from Philadelphia\u2019s central business district, plans to convert 14 acres occupied by parking lots and older buildings on land adjacent to the rail yards into an innovation community. It will eventually include seven million square feet of office, laboratory, retail and residential space within walking distance of downtown businesses, attributes that may be attractive to Amazon, which has named Philadelphia as one of 20 finalists in its search for a second headquarters.The development will include 2.8 million square feet of office space, 1.6 million square feet of apartments, one million square feet of lab space and more than 100,000 square feet of retail in buildings that will combine new and refurbished construction. Much of the land is owned by Drexel, whose main campus abuts the site. The university has leased the ground to the developer, Brandywine Realty Trust.Its scale and location will give further impetus to the University City district, a neighborhood in West Philadelphia that houses a complex of academic and research institutions, including Drexel, Penn and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Recent investment in research facilities and student housing in the district has already created one of the fastest-growing areas of the city, said Brandywine\u2019s chief executive, Gerard H. Sweeney.\u201cOur hope was that we could connect the city, eliminating the river as a historic dividing point,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said. \u201cWe hope Schuylkill Yards is going to move the physical perception of the city west.\u201dThe park is a linchpin of the project, Mr. Sweeney said, because the overall intent is to create a livable neighborhood that will attract an educated work force, one that increasingly demands walkable access to offices, shops and homes in a dense urban environment.\u201cSome people think you put a big tall building here right outside the train station,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said during a visit to the park construction site. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to create a platform for excellence, and the way you do that is you invest in public space. You create a place where people want to be.\u201dThe first tenant will be Spark Therapeutics, a five-year-old gene therapy company that has adapted expertise developed at University City\u2019s rich intellectual resources.John Fry, president of Drexel, called Spark\u2019s participation \u201ca major win\u201d for Schuylkill Yards.\u201cHaving Spark as our first tenant signals to everyone that we are going to favor life-sciences companies and high-tech companies,\u201d Mr. Fry said. He added that Spark planned to move into the first renovated building in the new complex in 2018.Mr. Fry said the project differed from innovation districts in other cities by combining the resources of a major university with a major developer. But the real draw was its proximity to a deep talent pool at Drexel, Penn and the University City Science Center, a nonprofit organization that provides resources to entrepreneurs.\u201cThere\u2019s an aggregation of talent in the fastest-growing employment center in the city, and Schuylkill Yards is right in the middle of that,\u201d Mr. Fry said.Bruce J. Katz, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has studied the development of University City, agreed that the project\u2019s proximity to transportation and top research facilities in the heart of a major city was an unusual combination that was likely to attract the significant investment sought by the developer.\u201cThis is an unparalleled opportunity, and very distinct from other innovation hubs,\u201d Mr. Katz said.Many cities have research institutions that are miles from downtown, but Philadelphia has them within walking distance, he said. Because of that, the development project is well positioned to create a nexus of research and commerce that will become a major growth engine for the local economy.\u201cThis parcel is going to be an enormous catalyst for broader-scale regeneration,\u201d Mr. Katz said.He said the attributes of Schuylkill Yards could also be attractive to Amazon, the Seattle-based behemoth. The development would fulfill many of Amazon\u2019s requirements for a second headquarters, including access to transportation, availability of skilled workers and an urban location, Mr. Katz said.But even if Amazon does not choose Schuylkill Yards or two other Philadelphia sites that the city has proposed, the new development is well placed to meet the demands of the businesses that it seeks, he said.\u201cWhat the innovation economy wants is this kind of proximity and density, and Philadelphia is giving it to them, and now they are leveraging it,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cThis whole area where Schuylkill Yards is going to be located is really the platform for that innovative economy.\u201dAn influx of new workers in West Philadelphia would help strengthen the city\u2019s economy. But some critics say it could also drive up real estate prices in adjoining low-income neighborhoods, which have already suffered from gentrification because of demand for housing from college students.Hoping to address those concerns, Brandywine has agreed to help fund affordable housing in local communities, and it is linking local businesses with existing vendors in an attempt to create jobs, Mr. Sweeney said.In addition, the developer has started an apprenticeship program for local people, who will be invited to take courses to meet trade union standards so they can become eligible for employment by Brandywine.Brandywine will provide $5.6 million to community organizations in the first phase of the development, a spokeswoman said. The outreach will also include support for education, housing preservation and minority business development.One of the groups, the Mount Vernon Manor Community Development Corporation, expects to share $3.1 million of the total, said its executive director, Michael Thorpe. Sixty percent of the money will be spent on affordable housing in a neighborhood where housing is already under pressure from the nearby student population.\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing a great deal of pressure for market-rate development, not for affordability,\u201d Mr. Thorpe said. \u201cPeople could be potentially pushed out if we don\u2019t create a program to offset some of that stress.\u201dMr. Sweeney said he hoped that the development\u2019s benefits would spread broadly to a city that for decades was seen by outsiders, and by some of its own people, as an inferior location.\u201cWe were losing population, we weren\u2019t growing jobs, we weren\u2019t attracting young people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look at the attributes that a company should look for to cement its growth for the next 50 years, it\u2019s right here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tyranny of Convenience", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConvenience is the most underestimated and least understood force in the world today. As a driver of human decisions, it may not offer the illicit thrill of Freud\u2019s unconscious sexual desires or the mathematical elegance of the economist\u2019s incentives. Convenience is boring. But boring is not the same thing as trivial.In the developed nations of the 21st century, convenience \u2014 that is, more efficient and easier ways of doing personal tasks \u2014 has emerged as perhaps the most powerful force shaping our individual lives and our economies. This is particularly true in America, where, despite all the paeans to freedom and individuality, one sometimes wonders whether convenience is in fact the supreme value.As Evan Williams, a co-founder of Twitter, recently put it, \u201cConvenience decides everything.\u201d Convenience seems to make our decisions for us, trumping what we like to imagine are our true preferences. (I prefer to brew my coffee, but Starbucks instant is so convenient I hardly ever do what I \u201cprefer.\u201d) Easy is better, easiest is best.Convenience has the ability to make other options unthinkable. Once you have used a washing machine, laundering clothes by hand seems irrational, even if it might be cheaper. After you have experienced streaming television, waiting to see a show at a prescribed hour seems silly, even a little undignified. To resist convenience \u2014 not to own a cellphone, not to use Google \u2014 has come to require a special kind of dedication that is often taken for eccentricity, if not fanaticism.For all its influence as a shaper of individual decisions, the greater power of convenience may arise from decisions made in aggregate, where it is doing so much to structure the modern economy. Particularly in tech-related industries, the battle for convenience is the battle for industry dominance.Americans say they prize competition, a proliferation of choices, the little guy. Yet our taste for convenience begets more convenience, through a combination of the economics of scale and the power of habit. The easier it is to use Amazon, the more powerful Amazon becomes \u2014 and thus the easier it becomes to use Amazon. Convenience and monopoly seem to be natural bedfellows.Given the growth of convenience \u2014 as an ideal, as a value, as a way of life \u2014 it is worth asking what our fixation with it is doing to us and to our country. I don\u2019t want to suggest that convenience is a force for evil. Making things easier isn\u2019t wicked. On the contrary, it often opens up possibilities that once seemed too onerous to contemplate, and it typically makes life less arduous, especially for those most vulnerable to life\u2019s drudgeries.But we err in presuming convenience is always good, for it has a complex relationship with other ideals that we hold dear. Though understood and promoted as an instrument of liberation, convenience has a dark side. With its promise of smooth, effortless efficiency, it threatens to erase the sort of struggles and challenges that help give meaning to life. Created to free us, it can become a constraint on what we are willing to do, and thus in a subtle way it can enslave us.It would be perverse to embrace inconvenience as a general rule. But when we let convenience decide everything, we surrender too much.Convenience as we now know it is a product of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when labor-saving devices for the home were invented and marketed. Milestones include the invention of the first \u201cconvenience foods,\u201d such as canned pork and beans and Quaker Quick Oats; the first electric clothes-washing machines; cleaning products like Old Dutch scouring powder; and other marvels including the electric vacuum cleaner, instant cake mix and the microwave oven.Convenience was the household version of another late-19th-century idea, industrial efficiency, and its accompanying \u201cscientific management.\u201d It represented the adaptation of the ethos of the factory to domestic life.However mundane it seems now, convenience, the great liberator of humankind from labor, was a utopian ideal. By saving time and eliminating drudgery, it would create the possibility of leisure. And with leisure would come the possibility of devoting time to learning, hobbies or whatever else might really matter to us. Convenience would make available to the general population the kind of freedom for self-cultivation once available only to the aristocracy. In this way convenience would also be the great leveler.This idea \u2014 convenience as liberation \u2014 could be intoxicating. Its headiest depictions are in the science fiction and futurist imaginings of the mid-20th century. From serious magazines like Popular Mechanics and from goofy entertainments like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d we learned that life in the future would be perfectly convenient. Food would be prepared with the push of a button. Moving sidewalks would do away with the annoyance of walking. Clothes would clean themselves or perhaps self-destruct after a day\u2019s wearing. The end of the struggle for existence could at last be contemplated.The dream of convenience is premised on the nightmare of physical work. But is physical work always a nightmare? Do we really want to be emancipated from all of it? Perhaps our humanity is sometimes expressed in inconvenient actions and time-consuming pursuits. Perhaps this is why, with every advance of convenience, there have always been those who resist it. They resist out of stubbornness, yes (and because they have the luxury to do so), but also because they see a threat to their sense of who they are, to their feeling of control over things that matter to them.By the late 1960s, the first convenience revolution had begun to sputter. The prospect of total convenience no longer seemed like society\u2019s greatest aspiration. Convenience meant conformity. The counterculture was about people\u2019s need to express themselves, to fulfill their individual potential, to live in harmony with nature rather than constantly seeking to overcome its nuisances. Playing the guitar was not convenient. Neither was growing one\u2019s own vegetables or fixing one\u2019s own motorcycle. But such things were seen to have value nevertheless \u2014 or rather, as a result. People were looking for individuality again.Perhaps it was inevitable, then, that the second wave of convenience technologies \u2014 the period we are living in \u2014 would co-opt this ideal. It would conveniencize individuality.Consider the man of the early 1980s, strolling down the street with his Walkman and earphones. He is enclosed in an acoustic environment of his choosing. He is enjoying, out in public, the kind of self-expression he once could experience only in his private den. A new technology is making it easier for him to show who he is, if only to himself. He struts around the world, the star of his own movie.So alluring is this vision that it has come to dominate our existence. Most of the powerful and important technologies created over the past few decades deliver convenience in the service of personalization and individuality. Think of the VCR, the playlist, the Facebook page, the Instagram account. This kind of convenience is no longer about saving physical labor \u2014 many of us don\u2019t do much of that anyway. It is about minimizing the mental resources, the mental exertion, required to choose among the options that express ourselves. Convenience is one-click, one-stop shopping, the seamless experience of \u201cplug and play.\u201d The ideal is personal preference with no effort.We are willing to pay a premium for convenience, of course \u2014 more than we often realize we are willing to pay. During the late 1990s, for example, technologies of music distribution like Napster made it possible to get music online at no cost, and lots of people availed themselves of the option. But though it remains easy to get music free, no one really does it anymore. Why? Because the introduction of the iTunes store in 2003 made buying music even more convenient than illegally downloading it. Convenient beat out free.As task after task becomes easier, the growing expectation of convenience exerts a pressure on everything else to be easy or get left behind. We are spoiled by immediacy and become annoyed by tasks that remain at the old level of effort and time. When you can skip the line and buy concert tickets on your phone, waiting in line to vote in an election is irritating. This is especially true for those who have never had to wait in lines (which may help explain the low rate at which young people vote).The paradoxical truth I\u2019m driving at is that today\u2019s technologies of individualization are technologies of mass individualization. Customization can be surprisingly homogenizing. Everyone, or nearly everyone, is on Facebook: It is the most convenient way to keep track of your friends and family, who in theory should represent what is unique about you and your life. Yet Facebook seems to make us all the same. Its format and conventions strip us of all but the most superficial expressions of individuality, such as which particular photo of a beach or mountain range we select as our background image.I do not want to deny that making things easier can serve us in important ways, giving us many choices (of restaurants, taxi services, open-source encyclopedias) where we used to have only a few or none. But being a person is only partly about having and exercising choices. It is also about how we face up to situations that are thrust upon us, about overcoming worthy challenges and finishing difficult tasks \u2014 the struggles that help make us who we are. What happens to human experience when so many obstacles and impediments and requirements and preparations have been removed?Today\u2019s cult of convenience fails to acknowledge that difficulty is a constitutive feature of human experience. Convenience is all destination and no journey. But climbing a mountain is different from taking the tram to the top, even if you end up at the same place. We are becoming people who care mainly or only about outcomes. We are at risk of making most of our life experiences a series of trolley rides.An unwelcome consequence of living in a world where everything is \u201ceasy\u201d is that the only skill that matters is the ability to multitask. At the extreme, we don\u2019t actually do anything; we only arrange what will be done, which is a flimsy basis for a life.We need to consciously embrace the inconvenient \u2014 not always, but more of the time. Nowadays individuality has come to reside in making at least some inconvenient choices. You need not churn your own butter or hunt your own meat, but if you want to be someone, you cannot allow convenience to be the value that transcends all others. Struggle is not always a problem. Sometimes struggle is a solution. It can be the solution to the question of who you are.Embracing inconvenience may sound odd, but we already do it without thinking of it as such. As if to mask the issue, we give other names to our inconvenient choices: We call them hobbies, avocations, callings, passions. These are the noninstrumental activities that help to define us. They reward us with character because they involve an encounter with meaningful resistance \u2014 with nature\u2019s laws, with the limits of our own bodies \u2014 as in carving wood, melding raw ingredients, fixing a broken appliance, writing code, timing waves or facing the point when the runner\u2019s legs and lungs begin to rebel against him.Such activities take time, but they also give us time back. They expose us to the risk of frustration and failure, but they also can teach us something about the world and our place in it.So let\u2019s reflect on the tyranny of convenience, try more often to resist its stupefying power, and see what happens. We must never forget the joy of doing something slow and something difficult, the satisfaction of not doing what is easiest. The constellation of inconvenient choices may be all that stands between us and a life of total, efficient conformity.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Buys Ring, Maker of Smart Home Products", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon said Tuesday that it had acquired Ring, a maker of internet-connected doorbells and cameras, pushing more deeply into the home security market.The deal is worth around $1.1 billion, according to a person briefed on the deal who would speak only anonymously because the terms were private.Ring is best known for a doorbell with a security camera inside. The device allows homeowners to monitor visitors at their front door through an app on their phone, even if they\u2019re not at home. Amazon has made home automation a major focus because of the success of its Echo family of products, which allow users to control thermostats, surveillance cameras and other connected devices using voice commands.Amazon\u2019s Echo Spot device already works with Ring doorbells, allowing people to look at footage from the cameras on the Echo Spot\u2019s screen. Amazon had invested an undisclosed amount in Ring through its Alexa Fund, which finances start-ups that integrate their products with Alexa, the Amazon intelligent assistant that powers Echoes and other devices.Buying Ring, though, suggests that Amazon has more ambitious plans for the product than it could achieve through a partnership.Luke Schoenfelder, chief executive of Latch, a start-up that makes a family of smart locks, said he believed that Amazon would make a more serious effort to enter the home security market and compete against companies like ADT, Comcast and Alarm.com. Mr. Schoenfelder speculated that Amazon could seek to make home security part of its Prime membership service, which today includes free and fast delivery of orders and video streaming.\u201cYou could imagine some kind of bundled offering with Ring\u2019s capabilities,\u201d he said.ADT\u2019s stock fell sharply after the deal became public on Tuesday afternoon. It ended the day down 4.6 percent.The companies declined to say much about their plans. \u201cRing\u2019s home security products and services have delighted customers since Day 1,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with this talented team and help them in their mission to keep homes safe and secure.\u201dRing\u2019s statement said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to achieve even more by partnering with an inventive, customer-centric company like Amazon. We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods.\u201dRing\u2019s internet doorbells start at $179. People who want to use them to record video must pay for that capability, with plans starting at $3 a month or $30 a year. The company also makes stand-alone security cameras.Amazon has taken some baby steps into home security. Last year it began selling an indoor security camera of its own design, Amazon Cloud Cam, and in December it acquired Blink, a maker of inexpensive internet security cameras and doorbells.Google, one of Amazon\u2019s biggest rivals, is also an increasingly important player in home automation and security, with its Nest thermostats and security cameras.James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said he believed that Amazon had bought Ring so it could add more intelligent capabilities to its doorbells and cameras, like the ability to use software to recognize faces at the front door.\u201cI think it\u2019s about going to the next level and having Alexa say, \u2018James, your fifth grader just walked in, and I locked the door behind them,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where these technologies have to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Marches Forward on A.I., the White House Is Silent", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "Last summer, China unveiled a plan to become the world\u2019s leader in artificial intelligence, challenging the longtime role of the United States.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In July, China unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence and create an industry worth $150 billion to its economy by 2030.To technologists working on A.I. in the United States, the statement, which was 28 pages long in its English translation, was a direct challenge to America\u2019s lead in arguably the most important tech research to come along in decades. It outlined the Chinese government\u2019s aggressive plan to treat A.I. like the country\u2019s own version of the Apollo 11 lunar mission \u2014 an all-in effort that could stoke national pride and spark agenda-setting technology breakthroughs.\u201cIt is remarkable to see how A.I. has emerged as a top priority for the Chinese leadership and how quickly things have been set into motion,\u201d said Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security who helped translate the manifesto and follows China\u2019s work on artificial intelligence. \u201cThe U.S. plans and policies released in 2016 were seemingly the impetus for the formulation of China\u2019s national A.I. strategy.\u201d\u201cWe are still waiting on the White House to provide some direction\u201d on how to respond to the competition, said Tim Hwang, who worked on A.I. policy at Google and is now the director of the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative, a new organization created by the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and others to fund ethical research in artificial intelligence.American companies like Amazon and Google have done more than anyone to turn A.I. concepts into real products. But for a number of reasons, including concerns that the Trump administration will limit the number of immigrant engineers allowed into the United States, much of the critical research being done on artificial intelligence is already migrating to other countries, including tech hot spots like Toronto, London and Beijing.To China\u2019s growing tech community, driving the industry\u2019s next big thing \u2014 a mantra of Silicon Valley \u2014 is becoming a tantalizing possibility.\u201cThanks to the size of the market and the rapid experimentation, China is going to become one of the most powerful \u2014 if not the most powerful \u2014 A.I. countries in the world,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft and Google executive who now runs a prominent Chinese venture capital firm dedicated to artificial intelligence.The 2016 A.I. reports were shepherded by President Barack Obama\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy.The O.S.T.P., which has overseen science and technology activities across the federal government for more than four decades, is now run by the deputy chief technology officer Michael Kratsios. He had worked as a Wall Street analyst before serving as chief of staff for an investment fund run by Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist who supported Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential run. The administration has yet to name an office director or fill four other assistant posts.In a recent interview, Mr. Kratsios was adamant that any concerns over the administration\u2019s approach to A.I. were unfounded.\u201cArtificial intelligence has been a priority for the Trump administration since Day 1,\u201d he said. Mr. Kratsios added that the administration was particularly concerned with the development of A.I. in national security and as a way of encouraging economic prosperity.Many staff members in Mr. Kratsios\u2019s office are exploring issues related to artificial intelligence, he said. Mr. Kratsios also meets with a committee, set up by the Obama administration, that coordinates A.I. policy across the government.\u201cThe key thing to remember is that the front line of A.I. policy is at the agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House is a convener and a coordinator.\u201dIn an echo of plans laid out by the Obama administration, China\u2019s government said it intended to significantly increase long-term funding for A.I. research and develop a much larger community of A.I. researchers.There are several ways to do that, according to the Obama administration and China. First, educate more students in these technologies. Second, recruit experts from other countries.At the same time, both policy statements urged companies to share more technology and data. Huge pools of data are need to \u201ctrain\u201d A.I. systems, and in the United States much of this is locked up inside companies like Facebook and Google. Mr. Lee said China already has an enormous advantage here because its large population will generate more data and its companies are more willing to share.Artificial intelligence has been a focus of Chinese technologists for some time. By 2013, China was already producing more research papers than the United States in the area of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the main technology driving the rise of A.I., according to the Obama reports. Deep learning, which allows machines to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, is one of the main technologies driving the rise of artificial intelligence.It is unclear how much China as a whole is spending. But one Chinese state has promised to invest $5 billion in A.I., and the government of Beijing has committed $2 billion to an A.I. development park in the city. South Korea has set aside close to $1 billion of its own. Canada, already home to many of the top researchers in the field, has also committed $125 million to, in part, attract new talent from other countries.It is also difficult to say just how much the government of the United States is spending. Government organizations like the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation continue to fund new research in universities and the private sector. According to an O.S.T.P report, the federal government spent about $1 billion a year in 2015. The Trump administration says that spending jumped to $3 billion in 2017. But the current administration said that was not an apples-to-apples comparison to the 2015 tally, because it was not certain how the Obama administration made it calculations.\u201cWe may have a bunch of small initiatives inside the government that are doing good, but we don\u2019t have a central national strategy,\u201d said Jack Clark, a former journalist who now oversees policy efforts at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab co-founded by Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is confusing that we have this technology of such obvious power and merit and we are not hearing full-throated support, including financial support.\u201d\u201cThey are headed in precisely the wrong direction,\u201d said Thomas Kalil, who led O.S.T.P\u2019s Technology and Innovation Division under President Obama. \u201cThat is particularly concerning given that China has identified this as a strategic priority.\u201dGoogle operates another important lab in Montreal. Its London lab, DeepMind, may be home to more top-notch A.I. researchers than any other lab on earth. And Google recently unveiled new labs in both Paris and Beijing. Facebook, after creating its own lab in Canada, recently pumped 10 million euros, or more than $12 million, into its existing operation in Paris. And Amazon is opening a lab in Germany.Inside these facilities, researchers still create technology for their American employers. As the labs grow and the products get better, some employees can be expected to leave to start their own companies and hire their own employees.Google\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s work in China has already led to Chinese start-ups like Malong, which is building image recognition systems, and a major A.I. investment fund run by Mr. Lee.\u201cWhen it is close to you, something like Microsoft Research has real economic value,\u201d said Mr. Clark, of OpenAI.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

Compared with the modern digital soundscape, though, his era is positively muted. Bombastic, attention-grabbing inorganic noises are becoming the norm, disruptive sonic alerts trigger Pavlovian feedback, and simulated sounds are supplanting analog ones.Mobile games may be where sounds have changed most over the last decade. Phones have a small dynamic range, meaning the difference between the softest and loudest portions is limited compared with, say, a high-quality movie theater sound system.Why can you so often overhear other people\u2019s games? Prof. Cohen-Sinclair said that designers accentuate the midrange sound frequency, which translates best to earbuds and small speakers, and to which humans are most sensitive. Because mobile games often compete with external noise, they also contain louder sounds that often carry beyond the player\u2019s earbuds.Something similar was certainly at play with the ringing landline of yesteryear, but phone calls come at a far slower pace, take more time and rarely involve the caller (let alone hundreds of them) affirming how much they \u201clike\u201d you.Whereas the old guard privileged pleasing musicality or organic sounds and tried to create distinctive signatures that somehow represented their brand, the new wave seems primarily concerned with securing the viewer\u2019s attention immediately, at a minimum of time, through jarring, synthesized noises that are ultimately interchangeable with those of other companies.Many digital sound effects, such as the camera shutter, can be classified as \u201cskeuomorphs,\u201d or imitation objects that unnecessarily use ornamental design features of the originals (such as fake stitching on pleather seats). Their ubiquity suggests a postmodern aural backdrop in which the artificial is increasingly replacing the real. For people who grew up hearing only the real sounds, the new distinctions are likely clearer.\u201cSomeone who\u2019s 80 and someone who\u2019s 12 are going to have different responses to a sound,\u201d said Will Mason, a visiting professor of music theory at Oberlin. But the 12-year-old isn\u2019t necessarily at a disadvantage, he said: \u201cWe want to privilege the real sounds over the synthesized ones, and we want to think a shift to a landscape characterized by these \u2018artificial sounds\u2019 is a dystopian element. But I wonder why it is that we want to call it dystopian. There seems to be some knee-jerk, intuitive way in which that\u2019s the default stance and in which the real is preferable.\u201dAs we blithely send our personal data to companies on a whoosh and a bleep, we think less and less about hearing so many other disembodied and artificial noises in the background. We may not love Big Brother, but seem to be O.K. with his cacophonous little siblings.Advertisement"}

Another potential issue is whether or not two of Hulu\u2019s owners \u2014 Disney, which owns ABC, and Comcast, which owns NBC Universal \u2014 will be able to play nicely with each other after they become owners with uneven stakes in the platform.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly awkward,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, a global financial services firm. \u201cThe question is which way it goes: Does Comcast buy out Disney?

Why has his downfall set off debate and action in Canada and elsewhere outside of the United States?A. I actually think it was less about Weinstein and more about the women who chose to speak out. This was one of the few, perhaps only, cases in recent history where the victims were vastly more famous than the abuser \u2014 and I think that was one of the many factors that contributed to the explosion. Social media played a part in the ripple effect, continuing to spread the message and to shift the conversation away from those famous women to the rest of us. And the rest of us are key to this. The #MeToo movement has sustained because sexual assault and harassment is a universal experience.While debating sexual harassment legislation in Parliament this week, some of the legislators expressed concern that the #MeToo movement might flame out as rapidly as it rose up. What will it take to affect sustained changes?I think we\u2019ve already seen that that\u2019s not the case. As journalists, we so often wait for when reader fatigue sets in, when our audience tires of a particular story line or the next scoop comes along. That truly hasn\u2019t happened in this case. The stories keep coming, the complicity continues to be uncovered, and the major shift I\u2019ve seen is the focus from pure accusations to what\u2019s next. In what ways has policy not kept up with the times? If we know that most sexual harassment training doesn\u2019t work \u2014 which we do \u2014 how will institutions work to eradicate the behavior? I don\u2019t think this conversation is going away, but I do think it will shift from problem to solution.Are Americans paying any attention to the debates in Canada and elsewhere in the world?I think that social media has helped keep the conversation global. In France it was #BalanceTonPorc, in Spain and Latin America #YoTambien, in Italy #QuellaVoltaChe, in Israel #\u05d2\u05dd\u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u2014#MeToo has stretched from Canada to China.Within that context the On The Market feature of our Real Estate section headed out to take a look at two condos in Toronto.Below are a couple of highlights.From Tom Roach, Waterloo, Ontario:\u201cThe real issue is not Nafta. Our politicians and pundits have been explaining for years that the old manufacturing jobs are gone for good: Canada needs to look in other directions if it is to grow.\u201dFrom Dale Coles, Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia:\u201cI will always buy Canadian first whenever possible. However as the current U.S. administration becomes more belligerent toward Canada, I tend to look beyond the U.S. more often for my needs, even when the products are equal.\u201dThe Canadian government won\u2019t reveal its plans for dealing with past criminal convictions related to marijuana until after legalized sales start, something currently scheduled for late June. And, for now, the police continue to make arrests related to marijuana purchases.But several place in the United States have taken steps to wipe out previous convictions and others are openly debating the issue.But that may not be the end of the cartoonish caricature. The University of Illinois dumped its mascot, Chief Illiniwek, in 2007. But Mitch Smith found that the mascot, and the debate surrounding it, have not gone away.The beginning of another month means a fresh round of recommendations of Netflix Canada\u2019s offerings from Watching, the Times\u2019s guide to television and movies. \u201c\u2018The Final Year,\u201d a documentary about the Obama administration\u2019s last foreign policy moves, looks particularly compelling.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s Week in Tech: Less Time on Facebook, More Noise From Amazon", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsGood morning, readers! Here are a couple of big stories from tech land this week.Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway walk into a hospital. That\u2019s either the setup to a bad joke or the start of a revolution in American health care \u2014 but for now, nobody knows the punch line.But this is Amazon! Amazon thinks big! And so despite the dearth of details, the announcement made a splash in the business world, prompting optimism that someone may finally be on the verge of reforming the expensive and complex health care industry.In that vein: Tune in for Bezos\u2019s star turn in Amazon\u2019s Super Bowl commercial on Sunday.Amazon\u2019s rep rehab happened in a year in which tech companies have been hammered in the media, none more so than Facebook. Now Facebook is turning a new leaf, according to Mark Zuckerberg.In an earnings report on Wednesday, Facebook\u2019s chief repeated what he has been saying for several months now: Facebook is going to address its effects on society by encouraging people to use Facebook less often.I don\u2019t need to tell you that it is very strange for a C.E.O. to brag about people using his products less often. Investors didn\u2019t know what to make of the news; Facebook\u2019s stock fell in the aftermath of its report. But by Thursday, shares were back up, suggesting Facebook\u2019s argument to investors had stuck.But I\u2019m fascinated by what happens next. Facebook, so far, has thrived on its promise of never-ending usage growth. Its shift to a new metric for success will be of enormous significance for the company and how its products fit into our lives. I doubt the transition will occur without eventual pushback from investors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Asked for Patience. Remarkably, Wall Street Complied.", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAllen Gillespie is one lonely stock analyst.Of the dozens of Wall Street analysts covering Amazon, he is the only one tracked by Bloomberg who recommends that investors sell the company\u2019s shares.Mr. Gillespie, a partner at FinTrust Investment Advisors, a wealth management firm in Greenville, S.C., questions whether Amazon deserves such a stratospheric share price.\u201cEverybody thinks I am crazy,\u201d said Mr. Gillespie, who also serves on the board overseeing South Carolina\u2019s pension fund. \u201cI have had people I\u2019ve never met email me to ask if I was serious.\u201dIt is a bold call indeed. Since Mr. Gillespie put a sell rating on the company last July, Amazon\u2019s shares have increased 37 percent, to $1,429. On Friday, one day after Amazon reported the biggest quarterly profit in its history, Amazon\u2019s market value briefly crossed the $700 billion mark, and its share price increased 3 percent even as the Dow fell 2.5 percent.For most analysts, the end is not yet in sight. When the investment firm D.A. Davidson & Company predicted last month that Amazon\u2019s shares could rise to $1,800, Morgan Stanley upped the ante the next day, forecasting a possible $2,100 share price.\u201cIt\u2019s an infatuation,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern business school, who recently published a book about Amazon, Google and other tech giants.How that infatuation developed is the story of a company that figured out how to tame Wall Street. In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along.Over its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway.\u201cI think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn\u2019t deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,\u201d said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon.In part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn\u2019t appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years.In a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company\u2019s ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them.\u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Long Term.\u2019\u2019Mr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.And its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year \u2014 hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see.Yet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.It may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true.\u201cIf Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,\u201d said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.)The reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street\u2019s old rules, which demand consistent profit growth.It wasn\u2019t always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys.But like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon\u2019s shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival.Mr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days. But it took many years for investors who had been burned by the dot-com crash to give Amazon a second chance.For long stretches from 2002 to 2006, Amazon\u2019s stock price languished, while it invested in researching and developing new technologies and businesses.Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets, looked at the company\u2019s slipping profit margins during that period and warned investors to stay away.Mr. Mahaney said he failed to realize \u201cthat all that spending on R.&D. was a bullish sign for the future.\u201d He has had a buy rating on the company for more than a decade.Those long-term investments, which Amazon didn\u2019t detail at the time, eventually gave rise to some of the company\u2019s most profitable businesses, like its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services.The success of the cloud computing business proved a tipping point. If investors allowed Amazon to spend time and money investing, patience would pay off.By now, Wall Street has been well trained to believe that Amazon has a strategy for Whole Foods and it will take time to carry it out.\u201cWhat the market finally figured out is Amazon is extremely good at investing those dollars,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the investment officer at Miller Value Partners.Ultimately, much of the investor confidence in Amazon reflects a belief in its future opportunity \u2014 what investors frequently call a company\u2019s \u201caddressable market.\u201dFor Amazon, the addressable market in retail is roughly $5 trillion in the United States and many times that globally, Mr. Miller said. And that\u2019s not even including the traditional information technology market that Amazon Web Services is attacking. \u201cI asked Jeff what the addressable market is for A.W.S.,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018Trillions and trillions.\u2019\u201dEven Mr. Gillespie, the skeptic, acknowledges that Amazon is \u201coperating extremely well.\u201d But he questions whether years of low interest rates have helped inflate Amazon\u2019s value because investors are so starved for return, they are willing to overlook some of the risks.Those risks, he said, include regulators deciding the company is growing too large or not paying its fair share in taxes.\u201cPeople tend to assume away these things,\u201d he said.Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employer Health Insurance: Often-Hated, Sometimes Pioneering, and Now on Amazon\u2019s Radar", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryone likes to complain about our company-based system, but there have been real examples of innovation.\u201cTo the extent that you have seen innovation by insurers, it\u2019s often at the behest of employers,\u201d said Jonathan Kolstad, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the industry.Companies started offering health coverage broadly during World War II, when the government imposed wage controls. And the system was cemented when the Internal Revenue Service decided that health insurance was not subject to income taxes, making it a particularly valuable way for employers to improve compensation for their workers. Critics point to numerous problems with the system: It relies on company leaders to pick health insurance for all workers, even though C-suite executives might have preferences different from their lower-wage employees. It diminishes incentives to reduce costs, by insulating workers from the full price of their benefits. It discourages changes that could displease even a small number of workers, creating incentives to minimize disruption. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason for the employer to be doing this,\u201d said Fiona Scott Morton, a health economist at the Yale School of Management.But the employer system also has points in its favor. For one, proponents note employers have multiple incentives to get health insurance right. They want their workers to be happy with their full slate of compensation \u2014 an employer that offered deceptive plans, for instance, might not hold onto good employees for long. Employers also want workers who are healthy and productive, able to work hard and to focus on their work.Employers tend to be insulated from the political considerations that can make it hard for government plans or large insurers to try new strategies.Large companies are able to pool risks, since they tend to cover both healthy and sick employees and family members. Because employers pay a large share of insurance premiums, most workers tend to sign up for plans even if they\u2019re healthy. Employers with people who stick around a long time \u2014 think police departments or universities \u2014 have an additional incentive to prevent their workers\u2019 health from deteriorating over time.Large employers have the resources to hire human resources professionals and benefits consultants to shop for their health plans. At least theoretically, those people should know more about how to pick a good health insurance plan that will serve the needs of the company\u2019s workers. And the bigger the companies, the more they can pay to hire people really good to do that work, since their salary gets split many times over.But there is also a robust history of employer experimentation. Some employer ideas have paid off \u2014 and spread. Others have flopped. Amazon and friends would be building on this tradition.Arnold Milstein, a professor at Stanford Medical School, spent several years with the benefits consulting firm Mercer developing unconventional benefit products with companies.

{"Headline": "NBC Executive Takes Over Amazon Studios", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon had been on the hunt for a new executive, placing a strong emphasis on finding a woman, since October. In that time, streaming rivals like Netflix, Hulu and Apple have continued to gobble up television projects.Amazon has made the occasional splash at the Golden Globes and the Emmys with shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d but it has failed to gain the same kind of standing that Netflix and even Hulu have within Hollywood\u2019s creative community.It will be up to Ms. Salke, 53, to essentially hit the reset button.\u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeff Blackburn, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for business development and entertainment, said in a statement.A Fox executive, Dana Walden, and an A&E executive, Nancy Dubuc, had discussed the position with Amazon before each dropped out of talks.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited about the future at Amazon Studios,\u201d Ms. Salke said in a statement. \u201cIn the studio\u2019s relatively short existence they have innovated, disrupted and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop culture. I am both honored and emboldened by the opportunity to lead this extraordinary business.\u201dFor the last seven years, Ms. Salke has been second in command at NBC, where she and Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, engineered an impressive turnaround.Mr. Greenblatt, who joined NBC in 2010, and Ms. Salke, who came on board as president from Fox in 2011, found a network in deep trouble and well past its \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u201cER\u201d and \u201cFriends\u201d heyday.But now, propelled by \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and shows like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d NBC is poised to win the 18-to-49-year-old demographic among the four broadcast networks for a second consecutive season.Ms. Salke was one of the biggest champions of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d an emotional family drama whose popularity has surprised many industry veterans \u2014 as has its ability to sustain that success in its second season. On Sunday, NBC gave \u201cThis Is Us\u201d the post-Super Bowl slot, where it garnered an impressive audience of 27 million viewers.Ms. Salke has also helped deploy a strategy that brought NBC\u2019s comedy lineup back to life. After the lineup collapsed when \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d went off the air, she said the network would develop comedies that weren\u2019t meant to appeal to everybody. NBC has since found traction with offbeat comedies like \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and \u201cSuperstore.\u201d\u201cJennifer Salke is a world-class entertainment executive and deserves enormous credit for helping put NBC back on top,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said in a statement.But whether her success at helping turn around a broadcast network \u2014 which also relies on a healthy diet of Dick Wolf dramas \u2014 will translate to a streaming service is an open question.Amazon has been viewed in Hollywood as something of a sleeping giant, one of the few companies that could match Netflix financially if it deployed its cash properly. Netflix is poised to spend $8 billion on content this year.But Amazon has had several expensive missteps. \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s unfinished novel, debuted to little fanfare and was canceled. Likewise, several comedies, including \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson\u201d and \u201cI Love Dick,\u201d have been canceled in the last month.At the same time, Hulu has found real momentum. It is introducing several shows this year, including \u201cThe Looming Tower,\u201d a mini-series based on Lawrence Wright\u2019s book about the lead-up to the Sept. 11 attacks, this month and the second season of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d in April.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spotify Is Getting Paid to Save the Music Industry: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify files to go public.\u2022 Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles.\u2022 The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one?\u2022 What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?\u2022 The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope.\u2022 And is Jared Kushner\u2019s weakness his family business?Perhaps more than any other streaming service, Spotify has revived the fortunes of recording artists. It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday.The numbers are included in Spotify\u2019s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing\u2019s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, \u201cconsists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.\u201dThe filing says Spotify had \u20ac3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was \u20ac2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. \u201cThis decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,\u201d the filing said.But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that.\u2014 Peter EavisAccounting nerds delving into Spotify\u2019s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy.Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of \u20ac324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled \u20ac179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda?It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung \u20ac439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year.\u2014 Peter EavisDirect listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market.Spotify won\u2019t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days.Here\u2019s a look at the details:Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang.Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify\u2019s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public.In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby.Dick\u2019s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT:\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201dOver five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero.Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest.\u2022 Mr. Ackman\u2019s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet.How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high.Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIs it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no.BackgroundSnap\u2019s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock.The criticism has also overshadowed Snap\u2019s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent.BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock\u2019s annual report:As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as \u201ccommon ownership\u201d. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.The filing goes on to say:If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock\u2019s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years.What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy.To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes.Is it working? Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year.Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony.\u2014 Peter EavisSky is both a telecom operator \u2014 selling TV, internet and phone services \u2014 and a media company with its own original news, sports and entertainment programming.

{"Headline": "Wall Street Halts a Global Rout", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter days of sometimes wild moves in stock markets, Wall Street had a good day on Tuesday. Investors refocused on the continuing strength of the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated on Tuesday, and the S.&P. 500 ended the session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles.The decline in stock markets on Monday was steep, but not the worst one-day percentage drop in the S.&P. 500. In the history of the index, 38 one-day drops were worse.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk ever higher, as measures of volatility \u2014 the ups and downs of stock prices \u2014 hit remarkably calm levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop of lackluster growth and inflation, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But that peaceful climb ended in recent days. Investors have become worried that the solid economy in the United States could be showing early signals of inflationary pressure and that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than previously expected. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data \u2014 such as the Labor Department\u2019s jobs report on Friday \u2014 showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.But Tuesday\u2019s results put a brake to the slide, at least for now.The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said it was possible that algorithmic trading programs were partly responsible for recent volatility in the stock market. \u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role \u2014 as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said Tuesday, adding that market participants are acting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems.In a sign of investor confidence, yields on the 10-year Treasury note rose on Tuesday. Spooked investors had bought supersafe government bonds in recent days after being startled by the market sell-off, bringing yields lower. So, the rise in yields suggests investors are regaining their nerve.Jack Ewing, Alexandra Stevenson and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From (Crumbling) Airport to (Broken) Escalators: An Infrastructure Odyssey", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseGiven the deficit-exploding impact of the new tax code, it\u2019s difficult to see where the money will come from. In any event, after this trip, I\u2019ll settle for something far more modest: basic improvements to public transportation.Regional transportation infrastructure is largely the responsibility of state and local governments, and it\u2019s especially complicated in places like the New York metropolitan area, which includes multiple jurisdictions and agencies. But just as the federal government spurred the creation of the Interstate highway system under President Dwight Eisenhower, it could revitalize the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure \u2014 without blowing up the deficit \u2014 with a combination of better regulation, creative incentives, loans and grants. Many transportation projects are sound investments that can pay for themselves.My trip to Manhattan from Newark Liberty International Airport began at Terminal A. Newark is a finalist in Amazon\u2019s quest for a second headquarters location, but one look at that terminal should be enough to send the e-commerce giant\u2019s representatives back to Seattle. The aging terminal was packed and badly lit, with peeling, mismatched carpeting. There was a line out of the men\u2019s room because so much plumbing was out of order. There was no dedicated TSA Pre-check line and the food options were minimal.No one, including the airport\u2019s owner and operator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, defends the terminal. \u201cThe Port Authority recognizes that Newark\u2019s Terminal A, which opened in 1973, can no longer adequately serve today\u2019s passengers,\u201d a spokeswoman acknowledged.Newark\u2019s Terminal B, which received a $350 million update in 2014, and Terminal C, which was built by United Airlines and is operated under a long-term lease by the company, are far better, though both attract plenty of complaints from travelers.A major issue for the New York area\u2019s airports is that the Port Authority is allowed to divert revenues collected from airline passengers to nonairport uses, like the PATH train and the new Oculus station at the World Trade Center, a project that went grossly over budget. Federal law bans such redirections elsewhere, but the Port Authority was one of several airport operators that were exempted.\u201cIf Newark airport kept all the money it generated from landing fees it could be a world-class airport,\u201d said Tom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, an independent urban research group that focuses on infrastructure and public policy in the New York area. But doing so would starve other Port Authority needs, such as mass transit, he added.Improving Newark and the rest of America\u2019s airports needn\u2019t add to the federal deficit. Airports can fund capital improvements by levying fees on passengers and airlines. Airlines typically oppose that, and federal law currently caps such fees, known as passenger facility charges. Efforts to raise the cap, which hasn\u2019t been increased in 15 years, have gone nowhere in Congress.\u201cIt makes no sense that the fees would be the same for Des Moines and Newark, given their vastly different mass transit needs,\u201d said Mr. Wright.After a 10-minute walk in Terminal A, I boarded the AirTrain for what is supposed to be an 11-minute trip to the Newark Airport train station. That seemed ample time to make the next New Jersey Transit train to Manhattan, due in 20 minutes.Nothing about the AirTrain inspires confidence. It moved along the monorail at what felt like a snail\u2019s pace, shuddering at every curve. Twice it inexplicably stopped for extended periods. During the second of these stops, within sight of our destination, I watched in frustration as my train to Manhattan came and went.Complaints about the AirTrain have been mounting for years, and the Port Authority has conceded it\u2019s \u201cunreliable.\u201d It has been periodically shut down for repairs, and passengers have had to be evacuated after being stuck on board.Though the AirTrain is less than 25 years old, and cost $769 million ($1.3 billion adjusted for inflation) to build, the Port Authority concluded it must be demolished and replaced. The current capital plan calls for $385 million in repairs to the existing AirTrain, and $40 million for planning its replacement, but doesn\u2019t include the cost of the new train system. The planning proposal anticipates \u201csubstantial completion\u201d in 2022, though that seems overly ambitious.Once I reached the station, I learned that the next New Jersey Transit train wouldn\u2019t arrive for 50 minutes. When I went to the enclosed (and presumably heated) waiting area, it was empty, and entry was barred by a guard at the door.A Port Authority official said the area was closed because of an unattended bag. Some time after I left, it reopened when a police dog certified in bomb detection determined the bag was harmless.A New Jersey Transit spokeswoman, Nancy Snyder, explained that weekend service from Newark Airport is \u201climited\u201d because of Amtrak maintenance work. Only three trains run per hour, clustered within the first 20 minutes of the hour, she said, and I evidently missed the last of those.In 2010, of course, Mr. Christie famously canceled a project for a new Hudson River tunnel, citing cost overruns, a decision whose reverberations continue to be felt by New Jersey\u2019s beleaguered commuters.The train, when it finally arrived, was packed. I found a seat, but other passengers were standing. Mr. Christie\u2019s successor as governor, Phil Murphy, has called New Jersey Transit a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d and has pledged better funding and improvements.Once we reached Penn Station, the escalator leading from the platform was broken, creating a logjam at the narrow stairways as passengers struggled with heavy luggage.Ms. Snyder said that New Jersey Transit maintains nine escalators on the Seventh Avenue side of Penn Station and that, as of this week, all were functioning. But she recommended passengers use the Eighth Avenue side of the station, which offers better access to and from platforms.Other than acknowledging receipt of the letter, the White House hasn\u2019t responded.Advertisement"}

Now, it is under pressure to demonstrate to its lenders that it has a realistic strategy for flourishing in the ultracompetitive toy industry.One plan under discussion includes shutting down close to 200 stores, and possibly more, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly.\u201cIf you look at the numbers, it doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d said Richard Gottlieb, an analyst and the publisher of Global Toy News. \u201cAnd it appears that some dramatic action is going to have to take place.\u2019\u2019It is not clear whether any additional closings would occur in the United States, or overseas. The company operates about 800 stores in the United States.Even as other retailers experienced strong holiday sales, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us cited undisclosed \u201coperational missteps\u201d in explaining its poor performance.Analysts say the company\u2019s biggest problem stems from its filing last year for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, after its private equity owners left it saddled with $5 billion in debt.The bankruptcy filing, only months before Christmas, left many shoppers with the impression that the company was shutting down, even though it planned to keep all its stores operating through the holidays, said Jim Silver, the editor of TTPM, a toy review website.\u201cThere was too much consumer perception that they were not going to be around, and it hurt their traffic incredibly,\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cWhen you are buying toys, you want to know you can return them and your gift cards will work.\u201dAnother big challenge came from competitors like Walmart and Amazon, which pushed toys heavily during the holiday season, just as Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was struggling to win back customers and calm jittery vendors.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is entering a crucial time, as it prepares to buy toys to sell for the next holiday season.

It should be a star-making performance for Letitia Wright (she previously appeared in the most recent season of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d in the episode \u201cBlack Museum\u201d). In the comics, Shuri eventually succeeds T\u2019Challa as Black Panther. Might she get her own spinoff movie? Or a teen-oriented cartoon show? At the very least, expect her to play a prominent role in the inevitable sequel.It\u2019s not just the portrayal of the African diaspora in \u201cBlack Panther\u201d that pushes boundaries, it\u2019s that of the women. This is the rare superhero movie that doesn\u2019t treat the female characters like ornaments or seasoning and even passes the Bechdel test.What did you make of Okoye (Danai Gurira of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) and her all-female fighting squad? Okoye\u2019s wig-throwing and car-surfing-in-a-red-dress scenes in South Korea were among the film\u2019s most indelible. But was her romance with W\u2019Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) believable? Was it necessary?M\u2019Baku, the chief of the renegade mountain tribe, starts out as a third-tier villain in the movie but ends up being unexpectedly heroic and pivotal to the plot. If not for him, T\u2019Challa would have been belly up in a river somewhere while Killmonger waged World War III from the Wakandan throne.The 31-year-old actor who plays M\u2019Baku, the Tobagonian-born, American-raised Winston Duke, is a relative unknown (he\u2019s had supporting roles on the TV shows \u201cPerson of Interest\u201d and \u201cModern Family\u201d) but infuses the role with gravitas, wry charm and incendiary wit. If there\u2019s any justice in the world, he\u2019ll be starring in a rom-com next year.A character that several critics have called the most compelling Marvel villain to date, Erik Killmonger is a unique and thoroughly American revolutionary. His bloodthirsty vision (of sweet revenge for centuries of oppression visited upon African-descended peoples around the world) is provocative because, viewed from the right angle, it offers a convincing approximation of justice.Was his primary critique of Wakanda \u2014 that it has selfishly shirked its responsibilities to other African nations and the diaspora \u2014 ultimately correct? Or was T\u2019Challa right that isolation to the point of invisibility was the only way to ensure that Wakanda never met the fate of its subjugated sister nations? Killmonger\u2019s final line \u2014 \u201cBury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from ships, because they knew death was better than bondage\u201d \u2014 is among the film\u2019s most trenchant, and one of the hardest to believe actually exists in a Marvel movie.In a film almost entirely populated by black faces, the two main white characters \u2014 one a marauding thief (Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue), the other an intermittently useful ally (Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross) \u2014 are a study in contrasts. Ross, the butt of several jokes in the movie (Shuri taunts him as a \u201ccolonizer\u201d), exists as a kind of corrective to the \u201cwhite savior\u201d characters that are standard in earlier Western films about Africans. What did you think of the character and how did your theater react to the jokes at his expense?In the first of two post-credit sequences, T\u2019Challa addresses the United Nations with a speech that includes this line: \u201cThe wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.\u201d Is that a pointed reference to the proposed border wall? Or just an apropos aphorism for Wakanda\u2019s climactic embrace of internationalist foreign policy?Let us hear your Wakandan war cries about all the things we called out above (and anything we did not) in the comments section.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Rejects Bail for Bomb-Making Suspect", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMagistrate Judge James L. Cott cited \u201cvery strong evidence\u201d suggesting that the teacher, Christian Toro, 27, was in the process of making a bomb or bombs by illegally amassing explosive materials. That evidence included new details about text messages that referred to the October 2017 massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas.An assistant United States attorney, Elizabeth Hanft, quoting an exchange of text messages that investigators uncovered, said Mr. Toro\u2019s brother, Tyler, noted that the assailant in the Las Vegas massacre had a police scanner.\u201cWe need to invest in one,\u201d Tyler Toro wrote.\u201cCopy,\u201d Mr. Toro replied. \u201cI see a couple on Amazon.\u201dWith several family members looking on, Mr. Toro was returned to jail in shackles after a nearly hourlong bail hearing.The Justice Department has not yet indicted the brothers or suggested a reason, or a target, for their alleged bomb-building efforts \u2014 a point raised by Mr. Toro\u2019s defense lawyer, Amy Gallicchio, in pleading for him to be freed on $100,000 bond. \u201cThere\u2019s no sinister plans, no plot, no motive,\u201d Ms. Gallicchio, a federal public defender, said.There was also no actual bomb, she noted. \u201cHe has no history of violence,\u201d she said.But the federal government, in its original complaint and at Wednesday\u2019s hearing, parceled out details clearly intended to suggest that the brothers had some form of large-scale violence in mind. Investigators found diary writings referring to an \u201cOperation Flash\u201d and a purple index card that read, \u201cUnder the full moon the small ones will know terror.\u201dThe criminal complaint filed in conjunction with the brothers\u2019 arrest last Thursday accused Mr. Toro of paying two students from Harlem Prep High School, where he was teaching at the time, $50 an hour to come to his apartment in the Bronx and take apart fireworks in order to collect their explosive powder.Judge Cott said Mr. Toro \u201cis not someone I am comfortable releasing to the community at this time.\u201dThe complaint, which Ms. Hanft revisited and fleshed out at Wednesday\u2019s bail hearing, said the brothers were arrested with more than 32 pounds of explosive ingredients, from an iron oxide to confectioner\u2019s sugar, which can be used as explosive fuel. The materials were stored in a closet of the apartment they shared with their mother, Carmen Melendez.\u201cThis is a defendant who had a cache of weapons in his apartment,\u201d Ms. Hanft said, describing a \u201cgrocery list\u201d of explosive ingredients, including incendiary powder kept in glass jars in quantities that could, if detonated, cause \u201can explosion sufficient to blow off a limb or body part.\u201dMs. Hanft said investigators also seized several boxes of fireworks, bullets, a magnesium strip that can serve as a fuse when lit, metal ball bearings and a container of \u201cimprovised napalm,\u201d consisting of gasoline and Styrofoam, found sitting on the apartment fire escape.\u201cIt\u2019s not science project material,\u201d Ms. Hanft said, adding that it was consistent with the instructions in a bomb-making manual that was found on Mr. Toro\u2019s school-issued laptop computer after he had quit his job in January and returned the device to Harlem Prep.Mr. Toro is also facing an unrelated charge of third-degree rape in connection with a sexual relationship he is accused of having with a student at the school, his lawyer acknowledged on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear what impact his arrest in the bomb-making case could have on any bond he or his family might have secured in the sexual assault case.Ms. Hanft contended that Mr. Toro also lied to investigators when they asked him about the bomb-making manual found on the laptop, which he said he had only meant to read, not download, while doing research into the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Mr. Toro told investigators he had not made a bomb \u2014 a statement Judge Cott said was \u201cmisleading at best.\u201dMs. Gallicchio argued that merely possessing bomb-grade materials was not the same thing as making or possessing the bomb itself.Judge Cott rejected the distinction, saying it \u201cstrains credulity\u201d to deny the government \u201clogical inferences\u201d in making its case for arrest and against bail.Ms. Gallicchio maintained that her client did not pose a flight risk, and belonged to a large and loving family willing and able to put up his bail. Ms. Gallicchio said Mr. Toro\u2019s family knows him as \u201ca peaceful, law-abiding person\u201d who is \u201ckind and loving,\u201d and family-oriented himself.Tyler Toro also remains jailed, and has not yet submitted an application for a bail hearing, according to Nicholas Biase, a Justice Department spokesman. Their family members, including Ms. Melendez, all declined to comment after the hearing.Advertisement"}

Mr. Durant and his business partner, Rich Kleiman, started an entertainment company, Thirty Five Media, in April. Last month, YouTube tapped them to develop sports programming, including the creation of channels focused on athletes like Karl-Anthony Towns, an N.B.A. All-Star with the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.N.B.A. players as Hollywood hotshots? It\u2019s not a far-fetched notion at a time when one of the world\u2019s biggest movie stars, Dwayne Johnson, is a former pro wrestler.\u201cCelebrity and name recognition is currency in Hollywood,\u201d said Todd Boyd, a cinema and media studies professor at the University of Southern California. Mr. Boyd, whose work focuses on race and popular culture, added that the entertainment business was under pressure to diversify its ranks and the stories it put on screen.\u201cThe question is where this goes in the long term,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201cHow long will the content boom last? Will diversity continue to matter?\u201dAnd success on the court in no way ensures success on screens, Mr. Boyd noted.\u201cAs the number of platforms and distribution channels grows \u2014 social media, Amazon, Netflix \u2014 there is a big need for unique content and quality storytelling that can cut through the noise,\u201d said Mr. Carter, who serves as SpringHill\u2019s chief executive and has known Mr. James since boyhood. \u201cWe saw an opportunity to tell stories about people who look like us and think like us.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s working on a bunch of novels \u2014 fiction, but rooted in sport \u2014 and will be building shows and films from there, original from his own head,\u201d said Molly Carter, Granity\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cThis is better than any All-Star Game I was ever in,\u201d he said after posing with Allison Janney, an Oscar acting nominee for the ice-skating biopic \u201cI, Tonya.\u201dHollywood has a long history of casting athletes, who come with built-in fan bases and often exude a natural magnetism on screen. Johnny Weissmuller, an Olympic swimmer, starred in a dozen \u201cTarzan\u201d movies starting in the 1930s.Among basketball players, Michael Jordan appeared as himself in the original \u201cSpace Jam,\u201d which took in $337 million worldwide in 1996, after adjusting for inflation. Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson have tried acting, producing and hosting over the years, to mixed results.\u201cLeBron has done such a great job so far,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, wow, this can actually be done.\u201dMr. Kleiman, who is also Mr. Durant\u2019s manager, added that a generation of athletes had also watched music stars build business empires. \u201cKevin paid attention to the Jay Zs and the Puffys that came up ahead of him and provided a blueprint,\u201d Mr. Kleiman said.Thirty Five Media also aims to increase revenue on the channel with a twist on the endorsement deal.\u201cYou may not get Kevin Durant the spokesman \u2014 he can only personally represent so many brands authentically \u2014 but you can get branded content,\u201d Mr. Kleiman said.\u201cHe started telling me the very interesting story about his early days playing basketball and how his mom kept a really good eye on him,\u201d Mr. Grazer said. \u201cAnd that got us talking about another way to do \u2018Friday Night Lights,\u2019 which was a series and movie about a boy\u2019s identity and how things that seem imperceptible can be so seismic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s HomePod Has Arrived. Don\u2019t Rush to Buy It.", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixOn my second day with Apple\u2019s new HomePod, I asked the artificially intelligent speaker to play some music. Siri, the virtual assistant that powers HomePod, enthusiastically replied, \u201cO.K., let\u2019s get going with some Dashboard Confessional.\u201dI cringed. \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody likes Dashboard Confessional.\u201dAt the time, I gave Siri a pass. After all, Apple\u2019s HomePod, a rival to smart speakers from Amazon and Google, is supposed to study your music preferences over time to create special playlists just for you. I had had only one day with HomePod.But after a week \u2014 during which I asked HomePod to play my favorite tunes from artists like Beck, Talking Heads and David Bowie \u2014 the smart speaker still did not learn. Instead, like a stubborn D.J., Siri kept playing music by artists outside my music palette: Taylor Swift and Leroy Francis, to name just two.That leads to my conclusion: The $349 HomePod, which costs roughly three times as much as its competitors and arrives in stores on Friday, is tough to recommend to you, dear reader.Apple\u2019s speaker is certainly an impressive piece of hardware. Audiophiles will appreciate that it has a woofer with a custom amplifier and seven tweeters. The result is a speaker with a deep bass and rich treble that is loud enough to fill a large room with superb sound. HomePod makes the Amazon Echo and Google\u2019s Home sound muffled and tinny in comparison.But Siri on HomePod is embarrassingly inadequate, even though that is the primary way you interact with it. Siri is sorely lacking in capabilities compared with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. Siri doesn\u2019t even work as well on HomePod as it does on the iPhone.Even now, Apple is shipping the HomePod unfinished. On Day 1, the device will lack some cool features, like the ability to link several HomePods to create a multiroom sound system that Apple says will fill an entire home with music. That feature will come in a software update later this year.And there are other limitations: The HomePod requires an iOS device, like an iPhone, an iPad or an iPod Touch, to set it up. To use your voice commands to play music, you will also need to subscribe to Apple\u2019s streaming music service, Apple Music.So how exactly did I reach my conclusion on HomePod? I tested it side by side with Echo and Home smart speakers, grading them on their ability to accomplish 14 tasks across several categories, including music, productivity, commuting, home automation and cooking. Let me walk you through the process and results.Apple also provided statistics on smart speaker usage from the research firm Parks Associates. That report also found that playing music and getting the weather were the top uses of smart speakers, while roughly 20 percent of people enjoyed using them for tasks like accessing a calendar and searching for recipes.Amazon says most of its Echo customers use at least one \u201cskill,\u201d or third-party app. So I added the ability to use Uber, the most popular ride-hailing service, as a test.Now onward to the tests themselves.I set up a HomePod, an Echo and a Home in my house and began with a battery of question-and-answer sessions. First up: traffic.All the speakers gave a similar traffic estimate for a drive to San Jose, Calif. \u2014 roughly a one-hour drive on the freeway. But when I asked HomePod to summon a car from Uber, Siri responded, \u201cI wish I could, but I can\u2019t help with rides here.\u201dThe other speakers were happy to help \u2014 so I followed up with: \u201cHey, Siri, what gives?\u201d HomePod\u2019s colorful touch screen lit up to show it had heard my question, but Siri remained silent.Next, it was time for some cooking questions. All the speakers were able to flawlessly set a kitchen timer. But when I asked HomePod how to make pasta, Siri blanked and said, \u201cI can\u2019t get the answer to that on HomePod.\u201dThen it was time to move on to some work-related tasks. I asked Siri to schedule a meeting for Tuesday. Siri responded: \u201cI cannot access your calendar from here. Sorry about that.\u201d It couldn\u2019t look at my calendar for the day, either. Google Home and Amazon Echo, in contrast, managed to schedule new events and read my calendar for the day: a meeting in the morning, followed by a photo shoot and a business dinner in the evening.When I asked Apple about Siri\u2019s hiccups, the company said that for the first version of HomePod, it focused on including tasks that people use smart speakers for the most, like playing music and asking about the weather, and that it would continue to evaluate what other features to add over time.I wondered whether HomePod would do better with home tasks and decided to ask all the smart speakers to turn on a Wi-Fi-connected light bulb from the smart light company Lifx. In this test, HomePod got a higher score because setting up the smart light, which involved using the iPhone camera to scan a code on the instruction manual, was seamless and much easier than it was with Google Home and Amazon Echo, which required installing a third-party app.Bonus: The light turned on when I asked.One of the most crucial tests for HomePod had to do with audio. That\u2019s because Apple has long emphasized that the smart speaker is first and foremost a music player.Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s head of marketing, said at a gathering at the company\u2019s audio lab last week that Apple started developing HomePod six years ago with the intention of making a speaker that specialized in playing music in a unique way. The project started well before Apple introduced other services like Apple Music, which was released in 2015, and HomeKit, the home automation platform that was unveiled in 2014, he added.Mr. Schiller said Apple wanted to stay true to the original goal of the project \u201cwithout ever compromising that it\u2019s a speaker first.\u201dAll three speakers did great playing music. Echo, Google\u2019s Home and HomePod were each able to play specific songs by artists, generate playlists for specific artists or music genres, and play podcasts. HomePod got a higher score in audio with its superior sound quality factored in.Yet that\u2019s also where Dashboard Confessional came in and where HomePod\u2019s biggest shortcomings became apparent. Whenever I asked HomePod to \u201cplay some music,\u201d it never played music that was relevant to my preferences or listening history.That wasn\u2019t the case with the Google and Amazon speakers. When I asked those speakers to play music, the gadgets simply resumed what I was last playing on Spotify, which was satisfying.In response to my concerns, Apple said HomePod studies a customer\u2019s music preferences over time. I figured a week should have been enough.From the tests, I graded the speakers on their ability to accomplish each task on a scale from 0 to 4. (I gave a 0 for tasks that could not be done at all, a 2 for tasks that could be done with some issues, and a 4 for tasks that could be completed flawlessly.)So how did they all stack up in terms of grade-point averages out of 4.0? The final results:\u25a0 Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 3.4\u25a0 Google\u2019s Home \u2014 3.1\u25a0 Apple\u2019s HomePod \u2014 2.9An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a musical artist whose music was played by Apple\u2019s HomePod speaker without being requested.

In the scene they filmed this early February morning, Annie, a cashier in the middle of a custody battle, and Ruby, a former waitress with a gravely ill daughter, were huddled over a laptop, drinking coffee out of matching mugs while they searched homicide reports and debated best-case and worst-case scenarios. Glass half-full? The latest crisis subsides, the women keep earning.\u201cWhat\u2019s glass half-empty?\u201d Annie asks.\u201cGetting put in a wood chipper,\u201d Ruby replies. This may not be a joke.\u201cWe love the show because it\u2019s distinctive, it has you on the edge of your seat,\u201d Ms. Salke said, speaking by telephone. \u201cWe would never dream in a million years of trying to do anything to push it to the middle.\u201dThat\u2019s wise. Because \u201cGood Girls\u201d suggests that when pushed too far, women push back.That conversation made Ms. Bans want to honor women like her mother, who have kept going when the playing field was anything but level. Eventually, that tribute became a compensatory fantasy, showing what might happen if women did rock the boat, if they did ruffle feathers, if they did take what they want. When we meet the characters of \u201cGood Girls,\u201d they\u2019re struggling, they\u2019re powerless, they haven\u2019t reaped the rewards they\u2019ve been promised. A few ski masks, a handful of toy guns, an \u201cAll right, everybody be cool and nobody gets hurt\u201d and those rewards start coming.\u201cIt\u2019s probably not the best choice,\u201d Ms. Bans said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a responsible choice.\u201dIt\u2019s certainly a bold choice to shove a climactic event like the heist into the pilot, rather than build up to it over many weeks, but Ms. Bans seemed unconcerned that viewers won\u2019t stick around. \u201cWe\u2019re never really struggling for lack of a story,\u201d she said. \u201cUsually we\u2019re trying to prune story out of our episodes because they\u2019re too overstuffed.\u201d\u201cGood Girls\u201d has a punchier, more comedic feel than the Shondaverse of \u201cScandal,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cPrivate Practice\u201d (series on which Ms. Bans worked), but shares some of those shows\u2019 D.N.A. As Ms. Bans said, Ms. Rhimes imbued in her \u201ca sense of risk-taking, of not keeping it safe, of pushing your characters to do things that scare them.\u201dHere, doing things that scare them allows these suburban moms to finally own their smarts, skills and mettle. As Ms. Hendricks\u2019s Beth says in the pilot, \u201cWe have accomplished way harder than this. I once made 300 damn cupcakes in one night and they were both nut- and gluten-free.\u201d So what\u2019s a little crime?It\u2019s a reluctance \u201cGood Girls\u201d shares and won\u2019t apologize for. \u201cWe really want to protect their sense of right and wrong,\u201d Ms. Bans said. \u201cWhen they make what is a morally gray choice, they really struggle with it.\u201dSo these women won\u2019t break bad. But they will definitely break not nice. And if they were on cable, Ms. Bans thinks they would probably swear a lot more, but she promises that this is the only compromise.Ms. Hendricks said she hopes that the show will encourage viewers to examine their own sense of right and wrong. \u201cFollowing these women around, you ask yourself questions like, \u2018What would you do for your family? What\u2019s the sliding scale in your life? Would you do something a little illegal? Would you do something a lot illegal?\u2019\u201d Beth will commit multiple felonies, but will still slide a coaster underneath a soda can, so that\u2019s her line in the sand.None of these characters is flawless. None of these characters is simple. As Retta, drinking a La Croix in her trailer between scenes, joked, \u201cI get to have it all \u2014 kids and a husband and an illegal job.\u201d Ms. Whitman, resting in the neighboring trailer, described \u201ca weird sick excitement on my part to play somebody who isn\u2019t perfect.\u201d\u201cGood Girls\u201d asks what would happen, what could happen if girls and women stopped angling for perfection. \u201cIt\u2019s sad and funny to think about,\u201d Ms. Bans said.

Ms. Pirro met with Mr. Trump in the White House on Wednesday, hoping to secure his participation.Over lunch, Mr. Trump agreed to be interviewed by Ms. Pirro for the book, according to one of the people briefed on their discussion.For weeks, the president has seethed about the depiction of him in \u201cFire and Fury\u201d as a volatile and ill-equipped chief executive, even asking the White House counsel and allies whether a libel lawsuit against Mr. Wolff is still possible.

{"Headline": "From Knitwear to \u2018Call Me by Your Name\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 Though Luca Guadagnino\u2019s film \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d earned four Oscar nominations, costume design was not among them. It\u2019s surprising, given how much the look of the film \u2014 all \u201980s nostalgia and insouciant sensuality, with a dollop of athletic shorts \u2014 has infiltrated the broader fashion sensibility since its release last year.And it\u2019s not the first time the woman responsible, Giulia Piersanti, has changed the way people dress. As Mr. Guadagnino\u2019s secret weapon \u2014 she has worked with him since his 2015 film \u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d \u2014 and the knitwear spark for brands such as C\u00e9line, Balenciaga and Lanvin, she specializes in reworking classic garments with a bit of irony and new spins on traditional yarns. Now, she toggles between film and fashion depending on the month.\u201cI\u2019m a designer and I happen to do movies,\u201d the 41-year-old said over tea at her Milan apartment, looking the epitome of cool in a khaki jumpsuit, her tousled black hair pulled into a low-slung ponytail. \u201cMovies,\u201d she said, \u201callow me to step outside of the knitwear category. I get to create a world from A to Z.\u201dMs. Piersanti\u2019s path from Italy to Hollywood was somewhat circuitous. Born in Rome, to an Italian family, she moved to Paris at the age of 7, and then to Los Angeles as a teenager. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak English; it was such a culture shock,\u201d she remembered. New York was next, where she studied fashion design at Parsons before dropping out to start her career at Miu Miu, in Milan.\u201cI decided to focus on knitwear early on,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s three-dimensional and experimental. You\u2019re actually creating new fabric.\u201dShe and Mr. Guadagnino met in Milan through friends, and he asked her to help with \u201cA Bigger Splash\u201d because traditional costume design \u201ccame with a sense of detachment from reality I couldn\u2019t understand,\u201d the film designer said. \u201cHer knowledge of every tribe and social identity is so deep that I felt it was a no-brainer.\u201d It was a challenging first film job with a seven-week deadline \u2014 not that any of that fazed Ms. Piersanti.The designer describes herself as a \u201cmassive researcher.\u201d Indeed, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who plays Elio in \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d described the film\u2019s costume department in Crema, Italy, as strewn with pictures. \u201cThey went door-to-door in town collecting photographs of the locals from the \u201980s,\u201d he said.Ms. Piersanti said photographs by Charles H. Traub of Italy in the \u201980s, teen magazines of the era and \u00c9ric Rohmer\u2019s 1983 film \u201cPauline at the Beach\u201d were all key influences. \u201cI wanted to avoid the characters looking too \u2018costumey,\u2019 like one of those bad Italian TV movies,\u201d she said.Case in point: the various kinds of super-short shorts worn by Armie Hammer\u2019s character Oliver throughout the film.Most recently, Ms. Piersanti worked with Mr. Guadagnino on \u201cSuspiria,\u201d a new version of Dario Argento\u2019s 1977 cult classic, scheduled for release this year. \u201cI designed an entire wardrobe from scratch,\u201d she said of the Amazon Studio horror movie. \u201cEverything from accessories to outerwear, and dresses, to prints.\u201dThe result was so extensive that, Ms. Piersanti said, manufacturing the collection and selling it through the online giant\u2019s fashion division in conjunction with the film\u2019s release was considered, although no deal has been signed.Tilda Swinton, who stars in \u201cSuspiria\u201d along with Dakota Johnson and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, said Ms. Piersanti \u201cthinks and works way beyond fashion and the conventional bounds of costume design,\u201d adding that she \u201cdesigned exquisite prints for blouses and dresses, glimpsed for an instant \u2014 at most \u2014 in the film, but imbuing the film with a sense of specialness, heightened reality, critical to the atmosphere of the world we made.\u201dThe film, set in the \u201970s, centers on a young American ballet dancer (Ms. Johnson) who travels to a prestigious Berlin dance academy only to discover its sinister and supernatural secrets.As with \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d Ms. Piersanti bypassed the usual sartorial tropes of the \u201970s, with her research producing voluminous silhouettes rather than bell-bottoms. During a visit to the film\u2019s set at the Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori in Varese, Italy, slinky blood-red macram\u00e9 dresses with bondage elements hung in a makeshift dressing room next to hair tunics that resembled nothing so much as long brunette versions of Martin Margiela\u2019s famous wig-coat from spring 2009. And Ms. Piersanti\u2019s aunt, Laura Urbinati, created dance leotards in the \u201cmuddy\u201d palette that the designer requested.\u201cI can\u2019t see myself working without Giulia for my next endeavors,\u201d Mr. Guadagnino said, adding that the two \u201care already plotting new worlds to create.\u201dBefore that, however, comes fashion week. Ms. Piersanti will be in Paris before moving on to Los Angeles and the Oscars, which she will attend with Mr. Guadagnino. She\u2019s considering wearing a pink C\u00e9line style from last spring\u2019s collection to the ceremony.\u201cMy peers find it difficult to comprehend I can work well in both environments,\u201d she said before leaving her apartment to take a plane to London. \u201cI\u2019m lucky I guess. A lot of people don\u2019t get to do what I do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Enter Correction Territory: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 Stocks enter correction territory.\u2022 Qualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s revised offer.\u2022 Snap and Twitter: From also-rans to worthy contenders?\u2022 BlackRock is reportedly setting its sights on Berkshire Hathaway and the Blackstone Group.\u2022 A top WSJ editor heads to Lazard.\u2022 Brunswick Group has named Neal Wolin as its new C.E.O.The Dow Jones industrial average and S.&P. 500 went more the 400 days without a pullback of 5 percent.That streak ended this week, and on Thursday, the two indexes fell into correction territory, defined as a pullback of at least 10 percent from their high. For both, it is the first time they have crossed into a correction since early 2016.The Dow plunged more than 1,000 points Thursday, its second decline of more than 1,000 points this week. The S. & P. 500 dropped 100 points, its third decline of more than 100 points in its history.On a percentage basis, the Dow fell 4.15 percent, the S. & P. 500 dropped 3.75 percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.9 percent.The bigger pictureAnxieties about inflation have driven the much of decline over the past week and a half. The yield on the benchmark Treasury note climbed above 2.85 percent \u2014 its highest level since 2014 \u2014 for the second time this week. Higher yields can crimp economic activity by raising borrowing costs, while also making riskier assets like stocks less appealing to bonds.Many market watchers say that investors should not worry about the recent spate of volatility in the stock market. Such swings, they say, are normal. They point to strong corporate earnings and a strengthening economy both in the United States and abroad as reasons to be optimistic about stocks.Investor sentiment has reversed in recent weeks as the sell-off in stocks gained momentum.According to the American Association of Individual Investors\u2019 weekly survey, bullish sentiment, or the percentage of respondents that say stocks will rise over the next six months, declined to 37 percent. The drop ended a streak of eight straight weeks with bullish sentiment above its historical average of 38.5 percent.It began the year at nearly 60 percent, its highest level since 2010.The contextThe survey has proved to be a good contrarian indicator. That means overly bullish sentiment often signals that the stock market is ripe for a pullback, while overly bearish sentiment often indicates that market may soon rally.The chip maker said its board had rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised $121 billion offer.The reasons\u2022 \u201cThe Broadcom proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm.\u201d\u2022 The offer \u201cfalls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction.\u201dQualcomm said that it was willing to meet with Broadcom to see if its issues with the offer could be addressed.The contextQualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.Till this week, many investors wondered whether Snap and Twitter had much of a future at a time when Google and Facebook are sucking up such a large share of digital advertising dollars. But after Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even as they remain in the shadow of Facebook and Google.\u2014 Peter EavisBlackRock itself raises a different comparison, according to Sarah Krouse of the WSJ \u2014 to Warren Buffett:The \u201cbest known\u201d example of BlackRock\u2019s approach with this new vehicle is Berkshire Hathaway, according to a fund-raising document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Omaha conglomerate run by Mr. Buffett is well known for its long-term ownership of companies.BlackRock\u2019s Long-Term Private Capital fund would be a tenth of Berkshire\u2019s $101 billion in cash. But it too would look to buy and hold positions for more than 10 years. Over all, though, this seems more akin to private equity.The practice has grown on Wall Street with the rise of activist investors, with investment banks touting their defense capabilities to corporate clients.Before becoming finance editor at the Journal, Mr. Berman oversaw the paper\u2019s business coverage and was its M.&A. reporter prior to that.Mr. Berman, who will join as a managing director and be based in New York, will start on Feb. 26.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedAndrew, with a bit of contextDennis follows in the footsteps of Steven Rattner, who worked as a reporter at the NYT in the 1980s before going to work as a banker at Lazard and becoming an influential financier. (Today, Mr. Rattner overseas Michael Bloomberg\u2019s fortune.)Dennis was my fiercest reporting competitor over the last decade and is one of the most talented financial journalists in recent memory.Mr. Wolin, who will remain based in Washington, will take over from the London-based Susan Gilchrist, who will become chairwoman of Brunswick\u2019s global clients operations and focus on client work full time.Alan Parker, Brunswick\u2019s founder, said in a telephone interview of the move, \u201cIt reflects the growth of the business and the business opportunity in America.\u201dThe contextIn some ways, the appointment of Mr. Wolin reflects that trend. Beyond his time at the Treasury Department, he previously worked as a senior executive at The Hartford, an insurer. And he was previously a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration.\u201cIncreasingly, I think senior executives and boards of directors have come to understand that a lot of their challenges and opportunitiess sit at the intersection of business and governments and society and so forth,\u201d Mr. Wolin said in a phone interview.Or as Mr. Parker put it, \u201cMore and more we hear ourselves described as a critical issues business.\u201dOther moves at Brunswick\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe recent stock market freak-out may have abated, but the dynamics that drove the sell-off \u2014 worries that faster global growth and hotter inflation will trigger faster-than-expected rate hikes \u2014 are alive and well in the currency markets.On Thursday, the Bank of England raised its growth forecasts for the United Kingdom, and Mark Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said rates would likely have to be increased faster than previously expected.The British pound promptly popped by more than 1 percent against the dollar, and yields on British government bonds rose. Treasury bonds yields in the United States also rose, with the 10-year note offering yields of nearing 2.90 percent.The sight of bond yields nearing 3 percent should keep stock investors on edge amid the growing conviction we\u2019re moving out of the era of low-interest rates, which were such a key ingredient for the near-decade-long bull market in stocks.\u2014 Matt PhillipsThe bigger pictureWhat business cares about in the proposal:\u2022 Nearly $300 billion in additional spending over the next two years\u2022 $20 billion for infrastructure spending\u2022 A lifting of the debt ceiling until March 2019The agreement will cause federal budget deficits to grow even larger, on top of the effects of the sweeping tax overhaul that lawmakers approved in December.

{"Headline": "What Bitcoin Reveals About Financial Markets", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe spectacular increase and recent plunge in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have raised concerns that the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble will cause financial markets to crash. They probably won\u2019t, but the Bitcoin bubble should finally destroy our faith in the efficiency of markets.Since the 1970s, economic policy has been based on the idea that financial market prices reflect all the information relevant to the value of any asset. If this is true, market prices are the best estimates of the value of any investment and financial markets should be relied on to allocate capital investment.The hypothesis survived the absurdities of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well as the meltdown in derivative markets that led to the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. Although the hypothesis should have been refuted by those disasters, it lived on, if only in zombie form.But at least each of those earlier bubbles began with a plausible premise. The rise of the internet has transformed our lives and given rise to some very profitable companies, such as Amazon and Google. Even though it was obvious that most 1990s dot-coms would fail, it was easy to make a case for any of them individually.As for the derivative assets that gave us the global financial crisis, they were viewed favorably in light of a widely held theory, known as the \u201cgreat moderation,\u201d that suggested that major economic crises were a thing of the past, thanks to certain systemic changes in the way developed nations ran their economies. The theory was backed by leading economists and central bankers. Asset-backed derivatives were, ultimately, a bet on the great moderation.The contrast with Bitcoin is stark. The Bitcoin bubble rests on no plausible premise. When Bitcoin was created about a decade ago, the underlying idea was that it would displace existing currencies for transactions of all kinds. But by the time the Bitcoin bubble took off last year, it was obvious that this would not happen. Only a handful of legitimate merchants ever accepted Bitcoin. And as the Bitcoin bubble drove up transactions charges and waiting times, even this handful walked away.For a while, Bitcoin was used for transactions that people wanted to keep secret from government authorities, like drug deals. It soon became apparent, however, that if authorities wanted to track these transactions, they could. For instance, Silk Road, the first major online drug market, which made use of Bitcoin, was shut down by the F.B.I. in 2013.Hardly anyone now suggests that Bitcoin has value as a currency. Rather, the new claim is that Bitcoin is a \u201cstore of value\u201d and that its price reflects its inherent scarcity. (By design, no more than 21 million Bitcoins can be created.)Most economists, including me, dismiss this claim. And if the claim is false, Bitcoin\u2019s value is obviously another deadly strike against the efficient market hypothesis.Consider: If Bitcoin is a \u201cstore of value,\u201d then asset prices are entirely arbitrary. As the proliferation of cryptocurrencies has shown, nothing is easier than creating a scarce asset. The same argument would apply to any existing financial assets. Any stock in the S & P 500 could be priced not in terms of future earnings prospects but on the basis that people choose to value it highly.Suppose, more plausibly, that Bitcoin has no underlying value and will eventually become worthless. According to the efficient market hypothesis, financial markets will correctly estimate the true value of Bitcoin and will drive the price to zero immediately.But that hasn\u2019t happened either. Until recently, it wasn\u2019t even possible because the Bitcoin markets were themselves as opaque as the currency.Now it is possible: Futures trading for Bitcoin on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has been going on since December. But Bitcoin prices rose after the creation of futures trading and began their sharp decline only when governments took measures to limit speculation.Current futures contracts in Bitcoin extend as far as June of this year. According to those contract prices, the market expects Bitcoin to retain its value well into the future.Whatever happens to Bitcoin, we must not lose sight of a more fundamental \u2014 and more worrisome \u2014 development: A financial product with a purely arbitrary value has been successfully introduced in the world\u2019s most sophisticated financial markets.Bitcoin probably won\u2019t bring financial markets crashing down. But it shows that regulators need to cut those markets down to size.John Quiggin is an economist at the University of Queensland in Australia and the author of \u201cZombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk Among Us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Have Streaming Revenue, Too, Says NBC. And We Can Prove It.", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you run a broadcast network these days, it\u2019s easy to feel left out.\u201cAll the excitement is about cable and streaming,\u201d the chairman of NBC Entertainment, Robert Greenblatt, said in an interview. \u201cWe are the forgotten business on some level.\u201dBut Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s network is positioned relatively well among the networks. Last week, NBC pulled ahead of CBS in total viewers through the first 20 weeks of the 2017-18 season, the first time it has had the lead since 2002.Mr. Greenblatt has another reason for optimism: He is holding onto a trove of in-house statistics he believes are the key to proving to advertisers that broadcasters can make the transition to the streaming universe.Nielsen ratings, which measure the number of viewers who tune in for shows at the time of their broadcasts, are down for the networks yet again \u2014 10 percent this season. NBC has responded by learning to make money from viewers who stream its programs \u2014 and now it is learning how to put a number on it. The key is gathering statistics from services like NBC.com, the NBC app, video on demand and Hulu to determine how much money its shows are pulling in from streamers.Take \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d According to the network\u2019s data crunchers, NBC has earned around 47 percent of the revenue generated by its 2016 pilot episode from advertising through digital views. Over all, 44 percent of the revenue NBC has earned from \u201cThis Is Us\u201d has come through digital viewership.Similarly, the critically acclaimed sitcom, \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d starring Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, has earned roughly 36 percent of its revenue from digital advertising, NBC said.\u201cIt\u2019s not insignificant now,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think over time it grows into becoming really significant.\u201dNot every show is making big money from digital views. About three-quarters of the revenue NBC made from the 2015 pilot of \u201cBlindspot,\u201d for instance, has been earned the old fashioned way.But NBC was less savvy back then in extracting money from viewers who preferred streaming. By the time of the first \u201cThis Is Us\u201d season, NBC had wised up, striking a deal that allowed it to earn money from Hulu ads shown during episodes of the hit tear-jerker.Generating revenue from streaming is relatively new for the networks, said Jeff Bader, NBC\u2019s president of program planning, strategy and research.\u201cWhen I came to NBC five years ago, we were in this place with: How are we going to manage this business that\u2019s been in decline?\u201d he said. \u201cWe were doing everything we could not to be the record industry and have our stuff pirated and not monetized.\u201dParticularly depressing was the number of younger viewers who seemed to be changing their viewing habits.\u201cFor years, we were seeing our average age go up, up up,\u201d Mr. Bader said. \u201cYounger viewers were drifting. \u201dOnce the network examined the data, however, it saw that younger viewers hadn\u2019t abandoned NBC. They were just watching shows on their own schedules.NBC understands the reason for the advertising community\u2019s skepticism concerning the number of people who watch shows via streaming, however.\u201cThat is the frustrating part of the whole ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have a third-party objective measuring system that everyone has adopted that we all buy into.\u201dUntil that third-party system emerges, Mr. Greenblatt said that his sales department has gone all-in on selling advertisers on a statistical portrait that is prettier than the one painted by Nielsen.\u201cThis started for me purely on looking at viewership numbers, because I wanted to be able to make the argument, \u2018People aren\u2019t just bailing on network TV,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen it occurred to us, it\u2019s not just a viewership number we\u2019re defending. It\u2019s part of the business model now and it\u2019s going to be move that way more and more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
