{"Headline": "With Waymo Settlement, Uber C.E.O. Makes His Mark", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For weeks, Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s chief executive, and some of his lieutenants had worked behind the scenes to repair the ride-hailing company\u2019s fractious relationship with Waymo, the self-driving business spun out of Google.Mr. Khosrowshahi worked to coax Google\u2019s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and to let them know that Uber had turned over a new leaf, according to two people briefed on the situation, who asked not to be identified because the details were confidential. Tony West, Uber\u2019s recently appointed general counsel and a former Department of Justice official, also jumped into the negotiations, these people said.The settlement signified something else, too: Uber is Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s company now. Since stepping inside Uber\u2019s doors last fall, the 48-year-old has made it clear he wants to put the company\u2019s checkered past behind it as fast as possible. With the Waymo deal, he showed the many tactics that he plans to use to accomplish that \u2014 expressions of regret, accompanied by conciliation, compromise and efficiency. Call him the diplomat in chief.On Friday, Mr. Kalanick struck a defiant tone about the settlement. \u201cOur sole objective was to hire the most talented scientists and engineers to help lead the company and our cities to a driverless future,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe evidence at trial overwhelmingly proved that, and had the trial proceeded to its conclusion, it is clear Uber would have prevailed.\u201dFor now, Mr. Khosrowshahi has appeared to smooth over the sore spots with Waymo. Waymo will still be able to pursue a separate legal proceeding against Mr. Levandowski, which is unfolding as a closed-door arbitration.\u201cWhile I cannot erase the past, I can commit, on behalf of every Uber employee, that we will learn from it, and it will inform our actions going forward,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi said in his blog post.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Car Navigation Systems Plot a Course Forward Against Phone Apps", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsHow do you get someone to pay hundreds of dollars for an inferior product, when most people already have a better one in their pocket?That\u2019s the problem facing carmakers trying to sell built-in navigation systems when superior alternatives such as Apple\u2019s Maps, Google Maps and Waze are available for free to anyone with a smartphone \u2014 which is almost everybody.And next-generation navigation systems are not just an important way for carmakers to interact with drivers. They are also a crucial step in the development of autonomous vehicles.Garmin and TomTom \u2014 companies that became best known for GPS units that sit atop the dash \u2014 are also major providers of mapping data and in-dash user interfaces to car manufacturers.TomTom is \u201ccollecting data on a large scale, learning how to aggregate it to spot trends in traffic for autonomous vehicles,\u201d its chief executive, Harold Goddijn, said. \u201cAll the car manufacturers will need to share that data.\u201dBut for now, many carmakers bundle their navigation systems with other features, forcing buyers to take one in order to get something else they actually want.Do you want your gauges to appear on a digital display, instead of a standard instrument panel, in your new vehicle? Buyers of certain trim levels of some Audi and Volvo models may have to purchase a bundle that includes navigation. Volvo charges an additional $1,400 in its XC60, while Audi\u2019s could cost as much as $3,000, depending on the vehicle.Buyers of Alfa Romeo\u2019s base Giulia model who want Sirius XM satellite radio must take the navigation system, too \u2014 at a cost of $1,900.\u201cThis business model is not sustainable,\u201d said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director of connected vehicles and services.Even with their limitations, in-dash systems have some advantages. They\u2019re convenient and uncluttered. There\u2019s no need to find a way to suspend a smartphone and its dangling charge cable in the middle of the instrument panel. They use a vehicle\u2019s built-in controls, and there\u2019s no danger of running out of power.But in-dash systems typically store data locally, meaning information may be inaccurate and outdated. Upgrading such systems can be difficult or even impossible. Even when it can be done, it can be a multistep process of downloading new data to a flash drive and then transferring it to the vehicle.In a recent test of a 2015 model-year car, the built-in navigation system had no listing for a winery that has been in business for 15 years. Both Apple Maps and Google Maps found it in a split second. That\u2019s because smartphone navigation apps are cloud based, continually updated with new information.But in-dash systems are closing the gap. On the way are products that are connected to the cloud and easily upgraded via an over-the-air data connection. Tesla uses over-the-air updates to occasionally renew its maps, while Ford has already used such updates to add CarPlay and Android Auto functionality to models with its Sync3 system.And soon, maps will rely not just on stored information but on constantly updated data gleaned from a vehicle\u2019s cameras and sensors and data from other drivers.\u201cPressure from Google Maps and Apple Maps made automobile manufacturers realize they have to step up with over-the-air updates of their maps and their software,\u201d Mr. Goddijn said.HERE\u2019s next-generation in-dash navigation technology will debut this year in Audi\u2019s new A8 sedan and the 2019 Porsche Cayenne. The A8 will, among other things, use HERE technology to learn a driver\u2019s route preferences, and then make more informed route suggestions.Drivers can use the HERE smartphone app at home to plan a route, which will be automatically transferred to the in-vehicle system. When the driver reaches his or her destination, the app will pick up from there for foot or public transit directions.Route-mapping will be handled on HERE\u2019s servers, which will take into account traffic conditions far off the planned path that could nevertheless affect navigation. In addition, map data will include not just the road itself but information on weather, curves, inclines, junctions and city limits, allowing the vehicle to adjust its speed accordingly.In-dash navigation systems will also use information gleaned from a vehicle\u2019s sensors and cameras to position a vehicle in a lane, with accuracy within eight inches.\u201cOur sensor technology will allow us to tell drivers to remain in one lane on a road for the fastest travel time,\u201d Mr. Butler, of Ford, said.Technology from TomTom will let drivers indicate whether they\u2019re looking for the fastest route, or the one with the least stop-and-go traffic, and be instructed accordingly. When a single vehicle using HERE technology passes over a pothole, it will be recorded and subsequent vehicles directed around it.HERE is already accumulating such passively derived road data from 500,000 vehicles across the world. Currently, the company is sharing its data with only its three big German owners. In the United States, about 14 percent of cars on the road have the sensors necessary to transmit road conditions, Mr. Butler said.With the development of autonomous vehicles, that sort of information becomes even more important, enabling a car to learn about road conditions from other vehicles and safely navigate around accidents, tie-ups, potholes and flash floods.\u201cCurrently, our in-dash navigation systems are at a disadvantage compared to smartphone apps,\u201d Mr. Butler said. \u201cBut soon, we\u2019ll be at an advantage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gay Mardi Gras in Sydney Goes Corporate, Clashing With Activist Roots", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 They were there for the Sissy Ball, a vogue-style dance-off that was last weekend\u2019s contribution to the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, a two-week gay pride festival that will culminate in a parade this Saturday.But as dozens of gay and transgender dancers popped and sashayed on the catwalk before a cheering crowd, the ball\u2019s M.C. reminded everyone what made the bash possible.\u201cShout out to Red Bull!\u201d he yelled.Red Bull, the energy drink producer, is one of dozens of companies sponsoring and participating in Mardi Gras this year. Others include Netflix, Absolut, Airbnb and Tinder. The retail bank ANZ has decorated automated teller machines around Sydney, which it calls \u201cGAYTMs.\u201dOrganizers see corporate involvement as a sign of increased acceptance, an acknowledgment of gays\u2019 spending power and necessary to keeping the festival alive and growing. But critics contend that corporatizing the event risks losing its activist roots and community spirit.\u201cThe sad thing is, the big companies got in,\u201d said Daniel Matatahi, founder of Gay Sydney Australia, which was excluded despite marching for the past three years. \u201cNetflix! How the hell did they get in? They have money. They\u2019ve never been part of our community, never.\u201dBut that acceptance did not come easily.The first Mardi Gras took place in Sydney in 1978. Gays and lesbians, many of them out publicly for the first time, took to the streets for a pride parade. Police officers surrounded the marchers and arrested 53 people, in some cases using excessive force.\u201cWe were not supposed to be seen, we were expected to hide who we were,\u201d said Mark Gillespie, 65, reflecting on that first parade.For him, political activism, not mainstream acceptance, is at the core of the event.But today, Mardi Gras is a hugely popular \u2014 and visible \u2014 staple on Sydney\u2019s cultural calendar. There are family-friendly carnivals, a film festival and a sold-out after-party headlined by Cher.About 300,000 people are expected to attend this year\u2019s parade.Back then, corporations \u201cdidn\u2019t want to know us,\u201d said Tracey Atkinson, 60. \u201cNow we\u2019re the darlings of the free world.\u201dThe legalization of same-sex marriage last year put gays further in the spotlight, and advertisers are hoping to capitalize on that exposure. But more than just a onetime marketing play, businesses are increasingly aware of the gay community\u2019s consumer power and directing advertising toward it.A 2016 study by the marketing agency Out Now estimates the annual spending power of Australia\u2019s L.G.B.T. community at more than 73 billion Australian dollars, or $57 billion American dollars. Australian same-sex couples are likely to have higher personal incomes than those in heterosexual relationships, according to the 2016 census.\u201cMardi Gras is a community initiative, and it\u2019s a wonderful way to raise awareness and celebrate,\u201d said Vanessa Hicks, a spokeswoman for Vodafone Australia, the mobile phone network sponsoring the event. \u201cFor us as a business, we see this as a natural way to connect with that environment.\u201dThe event\u2019s organizer says corporate interest is a sign of progress and acceptance. In order to participate, said Terese Casu, the Mardi Gras chief executive, businesses are required to have their own inclusion and diversity initiatives in place.\u201cThe work that corporations are doing is not token,\u201d Ms. Casu said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely authentic and it\u2019s genuine, and if it isn\u2019t, they\u2019re not with Mardi Gras.\u201dOne of those grant recipients, Giti Datt, 33, is marching in the parade for the first time. Her float\u2019s theme is a gay Indian wedding.\u201cI was just crying and shaking,\u201d Ms. Datt said of learning that her float would be included in the parade. \u201cI think we have an opportunity to be visible. And that\u2019s a way that we can change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil Looks to Crack Down on Fake News Ahead of Bitter Election", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Worried that Brazilians will soon be flooded with fake news ahead of a critical presidential election, the country is setting out to crack down on organized efforts to intentionally mislead voters.The officials leading the effort argue that the right to free speech cannot come at the expense of an illegitimate outcome, in an election that could dramatically alter the course of Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy.At Justice Fux\u2019s direction, Brazil\u2019s Federal Police recently established a task force of law enforcement and intelligence personnel, which is developing strategies to prevent fake news from being produced and to limit its reach once misleading content starts spreading online.\u201cIt is not our intention to infringe on anyone\u2019s freedom of expression or their right to voice an opinion,\u201d said Eug\u00eanio Ricas, the director of the Federal Police\u2019s organized crime division, who is leading the fake news task force. \u201cThe big question is when does a personal opinion become a lie about a candidate that is published with the specific intent of harming them and in doing so interfering with an election.\u201dJudicial officials say the task force is studying the tactics used by groups that have been active in spreading fake news in the past and assessing under which current laws they could most effectively be charged. They have also been consulting and negotiating with American technology companies, including Google, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, in hopes of turning them into partners in the fight against fake news rather than targets of enforcement actions and fines.If their initiative succeeds, Brazilian officials say that the October election, which will take place in a deeply polarized society, could serve as a template to address a problem that has undermined faith in democracy across the world.While officials are mainly concerned about fake news strategies deployed by rival campaigns, not a foreign power, they caution that such tactics are often planned and executed abroad, which makes shutting them down difficult.Yet it is unlikely that lawmakers will pass controversial legislation before the election, according to politicians and analysts.That leaves officials having to make use of laws and regulations they view as anachronistic for a 21st-century problem.These include electoral and defamation penal codes that were passed before the internet existed, and a dictatorship-era public security law from the 1980s that prohibited spreading rumors with the potential to generate panic or unrest.\u201cThose laws are not adequate to apply to the tactics of today,\u201d Mr. Ricas said. \u201cThe evolution of the internet and communication,\u201d he added, \u201cmakes it hard to be relying on laws from the \u201980s, the \u201960s, the \u201940s.\u201dThe legal situation has made building constructive relationships with technology companies a pinnacle of the plan.They have a powerful incentive to cooperate because the tribunal headed by Justice Fux is in the process of finalizing guidelines for electoral advertising online. At a time when Brazilian politicians are increasingly turning to social media rather than traditional outlets to target voters, the social media platforms are positioned to make a windfall.This reliance on social media to get the campaigns\u2019 messages out are expected to put the companies in the cross hairs of fake news disputes, and they say they are doing what they can to combat the problem.\u201cThe elections in Brazil are a priority for us, and we have been taking a series of steps to make sure our platform gives people a voice, encourages civic engagement and helps strengthen democracy,\u201d a press officer for Facebook said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have made several product improvements to reduce the reach of low quality content, eliminate the economic incentives behind most fake news, and prioritize content from trustworthy and informative sources.\u201dGoogle, which has been sued and fined dozens of times in Brazil as part of efforts to get online content removed, has met with judicial officials to explain the advances, and limitations, of its tools to combat fake news.\u201cWhile there is always more to do, we believe the actions we are taking will help prevent the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality and downright false information,\u201d a Google press officer said in a statement.Law enforcement officials in Brazil have expressed particular interest in WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook, which has about 120 million active users in Brazil.While government officials and the technology companies\u2019 representatives say their discussions have been cordial and productive to date, the companies have made it clear they do not intend to become arbiters of truth.Mr. da Silva is by far the leading target of negative fake news stories in Brazil, according to an analysis by Veja, a weekly newsmagazine, which recently published a cover story about misinformation campaigns. One example was an article falsely claiming that Mr. da Silva had said he would ascend to the presidency even if it meant trampling the federal judge who convicted him of corruption and money laundering last year.Mr. Bolsonaro is the rare Brazilian public figure who is the subject of more fake news stories that cast him in a positive light than a negative one, according to Veja\u2019s analysis. A spokesman for Mr. Bolsonaro did not respond to an emailed query about whether the campaign considers the use of fake news a legitimate electoral tactic. Mr. de Silva recently said such tactics should not be employed.Marina Silva, a former environment minister who is running third in the polls, announced that she was recruiting an army of volunteers to discredit the type of disinformation campaigns that she said derailed her past two bids for the presidency, in 2010 and 2014. False stories spread on social media about Ms. Silva before those elections included a claim that, as an evangelical, she intended to ban video games and an accusation that her bodyguards once fatally beat a gay man who tried to approach her.\u201cWe have already seen troublesome initiatives and a proliferation of laws aiming at active monitoring and regulating of online speech and delegating fact-checking to authorities,\u201d the group said.But Justice Fux pointed to the American election as a cautionary tale about what can happen if there is no effort to check false information.\u201cIn the American election, freedom of expression trumped over fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cHere in our country we recognize that while a right may be exercised, it can also be abused.\u201dLis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Bush said that with Mr. Immelt, the answer is yes.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing less marriage counseling with 12 adults,\u201d Mr. Bush said of his board, adding that Mr. Immelt would be a partner to take advice from (and occasionally whine to).An outside perspective\u201cWhat Jeff brings is an understanding of scale on a couple of dimensions, not only in terms of people and processes but also how you think about scaling with your partners.\u201d\u2014 Henry Ellenbogen of T.

But because the agreement gives both parties what they wanted most, the deficit impact appears to be of little concern. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Speaker Paul D. Ryan all quickly embraced it.\u201dCritics corner\u2022 Hard-line conservatives were unsparing in their assessment of the deal.\u2022 Representative Nancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats, said she could not agree to any budget deal that was not accompanied by a debate over legislation to protect the fate of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers.\u201cRevenue was $286 million, up 72 percent from a year earlier and about $30 million more than analysts had expected. Daily users rose nine million to 187 million, the best growth in over a year. The retention rate of new Android users, a special focus for Snap, jumped nearly 20 percent over the previous year.\u201d\u201cThe company lost $350 million in the quarter, or 13 cents a share, which was narrower than the loss of 16 cents that was expected by analysts. And it also contrasted with the carnage of the prior quarter, when Snap recorded a net loss that was twice the forecast.\u201dThe bigger pictureThe results have helped quell some of the concerns about the company\u2019s slowing revenue and user growth in the face of increased competition from the likes of Facebook.Critics cornerIn the early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump lamented that in the \u201cold days,\u201d stocks would rise on good economic news, saying \u201cToday, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake.\u201d The tweet did not elaborate on what he meant by the \u201cold days\u201d or explain further his analysis of why stocks plummeted on Friday and Monday.Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the fall was pegged to good economic news stems from Friday\u2019s job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment.\u2014 Michael D. Shear and Alan RappeportIn recent months, many powerful men have had to step down from senior positions as they have faced accusations of sexual harassment, but none were the head of a public company like Mr. Wynn. How would the board, shareholders, regulators, customers and unions react?We now know something about the shareholder perspective: Shares in Wynn Resorts were up 7 percent in early-morning trading today. Regulators in Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau are still conducting their own investigations.But the biggest unresolved question remains the board and its conduct.The board set up a committee of independent directors to carry out an investigation after the WSJ article, but it was not clear how rigorous it would be. The board did not have a track record for holding Mr. Wynn accountable.In an email exchange with me, Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard law professor and an expert in corporate governance, asked why the board did not suspend Mr. Wynn from his position pending the investigation, or demand that he not interact with Wynn Resorts employees, a step that would have limited his ability to influence the board investigation.One remaining way to assess the board\u2019s resolve will be Mr. Wynn\u2019s separation agreement, which is not yet finalized.When the WSJ article was published, Mr. Wynn denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, calling them \u201cpreposterous.\u201d On Tuesday he said, \u201cI have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity.\u201dIt is not clear why Mr. Wynn decided to step down. It may have been pressure from gaming regulators. Customers might have been pulling back.Mr. Wynn may have wanted to preserve the value of his own stake in Wynn Resorts. But as it stands, it does not look like the board was a strong force.\u2014 Peter EavisSteve Wynn has stepped down from his $17 billion casino empire, a little over a week after allegations of forced sex and other sexual misconduct claims emerged in a WSJ investigation.Top executives spent hours with Mr. Wynn going over plans for a new casino he would like to build in Las Vegas, according to a person familiar with the matter, while the company\u2019s general counsel hopped on a call with other executives to discuss the Vegas Strong Fund, a nonprofit formed in the aftermath of last year\u2019s mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, according to a person familiar with the call.He also attended the company\u2019s 1,500-guest Super Bowl party on Sunday, the WSJ says.In a statement, Mr. Wynn blamed his exit on \u201ca rush to judgment\u201d that took \u201cprecedence over everything, including the facts.\u201dThe big questions\u2022 Do other S. & P. 500 C.E.O.s now have something to fear?\u2022 And is the Wynn empire \u2014 from Las Vegas to Macau to, soon, Massachusetts \u2014 now ripe for a takeover or breakup?Critics\u2019 cornerLAT staff have chafed at the decisions of Tronc and its chairman, Michael Ferro. More from Sydney Ember of the NYT:Many employees at The Times have of late adopted the mantra \u201canyone but Ferro,\u201d but it is also not clear what decisions Dr. Soon-Shiong, who largely made his fortune selling generic drugs and developing a new type of cancer drug, will make as the paper\u2019s owner.The deals flyaroundAs the stocks calmly glided higher in 2017, investors from hedge fund titans to day traders poured billions in to bets that volatility would continue to fall.Those wagers blew up this week.Now investors are selling the exchange company behind the trading in volatility.Shares of the C.B.O.E. Global Markets, whose volatility index facilitated those wagers, are down 17 percent since the start of the sell-off. Thursday they are off 3 percent.Critics cornerBlame the VIX/machines/debt?\u2022 Steven Mnuchin suggested yesterday that algorithms might be behind the whipsawing: \u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions.\u201dOn one side: Brian Chesky, the home rental giant\u2019s co-founder and C.E.O., who wants it kept private a while yet.More from Olivia Zaleski:Despite pledging support for Chesky\u2019s desire to keep Airbnb private, Sequoia Capital partner Alfred Lin, along with Jeff Jordan of Andreessen Horowitz, wanted to explore the possibility. In December, they asked Michael Grimes, the head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, to present options for going public, said people close to the bank.Ultimately, Mr. Tosi \u2014 who didn\u2019t see eye to eye with Mr. Chesky on other issues and generally did not fit in at Airbnb \u2014 resigned.An Airbnb spokesman denied there was ever any intent to pursue an I.P.O. this year.The tech flyaroundMr. Carstens also argued that cryptocurrencies were freeloading on existing financial infrastructure and the legitimacy that came from being linked to it.Most digital currencies are unlikely to survive in their current form, and investors should prepare for coins to lose all their value as they\u2019re replaced by a small set of future competitors, Goldman\u2019s Steve Strongin said in a report dated Feb. 5.\u201cCrazy things can come true.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Slack\u2019s C.F.O.

{"Headline": "Can the United States Search Data Overseas?", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorShould the United States government be able to conduct a search of your emails if they are stored on a server in another country, or does the government\u2019s right to examine digital evidence stop at the border?Both sides in the case have legitimate concerns. If the court sides with Microsoft and declines to allow searches for data stored in another country, the government will be hampered in investigating crimes like terrorism, child pornography and fraud.If the court sides with the government and rules that it may demand data stored overseas by American companies, those companies will find it much harder to do business abroad. This is because many foreigners fear that United States warrants authorizing such searches will disregard privacy protections afforded by their country. The government of Germany, a country with stringent privacy laws, has already indicated it will not use any American company for its data services if the court decides to allow searches.For the United States technology industry, the stakes are high. Last year, the worldwide public cloud services market was estimated to be a $246.8 billion business. Most of the leading companies in this sector are American: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, IBM. If other countries were to follow Germany\u2019s lead, the economic consequences could be severe.While a clarifying decision is needed in this particular case, nothing that the Supreme Court rules will solve the fundamental problem: The Stored Communications Act, a 1986 law that governs the storage and disclosure of electronic communications by third parties, is outdated. Congress needs to act to ensure that technology companies can flourish overseas while law enforcement has the right tools to gather evidence worldwide.The Supreme Court case goes back to 2013, when federal agents served a warrant on Microsoft, seeking email communications belonging to a drug trafficking suspect. Microsoft handed over the suspect\u2019s account information and address book, which sat on its servers in the United States, but refused to turn over any email content, which was stored at a data center in Ireland.Microsoft argued that the email content was outside the reach of United States law enforcement. The government countered that because Microsoft could retrieve the data in Ireland with a click of a mouse, without leaving its headquarters in Redmond, Wash., the email content was within its reach.Two lower courts agreed with the government. But in July 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York reversed the lower courts and determined that the information stored in Ireland was beyond the reach of a United States warrant.At the center of this case is the Stored Communications Act, which was written when there was no modern global internet or cloud storage. It provides Fourth Amendment safeguards to prevent unreasonable searches of electronically stored communications \u2014 but says nothing about data held abroad.The Court of Appeals concluded that the Stored Communications Act was not intended by Congress to allow searches outside the country. The ruling followed the well-established principle that American courts generally do not apply United States law beyond its borders unless Congress intended so.But at least four federal courts have since refused to follow the ruling, mostly for practical, technology-driven reasons. The cases before those courts involved Google and Yahoo, which store data \u201cdynamically\u201d \u2014 breaking data into many small pieces and constantly shuttling it among storage centers in various countries to optimize performance and network efficiency. The text of an email might reside in Bulgaria, but the attachment in Spain.Does it make any sense to think of this email as located in a specific country overseas? As a United States District Court judge, Juan R. S\u00e1nchez, wrote in an opinion that rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, \u201cno one knows which country to ask\u201d for the data.Because Microsoft still frequently uses local-based storage, the Supreme Court case, though important, is of limited significance. The court has an opportunity to clarify the scope of the Stored Communications Act with respect to data stored \u201cstatically\u201d outside the United States. (When signing up for service, a Microsoft user indicates his or her country of residence and Microsoft usually stores the user\u2019s data in a nearby data center.) But the case does not address the more general question of the legal standards that govern information that crosses borders \u2014 and in particular, data stored \u201cdynamically.\u201dOnly Congress can address that larger question, by writing an urgently needed new law. (Even the Second Circuit appealed to Congress to step in.) The International Communications Privacy Act, introduced last term in Congress, is a good place to start. It provides a framework by which United States law enforcement can obtain communications of both United States and foreign citizens, consistent with the privacy protections afforded by international law.The guiding principle should be that the reach of any new law is defined by the citizenship and geographical location of the individual whose data the government seeks, rather the physical location of the data. This would allow for the right balance between global privacy rights and the needs of United States law enforcement.No matter how the Microsoft case is decided, if Congress fails to act, we will continue to have a legal system that inadequately governs the vast stores of electronic data that move seamlessly across international borders.Craig A. Newman is a lawyer at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber and Waymo Settle Trade Secrets Suit Over Driverless Cars", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Waymo and Uber settled their legal fight on Friday, nearly a year after Waymo first accused the ride-hailing company of plotting to steal important self-driving car technology.After four days of arguments and testimony in Federal District Court here, Uber agreed to provide Waymo, the self-driving car unit under Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, with 0.34 percent of its stock. According to Waymo, the settlement\u2019s terms value Uber at $72 billion, meaning the Alphabet unit\u2019s stake is worth about $245 million.The trial also offered a peek into how Silicon Valley really works: the rise of promising start-ups that challenge incumbents; the inner workings of rich, but often chaotic, technology companies; the complicated rivalries among billionaire tech entrepreneurs; and the costly competition for engineering talent.The dispute between the two companies started in 2016 after Uber acquired Otto, a start-up making self-driving trucks that was founded by Anthony Levandowski, an early member of Google\u2019s self-driving car project. Uber agreed to pay a reported $590 million for Otto just six months after it was founded.But Waymo \u2014 which was spun out from Google in late 2016 \u2014 claimed the deal was part of a plan to steal its laser-sensor technology, a key component for operating self-driving cars. Mr. Levandowski had begun talking with Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive at the time, about the possibility of working together on autonomous-vehicle technology while he was still employed at Google, according to evidence presented at the trial.Before the trial started, Uber offered to settle with Waymo in exchange for 0.68 percent of the company\u2019s equity, or about $500 million, but its board of directors pulled the offer and allowed Mr. Kalanick to testify, according to two people familiar with Uber\u2019s thinking who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.After testimony on Thursday, settlement talks restarted, and Uber offered the lower percentage, these people said. For Waymo, the financial terms were not as important as scoring concessions on not using Waymo\u2019s technology, said a person familiar with Waymo\u2019s deliberations who was not authorized to discuss them.The settlement included an agreement that none of Waymo\u2019s confidential information was being incorporated in Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicle technology.After almost a decade of work on self-driving cars, the Uber stake may be the first substantial money that Waymo has made from the technology. Alphabet was already a major investor in Uber through its venture capital arm, GV. It has also made a billion-dollar investment in Uber\u2019s main rival in the United States, Lyft.Although it settled the lawsuit, Waymo\u2019s court fight may have succeeded in embarrassing a rival while delivering a unspoken warning to former and current employees to be cautious about leaving the company with know-how developed there. It also struck a deal before Larry Page, Alphabet\u2019s chief executive, who rarely speaks in public, had to testify in court next week.The settlement helps resolve one of Uber\u2019s many lingering issues from Mr. Kalanick\u2019s tumultuous time as chief executive, which ended in June. His successor, Dara Khosrowshahi, has said he hopes to change the perception that Uber has been too quick to break rules.The settlement also clears away a significant legal risk as Uber prepares for an expected initial public offering. It is still dealing with a Department of Justice investigation into its business practices. Although the company insists it did not take any Waymo trade secrets, Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a statement that he regretted the events that led to the litigation.\u201cMy job as Uber\u2019s C.E.O. is to set the course for the future of the company: innovating and growing responsibly, as well as acknowledging and correcting mistakes of the past,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cThe prospect that a couple of Waymo employees may have inappropriately solicited others to join Otto, and that they may have potentially left with Google files in their possession, in retrospect, raised some hard questions.\u201dMr. Kalanick released a statement that was not nearly as conciliatory.\u201cNo trade secrets ever came to Uber,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe evidence at trial overwhelmingly proved that, and had the trial proceeded to its conclusion, it is clear Uber would have prevailed.\u201dJudge Alsup referred Mr. Levandowski\u2019s case to the Justice Department, although it was not clear whether a criminal case was being pursued against him. Mr. Levandowski, who received a $120 million bonus for his work on Google\u2019s self-driving car, was expected to refuse to answer questions if he had taken the stand as scheduled next week.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Go, Me!\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplaySATURDAY PUZZLE \u2014 I was struck by two aspects of this Saturday puzzle by John Guzzetta, one very specific, one broad. First, for some reason, a pair of long crossing entries stuck out to me \u2014 PAROLE HEARING and BAILED OUT. That inspired the silly readout under the headline today, and just struck me as extra clever. It couldn\u2019t be my own conscience, which is as innocent as a spring lamb, and certainly couldn\u2019t be because the long, extremely slow-moving arm of the law has been on my blameless mind these days. Nevertheless, I appreciated it.The other, less particular attribute today was the nice mix of clues from different vernacular eras. Today\u2019s puzzle had a couple of very recent terms that I was challenged by, and another couple of long entries that were anachronisms to me, equally hard to figure. Most of the good Times puzzles use modern slang, terms from antiquity, and everything in between; the best do it so skillfully that solvers of all linguistic interests can find a clue or two for their genre of choice, as well as pick up some terms. That\u2019s one of the things that keeps this sport alive!17A: For \u201cDirt spreader,\u201d I thought literally, and tried to figure out what farming or construction implement could fit in here. Instead this cleverly refers to the kind of dirt we dish out, gossip or whisper about, the specialty of a RUMORMONGER.33A: An occasional entry in the Times puzzle, I didn\u2019t know the term COLLET for a gem setting. In case you want to incorporate it into conversation (with your jeweler, perchance?) the word apparently sounds like \u201ccall it,\u201d rather than \u201cCollette\u201d or \u201cCalais.\u201dThis meditative little video is from a notable silversmithing family, originally from Spain, that\u2019s been in Buenos Aires for about a century.When I submitted this puzzle in 2016, MACRON was not the president of France.

{"Headline": "In an Era of \u2018Smart\u2019 Things, Sometimes Dumb Stuff Is Better", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIt still feels magical to light up your living room by saying \u201cAlexa, turn on the lights.\u201d But with all the hype surrounding so-called smart things \u2014 everyday devices that are connected to the internet \u2014 it\u2019s easy to forget that sometimes the dumb stuff is just better.Tech companies are adding internet connections to just about everything you can imagine so that they can be controlled with smart speakers or phones. Thermostats, surveillance cameras, mosquito zappers, coffee makers \u2014 you name it.But before we get carried away setting up the Wi-Fi connections on all our appliances, lights and fashion accessories, let me play Luddite for a second. Some of the most mundane devices are designed to accomplish a simple task extremely well \u2014 and in some cases they still execute those duties better than their high-tech brethren.So let\u2019s take a moment to appreciate some of the best dumb things. Here are my top picks.Yet a normal wristwatch is still superior at one crucial task: Telling the time.The Apple Watch\u2019s screen wakes up when you tilt your wrist at an angle, which indicates you are trying to check the time. That helps conserve battery life. But any Apple Watch wearer is familiar with situations where this feature gets frustrating.While riding a bicycle, for example, you often have to let go of the handle bar and lift the watch toward your face to check the time. When you\u2019re standing on a bus or subway train and holding onto a pole, it is difficult to tilt your wrist at the correct angle to look at the time. Or when you\u2019re in a meeting and want to see if you\u2019re staying on schedule, flicking your wrist isn\u2019t very subtle.Until the Apple Watch manages to constantly display the time without sapping the battery, a normal wristwatch is better for telling the time in all those scenarios. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see me wearing a normal watch at work but an Apple Watch at the gym.Many cars are now equipped with a touch-screen on the console that essentially mirrors your smartphone screen. Android phone users get to use Android Auto, and iPhone users hook into CarPlay.The problem with this concept is there are a limited number of apps that work with these smart infotainment systems. For example, if on CarPlay you prefer to use Google Maps or Waze, you\u2019re out of luck and are stuck with Apple Maps.Voil\u00e0, your phone has become your infotainment system, capable of running your favorite navigation and music apps and using voice controls to place calls over speakerphone. The screen is large enough to clearly read maps, and you can update the operating system on your own. What more do you need?A camera on your nightstand that is constantly pointed at your bed? It\u2019s like asking for your privacy to be violated. You might as well shop for your groceries in your underwear or post all your smartphone photos publicly on the web.Amazon promises the camera software on the Echo Spot can be turned off whenever you aren\u2019t using it. But it\u2019s an obvious feature for hackers to target with malware.So if your primary goal is to have a device that wakes you up on time to go to work, just get an old-school alarm clock.But there are reasons a cheap kitchen timer can be superior.Cooking timing can vary depending on your heating element, among other factors. So if you have to check your food for doneness and change the kitchen timer, an old-school timer \u2014 either the analog variety or the type with a digital time display and two or three physical buttons \u2014 can be easier. It simply dings or beeps when the time is up and it\u2019s quicker to add or subtract a few minutes by turning a dial or pressing a button or two.You can also constantly see how much time is left on the timer, whereas with the Echo, you have to open a smartphone app to see the remaining time or ask Alexa to tell you how much time is left. Over the long term, using a smart speaker as a timer gets tedious.When people buy new iPads or Amazon Fire tablets, they often give their older tablet a second life by designating it for the kitchen. There, the ancient tablet gets mounted to the refrigerator with a magnet and becomes a glorified recipe reader.Having tried this experiment, it\u2019s a hassle. You often have to clean the tablet after smearing food on the screen. The battery eventually needs to be recharged. And if you want to double or halve a recipe, you have to do some mental math, which makes multitasking more challenging when you are busy in the kitchen.Printing out or jotting down a recipe on a piece of paper is just simpler. You can easily scribble additional notes, like changes and improvements to the recipe. Assuming you have decent handwriting, it\u2019s easy to read the steps and ingredients.And if it gets covered in food, you can just throw it away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "East Chelsea, Manhattan: Once Industrial, Now Residential", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving In9 PhotosWhen Sally Greenspan moved into a converted notions factory on West 20th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues 35 years ago, the area was industrial, she recalled, with few shops, restaurants or other residential amenities.\u201cIt was like the Wild West,\u201d said Ms. Greenspan, 71, a retired marketing executive who came from the Upper East Side with her husband, Michael, a biochemist who wanted a quicker commute to his job in New Jersey.The area, which is often called East Chelsea \u2014 it extends from West 14th to West 30th Streets and from Sixth Avenue to Ninth Avenue, where West Chelsea begins \u2014 started becoming residential about 20 years ago. But change has been more rapid, she said, in the past several years: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an enormous number of young families move in. It\u2019s been an explosion.\u201dOlder buildings have been converted to apartments, and the remaining open spaces \u2014 many of them former parking lots \u2014 have been filled in with new construction. \u201cIt\u2019s now a destination area,\u201d she said, \u201cwith hot restaurants and hot bars.\u201dMichael Walsh and his wife, Annie Mayer Walsh, who are both in their 40s with children ages 5 and 9, are among those families. Ms. Walsh bought a studio on West 24th Street in 2000, when she was single and the area was still \u201ca bit of a no man\u2019s land,\u201d said Mr. Walsh, who moved in when they married in 2005. In 2009, when they were making plans to expand their family and prices were lower following the 2008 economic crash, they bought a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath condo for slightly over $1 million.\u201cWe saw it as a good move for our family,\u201d Mr. Walsh said, largely because of the good transportation options and the many restaurants, stores, theaters and other recreation spots. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the neighborhood become more stroller-heavy.\u201dA television casting director, Mr. Walsh initially walked to work, but now has a 20-minute subway commute to the financial district. His wife, a former architect, teaches tap dance part time and is starting her own home furnishings line later this year.A downside of the upscale growth is that many working-class people can no longer afford the neighborhood, said Andy Rai, 37, who lives in the fourth-floor walk-up one-bedroom he grew up in. He pays $1,600 a month for the rent-stabilized apartment, he said, but a similar one next door goes for $4,000. The majority of tenants in his building, he said, work around the corner at Google\u2019s New York City headquarters, at 111 Eighth Avenue. (Twitter\u2019s New York office is nearby as well.)Some areas of East Chelsea have seen vigorous growth, with high-rises and larger stores popping up along Sixth and Seventh Avenues, but Eighth and Ninth are generally quieter. The neighborhood also has charm, with several historic districts and many graceful older buildings on side streets.Still, it is sometimes seen as a \u201cforgotten stepchild\u201d compared to West Chelsea, said Jason Haber, an associate broker with Warburg Realty. The west side has more buzz, he said, but the east side \u201chas access to transportation, access to the Flatiron district and is more accessible in general.\u201dPeter Oliveri, a salesman with Elegran Real Estate, also cited the area\u2019s accessibility. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the heart of Manhattan,\u201d he said. \u201cTo foreigners, Midtown is more central. But to New Yorkers, that\u2019s a tourist area, and this is more desirable.\u201dSome streets, however, have become conduits for tourists heading for the High Line in West Chelsea. \u201cWe have a lot more traffic now,\u201d said Debbie Martin, who has lived in the Chelsea Hotel on West 23rd Street with her husband, Ed Hamilton, since 1995, and is one of the few tenants remaining as it undergoes renovation.The rezoning of Chelsea to high-rise residential use began in 1995 around Sixth Avenue, spearheaded by Adellco, a real estate company owned by Matthew Adell. Mr. Adell\u2019s company has sold the rental buildings it developed there, he said, and is now building a condo called the d\u2019Orsay, on West 14th Street. But Mr. Adell doesn\u2019t consider that part of Chelsea. \u201cWe see it as West Village North,\u201d he said, pointing to the fluidity of neighborhood names.On the other end of East Chelsea, Alex Bernstein, the executive vice president of Bernstein Real Estate, said he favors NoChe or North Chelsea, for the area from West 26th or 27th Street up to West 30th. His 91-year-old company, founded by one of his great-grandfathers, is building its first New York City residence, a 24-story environmentally friendly rental on a former parking lot at 211 West 29th Street, which will include affordable apartments. This area is also home to Penn South (officially known as Mutual Redevelopment Houses), a co-op housing development of 15 buildings for moderate-income residents, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues and West 23rd and West 29th Streets.Prices of apartments in the area have generally gone up over the last five years, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel real estate appraisers. The median price was $1.014 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 3 percent from $984,000 in the same period in 2012. \u201cThat\u2019s partly because the housing stock has more luxury in it than it did five years ago,\u201d he said.The sales volume, however, has dropped 46 percent, from 126 sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 68 in the same quarter of 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s not less popular,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cbut five years ago we were in the middle of a development boom,\u201d which has slowed but not stopped.The neighborhood also has a Whole Foods and a Trader Joe\u2019s, as well as coffee shops, several indoor children\u2019s play spaces and a number of exercise venues.Some people walk or, with several bike lanes available, ride to work. The 1, 2, 3, A, C, E, F, L and M subways lines make full- or part-time stops in the neighborhood, as do PATH trains.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spreadsheets at Dawn: The New Tax Battle Is All About Data", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The new Republican tax cut is providing a powerful weapon for the law\u2019s supporters and detractors, as well as investors and analysts, who are mining data on how companies are spending their windfalls in a battle to sway the behavior of voters and executives alike.In the two months since President Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax bill into law, a vast arsenal of spreadsheets has begun to capture, in real time, the effect of the tax cut as it works its way through corporate balance sheets. Traders are compiling data to find value in a volatile stock market. Advocates of corporate responsibility are hoping to shame companies into passing more of their savings on to employees or charities. Partisans are using it to sway public opinion.Advocates are hoping that the more information they can bring to the surface, the more they can bend companies\u2019 or voters\u2019 behavior with it.\u201cWhat we want to create is sort of a living thing that puts companies on notice,\u201d said Martin Whittaker, chief executive of Just Capital, a nonpartisan group that has compiled data on how 90 public corporations plan to spend their tax savings, and which will send letters to 875 companies on Wednesday seeking more information on those plans. Its initial release includes breakdowns of how individual companies will allocate their tax savings, based on their public statements and disclosures.Paul Tudor Jones, a hedge fund titan who is a co-founder of Just Capital, said he hoped publication of that data would lead to a dialogue among executives and the general public \u201cabout what\u2019s the most equitable way to distribute this windfall we just received.\u201d By the middle of the year, he added, the group should have enough information from public disclosures and survey responses to get a fuller understanding of where the money is actually headed. \u201cWe\u2019ll learn a lot,\u201d he said.The group\u2019s initial findings suggest shareholders of 90 large corporations \u2014 including Home Depot, Pfizer and Capital One \u2014 are reaping far more of the benefits of the law than workers or consumers. Pay or benefit increases for workers account for 6 percent of the savings those companies report from the law, the group calculates, while job creation accounts for 22 percent. More than half of the money going directly to workers takes the form of one-time bonuses, as opposed to permanent raises or benefits.Those bonus announcements have dominated headlines, though, in part because of the tireless compilation work of Mr. Kartch, the vice president for communications at Americans for Tax Reform. \u201cNobody was expecting those announcements,\u201d Mr. Kartch said; Republicans had largely argued that corporate rate cuts would unleash business investment, which would raise productivity and, with it, worker pay.When companies began announcing them in late December, after the bill had passed but before Mr. Trump had signed it, Mr. Kartch sent an email to staff members and affiliates of his organization, asking them to flag \u201cany statements you see from companies raising wages/paying bonuses/hiring due to the tax bill.\u201d He said he would keep a running list and include smaller businesses that \u201cwould otherwise be overlooked by national media.\u201d\u201cIt will get more detailed with time,\u201d Mr. Kartch said, \u201cbut for now, it\u2019s all the raw material up there for anybody who wants it.\u201dOutside groups are compiling a much broader array of data on what companies plan to do with their savings. Morgan Stanley has surveyed its stock analysts over their expectations of how companies they cover will spend their tax savings. Last week, its researchers released a 23-page report, counting appendixes, that contends stock traders may be overvaluing some companies by underestimating how much of their tax savings they will invest in workers and operations, as opposed to passing on to shareholders.Just Capital is hoping to round out the picture further, by pushing companies that have not disclosed their tax windfall plans to answer 11 questions \u2014 including spelling out how much of the savings they will put toward raising workers\u2019 compensation, lowering consumer prices and minimizing environmental impact. Mr. Jones said the group would follow up weekly, as necessary, with phone calls and other attempts to collect the information.\u201cMy attitude is,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to get the data one way or another.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A closer look at potential privatization targets under the White House\u2019s infrastructure plan.\u2022 What investors should be watching to discern where the markets are headed.\u2022 Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason urge shareholders not to \u201clet Fuji steal\u201d Xerox.\u2022 General Dynamics\u2019s big deal shows that military spending is set to go up.\u2022 Where Dina Powell is going next.Stocks on Wall Street endured their worst week in two years last week.Monday they capped their biggest two-day advance since 2016.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 percent and turned positive for the year.Correction factoidsRay Dalio thinks so.\u2022 Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport\u2022 Dulles International Airport\u2022 The George Washington and Baltimore Washington parkways\u2022 The Washington AqueductHere\u2019s what the plan says:The vast majority of the Nation\u2019s electricity needs are met through for-profit investor-owned utilities. Federal ownership of these assets can result in sub-optimal investment decisions and create risk for taxpayers.While the Blackstone Group is raising $40 billion for its own infrastructure fund (half of which is coming from Saudi Arabia), it\u2019s hard to see private investors filling in the $1.3 trillion required to fulfill the Trump administration\u2019s vision.To break it down numerically:\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe recent, complacency-shaking declines in stock prices will have forced investors to take more seriously the yardsticks used to assess whether stocks are worth buying. None of the metrics on their own reliably can predict the direction of stocks, but when markets are freaking out and much is a blur, well-chosen indicators can steady the nerves and clarify the mind.The most important indicator right nowIt\u2019s the 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price. A higher yield reflects greater inflation fears among investors \u2014 and a higher likelihood of that interest rates are going up.Stock investors fear higher interest rates for two main reasons:\u2022 Most immediately, they make stock valuations look less attractive\u2022 In the longer term, they can eventually slow economic growth.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has retreated to 2.83 percent Monday, while United States stocks are trading higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all up more than 0.5 percent.Adding to the funThe government inflation figures come out on Wednesday.The valuation questionThe recent volatility in the stock market has stirred up the valuation debate. Put more directly, did the declines take stock prices down to level where they no longer look expensive?Still, history shows why that might not be the case. In 1997, the rule of 20 gave roughly the same answer as we have now, but stocks kept zooming higher. (Of course, that bull run did not end well. By 2001, the stock market was down below 1997 levels.)If you find the debate over valuation unsatisfactory ...There are also technical indicators, which look at how traders react to a wide selection of market measurements. One of the most interesting right now is the 200-day moving average on the S.&P. 500.But at one point Friday, it looked like that was where things were heading. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, or 2539, before recovering and closing the week above 2619, up 1.5% on the day.The 200-day moving average\u2014the continually updated average price of the past 200 days\u2014is considered a strong measure of investor sentiment. If the S&P 500 had continued to fall below the average, it would have conveyed real bearishness. The S&P 500 hasn\u2019t closed below that moving average in 408 trading sessions, going back to around the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, according to LPL Financial.\u2014 Peter EavisIt really is a remarkable achievement by Fuji. Without putting up any cash, they will acquire majority control and ownership of a venerable American icon. In exchange, we \u2013 the existing Xerox shareholders \u2013 will receive (1) an additional, indirect 25% interest in a Fuji subsidiary that just last year disclosed a $360 million accounting scandal caused by a \u201cculture of concealment\u201d and Fuji\u2019s failure to have adequate management systems and (2) a one-time special dividend financed with our own assets.The backstoryAt the end of last year, Mr. Icahn launched a campaign to unseat the Xerox\u2019s board, and late last month, he and Mr. Deason pressured the company to explore a deal \u2014 including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture.Xerox said it \u201cconsidered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the \u2018best path to create value\u2019 for the company.\u201d\u2014 Stephen GrocerHere are some of Mr. Tan\u2019s comments:On concerns the deal won\u2019t win regulatory approval and Broadcom\u2019s offer of an $8 billion breakup fee if it doesn\u2019t:\u201cYou know, I\u2019m kind of a frugal guy.

Combined with her deep private sector background, Dina will be a source of ideas and inspiration for our students.\u201dMany had been wondering where Ms. Powell would go after her tenure in the Trump administration. Before joining the White House, she had been a fast-rising executive at Goldman Sachs, where she oversaw the firm\u2019s impact investment business.Before that, she had been an official in the George W.

{"Headline": "A Stolen Watch Used to Mean Ready Cash for Thieves. Not Any More", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWatches have long been easy targets for thieves. Stolen off a wrist or taken in a smash-and-grab attack, high-end timepieces, easily transportable and often untraceable, could easily be turned into cash.But that has been changing. The rise of online services specializing in identifying lost or stolen watches has helped law enforcement, dealers and diligent buyers \u2014 even in Miami, which the FBI has identified as one of the top fencing hubs in the United States (and where the Watches & Wonders fair is opening Friday).\u201c \u2018No mama, no papa\u2019 \u2014 that is what they call watches with no papers and no serial number,\u201d Jeff Harris, a Los Angeles-based watch dealer, said. \u201cThose are very easy to trade. After all, a gold Submariner is a gold Submariner.\u201dTo Mr. Harris, the vernacular of that underworld has become all too familiar. He was in Las Vegas last April to attend the International Watch and Jewelry Guild trade show, held at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino. With about $2 million in mostly vintage and one-of-a-kind timepieces locked in his room safe, Mr. Harris went to dinner \u2014 and returned about an hour later to find the room door broken and the safe missing.\u201cThe safe was crowbarred out of the wall,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cThe thief had wrapped it in a towel to take it out to the stairwell. He was caught on video running out of the hotel and jumping into a cab.\u201dFilippo Salvador Cuomo, who was arrested days later in Miami, was identified from a combination of the surveillance video and a jacket that he left behind in his own room at the hotel. His name had been sewn into the label.He pleaded guilty to larceny and, through an agreement with Nevada state prosecutors, received a five-year prison sentence; a federal case (he crossed state lines during the crime) is pending.Mr. Harris\u2019s watches, however, were not recovered. \u201cThey made off with a couple of ruby- and sapphire-encrusted Rolex Daytonas, vintage complicated Pateks, Rolexes with Stella dials, a unique Audemars Piguet and other very rare timepieces,\u201d the dealer said.According to the FBI\u2019s website, organized groups of thieves often use intermediaries, commonly called fences, in cities such as Los Angeles, Houston, New York and Miami to convert stolen goods into cash.In his case, Mr. Harris said, authorities have leads to two fences in Miami. \u201cWe suspect a Miami jeweler and a known Milanese money launderer, identified in the Rio hotel\u2019s surveillance video,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cIn the U.S., the hub for stolen watches is Miami. In Europe, it is Italy.\u201dThe theft-check company with the largest global database of stolen watches is Watch Register, a London-based site operated by the Art Loss Register, a well-known stolen art tracking service founded in 1990. The Watch Register provides both identification and recovery services of lost and stolen watches across borders.\u201cWe had been registering watches since 1991 when we first started collecting information about stolen artworks as a service to auction houses,\u201d Katya Hills, managing director of the Watch Register, said. \u201cBy 2014, we had sufficient data on watches to provide a targeted service.\u201dToday, the Watch Register has details about more than 60,000 lost and stolen watches, involving more than 850 brands. One third, according to Ms. Hill, are stolen or lost Rolexes and, while most of the timepieces are modern, there also are vintage ones as well as pocket watches. Users must pay a fee of 10 pounds plus tax (about $13.75) to check the provenance or status of a watch; subscriptions for dealers and pawnshops that need multiple searches also are available.\u201cLast year alone, we added 10,000 more watches to our database,\u201d Ms. Hills said. \u201cWe get between 80,000 to 100,000 search requests per year.\u201dUnlike modern high-end watches, each of which has a unique serial number, vintage timepieces or pocket watches can only be registered by descriptions of their distinctive features. \u201cWe treat vintage or pocket watches like antiques,\u201d Ms. Hills said. \u201cWe use keywords from the description and the image, and the search becomes more sophisticated.\u201dThe site has had its successes. In 2016, for example, the Watch Register helped recover a Patek Philippe stolen in Naples, Italy, that had turned up in an auction in New York.When auction houses are preparing an art or watch event, they typically check their lots against both the Art Loss and Watch registers. \u201cAll our worldwide catalogs, including online sales, are checked by the Art Loss Register,\u201d said Sabine Kegel, international senior watch specialist at Christie\u2019s in Geneva.While auction houses, pawnshops and dealers can check such sites before reselling a watch, Mr. Harris said he feared that such online tracking just pushed opportunistic watch thieves further underground.\u201cPeople can still buy a stolen watch and wear it, without ever looking up the serial number,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cAlso now there are places that can change the serial number on some watches.\u201dBecause his stolen watches were mostly one-of-a-kind or limited editions, Mr. Harris is optimistic that they will be recovered. \u201cMy watches are so unique that they can be immediately identified if they ever turn up,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are very few buyers in the world for these watches. The best option at this point may be for the thieves to \u2018sell\u2019 them back to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We mean platforms and passageways that feel like greased-up slip-and-slides.If you\u2019ve wondered what that lubey layer was, you\u2019re not alone.Users responded with anecdotes about face planting in Brooklyn, gingerly tiptoeing through corridors and \u201cskating\u201d in Vans across platforms.People have been hurt. Last month, Chris Wilson, 39, a software developer, needed eight stitches after slipping on the escalator at the South Ferry station.\u201cI wasn\u2019t walking down,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t actually doing anything. My foot just sort of slipped out from under me. It was definitely the slickness on the floor.\u201dWe asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Shams Tarek, a spokesman, said the slippery floors are from the combination of rain and snow tracked in from the street, other substances brought in on shoes, and high humidity in stations that traps moisture.The buildup on the subway floor \u2014 from shoes, trash, spills and exhaust \u2014 contains substances that dissolve in water, like salt and sugars, along with oily compounds, which don\u2019t, explained Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University.You just don\u2019t notice the oily stuff until it rains or snows because it\u2019s caked together on the subway tile with everything else.\u201cOnce you add water, whatever didn\u2019t dissolve is going to be oily,\u201d Professor Kumar said. On nonporous subway tiles, where hardly anything is absorbed, the slick stuff just sits on the surface.As for why floors can seem more slippery on snowy days than on rainy days, Professor Kumar theorized, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to carry snow in on your shoes, so you\u2019ll have more water on the snowy days.\u201d(Update: Some readers have speculated that the M.T.A. has changed the kind of cleaning fluid it uses. It has not, Mr. Tarek said.)For now, the M.T.A. said it would continue to mop aggressively after both snow and rain \u2014 the latter of which is expected to fall for much of the rest of the day.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Speaking of dangerous substances, there are local developments on the Tide pod challenge front.If you are determined to participate in the challenge \u2014 safely \u2014 a few local businesses have come up with alternatives.Jonah Bromwich contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But in any game of strategy, the best moves are those that accomplish multiple objectives. Friday\u2019s indictment should serve as a reminder that Project Latkha didn\u2019t merely aim to influence the outcome of the election, but also its tone, and Americans\u2019 attitudes toward their own democratic institutions.The bulk of the Russian team\u2019s online trolling efforts were directed at Mrs. Clinton, but the indictment notes that they also took aim at other, Republican candidates; Mr. Trump, Bernie Sanders and the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, were spared. The trio had something more than opposition to Mrs. Clinton in common: A central theme of their campaigns was that the American political system is fundamentally rigged \u2014 the same claim that had so incensed Mr. Putin.This same theme crops up in many of the Russian front groups\u2019 attacks: \u201cHillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa caucus,\u201d one social media post declared. One of the more memorable stunts the Russian team sponsored \u2014 hiring an American to attend rallies dressed as Mrs. Clinton in prison garb, toting an ersatz jail cell \u2014 fits the same pattern: She had to be cast not merely as an inferior candidate, but as a criminal who could win only through corruption.Mr. Trump was vehemently committed to the same message, not only leading those infamous chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d but routinely declaring that if he were defeated \u2014 which polls throughout the campaign suggested was the most likely outcome \u2014 it would only be because Democrats had rigged the vote.In hindsight, it\u2019s natural to think that Russia\u2019s primary aim was to achieve the upset Trump victory we now know occurred. But if they were relying on the same polls as the rest of the world, they would have regarded that as a long-shot. It seems at least as likely that they hoped a strong showing would position a defeated Mr. Trump as a thorn in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s side, casting a pall over the legitimacy of her administration by fuming publicly about how he had been cheated. (They probably could not have imagined that Mr. Trump would do this even in victory, insisting without any evidence that he had lost the popular vote only because of voter fraud.)If we run with the hypothesis that Russia\u2019s core goal was to sow doubt about the integrity and fairness of American elections \u2014 and, by implication, erode the credibility of any criticism aimed at Russia\u2019s \u2014 then the ultimate exposure of their interference may well have been viewed not as frustrating that aim but as one more perverse way of advancing it.That would be a final irony, and an unpleasant one. No less than our \u201cmeddling\u201d in their internal elections, Russia has long resented United States criticism of the country\u2019s repressive approach to online speech. Their use of online platforms to tamper with our presidential race reads not only as an attack, but as an implicit argument: \u201cThe freedoms you trumpet so loudly, your unwillingness to regulate political speech on the internet, your tolerance for anonymity \u2014 all these are weaknesses, which we\u2019ll prove by exploiting them.\u201dUrgent as it is for the United States to take measures to prevent similar meddling in the next election, we should be careful that our response doesn\u2019t constitute a tacit agreement.Julian Sanchez is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.Advertisement"}

He eventually discarded the rifle, a vest and ammunition in a stairwell, blended in with fleeing students and got away, the authorities said.After leaving the school, Mr. Cruz walked to a Walmart, and bought a drink at a Subway. He also stopped at a McDonald\u2019s. He was arrested by the police without incident as he walked down a residential street at 3:41 p.m.\u201cHe looked like a typical high school student, and for a quick moment I thought, could this be the person who I need to stop?\u201d said Officer Michael Leonard.Here are the takeaways:\u2022 The AR-15 rifle used in the attack was purchased legally, at Sunrise Tactical Supply in Florida, according to a federal law enforcement official. The arrest report said Mr. Cruz purchased it in February 2017. \u201cNo laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,\u201d said Peter J. Forcelli, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Miami.\u2022 The F.B.I. said on Thursday it received information last year about a comment made on a YouTube channel which has been attributed to the gunman, but was unable to identify the person.Among them was a popular football coach and a geography teacher credited with saving a boy\u2019s life when he stood in front of a classroom door.Shackled around his hands, feet and waist, Mr. Cruz was asked if he understood the circumstances. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he whispered.\u201cHe\u2019s sad. He\u2019s mournful,\u201d his public defender, Melisa McNeill, said afterward. \u201cHe is fully aware of what is going on, and he\u2019s just a broken human being.\u201dMr. Weekes, the chief assistant public defender, said the lawyers were still trying to piece together the details of Mr. Cruz\u2019s life. Mr. Cruz has a \u201csignificant\u201d history of mental illness, according to Mr. Weekes, and is possibly autistic or has a learning disability.But Mr. Weekes was not yet ready to say whether he would pursue a mental health defense.Howard Finkelstein, the chief public defender in Broward County, said the case will present a difficult question: Should society execute mentally ill people?\u201cThere\u2019s no question of whether he will be convicted of capital murder 17 times,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we let one of our children fall off grid, when they are screaming for help in every way, do we have the right to kill them when we could have stopped it?\u201dThe family that took him in, the Sneads, had seen signs of depression in Mr. Cruz, but nothing indicated that he was capable of this kind of violence, Jim Lewis, the family\u2019s attorney, said. The family had allowed Mr. Cruz to bring his gun with him to their house, insisting that he keep it in a lockbox.Mr. Lewis had encouraged Mr. Cruz to attend adult education courses, work toward his G.E.D., and take a job at a local Dollar Tree store, he said in a brief interview. The Sneads\u2019 son, a junior, knew Mr. Cruz from Stoneman Douglas High.Gino Santorio, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Broward Health, said the hospital where Mr. Cruz was taken, Broward Health North, enacted safety protocols when he arrived on Wednesday.The staff treated the suspect \u201clike every patient they treat,\u201d Mr. Santorio said.\u201cWe were able to seclude the patient, treat and get them out without any issues,\u201d he added.Broward Health North received nine patients, including the suspect, according to Kelly Keys, manager of emergency preparedness for the health system. Two patients died, three remain at the hospital, and three have gone home.Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa, 14, was killed, made an emotional plea for action.\u201cPresident Trump, we need action, we need change,\u201d she said, the urgency rising in her voice. \u201cGet these guns out of the hands of these young kids and get these guns off the streets.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re constantly having our children worried about getting shot at, what are we telling our future?\u201d said David Hogg, 17, a senior, who said two of his 14-year-old sister\u2019s friends were killed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what these people are killing, our future.\u201dSuperintendent Runcie did not mince words: \u201cNow is the time for the country to have a real conversation on sensible gun controls in this country,\u201d he said.Democrats in Congress welcomed a gun control debate. \u201cAt some point, we\u2019ve got to say enough is enough,\u201d Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said on the Senate floor.Since 26 people were killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, a nonprofit that tracks school shootings has recorded five a month, on average.Ben Bennight, a bail bondsman in Mississippi, said in an interview that he reported a suspicious comment left on his YouTube channel last fall by a user named \u201cnikolas cruz.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to be a professional school shooter,\u201d the Sept. 24 comment said.Mr. Bennight took a screenshot of the comment and flagged it to YouTube, which removed the post. Mr. Bennight said he then left a voice mail message at his local F.B.I. field office alerting it to the comment.Mr. Bennight, 36, said that when he originally reported the comments to the F.B.I., a pair of agents interviewed him the next morning. Mr. Bennight said two F.B.I. agents visited him a few hours after the shooting on Wednesday, spending about 15 to 20 minutes with him. The agents told him they thought the person who posted on his channel might be connected to the Florida shooting because they had the same name.The F.B.I. on Thursday released a statement that said it received information about a comment made on a YouTube channel in September 2017. \u201cNo other information was included in the comment which would indicate a particular time, location, or the true identity of the person who posted the comment,\u201d the statement said. The F.B.I. said it conducted database reviews and other checks, but was unable to further identify the person who posted the comment.On Thursday, Jordan Jereb, a leader of a white supremacist group based in North Florida, told The Associated Press that Mr. Cruz had joined the group, but later Mr. Jereb said that he did not know whether that was true. Sheriff Israel said he could not confirm any ties Mr. Cruz might have had to white nationalists.Two Instagram accounts that classmates said belonged to Mr. Cruz were filled with images of weaponry, as well as the hats and bandannas he liked to wear to school. Among more innocuous pictures of animals, including a dog and a gecko, was a picture of a slaughtered toad. In response to a comment on that image, Mr. Cruz wrote that toads tended to run away when they saw him, because \u201cI killed a lot of them.\u201dOther posts on the first account, like one captioned \u201carsenal,\u201d showcased collections of firearms, including what appears to be a Savage Axis bolt-action rifle, a Smith and Wesson M&P15-series rifle, and at least two shotguns.It was unclear whether the profile picture for that account, a face nearly entirely covered with a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and large bandanna, was an image of Mr. Cruz.The profile picture for the second account also featured a face almost fully covered, this time with an Army beanie. The account included several pictures of a figure wearing several different Army hats and carrying guns and knives. It also contained a picture of a Google search for the Arabic phrase \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d \u2014 God is great.Instagram did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Moises Lobaton, a senior, was in psychology class when gunfire boomed. The students scurried to try to hide as far away from the door as possible.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough space behind the desk, so not all of the kids could fit,\u201d he said.Shots shattered a glass window on the door, injuring at least three of his classmates, including a girl who \u201cwasn\u2019t moving at all.\u201d\u201cShe was next to a pool of blood, but I couldn\u2019t tell if it was hers or the guy next to hers,\u201d he said. The boy had been shot in the arm and was bleeding profusely. His classmates wrapped the arm in cloth. Another boy called 911.\u201cThe shots were something I\u2019ll never forget. It sounded like bombs going off, one at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was one or two feet to the right, I would have died.\u201dA gunman armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle and \u201ccountless magazines\u201d killed at least 17 people at his former high school in Florida in February.Cole Carlberg, 16, turned himself in, and the police picked up Joshua Schechter, 16, after receiving a 911 call at about 9 a.m. on Thursday. Both were charged with making terroristic threats, aggravated harassment and criminal possession of a weapon, a New York police sergeant, Brendan Ryan, said.On Wednesday, the teenagers had posted on Snapchat that they had planned to shoot up Brooklyn Prospect Charter School on Fort Hamilton Parkway, Sergeant Ryan said, adding that the school contacted parents about the threat. One of the teenagers had an \u201cair pistol rifle\u201d that Sergeant Ryan described as a pellet or BB gun, but said it was unclear who owned it. \u201cThat\u2019s still under investigation,\u201d he said.Mr. Carlberg and Mr. Schechter remained in custody on Thursday night, Sergeant Ryan said.Reporting was contributed by Audra D.S.

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: How Monday\u2019s Stock Plunge Ranks?", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 There have been far blacker Mondays.\u2022 Kenneth C. Griffin is growing concerned about inflation.\u2022 The Fed\u2019s regulatory action against Wells may have some bite.\u2022 Broadcom puts more pressure on Qualcomm\u2022 How worried should JPMorgan clients be about health care?\u2022 How much more will Wells Fargo have to do?Measured by points, those are steep drops \u2014 the biggest on record for the indexes. The previous largest point declines for each benchmark came in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.But Monday\u2019s plunge was far less impressive on a percentage basis. The Dow\u2019s fall ranked as its 100th biggest, while the S. & P. 500\u2019s slide was the 127th biggest in the index\u2019s history, according to S & P Dow Jones Indices.Here is how Monday\u2019s sell-off stacks up against two other major tumbles.But points are not the best way to compare the magnitude of a stock index\u2019s declines across eras. As the stock market has risen, big point moves have translated into increasingly smaller percentage changes. The Dow and the S. & P. 500 have more than doubled from their closes on Sept. 29, 2008.\u201cBlack Monday\u201d was a petrifying moment \u2014 an even bigger decline in both points and percentage than the stock market crash of 1929. But unlike the 1929 crash, the slide in 1987 did not contribute to a wider economic slump. The stock market recovered its losses by early 1989.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Peter EavisAs the U.S. stock markets look wobbly for the first time in nearly two years, at least one major investor is sounding a bearish tone.In a Jan. 31 letter to investors, Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago hedge-fund firm Citadel, wrote that even though the broader economic backdrop continues to be positive, he sees several warning signs that could turn stock prices downward.The end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy is one factor, Mr. Griffin wrote, that could pressure stocks. But the prospect of inflation, or a rapid rise in the prices of goods and services, is making him especially nervous.\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the nascent signs\u201d of rising inflation in a variety of countries, he wrote. As a result, he added, money managers at Citadel, which runs a variety of hedge funds, are \u201ccarefully positioning\u201d for a surprise, sharp upturn in inflation.Mr. Griffin added that he is also concerned about geopolitical risks, writing that his money managers need to be able to handle negative events if they do occur, \u201cincluding a trade policy misstep or a military conflict.\u201d He did not elaborate.In an interview with CNBC in November, Mr. Griffin said the stock market was in the \u201cseventh inning\u201d of a rally. He said through a spokesman on Monday that he still thinks there are several innings to go before a downturn begins and that he is more bearish on bond prices than stocks at the moment.\u2014 Kate KellyWith 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.The numbers\u202275 percent of companies are reporting earnings above estimates, above the five-year average.\u2022 Companies that are beating estimates are doing so by a 4 percent margin, below the five year average.\u202280 percent of companies have reported revenue above estimates, a record high.\u2022 All 11 sectors are reporting earnings growth.Wells Fargo\u2019s stock is down more than 7 percent Monday, suggesting that investors believe the growth cap will have some bite. With the economy strengthening and interest rates rising, banks can expect to earn higher profits as they make more loans and suffer fewer losses from defaults. Indeed, this optimistic scenario has helped send bank stocks on a tear in recent months. Now, the question is to what degree Wells Fargo will have to sit out the good times.Wells Fargo executives on Friday suggested that the cap would have limited financial impact, saying it would reduce this year\u2019s net profits by $300 million to $400 million, which works out at less than 2 percent of 2017\u2019s earnings. One reason the earnings hit might be small is that the bank can stay within the cap by selling short-term, lower-risk investments that don\u2019t earn much. Another way the bank intends to limit the negative impact is by reducing the amount of deposits on which the bank pays out a relatively high interest rate.Crucially, Wells Fargo said that it hopes to increase the size of its loan book. The hope is that, by shedding the low-risk investments, the bank will create the room to make more mortgages, credit card loans and loans to businesses, while staying within the limit.But it may not turn out to be as straightforward as that.The growth cap comes after a lackluster year for Wells, which reduced its loans 1 percent last year, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent at Bank of America. Investors waiting for catch-up growth at Wells may have to wait still longer. Also, much depends on whether Wells Fargo can now satisfy the Fed\u2019s concerns. Any indication that the bank is struggling to comply with the regulator\u2019s demands could set off more turmoil at the bank. There is also a possibility that the tactic of shedding of low-risk investments while making more loans could increase the overall risk of Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet.Brian Kleinhanzl, a banks analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote on Sunday that the Fed\u2019s action will \u201cmean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,\u201d adding, \u201cWells will also have to maintain the balance sheet while other banks are growing, and we view this as defensive versus peers.\u201d\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 A takeover price of $82 a share, up from its original offer of $70\u2022 A \u201csignificant\u201d breakup fee if a deal were to be halted for antitrust reasons\u2022 A \u201cticking fee\u201d that Broadcom would pay in cash if a deal took more than a year to closeIt said the new \u201cbest and final\u201d offer would be withdrawn if Qualcomm either pushed its annual shareholder meeting back from March 6 (when Broadcom hopes to unseat the entire board) or if it paid more than $110 a share for NXP Semiconductor.Other cryptocurrencies are falling as well. Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin are all down Monday.How far can Bitcoin fall?Simon Tobler, a trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told Bloomberg: \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold the $8,000 level, Bitcoin may fall to $5,000, where the next big support is. The market is lacking big buyers.\u201dMore from Anna Wilde Mathews, Dana Cimilluca and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:In a reflection of the sensitivity of the subject, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon hit the phones Tuesday to assuage clients\u2019 concerns, people familiar with the matter said. So did some of the firm\u2019s health care bankers, who get paid handsomely to help clients with mergers and other deals and worry the move could cost them business.More from Emily Flitter, Binyamin Appelbaum and David Enrich:The settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.From her interview with Judy Woodruff:\u201cI don\u2019t want to label what we\u2019re seeing a bubble \u2014 as a bubble.\u201cBut I would say that asset valuations generally are elevated, and this is a characterization that we have offered up, for example, last summer in our monetary policy report.\u201d\u2022 Getting bigger by merging with another media company doesn\u2019t solve CBS\u2019s problems. Selling to a tech giant with great online distribution does more.\u2022 Amazon\u2019s exceptionally deep pockets would let CBS bid for expensive must-watch content like sports rights amid tougher competition.The deals flyaroundMore from David Segal of the NYT:\u201cIn my years of running the P.R.C.A., I have never seen anything worse, never seen anything equal to it,\u201d Francis Ingham, director general of the trade association, said in an interview. \u201cThe work was on a completely new scale of awfulness. Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of entrepreneurs [in Silicon Valley] developing the next app for clothes shopping who say, not ironically, that \u2018We are changing the world.\u2019 You\u2019re not changing the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Many People Are Watching the Olympics? NBC Uses a Tricky Head Count", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEach day of the Winter Olympics, NBC reports how many viewers watched the previous night\u2019s coverage, and analysts and television executives try to divine what those numbers mean.But NBC isn\u2019t presenting traditional Nielsen ratings, the television standard for decades. Instead, for prime-time viewing, the network primarily cites a recently created standard of its own making called total audience delivery, or TAD. It takes the ratings from the broadcast channel NBC and cable channels like NBCSN that are showing the Olympics and combines them with viewership across various streaming platforms to produce one number.NBC\u2019s number-crunching is only partly a marketing campaign. It is principally the latest attempt at a valid head count in an industry where no one seems to be able to measure the crowd. Viewers are spread too far and wide, no longer huddled around the TV.NBC also used TAD during the Rio Olympics two years ago, but this is the first time it has sold advertising based on it. Guarantees to advertisers about how many people will watch commercials will be based on TAD, not Nielsen household ratings. As television audiences shrink, that is a big deal for the network, which says its national ad sales for the Winter Games recently passed $900 million. And NBC Universal has committed $8 billion for the media rights to the Olympics through 2032.\u201cAdvertisers now recognize that a viewer is a viewer,\u201d said Dan Lovinger, NBC Sports\u2019 executive in charge of sales. He eschewed the idea that there is a fundamental difference between television and digital viewers. \u201cWhat we are doing now is adding it all together and treating a viewer as a viewer.\u201dFor decades Nielsen produced easy-to-compare measurements of how many people watched a program and what percentage of American households they represented. But an exploding array of technologies \u2014 first TiVo and other digital video recorders, and now streaming players like Rokus, computers and phones \u2014 has fragmented viewing across dozens of different platforms, a large factor in the broad decline in television ratings.With billions of dollars in commercial time at stake, content providers, and especially media companies that own expensive sports rights, have raced to keep up. Scripted programming can have a long shelf life and be sold over time in a variety of ways, but the vast majority of sports is watched live, which means broadcasters need to capture every viewer possible and figure out how to count them.The catch is that they aren\u2019t yet in agreement on how to do that.Nielsen ratings for traditional television are based upon averaging every minute of viewing by a representative panel. NBC combines Nielsen\u2019s measures for its television channels with Adobe\u2019s measurement of streaming data to form TAD.Advertising technology is changing constantly, and Nielsen has to carefully decide when a metric is ready for mainstream adoption. Megan Clarken, Nielsen\u2019s president of United States media (and at one time an Olympic-qualifying long jumper), said that a decade ago the company faced pressure to enter mobile measurement. If it had done so, Nielsen would have been pushing ultimately useless metrics to measure viewing on BlackBerry phones.\u201cWhat we do as a company is we watch for that activity, that evolution,\u201d she said, \u201cand what we aim to do is not be ahead of it, but be with it, and certainly not behind it.\u201dWhile analysts said it was smart of NBC to push its own metric for the Games, it is also the right move for Nielsen to proceed carefully as it develops an industry standard for tracking viewers across a \u201cdizzying array\u201d of consumer devices in the digital world, said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia.\u201cEverybody in the digital video industry is pretty much in agreement that 30 to 40 percent of the ad impressions that are delivered out there don\u2019t really exist,\u201d said Mr. Morgan, whose firm works with brands on targeted TV ads. \u201cYet nobody would say 30 to 40 percent of TV\u2019s viewing audience doesn\u2019t exist. So I think Nielsen is very, very afraid of going into a Wild West environment where it is wide open to fraud and bots.\u201dAccording to Nielsen, while measuring authentic digital viewing is difficult, it is no more difficult than doing so for television. But despite the ambiguity of the measuring sticks, advertisers don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to impress a mass audience over 17 days.\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily want to sit on the sidelines because, \u2018Hey \u2014 funky measurement,\u2019\u201d said Gibbs Haljun, managing director of media investment at GroupM, the media-buying arm of WPP. \u201cThat sort of defeats the point of what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201dWhile NBC sees a strong need for better measurement of non-television viewers, especially in sports, it won\u2019t necessarily be rolling out TAD across the NBC universe. The Olympics are a unique property, with thousands of hours of programming playing out on broadcast and cable channels, unlike a hit drama like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d which would never be shown across a broadcast and cable channel simultaneously.\u201cYou look at the Olympics in Rio and you look at the kind of decline in linear television viewing and the supplement of digital viewing, either simultaneous or delayed, and it is obviously a material difference,\u201d said David Cohen, president of North America at Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm.So far, TAD seems to be doing its job. Across the first four nights of the Olympics, ratings for NBC only were down 15 percent from the comparable nights in Sochi four years ago. But the total audience was down just 7 percent. NBC said it is meeting its ratings guarantees, and has begun selling extra ad inventory that it had held back in case of falling short.Mr. Haljun said that the timing is right for NBC\u2019s metric this year, but doesn\u2019t see it as a long-term solution.\u201cWe\u2019re at this weird point where people agree there needs to be a certified third-party number that\u2019s comparable across networks,\u201d Mr. Haijun said.\u201cBut we\u2019re in the early days of getting there,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are doing different things and have disagreements on the best way to do this.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the event in which Megan Clarken qualified for the Olympics. It was the long jump, not the high jump.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House.There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success \u2014 a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school \u2014 there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be.In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dJoining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care?In announcing they would try, they delivered an implicit rebuke of the complex and costly American health care system, suggesting that the best minds in business could do better.\u201cCompanies are now thinking much more about how to solve larger social problems,\u201d said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. \u201cWhen Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, three leaders in their industries, looked around, they realized that health care is a big issue facing them all.\u201dTheir efforts stem from a feeling that, with partisan bickering and constant campaigning consuming Washington, the onus is on businesses to fill the void left by an ineffective government.The notion that big business might shape government policy is nothing new, of course. Lobbyists have been working to sway lawmakers for decades, and the corporate world was an influential force in the tax overhaul passed last year.Yet for the most part, these efforts were narrowly aligned with a company\u2019s self-interest, usually in the form of lowering taxes and loosening regulations. And rarely have business leaders tried to assume operational control of a government function, let alone something as complex and unwieldy as health care.In recent years, however, more chief executives have begun speaking out on issues that at first glance have little to do with the bottom line, including immigration policy, climate change and gay rights.\u201cThe lack of leadership on the national political level has left this vacuum,\u201d said Kathleen Clark, a professor at the Washington University Law school. \u201cFortunately, there are some business leaders who see that there\u2019s a role for them to play.\u201dThe most vivid expression of this new willingness to speak out came last summer after white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Trump equivocated in his response to the violence.Chief executives may seem like unlikely ethical leaders; Wells Fargo, Equifax, Uber and many more companies have faced questions from Congress about practices that have harmed consumers and in some instances cost taxpayers billions of dollars.But companies have also been wading into moral debates for decades. General Motors and Pepsi pulled out of South Africa during the apartheid era. Apple, Disney and Xerox were early in extending health care benefits to gay and lesbian couples.Similar efforts by chief executives today recall \u201can earlier era of corporate statesmanship,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a fellow at New America, a research and policy institute. \u201cA lot of these business leaders viewed a business as having a somewhat broader public mission.\u201dNow, he said, thanks to \u201cthe rise, over the last 15 years, of the importance of social responsibly and social mission, there is a broad movement in business.\u201dEven Amazon\u2019s much-publicized efforts to select a city for a second headquarters could, in a roundabout way, influence local policymakers. Given that the company is unlikely to set up shop in a state with socially conservative laws that might alienate some employees, \u201cAmazon could have an effect not just on prices but on what legislators pass,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.George Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has been promoting democratic ideals around the globe. And Mr. Zuckerberg, through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, is working on ambitious long-term projects involving science, education and justice.There is a big difference, though, between supporting social causes and research and operating a sprawling public works system. Critics will contend that some of these efforts smack of arrogance, and that businesses ought to stay in their lane and focus on offering excellent products and services, not meddle in public policy.\u201cThere is this hubris, thinking that they can do it better,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.There is also a certain irony to the fact that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan said the new company they had formed would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dThe profit motive, after all, is what leads to efficiency and innovation, according to conventional business school wisdom. Operating as a nonprofit \u201cflies in the face of the logic of the capitalist economy,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.It most likely will take years to determine if the three companies can make good on their promise of building a better health care system. Even if they succeed, the rewards may be limited to their employees \u2014 a large figure, but a small portion of the American work force.Nonetheless, the companies\u2019 push is among the most audacious efforts by the private sector to date, and Mr. Dimon did not shy away from the scope of their ambition.\u201cThe three of our companies have extraordinary resources,\u201d he said on Tuesday when the initiative was announced. \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

President Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner\u2019s news network, CNN, and said before the election that the deal should be stopped.The bigger pictureCecilia Kang of the NYT: For the first time, and after much protest, public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of the chief executive. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed nearly eight years ago, required the disclosure, and firms are now disclosing it in proxy reports for 2017.Companies, lobbyists and some compensation experts spent years criticizing the rule, arguing that it revealed little about pay trends and was of little use to shareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning think tank, on Tuesday noted that Honeywell was the first United States corporation to release the ratio. The company\u2019s C.E.O., Darius Adamczyk, had a total pay package of $16.8 million in 2017, which was 333 times the pay of the median employee.The rule allows certain companies to exclude some foreign employees from the calculation of the ratio. Honeywell excluded workers from several countries where pay is most likely lower than in the United States. \u201cThe 333:1 ratio that Honeywell is reporting most likely would be even wider if Honeywell took all its workers into account,\u201d the Institute said.\u2014 Peter EavisA federal judge in Manhattan, in a brief order, rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Mr. Cohen and his firm, Point72 Asset Management, to temporarily seal a complaint filed last week by Lauren Bonner, an employee of the firm. Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer had asked the judge to seal the lawsuit, which alleges the firm underpays female employees and fosters a hostile workplace for women, pending the resolution of another motion to push the matter into arbitration.Judge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the request to seal the entire complaint was \u201cnot narrowly tailored\u201d and was inconsistent with the \u201cpresumption of public access\u201d to court records.Lawyers for Mr. Cohen had sought to seal the order because it contained details of other employees\u2019 compensation packages. The lawsuit also detailed a testosterone-fueled \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d atmosphere in which men commented frequently on women\u2019s bodies and belittled their abilities.\u2014 Matthew GoldsteinAndrew writes:More from the column:There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products.

On Tuesday, the government sold $179 billion worth of debt.Bloomberg reports:\u201cConcerns about the U.S. borrowing cap had forced the Treasury to trim the total amount of bills it had outstanding, but that\u2019s no longer a problem and the government is now busy ramping up issuance. Financing estimates from January show that the Treasury expects to issue $441 billion in net marketable debt in the current quarter and the bulk of that is likely to be in the short-term market.\u201dThat\u2019s been a regular question since the tax overhaul was signed into law last year. Analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note over the weekend shed some light on the answer.\u2022 \u201cCompanies have pointed to a modest increase in investment as one destination for the incremental cash flow from tax reform. Consensus estimates for 2018 capex have increased by $17 billion (3 percent) since the passage of tax reform.\u201d\u2022 Last month 39 S.&P. 500 companies increased their dividend, while for the first since 2012 no companies cut their payments.\u2022 Buying back shares remains a priority of companies, Goldman writes. Over the past 2 \u00bd months, S.&P. 500 firms have announced $171 billion of buybacks, $67 billion of which has come this year, a 22% increase from the same period in 2017.In the same note, Goldman also took a closer look at this earnings season.By many measures, corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in the past decade. Goldman points out:\u2022 Companies in the S.&P. 500 are set to report that profit grew 15 percent last quarter. That\u2019s the fastest pace since 2011.\u2022 The percentage of companies beating estimates is at its highest level since 2010. The percentage beating sales forecast is at its highest since 2004.But the stock reaction to S.&P. 500 companies either beating or missing expectations \u201chas been muted relative to history.\u201dThe reason? Investors are more focused on tax reform and earnings forecasts for 2018, Goldman writes. Analysts have raised their 2018 earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 by 7 percent so far this year.Some contextHigher profit margins because of the lower corporate tax rate are driving much of the increase in this year\u2019s earnings forecast. A point that becomes clearer by looking at 2018 sales estimates. Analysts have increased their revenue forecasts by only one percentage point and much of that increase comes from higher oil prices boosting forecasts for energy companies.Remember when the company said that it was changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea and shift its corporate focus to virtual currencies?\u2022 Long Blockchain has named a new C.E.O., Shamyl Malik.\u2022 It plans to spin off its beverage division into the publicly traded Long Island Brand Beverages by June 30, and the company\u2019s last C.E.O., Philip Thomas, will be on the new business\u2019 board.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cWe\u2019re making real progress putting our unique assets to work to serve customers in all the ways they want to shop.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedIn real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.The tech flyaroundThe new offer may have come at an opportune time: I.S.S., the influential proxy adviser, recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for four of Broadcom\u2019s six board nominees.

{"Headline": "Facial Recognition Is Accurate, if You\u2019re a White Guy", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacial recognition technology is improving by leaps and bounds. Some commercial software can now tell the gender of a person in a photograph.When the person in the photo is a white man, the software is right 99 percent of the time.But the darker the skin, the more errors arise \u2014 up to nearly 35 percent for images of darker skinned women, according to a new study that breaks fresh ground by measuring how the technology works on people of different races and gender.These disparate results, calculated by Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, show how some of the biases in the real world can seep into artificial intelligence, the computer systems that inform facial recognition.In modern artificial intelligence, data rules. A.I. software is only as smart as the data used to train it. If there are many more white men than black women in the system, it will be worse at identifying the black women.One widely used facial-recognition data set was estimated to be more than 75 percent male and more than 80 percent white, according to another research study.The new study also raises broader questions of fairness and accountability in artificial intelligence at a time when investment in and adoption of the technology is racing ahead.Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending.Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far.\u201cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail \u2014 to make them socially accountable,\u201d said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah.Sorelle Friedler, a computer scientist at Haverford College and a reviewing editor on Ms. Buolamwini\u2019s research paper, said experts had long suspected that facial recognition software performed differently on different populations.\u201cBut this is the first work I\u2019m aware of that shows that empirically,\u201d Ms. Friedler said.Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long.But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again. Only when she put on a white mask did the software recognize hers as a face.By then, face recognition software was increasingly moving out of the lab and into the mainstream.\u201cO.K., this is serious,\u201d she recalled deciding then. \u201cTime to do something.\u201dSo she turned her attention to fighting the bias built into digital technology. Now 28 and a doctoral student, after studying as a Rhodes scholar and a Fulbright fellow, she is an advocate in the new field of \u201calgorithmic accountability,\u201d which seeks to make automated decisions more transparent, explainable and fair.She found them all wanting.To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark-skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents.The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race.Then, each company\u2019s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft\u2019s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM\u2019s and Megvii\u2019s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males.Ms. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies. IBM said in a statement to her that the company had steadily improved its facial analysis software and was \u201cdeeply committed\u201d to \u201cunbiased\u201d and \u201ctransparent\u201d services. This month, the company said, it will roll out an improved service with a nearly 10-fold increase in accuracy on darker-skinned women.Microsoft said that it had \u201calready taken steps to improve the accuracy of our facial recognition technology\u201d and that it was investing in research \u201cto recognize, understand and remove bias.\u201dMegvii, whose Face++ software is widely used for identification in online payment and ride-sharing services in China, did not reply to several requests for comment, Ms. Buolamwini said.Ms. Buolamwini is releasing her data set for others to build upon. She describes her research as \u201ca starting point, very much a first step\u201d toward solutions.\u201cThere is a battle going on for fairness, inclusion and justice in the digital world,\u201d Mr. Walker said.\u201cWe\u2019d have a lot more introspection and accountability in the field of A.I. if we had more people like Joy,\u201d said Cathy O\u2019Neil, a data scientist and author of \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction.\u201dTechnology, Ms. Buolamwini said, should be more attuned to the people who use it and the people it\u2019s used on.\u201cYou can\u2019t have ethical A.I. that\u2019s not inclusive,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd whoever is creating the technology is setting the standards.\u201dBecause of an editing error, two picture captions with an earlier version of this article misstated the number of photos used by researchers to study artificial intelligence software\u2019s accuracy in identifying two groups of people by gender.

The huge new government demand for credit could push up interest rates in the markets. The Fed may be fine with that, given that it is expected to raise interest rates this year.

{"Headline": "Sinclair Deal With Tribune Hits Complications in Washington", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intent to buy Tribune Media in a blockbuster merger last May, the company predicted that regulators would quickly wave through the deal.At issue is how much power Sinclair, the country\u2019s largest broadcaster, will have over local media markets and national television audiences. Sinclair has argued that by combining forces with Tribune, it will be able to bolster local news coverage and be a stronger competitor to internet giants like Facebook and Google.The Justice Department is concerned that the merger will harm competition in several cities. The agency is looking at whether the deal could also give Sinclair too much power over television advertising and over licensing deals with cable and satellite companies that retransmit their broadcasts.John Newman, a professor at the University of Memphis and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department, said previous big radio mergers \u2014 similar in many ways to the Sinclair-Tribune deal \u2014 had been approved by the Justice Department without a lot of focus on how consumers were harmed.The treatment of the Sinclair deal, he said, shows that \u201cthe D.O.J. is getting more aggressive and looking at consumer welfare, too.\u201dThe Justice Department and Sinclair declined to comment.The two sides are expected to come to an agreement eventually, according to three people familiar with the negotiations who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.The F.C.C. is reviewing the merger separately from the Justice Department, focusing on whether the deal is in the public\u2019s interest. The agency is widely expected to approve the deal.Last week, in an attempt to move closer to a resolution, Sinclair submitted a proposal to sell stations in big markets including New York and Chicago, as well as some smaller stations. The proposal would put many of the stations in trusts, an arrangement that has raised some concern from consumer groups that the company will try to operate them through partners down the road, because it runs some stations that way now.The Tribune stations in New York and Chicago would not go into a trust, but Sinclair said it had reached agreements to sell those stations to third parties that it would partner with later. Selling them will help Sinclair get near an important threshold: owning stations that reach no more than than 39 percent of American households, the limit under F.C.C. rules.In addition, Sinclair\u2019s new plan has not satisfied the Justice Department, which still seeks more divestitures, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation.The government\u2019s demands are an unexpected setback for Sinclair, which predicted its proposal would be met by more sympathy from regulators in the Trump administration.Sinclair\u2019s initial confidence was partly buoyed by a string of regulatory victories last year at the F.C.C., including the relaxation of a television ownership limit last April that enabled its $3.9 billion merger with Tribune.Analysts had expected more corporate consolidation under President Trump, but the Justice Department\u2019s response to Sinclair\u2019s proposed deal for Tribune instead underscores a surprising skepticism toward big corporate mergers, particularly those involving the media industry. In November, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner because of concern that the union of telecom and media giants would have too much power over streaming video entertainment.\u201cClearly, the D.O.J. has honed in on the dangers of concentrated transmission and concentrated media content markets that is harmful to competition and to consumers,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of the public interest group Public Knowledge and a former senior antitrust official the Justice Department.The biggest sticking point for Sinclair appears to be how many stations it would need to sell in order to get its deal approved.In its new proposal, Sinclair asked that it be able to keep multiple stations in greater Greensboro, N.C., greater Harrisburg, Pa., and Indianapolis. The company said it should be able to have two of the top four stations in the local markets after the F.C.C.\u2019s action last November to relaxed rules barring too much concentration among top stations.Sinclair\u2019s filing of an amended plan last week could indicate that the company believes it is close to a resolution with the Justice Department and that it is confident enough to start the process moving again at the F.C.C.The list of divestitures Sinclair proposed in its amended plan could still change, Marci Ryvicker, a senior analyst with Wells Fargo, said.\u201cWe do not believe that this is the final list of the station divestitures,\u201d Ms. Ryvicker wrote in a research note last week.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why We May Soon Be Living in Alexa\u2019s World", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtMy wife and I were just settling into bed one night when Alexa, the other woman in my life, decided to make herself heard.Without being summoned, the Amazon Echo Dot at my bedside \u2014 one of the half-dozen devices that Alexa inhabits in our house \u2014 lit up its spectral blue ring, as if it had heard its triggering wake word, \u201cAlexa.\u201d But instead of offering help with some household chore, the voice assistant began to wail, like a child screaming in a horror-movie dream.\u201cHuh,\u201d I said to my wife when it was over. She said something less kind.But here\u2019s what\u2019s really strange: By the next morning, we had forgotten all about it.It is a measure of how thoroughly Amazon\u2019s voice assistant has wormed herself into our lives, and into much of the culture beyond, that I never considered unplugging her after the scream. Instead I chalked the incident up to a harmless bug \u2014 one of the many mysteries of living with an artificial intelligence life form that can be summoned at a breath. (An Amazon representative offered to investigate, but said the company had never heard of such a thing happening before and didn\u2019t think Alexa was even capable of making such a sound.)Something bigger is afoot. Alexa has the best shot of becoming the third great consumer computing platform of this decade \u2014 next to iOS and Android, a computing service so ubiquitous that it sets a foundation for much of the rest of what happens in tech.It is not a sure path. Amazon could screw this up, and rivals like Google have many cards to play to curb Alexa\u2019s rise. Amazon\u2019s strategy \u2014 something like a mix between Google\u2019s plan for Android and Apple\u2019s for the iPhone \u2014 is also unusual. And there are lingering social concerns about voice assistants and, as I discovered, their sometimes creepy possibilities. How many people, really, are willing to let an always-on device in their house?Despite this, Alexa\u2019s ubiquity is a plausible enough future that it is worth seriously pondering. In an effort to do so, I recently dived headlong into Alexa\u2019s world. I tried just about every Alexa gadget I could get my hands on, including many not made by Amazon, such as an Alexa-enabled pickup truck, to see what life with her will be like once she\u2019s everywhere.What I found was a mess \u2014 many non-Amazon Alexa devices aren\u2019t ready for prime time \u2014 but an inviting one. Late-night shrieks notwithstanding, one day very soon, Alexa or something like it will be everywhere \u2014 and computing will be better for it.\u201cWe had a spectacular holiday,\u201d Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, said when I called last month to chat about the assistant\u2019s future.Amazon is famously cagey about sales numbers, but Mr. Limp braved a slight disclosure: \u201cWe\u2019ve said we\u2019ve sold tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices, but I can assure you that last year we also sold tens of millions of just Echo devices. At that scale, it\u2019s safe to now call this a category.\u201dMr. Limp\u2019s distinction is confusing but important. At Amazon, Alexa lives in two places. She is part of a device category, the Echo smart speaker, which now comes in a variety of permutations, from the $49 Echo Dot to the screen-bearing Echo Show, which sells for $229. (These prices are merely guidelines; in its bid for ubiquity, Amazon often offers steep discounts, with the Dot selling for $29 during last year\u2019s holidays.)But like Google\u2019s Android operating system, Alexa is also a piece of software that Amazon makes available for free for other device makers to put into their products.Alexa is spreading so quickly that even Amazon can\u2019t keep track of it. Mr. Limp said that as he wandered the floor at the CES electronics trade show in Las Vegas this year, even he was surprised by the number of different Alexa devices.\u201cTo me, that says the strategy is working,\u201d he said.There are some costs to this strategy, which prizes speed over polish. The universe of Alexa-enabled products is shaggy. Many third-party devices get low reviews on Amazon. Many don\u2019t include some of Alexa\u2019s key functions \u2014 I tested devices that don\u2019t let you set reminders, one of the main reasons to use Alexa. Technical limitations also prevent non-Amazon devices from taking advantage of some of Alexa\u2019s best new features, like the ability to call phones or other Alexas (creating a kind of home intercom system).Mr. Limp said Amazon was aiming to fix these limitations, but conceded that its strategy necessarily led to some low-end devices. \u201cYou\u2019re right, sometimes the ramifications of this will be that some devices will be out there that aren\u2019t perfect,\u201d he said.But there are also advantages to Alexa\u2019s model for ubiquity. Imagine if you could gain access to your smartphone on just about any screen you encountered. Move from your phone to your TV to your laptop to your car, and wherever you went, you\u2019d find all your apps, contacts and data just there, accessible through the same interface.That model isn\u2019t really possible for phones. But because Alexa runs in the cloud, it allows for a wondrously device-agnostic experience. Alexa on my Echo is the same as Alexa on my TV is the same as Alexa on my Sonos speaker.And it\u2019s the same even on devices not in your home. Ford \u2014 the first of several carmakers to offer Alexa integration in its vehicles \u2014 lent me an F-150 pickup outfitted with Alexa. The experience was joyously boring: I called up Alexa while barreling down the highway, and although she was slower to respond than at home, she worked just the same. She knew my musical tastes, my shopping list, the apps and smart-home services I had installed, and just about everything else.It was the best showcase of the possibilities of always-on voice computing. In the future, wherever you go, you can expect to talk to a computer that knows you, one that can get stuff done for you without any hassle.This is not the best outcome for the future; it would be better for all of us if the next computing platform didn\u2019t come from one of the current tech giants, and if start-ups didn\u2019t have to rely on Amazon or Google for this key piece of tech.But that seems unlikely. If Alexa is headed for ubiquity, it\u2019s good that Google may be, too.Advertisement"}

It can\u2019t manage health care. It can\u2019t master infrastructure. It can\u2019t fund itself for more than tiny increments of time. It can barely stay open. It shut down briefly on Friday for the second time in three weeks. Maybe it should just stay closed for good.Let corporations pick up the slack! In fact they\u2019re doing that already, with an innovation and can-do ambition sorely absent in Washington.It was also a roaring, blazing sign of our times, in which the gaudy dreams and grand experiments belong to the private sector, not the public one, and in which the likes of Musk or Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos chart a future for our species beyond our stressed-out planet. NASA no longer leads the way.Lehane noted that democratic governments are designed to proceed with caution, but the pace of change in a digital world of automation and, now, artificial intelligence is brisker than ever. The nimbleness of corporations gives them an edge over hoary, complacent institutions, including those in higher education. Corporations\u2019 creep into that sphere is looking more and more like a sprint.\u201cI think enterprises like Amazon and Google are going to build universities that teach coding and things the nation needs,\u201d Margaret Spellings, the president of the University of North Carolina System, recently told me. Spellings was education secretary under President George W. Bush.Corporations have long been engines of innovation, sources of philanthropy and even laboratories for social policy. But the situation feels increasingly lopsided these days. I\u2019m struck, for example, by the intensity of conversation over the last year about what Facebook and its algorithms should do to stanch the destructive tribalism in American life. It\u2019s true that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s monster has badly aggravated that dynamic, in part by allowing its platform to be manipulated by bad actors. But so has Washington, and we seem less hopeful that it\u2019s redeemable and likely to shepherd us to a healthier place.But companies\u2019 primary concern isn\u2019t public welfare. It\u2019s the bottom line. I say that not to besmirch them but to state the obvious. Their actions will never deviate too far from their proprietary interests, and while tapping their genius and money is essential, outsourcing too much to them is an abdication of government\u2019s singular role. What\u2019s best for Amazon and what\u2019s best for humanity aren\u2019t one and the same.\u201cWhether they do it in the collective interest or in their own is very much in question,\u201d Summers told me. \u201cI use as a parable for a lot of things what happens in developing countries, where the urban electric system doesn\u2019t work well, and therefore the businesses start building their own generators to take care of themselves, and therefore there\u2019s no longer a constituency or pressure to fix the existing electricity system, and meanwhile the society is falling apart.\u201dThere may be something for all of us in Musk\u2019s rocket launch. But there\u2019s definitely a whole lot more in it for Musk.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts in Hand, Companies Spend More on Themselves Than on Wages", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump promised that his tax cut would encourage companies to invest in factories, workers and wages, setting off a spending spree that would reinvigorate the American economy.Companies have announced plans for some of those investments. But so far, companies are using much of the money for something with a more narrow benefit: buying their own shares.Those so-called buybacks are good for shareholders, including the senior executives who tend to be big owners of their companies\u2019 stock. A company purchasing its own shares is a time-tested way to bolster its stock price.But the purchases can come at the expense of investments in things like hiring, research and development and building new plants \u2014 the sort of investments that directly help the overall economy. The buybacks are also most likely to worsen economic inequality because the benefits of stocks purchases flow disproportionately to the richest Americans.What companies do with the trillions of dollars they\u2019re bringing back to the United States, and the money they will save each year on their tax bills, will in large part determine whether the plan is a success or a failure.As the tax cuts kick in, companies have laid out a variety of uses for the money. Some are paying out one-time bonuses to employees. Others are raising salaries. Others plan to open new factories.In the fourth quarter, American companies\u2019 investments in things like factories and business equipment grew by 6.8 percent. That was the fastest growth rate since 2014, but far from the giant surge in capital spending that was promised ahead of the tax overhaul.But the buying back of shares is also at record levels.Almost 100 American corporations have trumpeted such plans in the past month. American companies have announced more than $178 billion in planned buybacks \u2014 the largest amount unveiled in a single quarter, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm.Such purchases reduce a company\u2019s total number of outstanding shares, giving each remaining share a slightly bigger piece of the profit pie.On Monday, Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire might be open to buy some of its shares. The remarks helped send Berkshire\u2019s stock \u2014 and the broader market \u2014 higher.\u201cI\u2019m expecting buybacks to get to a record for 2018,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m disappointed, there\u2019s a lot of people with me.\u201dThe flurry of planned buybacks has been good for the stock market. Early this month, stocks were down more than 10 percent from their January peak. The prospect of companies flooding markets with \u201cbuy\u201d orders helped the market recoup some of its losses.The broader impact on the economy is less clear. Economists believe a rising stock market benefits the economy, helping support consumer and business confidence. But the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of American households, who own 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40 percent of all stocks.Ultimately, the effect of the rising stock market depends on how those wealthy investors use their windfall. It helps the economy more, for example, if they put the money toward productive new companies than if they invest in government bonds.Companies typically decide to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories based on whether they will make the company more profitable \u2014 not merely because the companies are sitting on a pile of money that they otherwise would have paid in taxes.At a news conference Thursday, the head of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, acknowledged that many companies were spending their money on buying their own shares.\u201cRight now we\u2019re going to have an adjustment where you see probably more dividends and share buybacks than wage increases,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cBut going forward we\u2019re going to see a lot of capital formation and wage growth.\u201dThat is not what happened in 2005, when a one-time tax holiday allowed companies to repatriate money on the cheap. That plan, championed by President George W. Bush, was sold as a way to get American companies to invest more in the domestic economy.Studies have shown that the tax change lifted companies\u2019 stock prices but did not expand their American work forces.Until the early 1980s, the practice of buying shares with corporate money was considered borderline illegal because it was thought to potentially open the company up to charges of manipulating share prices.But in 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that gave the green light to most share repurchases, as long as they followed certain rules.Historically, American companies had paid out profits with a quarterly check, known as a dividend. But after the S.E.C.\u2019s rule change, companies started using more of their profits to buy their own shares, in the process giving their shareholders a bigger piece of the company.Buybacks soon soared. By 2016, the most recent year for which there is complete data, companies spent $536 billion on purchasing their own shares, according to data from S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.That was about 5 percent less than those companies spent on new plants, research and development and other investments. By contrast, 20 years ago, companies spent four times as much on such investments as they did on buybacks.\u201cWe have some causal evidence that because of short-termism companies are doing some stock repurchases that maybe they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Heitor Almeida, a professor of corporate finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s causing them to reduce investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Autonomous Selfie Drone Is Here. Is Society Ready for It?", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "Advertisement\nIt\u2019s 2035, the Second American Civil War has been won by the other side, and you find yourself in a heap of trouble with Attorney General Logan Paul. (The future is very troubling.) He has dispatched an all-seeing eye-in-the-sky to tail you, an agile flying machine equipped with 13 cameras and a top speed of 25 miles per hour.The drone knows your face, your gait and your clothing. It hovers persistently behind your back, moving when you move, stopping when you stop, resisting every effort to shake it. You run into the woods, but you still can\u2019t lose it.So now what? Clip this article and save it as a guide for surviving our airborne future. In a woodsy park in San Francisco last week, I had an encounter with just such a self-flying drone, and I found only one trick for escape. Hint: It involved the indignity of repeatedly running around a tree.As the hapless chump in its cross hairs, I will tell you this: Being tailed by a 13-eyed flying machine has a way of focusing the mind.Autonomous drones have long been hyped, but until recently they\u2019ve been little more than that. The technology in Skydio\u2019s machine suggests a new turn. Drones that fly themselves \u2014 whether following people for outdoor self-photography, which is Skydio\u2019s intended use, or for longer-range applications like delivery, monitoring and surveillance \u2014 are coming faster than you think.They\u2019re likely to get much cheaper, smaller and more capable. They\u2019re going to be everywhere, probably sooner than we can all adjust to them.But these features tend to be less than perfect, working best in mostly open areas. Just about every drone on the market requires a pilot.\u201cOur view is that almost all of the use cases for drones would be better with autonomy,\u201d said Adam Bry, Skydio\u2019s chief executive.After takeoff, it\u2019s hands off. The drone operates independently. In the eight-minute flight I saw \u2014 through a wooded trail sparsely populated with runners and dogs \u2014 the R1 followed its target with eerie determination, avoiding every obstacle as naturally as an experienced human pilot might, and never requiring help. It lost its subject \u2014 me \u2014 only once, but I had to really work to make that happen.Watch this clip, recorded by the R1\u2019s main camera, showing the drone following Mr. Bry. When he runs, it immediately follows him, ducking behind trees, speeding up to catch him, then slowing when he slows. Much of the rest of the clip goes like that; every step he takes, the R1 is watching him.Time for some caveats: Skydio\u2019s technology is far from perfect. It doesn\u2019t work well in inclement weather or at night. It also requires a very high-powered processor, which gobbles up battery life; the R1 gets 16 minutes per flight, compared with around 20 for competing drones (but it will ship with two batteries, allowing for another flight after a quick swap out).Yet whatever happens to Skydio as a company, its flavor of autonomous tech seems likely to become ubiquitous. How Skydio has achieved autonomy is, at bottom, a marvel of software rather than hardware, and the software is likely to get cheaper and better quite quickly.There are two basic ways for computers to process the visual world. They can use cameras alone, or they can also use depth sensors, like lasers or radar, that precisely determine where objects are in space.\u201cA bird doesn\u2019t need lidar to fly,\u201d Mr. Bry told me.The scheme worked better than the team was expecting. Because an artificial intelligence technique known as deep learning has been improving much more quickly than insiders predicted, Skydio said, it is further along at key perceptual tasks than it had hoped to be, and Mr. Bry said the tech was still advancing.What this means is ubiquity. As I watched the R1 tail Mr. Bry, I played the scene forward in my mind: What happens when dozens or hundreds of runners and bikers and skiers and hikers and tourists begin setting out their own self-flying GoPros to record themselves? Our society has proved in thrall to photography; if you can throw up a camera and get a shot of you reaching the summit, who\u2019s not going to do it?Mr. Bry disputed this characterization. He argued that regulations allow for momentary periods when the drone is not in the line of sight, as long as the vehicle does not interfere with manned aircraft.As for other social disruptions that autonomous drones might cause, Mr. Bry was guarded. \u201cObviously, we tell our users to be responsible,\u201d he said.Which brings me to the escape plan. How do you lose an R1 that has been told to follow you? Here\u2019s what worked for me: Find a tree. Run around it very precisely, just fast enough to stay exactly opposite the drone, so the tree trunk blocks its view of you for seconds at a time. Do it just right and the bird will lose you, stopping in its tracks, confused.But I don\u2019t imagine this trick will work for long.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Give A.I. the Gift of Gab, Silicon Valley Needs to Offend You", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "Advertisement\nTay said terrible things. She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free \u2014 at least for now.These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. \u201cOuch, that\u2019s not good,\u201d it might say. \u201cHope your ankle feels better soon.\u201d If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company\u2019s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man \u2014 unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.Microsoft\u2019s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. \u201cIt is a problem if we can\u2019t get this in front of real users \u2014 and have them tell us what is right and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints \u2014 and bad press \u2014 Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines \u2014 easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted \u201cchatbots\u201d that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.\u201cIt is more powerful,\u201d said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. \u201cBut it is more dangerous.\u201dIt may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type \u201cwinne tonight drink resttaurant,\u201d it might respond with: \u201ci\u2019m not a fan of wine.\u201d  It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.When Microsoft\u2019s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue. In this case, the system knows enough about the world to identify Adele as a singer.ResponseRankshe's a singer1i don't know who adele is.2she is a singer3lana del rey4i don't know who she is but she is a singer5i don't know who she is but she's a singer6i don't know, i'm not a fan of adele7lana del ray8i don't know who she is, she's a singer9who is adele10i don't know who she is. she's a singer11i don't know who she is but she's a good singer12i don't know who she is. i'm not a fan of adele13i don't know who she is but she is a very good singer14i don't know who she is. she is a singer15i don't know her name. she's a singer16i don't know her name, she's a singer17she's not a singer18i don't know, i've never heard of her before19you don't know her20i don't know her name21i don't know, i've never heard of her22katy perry23i don't know who she is but i don't know her name24i don't really know who she is but i don't know her name25But researchers must also deal with the unexpected. Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude \u2014 or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems \u2014 general dialogue \u2014 is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. \u201cThere is a huge technical barrier here. We really don\u2019t know how to build a personal assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.\u201dIn the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.\u201cWe need people to forgive us when we screw up,\u201d he said. \u201cPushing forward is going to involve some screw-ups.\u201dChat animations are based on data from Microsoft and draw from 50 possible responses for each interaction.Illustrations by Minh UongAdvertisement"}

In a personal essay (500 words or fewer) or video (one minute or shorter), reflect on your experiences before and after you experimented with your news diet, and sum up how you see the role of news in your life now.We heard from 358 teenagers, most clustered in high schools where their teachers obviously took days, if not a week or more, to guide the process. (Teachers, we can\u2019t thank you enough. In fact, since the challenge was a new one for us, we\u2019d love to hear how it felt on your end, and if you are seeing any continuing effects on your students. Please feel free to post a comment here, or write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com.)Below we list our winners, runners-up and honorable mentions, and showcase the essays of our top students. Throughout, we\u2019ve also embedded the five videos we liked best.But as we wrote when we introduced the challenge, navigating information in a connected world is a problem not just for students, but for all of us \u2014 which is why we want to detail some of what we learned. Though these are lessons from teenagers, we\u2019re pretty sure anyone of any age who takes our three-step challenge in 2018 will discover very much the same._________For many, the 24-hour news audit revealed that though \u201cnews\u201d came to them constantly, it was mostly in the form of headlines they\u2019d breeze over and not really understand, or updates about sports or celebrities.Every day my routine was the same: sink into my bed and pull out my phone to catch up on what\u2019s happening in the world. Khloe Kardashian pregnant with Tristan Thompson\u2019s baby, Rapper Lil Peep died from a powerful drug overdose, Melanie Martinez, former \u2018Voice\u2019 contestant, accused of rape. It was an endless stream of celebrity news that I briefly examined but never read in depth. Still, I felt confident that I was caught up on all the news.My generation is the future and that leaves me genuinely terrified. This feeling came over me in class when my classmates and I shared the results of our initial news audit for The New York Times Media Challenge. Who cares that CVS is buying Aetna, or that the Republicans are moving a new tax bill through Congress? We thought the real news was that there is an ugly sweater party on Friday, or that Lululemon is having a Black Friday sale.My peers and I were essentially saying, \u201cI will worry about that when I am an adult.\u201dStudent after student talked about how \u201cdumb\u201d they felt in conversations in class, at the dinner table, and among friends when they couldn\u2019t contribute.In my journalism class, we read articles and discuss current news. In order to write, you need to read, and I realized that I never paid attention. Last year during the election cycle, I told myself that because I had no interest in politics, I didn\u2019t need to bother myself by reading articles about the presidential candidates and what was happening in the White House. At school, that was what everyone was talking about. I was lost and could not participate in any discussions, due to my lack of knowledge. Students and teachers were invested in the news, while I was sitting to the side, unable to contribute anything in conversations.Again and again we heard that the process of getting started was daunting.Obviously this transition was not smooth and simple. It is hard to go from reading an immature 250-word tweet to reading a well-written, somewhat boring professional article, and there were still problems with these platforms: Could I trust them after watching and reading about the president of the United States, the man that the Electoral College elected, publicly denounce CNN, NBC, and The New York Times?Another teenage participant wrote that after following the news for a week, I \u201cstarted to feel like a citizen of the world.\u201d____________________This came through loud and clear as our participants\u2019 primary excuse for not being more informed.I found that there is a horrific famine in Saudi Arabia and many innocent people and children are dying because the Saudi government is not letting any help in. I learned more about the Iraq wars and how the U.S. is sending soldiers overseas to fight and fix Iraq\u2019s problems with their corrupt government and invading terrorist groups. If we pull out our troops we can save our money and lives.I felt helpless and upset since it felt like I was worlds away from the problems and couldn\u2019t do anything about them.The news scares me; it makes me feel unsafe, uncertain, bored, sad, and most of all, anxious.\u2026 I have read, watched and listened to news about fires, Donald Trump, technology business that I still do not understand even after reading an article about it, sexual harassment, celebrity news, North Korea, pollution, and everything in between since I started this project, and the effect all of this has had on me is literally sickening. I have felt nauseous after finding out wordly information on more than one occasion, in addition to either an anxious feeling or pure sadness. These feelings that I\u2019ve been experiencing lately have made me wonder \u2014 Is my anxiety is normal? The other people in my class, along with my teacher, seem to have such an easy time discussing issue after issue, while I am silently hiding my scared thoughts.I heard about the Rohingya people, refugees trying to escape violence in Myanmar for a safer Bangladesh. I had never heard of them before, but, afterward, I researched everything I could about their plight. Luckily the media was shedding light on their stories, which the Myanmar\u2019s government was desperately trying to hide \u2026 Ignorance is not bliss, it just means more suffering for people who need us.Suddenly, like a gust of wind, it hit me. News was connected to me. This little boy was no longer a stranger tome, but someone close. His death suddenly became personal because my mom had reacted to his original story. The story inspired her to take action, and do something kind, which made an impact on his life. This completely changed my view on the media. When we read and respond to news, as my mom did, we experience a deep connection to humanity.Via their 24-hour news audit, many students realized that their sources leaned heavily in one political direction or another, and set out to fix that by adding new ones.But once they began comparing the treatment of the same story across publications, some felt angry or defeated.A Fox News headline states, \u201cRoy Moore, battered by the media and the establishment, loses in huge Alabama upset\u201d while a headline from CNN stated, \u201cMeasuring the \u2018Alabama earthquake\u2019: How Doug Jones won\u201d Comparing the two titles, the first, by Fox News seems to victimize Roy Moore, an accused pedophile, by using hyperbolic language, while the second headline is more of a factual statement, by CNN.In A.P. Government and Politics I\u2019ve been learning about parts of government, public participation, and the inside and out of political parties. This information gives me a false sense of confidence in my knowledge about the American government. Through reading I\u2019ve discovered that each little action that the politicians make is scrutinized and bashed by one side and praised by the other. Because of this pattern it\u2019s very difficult to understand what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.This exercise leaves me wondering if this mix-up would benefit our country and if it would help the states become more unified, like a country should be. As previously stated, it does help me understand people who are on the opposite side of the political spectrum. If everyone tried the mix-up, we would have a better understanding of one another and even though we would disagree with each other, we might comprehend each others POV\u2019s more clearly.Just starting to understand the world of news, and exposing themselves to a wide range of sources, seemed to open students\u2019 eyes.I Googled \u201cunbiased news\u201d, and came across www.allsides.com. This website offers a liberal, conservative, and centrist point of view for every article. I read all three points of view for most articles and I got to see why liberals feel the way they do about things, and why conservatives disagree and their feelings. I really enjoyed seeing their reasoning and arguments. What really stood out to me was that sometimes the two sides would make emphasis of some evidence that proved their claim, while the other side wouldn\u2019t make as big of a deal out of it because it wasn\u2019t useful to their cause.Why did I never consider what the liberal news outlets had to say? I realized that I rejected liberal news because I didn\u2019t want to know their narrative. I was grounded in my own views, and stubbornly rejected whatever the left- wing had to say.When I took I step back and looked at the news a really consume, I was dismayed. I was being flooded by Twitter news, CNN, and Syracuse.com. Twitter was the worse. Most of the people I follow on Twitter are very, very, very liberal. I think the only non liberal person I follow is President Trump. Actually \u2026 I don\u2019t even follow President Trump; Twitter just floods my phone with his tweets.On an average day, I\u2019ll spend 45 minutes scrolling through my seemingly endless Twitter feed about the day\u2019s current uproar. I paradoxically felt inundated by the constant flood of news updates, yet still oblivious to the world\u2019s affairs. The tweets, though expansive in quantity, lacked breadth in the details. Twitter is great in that news outlets can send updates out to users instantaneously, but the platform\u2019s tragic flaw renders it useless. Tweets all seems to dumb down our news into an easy-to-read, 140 character blurb. But the problem is that our news just isn\u2019t that simple. The GOP tax plan and the Trump-Russia probe are highly complex issues. And watering the facts down into a quick tweet does a disservice to Americans, who have the right to be informed.I decided to have a \u201cjuice cleanse.\u201d For a full 24 hours, I ignored every article sent my way on social media; instead, I pored through the headlines of the day on traditional news sites such as The New York Times and BBC. For a full day, I was irrevocably freed from the endless wars on social media comment sections, and the nagging need to constantly fact-check my sources.Though this experience was certainly refreshing, I realized something important: to have a well-balanced news diet doesn\u2019t necessarily entail removing social media completely. In fact, social media offers various unique advantages to consumers. For instance, we can actively engage in conversations about current affairs with people from all over the world.I found that the news provided by Snapchat was aimed toward my age demographic. Rather than sharing news about the serious problems in the world (poverty, global warming, world hunger, etc.), I was reading about why Walmart was changing its name from \u201cWal-Mart Stores Inc.\u201d to just \u201cWalmart Inc.\u201d. I also noticed that I wasn\u2019t actually reading the articles. I would see the heading and then quickly skim over it. To my surprise, I wasn\u2019t actually learning the news with as much depth as I thought I was.__________________I\u2019ve been noticing myself going to CNN 10 first instead of The New York Times. I really did not understand at first but then I realize that I would rather watch a 10 minute video with Carl Azuz talking about trivial events rather than read a gigantic essay that goes back and forth, using rhetorical devices, counterarguments, analysis, etc. That is the beauty of having a news outlet that promotes videos, the information comes quick and is easily gathered turning a chore of reading into a fast paced interesting session of knowledge.When I learned about the Pulse Nightclub shooting or Roy Moore\u2019s beliefs from traditional news, I felt vulnerable. When seeing the same stories on social media, I don\u2019t feel alone.I sat with my Uncle John, the whole time. Usually I talk to him for a minute about politics and I\u2019m bored out of my mind, but this time I felt something different. This conversation that, at one time, would put me to sleep, was appealing to me now. I knew this was a product of the news diet.I talked with Uncle John about things I didn\u2019t know about. One of which as was his career as a NYPD Police Officer. I connected with his stories now after listening to countless stories about his experiences. One such story caught my attention. It was 1974 and my uncle was working with the 7th Precinct. He was on a burglary call and he found the suspect going out the fire escape. He chased him across the roof, and while running it gave way and he fell off the building. He told me how he was feeling as he felt the roof give out from under his feet and how he felt while falling to the ground. It gave me a more in depth look at how an officer thinks and a different perspective to all the news stories concerning police officers, and a chance to see how they feel in a situation that the media makes them out to be the bad guys.Now, we invite you to read the essays of our seven top winners._________Katie Golden, 14, River Dell Regional High School:Shocking stories change us. Almost six years ago, my grandpa first introduced me to the horrors of the Holocaust and World War II. Drafted at the age of 17, a warrior in the famous Battle of the Bulge where he suffered frost bite in his toes to this day from interminable days without shoes, he was one of the last American soldiers to be stationed in Germany when war concluded. Why did he tell me these gruesome stories I knew hewished to forget?So that I wouldn\u2019t forget. So that it would never happen again.I\u2019m sure my grandfather wanted me to be informed about the world \u2026 and I thought I was. I knew all about the teen world: Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber\u2019s on-and-off romance, what fashion was especially trending in November, and what color dress matches my personality (thank you, People magazine!) I even read the sports section of the Daily News, and usually directed the basketball conversations in my friend group.The deficiencies in my media diet became clear when I was at a Global Connections Club meeting. We were discussing ways to help the Rohingya Refugees, a group of people being targeted for \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d The presenter said they were the \u201cleast wanted group in the world.\u201d She shared news stories about villages being burned and women being raped. I was shocked when the presenter compared the events in Myanmar to the Holocaust. Their situation sure sounded like the people my grandfather once told me about. Hadn\u2019t we all sworn it would never happen again? At this moment, I experienced a new revelation about myself: my eyes were on all the wrong stories. Terror was continuing to dominate our world, even in today\u2019s world.As part of the New York Times Media Challenge, I needed to alter my media intake, and as a result of my club meeting, I decided to look for news about the forgotten people of the world: poor people affected by new tax laws, immigrants facing deportation, women silenced by sexual harassment, and Beijing workers forced out of their homes. Like my grandpa, these reporters were exposing atrocities. They were telling stories of human suffering that they would probably like to forget too.News is the microphone for the forgotten, powerless voices of the world. The media is the shield in the current war our world wages on Human Rights. It speaks for victims of persecution, harassment, deportation, and ethnic cleansing. We can\u2019t limit ourselves to the fun news, but consider the heavy and sometimes gruesome stories the news may cover. The news exists simplistically to help and investigate when anyone is suffering. If we don\u2019t acknowledge the media, these barbarities will happen, again, and again, and again.Helen, 14, River Dell Regional High School:The day had just started and I was sitting in a classroom with two uneven pigtails, one untied lace, half of my best friend necklace, and zero English skills. Already, I felt lost. Having just moved from Germany, I was attempting to participate in a geography game. As my classmates kept putting up correct answers, I didn\u2019t have even one. Unless I could master the new language, I would have no power.I had a flashback to those times six years ago when my teacher asked me to participate in the New York Time Media Challenge. My writing class was talking about the news, and a wave of opinions drowned me. Like my former self, I was lost again. It wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the news, but none of it was about the government. I read about Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s $400 million dollar painting and Europe\u2019s first underwater restaurant, but I didn\u2019t know how the tax bill was going to affect my family or how the Russian investigation tainted our election. I realized I had no idea what was going on in politics.It appeared I had a new language to master. Because I am a busy high school student, I didn\u2019t have much extra time, so I decided I would watch ABC Nightly News and hope for some better results. I began following the Congressional tax bill, Michael Flynn\u2019s guilty plea, and even the Alabama senate race. I began to form so many different opinions. Politics is a topic no family wants to talk about over Thanksgiving dinner, but after this experiment, I had couldn\u2019t wait to share my thoughts. (Surprisingly, I still have relatives talking to me.)There are many people who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening in politics and rather than reading the news they decide to tune it out. Not paying attention to the news isn\u2019t going to make you understand it. The more you immerse yourself in the news, like a language, the more you will understand it. For those out there who believe that following the tax bill is too complicated, they are becoming submissive. They are willing to sit back and accept whatever the government is handing them. If you engage yourself in the media and follow that tax bill, you can write letters, fight for what you believe, and possibly change the direction of laws. Rather than believing the government will do the right thing, you will know, and can hold them accountable.Knowledge is power.Isabella Jimenez, 17, Canterbury School:It\u2019s overwhelming, really. My phone chimes at least 100 times a day, my push notifications filled with news headlines. Facts, opinions, controversies, and current events are constantly hurled at me a million miles an hour, and in the of age of technology, it\u2019s impossible to hide. It all becomes white noise, and it is hard to differentiate what is fact from fiction. Although I routinely read the news and stay up-to-date on what\u2019s going on in the world, I sometimes feel trapped. The news, despite its ability to empower, inspire, and educate many, has also acted as the carrier of anger, burden, and tragedy.My father had just picked up my sister and I from school. The second he turned on the car, he immediately shut off the radio, afraid of what my sister and I might overhear. I wasn\u2019t na\u00efve: my whole school had been in lockdown for the last five hours. I asked my dad what was wrong and he answered with silence, leaving me with an empty feeling in my stomach. On our way home, we stopped by Dunkin\u2019 Donuts/Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, because even at 13 years old, I already was a coffee dependent life-form. I remember walking in, hand and hand with my younger sister, and seeing \u201cBreaking News: Mass Shooting in Newtown Connecticut at local elementary school. \u201d flashing in big red letters on the screen and people on the floor helplessly crying. That whole afternoon, my eyes were glued to the TV as the number began to rise, finally stopping at 26. For the next couple of weeks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to go to school, turn on the TV, or even leave my house to go have breakfast at the local diner as information hungry news reporters infiltrated my town. I was trapped. Everywhere I went, the news followed.Living in Connecticut, the news is my means to escape to the world beyond my small high school and rural hometown. It has brought me face to face with President Trump, climate change, the refugee crisis, and with the victims of other mass shootings. Before experimenting with my news diet, I regularly pressured myself to read the news, reminding myself the importance of a globalized perspective and having this information as \u201csocial currency.\u201d I never took into consideration the toll it would all have on me and never realized the power I had to chose the news I wanted to consume. Participating in the news audit and reading almost every article that popped up into my notification feed and watching the TV, left me tired and frustrated. It made me feel as I did in the following weeks after the Sandy Hook tragedy: trapped. I realized through this project the importance of having a balanced news diet: an ideal combination of all perspectives from all news realms. Butmost of all, I recognized that sometimes, you need to take a step back in order to process, reflect, and breathe.While a teen sits and plays Call of Duty, a North Korean missile sails toward our country. The teen is oblivious as he strives to reach level 3 on the game. This seems like a scene out of Ray Bradbury\u2019s Fahrenheit 451. In thatnovel, citizens watch their full wall TVs, unaware of the warplanes flying above them.Participating in the New York Times Media Challenge, I found that I might be the teen described above and could star in a modern-day version of this book.Step one of this experiment required completing a review of my news diet. After monitoring my main sources of news, I discovered a blatant flaw in my news intake: I only read the headlines. Not only was it just the headlines, but I would only look at the five recommended articles that were displayed as widgets on my phone.If I found an article that was interesting, I might read some of it, or tell someone else about it. But if they asked me a question about a specific detail, I would answer, \u201cI don\u2019t know; I only read the headline.\u201dEmbarrassed by my lack of depth, I challenged myself to dive into entire articles, as opposed to the five ones displayed in a preview. What I got from this experience was a deeper understanding of the content. I took away more information than I would have from just reading the headlines, and I felt more content with myself after this experience. One article that stood out to me was from BuzzFeed. The headline stated that immigration officers continued to arrest illegal immigrants in Florida during Irma, even though they promised not to. The headline made the officers seem like villains, but when I read the whole article I saw both sides of the accusation. Headlines can show one-sided arguments, while reading the article in detail gives you all the information needed to comprehend a topic.Ray Bradbury warned us back in 1953 about what our society was becoming. Captain Beatty is one of the men in charge of keeping books out of peoples\u2019 hands. He describes why the world came to be the way that it is, and we are quickly becoming that society. Beatty says that all people want are, \u201csnap endings.\u201d I think this describes our world today perfectly. People don\u2019t read the whole book; they skip to the last page. They don\u2019t want to take the time to digest what they\u2019ve been given. I realized this after my experiment. I am becoming what Bradbury feared. We all are. It\u2019s time for our society to get out of the express lane.Wynn Maloney, 18, Canterbury School:Unconsciously, as it must be for many other eighteen year olds, my news diet was bland, lazy, and lacking effort. The only time I would ever discover news would be when I was tapping through my snap stories on Snapchat until I reached the discover section of the screen, or scrolling through my Instagram feed when I would come across a Barstool sports post. Occasionally, I would click on an alert from the news app on my iPhone when I was trying to clear my notifications, but I would find myself lost in the article I had just entered.I was absent and blind to what was going on around me in the world, I admit it.Once I realized the isolation I had put myself through that had prevented me from not only becoming an educated citizen of society, but also becoming aware of my surroundings, I decided it was time to change up my news diet. My first step was to turn on my brain and open my eyes in order to become more aware whenever I would come across a piece of news so I didn\u2019t just scroll or tap away to something more interesting to my tastes. Slowly, I noticed myself wanting to read the whole article or post whenever I would come across news, no matter the topic. Then, my second step was to turn on all my notifications in my news app in order to spark more news action in my day to day life. Once the news started to come to me, I would click on every notification and read up on the article. If I found myself lost, I would simply search the background of the topic through other news sources. The chase through my news app to catch the next update on particular stories I was following had become like gambling at a casino, every time I won, or found an amazing or interesting news piece, I was left hungry for more.Ever since I have implemented these two simple steps into my life I have found that I feel like I can contribute to society through participating in intriguing conversations pertaining to up-to-date news. I also feel as if I am able to make personal connections to many day to day issues through the feelings that arise within me once I read many articles that address national and even international issues. I was once an 18-year-old girl who unhealthily and lazily consumed my news, but now I am still that eighteen year old girl who now looks forward to educating myself and consuming every ounce of knowledge I can obtain through news, and for that I am grateful for my news diet project.Olivia McCormack, 14, The Franklin School Of Innovation:This project was an eye-opener, revealing several things including the substantial amount of news I got daily. The latter part of the project inspired me to learn what I could about our current world. I started with a 24 hour period where I recorded all the news taken in. I found the news I got was mainly background noise with no focused time, and with news taken in all at once, so for my news diet mix up, I chose to change this. My planwas to do two things: listen to NPR news podcasts and read CNN articles on my phone. The first week I quickly found that the mornings were not the time for focused news, so I changed my intake time to in the car or ondeck before swim practice.During this experience, I found myself inspired and powerless with many issues. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing about all the sexual harassment allegations and denials. People denying these brave women who are speaking out while knowing they will be pushed around. For a month I listen to coverage of people giving brave testimonies, while men in power were denying and bashing on these women. I was left heartbroken and questioning; what kind of world is this where there is no equality? I don\u2019t mean just in this matter, I see it everywhere, people not making something as simple as a cake for the lone reason the clients were gay, it\u2019s just so unconstitutional. I found that another time I had to stop listening to the news was during coverage of the terrorist attack in Egypt. I just couldn\u2019t bear to hear any more about the horrific things people do to each other.Still, there were times the news I heard excited me, these were times where things like advancements in Muller\u2019s investigation where people were finally paying for their crimes, or when the transgender woman was elected in Virginia an example of how we are coming closer to true equality.This project left me knowing that the news is a very valuable part of life in this country. I also realized that without the news, I would be as innocent as a kindergartner, so I the news is needed in order to be a valuable member of society. Throughout my experience in the new diet mix up, I know that if I ever want to be a valuable member of society I will need to be as informed as I can be. I hope to do so by finding the right news diet and to be able to find places where I can speak up and stand out. One needs a healthy amount of news in life to a point that you are informed but not overwhelmed. Overall, I learned that there are multiple issues that we as a society need to fix and that our news intake should be enough that we are informed, but not to the point that we\u2018re overwhelmed.Jocelyn Savard, 16, Hoggard High School:Each day, I attend a swim practice for about three hours. As soon as it ends, us, being teenagers go straight to our phones. My friends phones are filled with text messages, Snapchats, and missed calls. Of course, mine has all those things too but thrown in are news article headlines. If I have time, I will immediately read the articles.If I don\u2019t have time then, I make sure I get to them relatively soon. Many people in my community are not receiving any sources of news. Physical deliver-to-your-doorstep newspapers are rare in households now because of the internet. But how many of the people not receiving newspapers read them online daily? If the generation above us is not informed, how can we be expected to be? Most teenagers\u2019s only source of news are the gossip articles at the grocery store checkout lines. What sort of condition will our country be in twenty years when it\u2019s run by a generation who only knows about their individual lives performed until that point?Possibly more concerning than the lack of knowledge is the lack of consistency. I read everything from the \u00fcber conservative Washington Times to the extremely liberal New York Times. Each article the story changes; in one I\u2019m reading about the bill President Trump passed that will save the country\u2019s economy by saving x amount of money each year. Then, I go to the next article on my list and I\u2019m reading about the bill President Trump passed that is dooming the country\u2019s economy by losing x amount of money each year. As I\u2019m more left leaning, I tend to believe the more liberal sources which would be great except I have right leaning friends who believe the conservative sources. We are truly a divided country. If I weren\u2019t reading a wide range of news sources would I realize the biases? And despite reading several news sources, some such as USA Today (notoriously neutral), often times I don\u2019t know what the full truth is. Again, how can we be expected to lead a country where we only know a biased history of it, if any? During my audit, possibly the only new thing I realized was how negative all the news intake I was receiving constantly was. I read about poisonous cities, Trump\u2019s mistakes, and falling stocks. I didn\u2019t have articles on people beating cancer, communities coming together or good political choices. It seems that news has always been this way but it can still be linked to the lack of consumption of news from everyone of all ages in our country.Someday, I hope to leave swim practice with articles written by opposite political affiliations having consistent facts and possibly one story that would make anyone smile. I have hope that we can change the way we perceive the news, possibly by changing the news first, so that my generation will be able to grow to our full potential and lead well in coming years._________Shreya Aggarwal, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolAlexis, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolChristopher Burmaster, 15, River Dell Regional High SchoolMelissa Canales, 17, TERRA Environmental Research InstituteOlivia Chislett, 16, the American School in EnglandEllyn Fritz, 17, Canterbury SchoolMlawson19, 17, Exeter High SchoolOlivia, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolSpencer Schultz, 17, Jamesville-DeWitt High SchoolJulia Bialek, 17, Horace Greeley High SchoolAndrew Caslin, 14, River Dell High SchoolLeah Fishman, 14, River Dell High SchoolGabriel, 13, Franklin School of InnovationQuinn Hagerman, 16, Merced High Schooljhamburger, 16Isabella Kahn, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolAlex Main, 17, Landstown High SchoolMary, 16, Merced High SchoolOlivia, 18, Cresskill High SchoolSamantha, 17, Merced High SchoolClara Tomann, 17, Canterbury SchoolMegan Tracy, 17, Canterbury SchoolJosh Wiesenfeld, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolMichelle Yu, 17, Cresskill High SchoolJoanne Yang, 14, Seoul International SchoolSherry Zhu, 14, River Dell Regional High School_________Advertisement"}

Chips Available to Others", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Monday, the internet giant said it would allow other companies to buy access to those chips through its cloud-computing service. Google hopes to build a new business around the chips, called tensor processing units, or T.P.U.s.\u201cWe are trying to reach as many people as we can as quickly as we can,\u201d said Zak Stone, who works alongside the small team of Google engineers that designs these chips.And these days, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are not just big internet companies. They are big hardware makers.Right now, Google\u2019s new service is focused on a way to teach computers to recognize objects, called computer vision technology. But as time goes on, the new chips will also help businesses build a wider range of services, Mr. Stone said.At the end of last year, hoping to accelerate its work on driverless cars, Lyft began testing Google\u2019s new chips.Using the chips, Lyft wanted to accelerate the development of systems that allow driverless cars to, say, identify street signs or pedestrians. \u201cTraining\u201d these systems can take days, but with the new chips, the hope is that this will be reduced to hours.\u201cThere is huge potential here,\u201d said Anantha Kancherla, who oversees software for the Lyft driverless car project.T.P.U. chips have helped accelerate the development of everything from the Google Assistant, the service that recognizes voice commands on Android phones, to Google Translate, the internet app that translates one language into another.They are also reducing Google\u2019s dependence on chip makers like Nvidia and Intel. In a similar move, it designed its own servers and networking hardware, reducing its dependence on hardware makers like Dell, HP and Cisco.This keeps costs down, which is essential when running a large online operation, said Casey Bisson, who helps oversee a cloud computing service called Joyent, which is owned by Samsung. At times, the only way to build an efficient service is to build your own hardware.\u201cThis is about packing as much computing power as possible within a small area, within a heat budget, within a power budget,\u201d Mr. Bisson said.Typically, engineers train these algorithms using graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which are chips that were originally designed for rendering images for games and other graphics-heavy software. Most of these chips are supplied by Nvidia.In designing its own A.I. chips, Google was looking to exceed what was possible with these graphics-oriented chips, speed up its own A.I. work and lure more businesses onto its cloud services.At the same time, Google has gained some independence from Nvidia and an ability to negotiate lower prices with its chip suppliers.\u201cGoogle has become so big, it makes sense to invest in chips,\u201d said Fred Weber, who spent a decade as the chief technology officer at the chip maker AMD. \u201cThat gives them leverage. They can cut out the middleman.\u201dThis does not mean that Google will stop buying chips from Nvidia and other chip makers. But it is altering the market. \u201cWho\u2019s buying and who\u2019s selling has changed,\u201d Mr. Weber said.Over the years, Google has even flirted with the possibility of designing its own version of the chips it buys from Intel.Mr. Weber and other insiders question whether Google would ever do this, just because a C.P.U. is so complex and it would be so much more difficult to design and maintain one of these chips. But at a private event in San Francisco last fall, David Patterson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who now works on chip technologies at Google, was asked if the company would go that far.\u201cThat\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How C.E.O.s Should Spend Their Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCompanies are wrestling with how to allocate the windfall from the recent tax act. It\u2019s a nice problem to have.Neglected in the public discussion is yet another strategy, with large potential benefits for every company and for the nation as a whole: investing in human capital. Lost in the noise was Boeing\u2019s announcement that it will spend $100 million on work force development, training and education, and Disney\u2019s investment of $50 million to cover tuition payments for its hourly employees.Until recently, most corporate training programs focused on communicating company policies, building the company\u2019s \u201cculture\u201d and complying with legal mandates to provide instruction on sexual harassment, nondiscrimination and industry-specific regulatory requirements. Company leaders and promising younger executives were often given access to high-quality executive education programs.But most employees looking to upgrade their skills and qualifications had to go back to school. Those who remained on the job while attending classes part time could get up to $5,250 annually in tax-free tuition reimbursement from their employer. Most large companies have maintained such programs for decades, but less than 1 percent of the work force participates.Today, thanks to online technology, there has been stunning improvement in both the quantity and quality of learning opportunities available to employees. The largest platforms offer thousands of courses from more than 200 of the world\u2019s best universities, as well as state-of-the-art content from top technology companies. Many Fortune 500 companies are testing the use of such courses to develop the skills of their employees, and a few have begun large-scale deployment, offering customized courses to help employees gain competency in emerging fields such as big data, machine learning, deep learning and the internet of things.Less esoteric subjects \u2014 like digital marketing, project management, and managing people and teams \u2014 have also proved popular among employers. These courses typically cost less than 10 percent of what it would cost to take the same courses in a face-to-face, on-campus setting.The tax cut has given companies an opportunity to invest in the future. So, to America\u2019s chief executives: Don\u2019t spend it all on buybacks and bonuses. Invest in plants, equipment and research. But the best investment you can make with that money is in your people.Richard C.

{"Headline": "How Tiny Red Dots Took Over Your Life", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyAs the ranks of tech-industry critics have expanded, it has become harder to tell what common ground they occupy. Across various political divides, there is a sense that Facebook, Twitter and Google exert too much influence on the national discourse; closely connected to this is the widespread concern that we users have developed an unhealthful relationship with our phones, or with the apps on them. But on any more specific claim than that, consensus becomes impossible. The sudden arrival of a new class of tech skeptic, the industry apostate, has only complicated the discussion. Late last year, the co-inventor of the Facebook \u201clike,\u201d Justin Rosenstein, called it a \u201cbright ding of pseudopleasure\u201d; in January, the investment firm Jana Partners, a shareholder in Apple, wrote a letter to the company warning that its products \u201cmay be having unintentional negative consequences.\u201dAll but conjuring Oppenheimer at White Sands, these critics offer broadsides, warning about addictive design tricks and profit-driven systems eroding our humanity. But it\u2019s hard to discern a collective message in their garment-rending: Is it design that needs fixing? Tech? Capitalism? This lack of clarity may stem from the fact that these people are not ideologues but reformists. They tend to believe that companies should be more responsible \u2014 and users must be, too. But with rare exceptions, the reformists stop short of asking the uncomfortable questions: Is it possible to reform profit-driven systems that turn attention into money? In such a business, can you even separate addiction from success?Perhaps this is unfair \u2014 the reformists are trying. But while we wait for a consensus, or a plan, allow me to suggest a starting point: the dots. Little. Often red. Sometimes with numbers. Commonly seen at the corners of app icons, where they are known in the trade as badges, they are now proliferating across once-peaceful interfaces on a steep epidemic curve. They alert us to things that need to be checked: unread messages; new activities; pending software updates; announcements; unresolved problems. As they\u2019ve spread, they\u2019ve become a rare commonality in the products that we \u2014 and the remorseful technologists \u2014 are so worried about. If not the culprits, the dots are at least accessories to most of the supposed crimes of addictive app design.When platforms or services sense their users are disengaged, whether from social activities, work or merely a continued contribution to corporate profitability, dots are deployed: outside, inside, wherever they might be seen. I\u2019ve met dots that existed only to inform me of the existence of other dots, new dots, dots with almost no meaning at all; a dot on my Instagram app led me to another dot within it, which informed me that something had happened on Facebook: Someone I barely know had posted for the first time in a while. These dots are omnipresent, leading everywhere and ending nowhere. So maybe there\u2019s something to be gained by connecting them.That year, we got the very first glimpse of the iPhone\u2019s home screen, in Steve Jobs\u2019s hand, onstage at MacWorld. It showed three dots, ringed in white: 1 unread text; 5 calls or voice mail messages; 1 email. Jobs set about showing off the apps, opening them, eliminating the dots. Eventually, when the iPhone was opened to outside developers, badge use accelerated. As touch-screen phones careered toward ubiquity, and as desktop interfaces and website design and mobile operating systems huddled together around a crude and adapting set of visual metaphors, the badge was ascendant.On Windows desktop computers, they tended to be blue and lived in the lower right corner. On BlackBerrys, red, with a white asterisk in the middle. On social media, in apps and on websites, badge design was more creative, appearing as little speech bubbles or as rectangles. They make appearances on Facebook and across Google products, perhaps most notoriously on the ill-fated Google Plus social network, where blocky badges were filled with inexplicably, desperately high numbers. (This tactic has since spread, obnoxiously, to news sites and, inexplicably, to comment sections.) Android itself has remained officially unbadged, but the next version of the operating system, called Oreo, will include them by default, completing their invasion.What\u2019s so powerful about the dots is that until we investigate them, they could signify anything: a career-altering email; a reminder that Winter Sales End Soon; a match, a date, a \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d The same badge might lead to word that Grandma\u2019s in the hospital or that, according to a prerecorded voice, the home-security system you don\u2019t own is in urgent need of attention or that, for the 51st time today, someone has posted in the group chat.New and flourishing modes of socialization amount, in the most abstract terms, to the creation and reduction of dots, and the experience of their attendant joys and anxieties. Dots are deceptively, insidiously simple: They are either there or they\u2019re not; they contain a number, and that number has a value. But they imbue whatever they touch with a spirit of urgency, reminding us that behind each otherwise static icon is unfinished business. They don\u2019t so much inform us or guide us as correct us: You\u2019re looking there, but you should be looking here. They\u2019re a lawn that must be mowed. Boils that must be lanced, or at least scabs that itch to be picked. They\u2019re Bubble Wrap laid over your entire digital existence.To their credit, the big tech companies seem to be aware of the problem, at least in the narrow terms of user experience. In Google\u2019s guide for application developers, the company makes a gentle attempt to pre-empt future senseless dot deployment. \u201cDon\u2019t badge every notification, as there are cases where badges don\u2019t make sense,\u201d the company suggests. Apple, in its guidelines, seems a bit more fed up. \u201cMinimize badging,\u201d it says. \u201cDon\u2019t overwhelm users by connecting badging with a huge amount of information that changes frequently. Use it to present brief, essential information and atypical content changes that are highly likely to be of interest.\u201dThese companies know better than anyone that dots are a problem, but they also know that dots work. Late last year, a red badge burbled to the surface next to millions of iPhone users\u2019 Settings apps. It looked as though it might be an update, but it turned out to be a demand: Finish adding your credit card to Apple Pay, or the dot stays put. Apple might as well have said: Give us your credit card number, or we will annoy you until you do.The lack of consensus within the mounting resistance to Big Tech can also be found within the perimeter of the dot. After all, it\u2019s where the most dangerous conflations take place: of what we need, and what we\u2019re told we need; of what purpose our software serves to us, and us to it; of dismissal with fulfillment. The dot is where ill-gotten attention is laundered into legitimate-seeming engagement. On this, our most influential tech companies seem to agree. Maybe our self-appointed saviors can, too.John Herrman is a David Carr Fellow at The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case Against Google", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "FeatureCritics say the search giant is squelching competition before it begins. Should the government step in?Supported byIn the years that followed, those overlapping enthusiasms led to cohabitation, a raucous wedding and parallel careers at big technology firms. The thing is, though, when you\u2019re young and geeky and fall in love with someone else young and geeky, all your nerdy friends want you to set them up on dates as well. So Adam and Shivaun, who took Adam\u2019s last name after marriage, approached the problem like two good programmers: They designed a dating app.The app was known as MatchMate, and the idea was simple: Rather than just pairing people with similar interests, their software would put together potential mates according to an array of parameters, such as which pub they were currently standing in, and whether they had friends in common, and what movies they liked or candidates they voted for, and dozens of other factors that might be important in finding a life partner (or at least a tonight partner). The magic of MatchMate was that it could allow a user to mix variables and search for pairings within a specific group, a trick that computer scientists call parameterization. \u201cIt was like asking your best friend to set you up,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cSomeone who says, \u2018Well, you probably think you\u2019d like this guy because he\u2019s handsome, but actually you\u2019d like this other guy because he\u2019s not as good-looking, but he\u2019s really funny.\u2019\u2009\u201dWithin computer science, this kind of algorithmic alchemy is sometimes known as vertical search, and it\u2019s notoriously hard to master. Even Google, with its thousands of Ph.D.s, gets spooked by vertical-search problems. \u201cGoogle\u2019s built around horizontal search, which means if you type in \u2018What\u2019s the population of Myanmar,\u2019 then Google finds websites that include the words \u2018Myanmar\u2019 and \u2018population,\u2019 and figures out which ones are most likely to answer your question,\u201d says Neha Narula, who was a software engineer at Google before joining the M.I.T. Media Lab. You don\u2019t really care if Google sends you to Wikipedia or a news article or some other site, as long as its results are accurate and trustworthy. But, Narula says, \u201cwhen you start asking questions with only one correct answer, like, Which site has the cheapest vacuum cleaner? \u2014 that\u2019s much, much harder.\u201dFor search engines like Google, finding that one correct answer becomes particularly difficult when people have numerous parameters they want satisfied: Which vacuum cleaner is cheapest but also energy-efficient and good on thick carpets and won\u2019t scare the dog? To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.Soon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?As far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.Froogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201dAdam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.The Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.In a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.At the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.In its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201dStandard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201dIn 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201dThe Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.For decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.Consider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.What eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.The Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.\u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201dGoogle executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.One way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201dLeft unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.Shivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.As the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.But they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.Then there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201dThe more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201dTradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)Shivaun and Adam filled notepads with the names of companies that had complained about Google\u2019s tactics \u2014 eJustice, a vertical-search engine for legal information; NexTag, the fellow price-comparison site; BDZV, a group of German newspapers. They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.\u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.Google responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201dThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.Along the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.Even when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.By the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201dReback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201dIn public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.In the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.And most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201dMicrosoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.Or consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201dIt was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.The implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.\u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201dSome legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201dThose are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.Rather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.Put differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.For the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201dOne of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley and received a law degree from Santa Clara University.She is the daughter of Kim Benjamin of Los Angeles and Robert Benjamin of Westlake Village, Calif.He is the son of Diana A. Troxell of King of Prussia, Pa., and David D. Friedman of San Jose, Calif. The groom is the stepson of Elizabeth A. Cook and Eugene Troxell. The groom is a paternal grandson of Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist.Ms. Benjamin recalled Mr. Friedman came across as \u201ca character\u201d with \u201ca strong presence\u201d in 2011 as he interviewed her for a job at the Seasteading Institute.\u201cHe leaned as far back as he could go in his chair in these crazy pants with his arms crossed,\u201d she said, and wore a T-shirt that said \u201cI Am John Galt\u201d (a nod to the hero of the Ayn Rand novel \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u2019\u2019) and wild yoga pants with flames, moons and stars.\u201cI loved the idea of seasteading and wrote about it for part of my thesis,\u201d said Ms. Benjamin, who wore a more sedate pink cardigan over a peach A-line dress with a pearl necklace and matching earrings for the interview.\u201cShe was really enthusiastic about the political movement, which I started,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Friedman of seasteading, and added with a laugh that Ms. Benjamin, who identifies as a feminist, coined the term shesteading. \u201cI liked her positive energy.\u2019\u2019Toward the end of his marriage at the time, Mr. Friedman, by summer, had separated from his wife and was no longer working at the Seasteading Institute. At that point, he had no misgivings about asking Ms. Benjamin on a date of sorts \u2014 to join him on a 10-hour trip to Burning Man, an annual weeklong festival in Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert, where they would hang out with Future Camp, a group of futurists and transhumanists.They hauled some gear for the group in a red pickup truck he rented, and she brought along costumes, art supplies, and her guitar. They arrived in the desert at 3 a.m., and set up separate shelters.\u201cIt was my first Burning Man,\u201d said Ms. Benjamin, who saw it as an adventure and not a date at all. \u201cIt\u2019s a blank canvas for an experience that you want to have.\u201dHalfway through the festival they had their first kiss while drinking coffee and watching the early morning scene from atop a lifeguard tower.\u201cOh yes, this is a date,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Benjamin recalled thinking, and said that once they returned home, she soon got to know and came to love his two young children, Tovar and Izzy.In 2015 after Mr. Friedman proposed at Chez TJ, a French restaurant in Mountain View, they knew their commitment was long-term, really long-term.\u201cWe were committing to marriage to multiple human lifetimes if we have that opportunity,\u201d said Mr. Friedman, taking cryogenics and life-extension technology into consideration. She added: \u201cTwo hundred years of being married to Patri isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019d rather have 1,000.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The heads of Citi and Goldman took home healthy pay raises last year.\u2022 Qualcomm didn\u2019t categorically say no to Broadcom\u2019s latest offer.\u2022 What financial regulation could look like post-Brexit.\u2022 Look who bet big on a pick-up in volatility...Peter Thiel.\u2022 R.I.P., BTFD?\u2022 Kraft Heinz is due for a big deal.\u2022 U.S. Bancorp\u2019s big fine.The good times that returned to Wall Street after President Donald Trump got elected are now flowing into the pockets of the big banks\u2019 C.E.Os:Are those paydays justified?Let\u2019s take Mr. Corbat.Citigroup\u2019s stock rose 25 percent in 2017, a lot more than the 16 percent posted by the KBW Bank Index. Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations.Citi\u2019s underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years.The message from Citi\u2019s board seems to be that, since the bank\u2019s performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbat\u2019s pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street.But on other yardsticks, the awards can seem highCiti may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bank\u2019s return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of America\u2019s was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan.And the makeup of the compensation mattersC.E.O.s\u2019 compensation is made up of different types of pay:\u2022 Cash salaries and cash bonuses\u2022 Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future.The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is.Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 The decision starts a maximum 75-day clock for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to decide whether to approve or oppose the deal, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Chinese investors have faced heightened scrutiny from Cfius. Since president Trump took office, a half a dozen Chinese deals have fallen apart because of concerns raised by CFIUS, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Raising the breakup fee for antitrust reasons beyond $8 billion. That amount, which represents an already high 6.6 percent of the total deal price, still isn\u2019t high enough for Qualcomm. \u201cA breakup fee in the range proposed by Broadcom does not come close to compensating for those risks,\u201d Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm\u2019s chairman, writes in a letter to Broadcom\u2019s chief, Hock Tan.\u2022 Make unspecified other commitments meant to assuage antitrust regulators.\u2022 Clarify what Broadcom\u2019s intentions are for Qualcomm\u2019s big licensing business.More from Mr. Jacobs\u2019s letter:Our board is open to further discussions with Broadcom to see if a proposal that appropriately reflects the true value of Qualcomm shares, and ensures an appropriate level of deal certainty, can be obtained.If the two sides can\u2019t reach an agreement, then matters may come down to a vote on Qualcomm\u2019s board on March 6. Remember that Broadcom is seeking six of 11 board seats, down from its initial target of unseating all directors.\u2014 Michael de la MercedBritain\u2019s government is often criticized for not clearly communicating the type of deal it wants to strike with the European Union as it prepares to leave the bloc.The dilemma Britain faces.Post-Brexit, Britain\u2019s banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them to operate in any E.U. country with few restrictions. Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.Hence the new plan.The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems. It would allow both sides leeway to strike their own rules once they\u2019ve agreed on their main objectives. And it suggests that a monitoring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set up.Will the E.U. agree to the plan?The bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation. Certain politicians in the E.U. may argue Britain is trying to retain the privileges of the single market while discarding the duties that come with it. Still, some of Europe\u2019s leaders, banks and businesses may support the plan, in the belief that it will minimize disruption and allow the City of London to continue to play a big role in financing the strong economic expansion taking place in Europe.\u2014Peter EavisPeter Thiel.Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Thiel Macro, which invests Mr. Thiel\u2019s fortune, held put options on 1.9 million shares of ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures as of Dec. 31. The investment is designed to pay off if the VIX rises.It\u2019s unclear whether the fund had maintained those positions through last week. But if it had, he would have reaped a big windfall.Investors piled into bets that volatility would continue to decline last year. And those wagers paid off as the VIX spent 2017 trading at historically low levels. But volatility has picked up this year. After trading below 10 to start the year, the VIX spiked to above 37 during the selloff last week. It finished Friday at 19.The law firm Royds Withy King says it has seen a flurry of cases recently involving disputes over cryptocurrency holdings, one of which was recently valued at $1.4 million.The firm said it is currently working on three separate high-value divorce cases where spouses are seeking the disclosure and a potential share of cryptocurrency assets.Off the top of our heads, we\u2019d think that issues would include a) the reporting, or lack thereof, of holdings and b) the value of any digital money portfolios.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Julie Edde, Bei Hu and Suzanne Woolley of Bloomberg:\u201cThere\u2019s sort of, \u2018Everybody should buy a dip,\u2019 which has become folklore in the markets now.

{"Headline": "Why Scientists Love to Study Dogs (and Often Ignore Cats)", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecently someone (my boss, actually) mentioned to me that I wrote more articles about dogs than I did about cats and asked why.My first thought, naturally, was that it had nothing to do with the fact that I have owned numerous dogs and no cats, but rather reflected the amount of research done by scientists on the animals.After all, I\u2019ll write about any interesting findings, and I like cats just fine, even if I am a dog person. Two of my adult children have cats, and I would hate for them to think I was paying them insufficient attention. (Hello Bailey! Hello Tawny! \u2014 Those are the cats, not the children.)The research I have been interested in and writing about involves evolution, domestication, current genetics and behavior. And the questions are of the What-is-a-dog-really? variety. Dogs and cats have also been used as laboratory animals in invasive experiments, but I wasn\u2019t asking about which animal is more popular for those.\u201cOoo, that is an interesting question!\u201d she wrote back. \u201cWay more interesting than the various grant-related emails that are filling up my inbox.\u201cThe research has lagged behind in cats. I think they\u2019re taken less seriously than dogs, probably to do with societal biases. I have a vet in my group who thinks that many of the cancers in cats may actually be better models for human cancer, but there has been almost no research into them.\u201dBetter models than cancers in dogs, that is. Dogs do get many of the same cancers as humans, but in dogs the risk for these cancers often varies by breed, which narrows the target down when looking for the cause of a disease.Furthermore, said Dr. Karlsson, cat behavior gets no respect.\u201cNon-cat people tend to laugh at the idea of studying behavioral genetics in cats, and the animal training world complains that people tend to dismiss cats as untrainable.\u201dCats, of course, can be trained just as any animal can. Dr. Karlsson unwittingly trained her cat to hop up on the counter when she opened the door of a cabinet containing goodies.And commerce has recognized cat trainability. There are several models of toilet training kits to teach cats to use human toilets. If such kits exist for dogs, I couldn\u2019t find them. Not even for Bichon frises.And as to the cancers, Dr. Karlsson said Kate Megquier, a veterinarian working on a Ph.D. at the Broad Institute in cancer genomics thought cat cancers deserved more attention.Dr. Megquier said \u201cI\u2019ve been studying a lot of the dog cancers,\u201d but that there are reasons studying certain naturally occurring cancers in cats could be valuable.They get a lot of cancers called lymphomas, she said, and \u201cthey certainly have something to teach us about lymphomas.\u201d They also get oral cancers similar to ones humans get and it\u2019s possible, she said, that these might be related to environmental toxins they pick up while grooming themselves.Investigating that possibility \u201ccould give us some insight into these cancers,\u201d she said, helping pets and people. Dr. Megquier likes dogs, but is, by her own account, \u201cdefinitely a cat person.\u201dDr. Karlsson said that there are good reasons dogs are studied so intensively. There are many more dog breeds \u2014 about 400 compared to about 40 cat breeds. That means more genetic diversity, and better tools for studying genomes.\u201cWe\u2019re all hugely jealous of it, and had to put up with lots of teasing from the cat geneticists at the meeting I was at last week,\u201d she said.Cultural attitudes toward pets creep into research even in the organization of scientific meetings, Dr. Karlsson pointed out. Putting the two animals together as the subject of a meeting is more related to their status as the iconic human pets rather than biological similarity.Dr. Ostrander replied to my email by noting the attraction to science of the many different dog breeds and the vast range in dog size and shape. Some of the genes that affect growth, she said, affect \u201cdiseases of growth gone awry, like cancer.\u201dIn addition, she wrote, \u201cdogs have undergone this really striking bottleneck during domestication,\u201d in which a few ancestral wolves gave rise to all domestic dogs. Later on Victorians produced many breeds that have even narrower bottlenecks, with much inbreeding.Domestication, she said, has \u201chappened in an amazingly short period of time and we don\u2019t understand all the genetics associated with it. It remains one of the most interesting and challenging questions in biology.\u201dSome dogs suffer from behavioral problems that look similar to human problems like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Those similarities, Dr. Ostrander said, provide \u201ca great avenue for learning more about ourselves.\u201dThat pretty much stated the case for dogs, I thought. Next, I called one of the main people responsible for the recent cat genome Dr. Karlsson was talking about, Leslie Lyons at the University of Missouri.I asked her about there being more research on dogs than cats.\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d she said, \u201cfor several different reasons.\u201dShe agreed that the \u201cthe dog is a great model for cancers,\u201d she said. It\u2019s also true they have been domesticated longer than cats, and have more breeds, thus having a greater potential for studying inherited diseases.But she also said there are social reasons having to do with popular attitudes toward cats that spill over into the realm of research. She said cat lovers are not as interested as dog lovers in fancy breeds \u2014 yet. Cats could be bred in many different shapes and sizes like dogs, she said, if there were interest. \u201cWe could have a Chihuahua cat and a Great Dane cat,\u201d although, she said, \u201cI think that would be a little dangerous.\u201dShe said research funds are much harder to obtain for cats, even though cats are superior to other animals for studying some diseases, like polycystic kidney disease, or PKD. \u201cLet\u2019s put them in drug trials. We could fix the cats and we could fix humans.\u201d Dr. Lyons keeps cats as pets and did mention, in an offhand way, during our conversation the common observation that \u201cCats rule, dogs drool.\u201dShe said that cats are rarer than dogs in archaeological sites, partly because they\u2019re solitary and they don\u2019t seem to have been eaten as much by ancient humans.\u201cIf they\u2019re not eaten, you don\u2019t find them in waste piles,\u201d she said.\u201cI also think that there is a bias as a result of medieval to later European views of cats,\u201d she said. \u201cCats were considered to be bad animals because they didn\u2019t do what humans said.\u201d And yet, that is the source of their appeal now for many people. Dr. Marshall herself has pet cats.And now the numbers: A search of Pub Med, a database that includes most biomedical journals, yielded 139,858 results for cats and 328,781 results for dogs. Google scholar results were 1,670,000 for cats and 2,850,000 for dogs. These are simple searches, of course, and don\u2019t say much about the kind of research that was undertaken.As for journalism, my searches on the news database Nexis for dogs and cats kept returning more than 3,000 hits, which my screen warned me would take a long time to retrieve. So I settled for searches of \u201cdog genome\u201d and \u201ccat genome.\u201d The result, 20 for dogs, 6 for cats. The dog genome was sequenced before the cat genome.I would caution against concluding anything based on this haphazard browsing other than that the results do back up the researchers\u2019 sense that there\u2019s more research on dogs.Also, a colleague raised a question that didn\u2019t occur to a single expert I interviewed, which shows that devotion to science can sometimes limit your point of view.\u201cIs it possible,\u201d my friend, who has had both cats and dogs, asked, \u201cthat there are more dog studies because the cats won\u2019t consent?\u201dOf course.

Ms. Katz had reported on the company\u2019s affairs, including a raid by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office last month, and Mr. Li had overseen the coverage.Two other reporters involved in the coverage \u2014 Josh Saul, a Newsweek writer, and Josh Keefe, a writer at the affiliated International Business Times \u2014 were locked out of their computers and email accounts on Monday. They were not fired, but did not know whether they would still have jobs come morning.Newsweek\u2019s communications department said in an email on Tuesday that the company does not comment on personnel matters. The magazine\u2019s new acting editor, Nancy Cooper, did not respond to an email sent to her personal address.After the district attorney\u2019s raid on Jan. 18, editors at Newsweek assigned a group of reporters to investigate the company. An employee in the news department said that executives had vetted those reporters\u2019 stories before publication.At first, two employees said, the company\u2019s chief content officer, Dayan Candappa, protected the reporters, essentially acting as a buffer between them and top executives. But last week, Mr. Candappa took a leave of absence in response to allegations of sexual harassment.After the firings were announced, Matthew Cooper, a senior writer at Newsweek who has spent more than 30 years in journalism, quit in protest. In a resignation letter that he posted on Twitter, Mr. Cooper denounced Newsweek Media Group both for the firings and for what he called a pattern of \u201creckless leadership.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the installation of editors, not Li and Roe, who recklessly sought clicks at the expense of accuracy, retweets over fairness, that leaves me most despondent not only for Newsweek but for other publications that don\u2019t heed the lessons of this publication\u2019s fall,\u201d he wrote in the letter, which was addressed to Dev Pragad, the company\u2019s chief executive.IBT Media, the publisher of the International Business Times, purchased Newsweek in 2013 and rebranded as the Newsweek Media Group in 2017. It has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs since the purchase, but the past month has been particularly tumultuous.On Jan. 18, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office raided Newsweek\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan and seized 18 computer servers as part of an investigation related to the company\u2019s finances. The founders of IBT Media have been scrutinized for their financial and personal connections to the South Korean pastor David Jang and Olivet University, the small Bible college he runs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Waymo-Uber Trial, Kalanick Recalls \u2018Jam Sesh\u2019 With Rival Engineer", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Basketball players have pickup games. Rappers have freestyle cyphers. Tech entrepreneurs, according to the former chief executive of Uber, riff on big ideas in something they call a \u201cjam sesh.\u201dWaymo, the self-driving-car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, called Mr. Kalanick to the stand during the first full day of testimony in the federal trial. It hoped to reveal how Uber\u2019s win-at-all-costs attitude had pushed the company to acquire Otto, an autonomous-vehicle start-up created by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski.Waymo contends \u2014 and Uber denies \u2014 that the deal was part of Uber\u2019s plan to steal intellectual property from Google\u2019s self-driving-car project, which would later be renamed Waymo, in order to close the gap in an area of technology essential to its business.As he waded through questions from Waymo\u2019s lawyers, Mr. Kalanick, who resigned in June as Uber\u2019s chief executive, offered unusual insight into how deals get done in Silicon Valley and the freewheeling \u2014 some might say self-parodying \u2014 business culture at the biggest technology start-ups.A jam sesh, as Mr. Kalanick explained it, is a business meeting akin to a session in which a jazz ensemble spontaneously works out music. Creative people come in with their own ideas and create \u201cbeautiful music.\u201d Or business plans. The group discussed laser sensor technology that was critical to the operation of self-driving cars. A handwritten note on a whiteboard read, \u201cLaser is the sauce.\u201dBut there was a hangup: Mr. Levandowski wanted to venture out on his own.\u201cI wanted to hire Anthony and he wanted to start a company, so I tried to come up with a situation where he could feel like he started a company and I could feel like I hired him,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said, choosing his words carefully between long sips of water. He polished off four bottles of water in less than an hour on the witness stand.Uber acquired Otto for a reported $590 million in 2016, just six months after it was started. It is unclear how much Mr. Levandowski, already a wealthy man thanks to a $120 million bonus from his time at Google, personally made in the deal. An Uber spokesman, Matt Kallman, said the company had fired Mr. Levandowski in May before Otto could meet any of its performance targets. As a result, he lost out on an estimated $250 million worth of equity in Uber.Waymo contends that the clever solution \u2014 let Mr. Levandowski create his own company and then buy it \u2014 was simply obfuscation for a plot to steal important technology from Waymo.While the deal was unusual, it\u2019s not rare for an executive to want to ensure his independence inside a larger company. Technology giants often have to sell founders of start-ups on the idea that they will maintain some independence, as well as a big payday, in an acquisition. Facebook, for example, acquired Instagram and kept the photo-sharing app a separate unit within the company.Otto is still an independent unit within Uber and is technically a separate defendant in this case.Waymo is trying to portray Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Levandowski as a pair of aggressive, money-hungry conspirators who worked together to steal Google\u2019s intellectual property.Before Mr. Kalanick testified, Uber\u2019s lawyers objected to Waymo\u2019s presenting a text message that Mr. Levandowski sent to Mr. Kalanick with a clip from the movie \u201cWall Street\u201d in which Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, passionately argues that \u201cgreed, for the lack of a better word, is good.\u201d No ruling was made.On Wednesday, Mr. Kalanick is expected to be asked how much he revealed to Uber\u2019s board about Mr. Levandowski and what the engineer had taken with him from Google.In deposition testimony before the trial, Bill Gurley, an investor and a former board member at Uber, said the company\u2019s board had not been shown a due diligence report before the acquisition of Otto.Mr. Gurley, who stepped down from Uber\u2019s board in June, said he wouldn\u2019t have voted in favor of the acquisition had he known the report indicated that Mr. Levandowski possessed files from Google.Nathan Ballard, a spokesman for Mr. Levandowski, said after the session in the federal courthouse in San Francisco that \u201calthough a great many things have been said about Anthony over the last two days, we are confident that he will eventually be vindicated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Sublime and Scary Future of Cameras With A.I. Brains", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSomething strange, scary and sublime is happening to cameras, and it\u2019s going to complicate everything you knew about pictures. Cameras are getting brains.Until the past few years, just about all cameras \u2014 whether smartphones or point-and-shoots or CCTV surveillance \u2014 were like eyes disconnected from any intelligence.But all this is changing. There\u2019s a new generation of cameras that understand what they see. They\u2019re eyes connected to brains, machines that no longer just see what you put in front of them, but can act on it \u2014 creating intriguing and sometimes eerie possibilities.It doesn\u2019t take long to imagine the useful and very creepy possibilities of cameras that can decipher the world. Digital cameras brought about a revolution in photography, but until now, it was only a revolution of scale: Thanks to microchips, cameras got smaller and cheaper, and we began carrying them everywhere.The companies making these devices are aware of the privacy dangers. Many are moving into the field gingerly, slathering their products with safeguards that they say reduce the creepiness.Take Google\u2019s Clips, which I\u2019ve used for the past week and half. It\u2019s one of the most unusual devices I\u2019ve ever encountered. The camera is about the size of a tin of mints, and it has no screen. On its front, there\u2019s a lens and a button. The button takes a picture, but it\u2019s there only if you really need it.Instead, most of the time, you just rely on the camera\u2019s intuition, which has been trained to recognize facial expressions, lighting, framing and other hallmarks of nice photos. It also recognizes familiar faces \u2014 the people you\u2019re with more often are those it deems most interesting to photograph.Clips, which sells for $249, makes taking pictures unconscious and all but invisible. Carry it around wherever you go; the camera has a handy case with a big bendy clip, so it can be affixed to your jacket, set on a tabletop, carried in your palm or placed anywhere else with a view.From there, it\u2019s all A.I.Clips watches the scene, and when it sees something that looks like a compelling shot, it captures a 15-second burst picture (something like a short animated GIF or Live Photo on your iPhone).I took a trip with my family to Disneyland last week, and over two highly photographable days, I barely took a photo. Instead, this tiny device automatically did the work, capturing a couple hundred short clips of our vacation.Some of them were quite good, getting the high points of our trip in the same way I might have with my phone. Here\u2019s a clip of my son driving a car.But what was really interesting was the stuff I wouldn\u2019t have consciously captured. I got dozens of pictures like these:Aesthetically, these pictures aren\u2019t masterworks. Emotionally, they\u2019re on a higher plane. Clips caught moments of my kids goofing off and fighting in Disney\u2019s endless lines, playing catch at home, dancing like adorable maniacs \u2014 moments too spontaneous or seemingly slight for me to have caught with my camera, but that will probably paint a more accurate and edifying picture of our lives in 30 years.But you don\u2019t have to be as crazy as I am to share slivers of this fear \u2014 that your kids or your pets are constantly doing things that you\u2019ll later want to remember, but that smartphones often miss. An intelligent camera gets these times because it doesn\u2019t ask you to break the moment to capture them.But, obviously, setting up a camera that doesn\u2019t need to be specifically triggered to take a picture is problematic. It raises the worry of spying \u2014 that Google can spy on you, or that you can use it to spy on others.Google addresses that creepiness in two ways. The device is mostly unconnected from the internet. It can take pictures without a connection, and it requires your phone for viewing or saving the clips. But even then, all its A.I. happens on the device, and it doesn\u2019t even need you to have a Google account, the company said.\u201cWe spent a lot of time thinking about privacy, and making sure this was a device people would actually want,\u201d said Eva Snee, who heads Google\u2019s research on how people interact with Clips. \u201cWhat we learned was that cameras don\u2019t creep people out when they\u2019re used deliberately and the person is part of the process.\u201dClips also raises the memory of other products in this vein, including Snap\u2019s Spectacles and Google Glass, the search company\u2019s failed attempt to get consumers to use glasses that can take photos.To ensure that, Clips is designed to look like a camera. When it\u2019s on, it flashes a white LED to signal that it could be recording. It also does not record audio, because that might have felt too much like spying.Lighthouse, which I\u2019ve also used for a few weeks, is meant to be an upgrade over the internet-connected home security cameras that have become popular. Those devices can be annoying because they freak out every time they spot any movement.Lighthouse\u2019s special trick is a camera system that can sense 3-D space and learn to recognize faces \u2014 intelligence meant to avoid false alarms. It also has a nifty natural-language interface, so you can ask it straightforward questions: \u201cWhat did the kids do when I was gone?\u201d will show you clips of your kids when you were gone.Lighthouse, which sells for $299 and requires a $10 monthly subscription, feels like a work in progress. It was mostly accurate in differentiating people in my house, but it was also tripped up into thinking I had an intruder by a mylar balloon floating around my living room.The company is young, and I expect its software to improve. I can see it being of genuine use to people who wonder what\u2019s happening at home when they\u2019re away. Want to know if your dog is jumping on your couch? Ask Lighthouse; it can recognize dogs jumping around couches, and will instantly show you the clip. (Well, it can get close. I don\u2019t have a dog, so when I asked Lighthouse that question, it pulled up a clip of my kid kicking his stuffed tiger off the couch.)But what if it\u2019s your spouse, not your pooch, you\u2019re worried about? I trust my wife, but for the sake of this column, I asked the device to show me any clips of her in the house with an unfamiliar person. There she was one evening, with the babysitter, whom Lighthouse hadn\u2019t seen before.It was a case of straight-up spying on my family. But it\u2019s an obvious possibility with a camera that understands the world so well.Alex Teichman, Lighthouse\u2019s chief executive, said it could add safeguards against inter-family spying, for instance by restricting face identification only to unrecognized faces. He also pointed out that the system has numerous fine-grained privacy controls that allow you to turn off any recording when certain family members are present.I found his response credible. Both Lighthouse and Clips are well crafted against abuse. It should be noted that neither one allows for much more spying than we can already accomplish with smartphones; constant social surveillance is the norm in 2018.But they are guides to the future. Tomorrow, all cameras will have their capabilities. And they won\u2019t just watch you \u2014 they\u2019ll understand, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Artificial Intelligence Is Edging Its Way Into Our Lives", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArtificial intelligence is here \u2014 and it\u2019s bringing new possibilities, while also raising questions. Do these gadgets and services really behave as advertised? How will they evolve in the years ahead? How quickly will they overhaul the way we live and change the way we do business?A month after the Chinese electronics giant Huawei suffered a big setback in its quest to sell its high-end smartphones to Americans, the company\u2019s chief for consumer devices, Richard Yu, said he was still optimistic about Huawei\u2019s prospects in the United States.\u201cWe have won global consumers\u2019 trust, in over 170 countries,\u201d Mr. Yu said at the New Work Summit. \u201cWe very strictly protect consumers\u2019 privacy.\u201dAt the conference on Tuesday, Mr. Yu said that Huawei had no ties to the Chinese government. \u201cWe are a globalized company, just headquartered in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not part of any government. We have to be a company that is independent from every country.\u201dMike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, offered a glimpse of how the social network is applying artificial intelligence to ward off bad actors and keep its platform free of toxicity.Calling the fight against rules violators a \u201ccat and mouse game,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that Facebook\u2019s A.I. efforts had succeeded at certain types of content moderation, such as image classifier algorithms that find and automatically remove nude photos and videos.Now on Facebook, he said, \u201cthe vast majority of nudity and pornography reporting is automatic.\u201dBut the company has since added thousands of human content moderators and struck partnerships with human fact-checking organizations. Mr. Schroepfer implied Facebook has learned that A.I. alone would not do the trick, given the sophistication of bad actors who find ways around the platform\u2019s filters.Mr. Schroepfer also said that human judgment would be required in certain situations, like a comment (\u201cnice jacket\u201d) that could be either an earnest compliment or a sarcastic insult, depending on the context. And when it comes to some of Facebook\u2019s thornier problems, like trying to enforce consistent hate speech policies, human intervention may always be necessary.Michael Kratsios, a deputy chief technology officer at the White House, said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that regulators should get out of the way of advances in emerging technologies.He cited progress toward a repeal of some regulations on commercial drones, such as rules prohibiting them from flying at night.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s key to get ahead of those regulatory hurdles,\u201d said Mr. Kratsios, who previously worked as chief of staff to Peter Thiel, the libertarian venture capitalist. These regulations, he said, are \u201cputting us at a disadvantage.\u201dUnlike some experts who believe China is poised to dominate the A.I. age, Mr. Kratsios said he wasn\u2019t worried about overseas competition. The United States, he said, has a \u201c30-year head start\u201d in A.I. development.Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, blasted companies like Facebook on Tuesday for addicting children to their products and renewed his calls for more government regulation of the tech industry.Mr. Benioff compared a new Facebook Messenger product for children to candy cigarettes, which he used to pretend to smoke as a boy.\u201cWhat do you think they were trying to get us to do with those?\u201d Mr. Benioff asked onstage at the New Work Summit. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is any different now. They\u2019re focused on the addictive nature of these user interfaces. At some point, we have to say, \u2018Hold on.\u2019\u201dSilicon Valley is nearing the point where moral lines will have to be drawn by the government since the industry is not regulating itself and does not seem to be guided by a \u201cstrong hand of ethics,\u201d he said.There is a \u201ccrisis of trust,\u201d he added, that will become a \u201ctidal wave\u201d among American consumers who are growing wary of tech giants.\u201cI\u2019m trying to protect our industry,\u201d said Mr. Benioff, whose company sells access to business software over the internet. \u201cIf companies aren\u2019t able to regulate themselves, they should have external regulations.\u201dOne of the solutions he suggested was to move decision-making away from algorithms and back toward humans. He cited Facebook\u2019s decision to disband its trending news curation team as an example.\u201cFacebook had a team promoting, sorting and focusing stories, 100 curators that they removed and put an algorithm in their place, and that started the downward spiral that they\u2019re in today,\u201d Mr. Benioff said.He also spoke about the recent ban on kegs of beer at Salesforce offices after he recently stumbled across one while visiting a company he had acquired.Fei-Fei Li, a chief scientist at Google and a Stanford professor, has called on technologists to take a more \u201chuman centered\u201d approach to the creation of artificial intelligence. On Tuesday at the New Work Summit, Ms. Li said that researchers must work to ensure that A.I. embodied human qualities and that it would ultimately operate alongside humans, not replace them.\u201cI often tell my students not to be misled by the name \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 \u2014 there is nothing artificial about it,\u201d she said. \u201cA.I. is made by humans, intended to behave by humans and, ultimately, to impact humans lives and human society.\u201dAt Stanford, Ms. Li was instrumental in the recent rise of \u201ccomputer vision\u201d systems that can recognize people and objects entirely on their own. At Google, she is working to package and sell these and other systems as cloud computing services, delivering the latest A.I. technology to a wide range of businesses.But she said that as Google and other internet giants pushed these techniques forward, academia and the government must help ensure that A.I. evolved into something that enhanced our humanity, created as many jobs as it replaced and operated in safe and predictable ways.In particular, Ms. Li said, academic institutions can help ensure that computer scientists work alongside social scientists in building this new breed of technology.\u201cA.I. has outgrown its origin in computer science,\u201d she said.Ultimately, said Ms. Li, who was born in China, A.I. reflects the people who build it more than other technologies do. For that reason and others, she said, A.I. researchers must work in a way that spans not only many industries but many cultures as well.Tuesday\u2019s first speaker at the New Work Summit was Kai-Fu Lee, who used to lead Google in China and knows a thing or two about American tech giants in China. His prognosis about whether companies like Facebook will ever be able to crack the world\u2019s largest internet market?\u201cThe American products are simply uncompetitive in the China market,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who is now chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on Chinese technology. Even if internet titans from the United States could operate in China, he said, the local competition means they would have a hard time thriving.\u201cMessenger is a much worse product than WeChat,\u201d he said, referring to Facebook\u2019s messaging app and Tencent\u2019s ubiquitous app for chatting, social networking, making payments and other tasks.\u201cAmazon in China is substantially worse than Taobao, JD and Tmall,\u201d he said, referring to three leading Chinese e-commerce sites. And, he said, \u201cApple Pay is much narrower and much harder to use than WeChat or Alipay.\u201dMr. Lee sees other issues that augur against a big Facebook or Google renaissance in China. Multinational companies tend not to hire local managers to lead their China operations. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned about winning in the local market,\u201d he said.Last year, the Chinese government unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030, vowing to create a domestic industry worth $150 billion. This manifesto read like a challenge to the United States, and in many ways it echoed policies laid down by the Obama administration in 2016.John Krafcik, chief executive of the self-driving car company Waymo, took the stage at the New Work Summit on Monday night and spoke out for the first time since his company reached a settlement last week with Uber in a lawsuit over trade secrets that riveted Silicon Valley.\u201cWe were really happy with the outcome that we engineered,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in that case talking about the hardware, but the extra benefit we got from that suit was the ability to understand and ensure that Uber wasn\u2019t using any of our software.\u201dHe called the software Waymo\u2019s \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\u201cThis was a really special case with a really special set of circumstances,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cFor us, this was always about, and really just about, the fact that we needed to ensure Uber wasn\u2019t using our trade secrets.\u201d He added that he did not foresee Waymo suing other former employees.Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s chief executive of its consumer business, which includes its e-commerce operations, doesn\u2019t often make public appearances. But on Monday night, he joined the New Work Summit to discuss the internet retailer\u2019s move into artificial intelligence.His key message: A.I. is everywhere, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will take our jobs.\u201cIf you look at the evolution of technology over the course of decades, tech doesn\u2019t eliminate work; it changes work,\u201d Mr. Wilke said.Amazon has also embedded A.I. throughout the company, he added, with technologists working together with people who run businesses. The company is using machine learning and deep learnings, which are different flavors of A.I., to upgrade internal algorithms, he said.As A.I. technology barrels ahead in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s also starting to pick up steam as a political issue in Washington.So he\u2019s proposing a universal basic income plan called the \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d which would give every American adult $1,000 a month to guarantee them a minimum standard of living while they retrain themselves for new kinds of work.If there are many more white men than black women in the system, for example, it will be worse at identifying the black women. That appears to be the case with some popular commercial facial recognition software.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Google\u2019s Bosses Became \u2018Unpumped\u2019 About Uber", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, used to be like brothers. Google invested in Uber. The internet giant\u2019s top lawyer even served on Uber\u2019s board of directors.But that \u201cbig brother, little brother\u201d relationship deteriorated into paranoia as both companies pursued the creation of autonomous vehicles, Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former chief executive, said on Wednesday.The dissolution of Uber\u2019s relationship with Google demonstrates the finicky nature of the ties that bind \u2014 or break \u2014 tech conglomerates and promising start-ups.It\u2019s something Google understands well. Years ago, Google was tightly aligned with Apple. But the relationship soured as Google started developing smartphone software. Steve Jobs, who was Apple\u2019s chief executive, rightly believed that Google\u2019s Android would become a competitive threat to the iPhone.When Google initially invested in Uber in 2013, Larry Page, Google\u2019s chief executive at the time, and David Drummond, Alphabet\u2019s top lawyer, were mentors, Mr. Kalanick said. Alphabet remains an investor in Uber.The two companies, he said, had a \u201clittle brother, big brother\u201d dynamic because Uber was \u201ctrying to get more of their time than they were willing to give.\u201dAfter Mr. Page repeatedly spurned meetings to discuss combining Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service with Google\u2019s work on self-driving vehicles in some sort of partnership, Mr. Kalanick said, his company started to develop its own autonomous car technology.Uber hired a team of robotics experts from Carnegie Mellon University, deepening the division between the two companies.\u201cGenerally, Google was super not happy, unpumped about us doing this,\u201d said Mr. Kalanick, who stepped down as Uber\u2019s chief executive in June. He recalled that Mr. Page had been \u201cangsty\u201d and asked him: \u201cWhy are you doing my thing?\u201dAs Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Levandowski discussed ways to work together, they exchanged hundreds of text messages. The messages were presented in court on Wednesday and were mostly a variation on how important it was to win the race for self-driving cars.Mr. Kalanick said he did not recall, however, what he had meant by some of the text messages he sent to Mr. Levandowski, including one that read, \u201cBurn the village.\u201dIn another exchange, Mr. Levandowski sent Mr. Kalanick a link to a scene from the movie \u201cWall Street\u201d in which Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, argues \u201cgreed, for the lack of a better word, is good.\u201dWhen asked whether he had watched the scene, Mr. Kalanick said he thought so. His emoji response was a hint. \u201cI mean there is a winky-face there,\u201d he said.Once Uber and Otto struck a basic agreement for an acquisition in April 2016, months before the deal was announced, Mr. Kalanick told Uber executives in a meeting that \u201cgolden time is over \u2014 it\u2019s now wartime.\u201d At another meeting, he discussed how it was necessary for Uber to find and use \u201ccheat codes.\u201dMr. Kalanick explained that this phrase was not as nefarious as it sounded. Cheat codes \u201care elegant solutions to problems that haven\u2019t been thought of,\u201d he said. Tesla, for example, has customers pay tens of thousands for cars but loads those vehicles with sensors that provide data to support its self-driving car efforts.Mr. Kalanick said he had another testy conversation with Mr. Page in October 2016, after Uber announced its acquisition of Otto. Interestingly, Mr. Page was worried that Uber was developing its own flying car technology.Mr. Kalanick insisted that Uber wasn\u2019t working on flying cars, but he said Mr. Page was mad that Uber was hiring Google employees and taking its intellectual property. To which, Mr. Kalanick said, he responded, \u201cYour people are not your IP.\u201dIP is an abbreviation for intellectual property.As Uber\u2019s lawyers questioned him, Mr. Kalanick recalled how he had had so much fun as the company\u2019s chief executive.

{"Headline": "The Haunting of Lindsey Jacobellis", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byENCINITAS, Calif. \u2014 The Olympics were months away, and Lindsey Jacobellis, the world\u2019s most dominant athlete in the short history of snowboard cross, wore shorts and a tank top and sipped from a water bottle on a warm day near the beach. She had arrived at the coffee shop from home on a skateboard. Two dogs slept at her feet. A starfish pendant dangled from her neck.Her body was nowhere near the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. But her mind was.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it just be nice if the media didn\u2019t harangue me for something that happened 12 years ago?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can go into everyone\u2019s past 12 years ago and pick out something that they coulda, shoulda, woulda done. It\u2019s just mine was on a world stage that people have a hard time forgetting, or they just think that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s happened or that it defined me as an athlete.\u201dThe day before, as she had done a time or two most weeks for most of a year, the 32-year-old Jacobellis spent an hour on FaceTime talking with Denise Shull, her mental coach \u2014 a \u201cperformance architect,\u201d in Shull\u2019s words. They spoke about how to handle the coming onslaught of uncomfortable questions from reporters bent on dredging up past failings \u2014 especially that one notorious fall \u2014 as if all of life can be reduced to a single, recycled story line.Working with a mental coach, or a psychologist, or a performance architect, is nothing new in sports. But two things made this pairing more interesting than most.She has been trying to overcome it since \u2014 not for herself, really, because she has moved on, quite spectacularly, if people would just pay attention more often than every four years. What she was trying to overcome was something ghostlier, something harder to catch and release, which is the nagging feeling that when huge numbers of people think of Lindsey Jacobellis, they see a blooper, not a champion.She knew the questions were coming because she faced them in 2010, when she fell short again, and in 2014, when it happened a third time. Certainly, her reward for remaining atop her sport as the 2018 Winter Games approached was to be asked them all again.The biggest difference this time, besides the experience and wisdom that come with four more years, is that Jacobellis has Shull. Their pairing was the idea of Peter Foley, the longtime United States snowboard cross head coach.\u201cShe\u2019s had a bad experience with the Olympics, and in a lot of ways she dreads the Olympics now,\u201d Foley said. \u201cIt would be nice if she could feel better about it.\u201dShull\u2019s purpose is to see if a new mind-set can make the difference between gold and disappointment. And as much as it frustrates Jacobellis to be reminded of it all, internally she has embraced Shull\u2019s unusual advice: Do not try to put 2006 out of your mind, because that is impossible. Even in the starting gate, even in a gold medal race, if the thoughts creep to the memory of a long-ago fall, not the gauzy vision of the medal stand, seize them.\u201cWhat you want athletes to do is say, \u2018I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 \u201d Shull said. \u201cBecause they all are. And if they say it, they can use it. If they try to set it aside, it\u2019s lurking around them, interrupting what they normally know how to do.\u201dIt is the opposite of what many sports psychologists and coaches preach, which is to clear the mind and think only positive thoughts. To Shull, to pretend that negativity does not exist is as ridiculous as children holding hands over their ears and shouting \u201cnuh-nuh-nuh-nuh\u201d to avoid hearing what is being said.The results have been promising. Jacobellis, a 10-time gold medalist in boardercross at the X Games (which discontinued the event in 2017), won her fifth world championship last March and the first two World Cup events this season. She has reasserted herself as the favorite heading into the Olympics.\u201cHopefully these are all small positive steps, moving forward, that could potentially have things line up for me right for this one,\u201d Jacobellis said.Jacobellis and Shull mostly talk from distant time zones. They have met in person only a few times. They may be the odd couple of the Olympics.Shull hails from the financial world, having made a living as a trader and trading desk manager. But a deep interest in psychology (her master\u2019s thesis at the University of Chicago was on the neurobiology of Freud\u2019s Repetition Compulsion Theory) had her thinking about mind games on Wall Street, where the general rule is to take emotion out of decision making.Clients, she said, told her that her unusual views on confronting emotion, not ignoring it, helped with out-of-work diversions, too, like golf. A trading desk manager in Asia, Shull said, raced cars as a hobby, and one particularly fear-inducing turn on a racetrack consistently ruined his time.\u201cI said, \u2018O.K., as you go into that turn, I want you screaming in that car that you are terrified,\u2019 \u201d Shull said. \u201cWhat do you think happened? Fastest time ever. Coaches might have a heart attack if they heard a racer say that \u2014 literally, \u2018I\u2019m terrified, I\u2019m terrified, I\u2019m terrified.\u2019 But the chances that they win have gone way up. That contracts the energy in a way it becomes fuel. It focuses the energy.\u201dA colleague had a connection to the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, and Shull espoused her theories to coaches at a meeting in 2016. Afterward, she was approached by Foley. I think I have a client for you, he said: Lindsey Jacobellis.\u201cI didn\u2019t know her,\u201d Shull said. \u201cSo I Googled her.\u201dShe learned that Jacobellis grew up in Connecticut and, as a teenager, was an up-and-coming racer in the burgeoning sport of boardercross, where a pack of riders leaves the gate at once and navigates a high-speed roller coaster of a course, racing to the bottom amid the occasional carnage of collisions and crash landings.Her rise was timed perfectly. She was 20 when snowboard cross, as the Olympics called it, made its Olympic debut in 2006. Jacobellis was anointed, predictably, as a made-for-television sweetheart in a must-see new event, a favorite with cascading ringlets of blond hair and a smile that masked her competitive muscle.Then, in a moment, she became better known for falling than she would have for winning, the butt of jokes and even the target of animosity. She never really understood it. She tried to smile it away, but strangers seemed more bothered by the fall than she did. Wherever she went, the episode and the questions \u2014 How? Why? \u2014 followed her like a plume of snow.\u201cI don\u2019t think it has to do with the Olympics,\u201d she said that day in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s just on a fluke of when things work out for me and when they don\u2019t.\u201dHer longtime teammate Faye Gulini was more exacting.\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how much pressure is put on her,\u201d she said four years ago. \u201cIt breaks my heart because I think it takes the fun out of it for her. Just this event. She loves the sport. She\u2019s a phenomenal snowboarder. But it\u2019s in her head.\u201dShull\u2019s first conversation with Jacobellis in 2016 focused on 2006. Shull was one of the first people who did not try to convince Jacobellis that she should just get over it but instead said she should examine it.\u201cI was like, wait a minute \u2014 you were doing what teenagers do,\u201d Shull said. \u201cYou were defining yourself. \u2018Everyone expects me to be this perfect little golden girl who wins this gold medal,\u2019 and what do we all do as teenagers? For normal people, you change your major in college, or you date the wrong girl. You do something that\u2019s different than what everyone is telling you and expecting you to do.\u201dIt was a distinct echo of what Jacobellis said at the coffee shop that warm day not long ago.\u201cBreaking it down, it was almost this rebellious act,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what 19-year-old\u201d \u2014 she was 20 \u2014 \u201cdoesn\u2019t flirt with a little rebellion when they\u2019re growing up as an individual?\u201dOne of the dogs, a terrier mix named Gidget, stirred at her feet. Jacobellis continued.\u201cI had always been so disciplined, and then you get to that moment where you have a choice, and you almost don\u2019t want to do something that someone is forcing you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a little bit easier to forgive myself because now you understand, maybe, why you did something when you didn\u2019t know the rhyme or reason for it. It wasn\u2019t an insult to the country. It was just me being a teenager and trying to express myself and having fun snowboarding and being lost in the moment.\u201dShe smiled.\u201cIt was just something that happened,\u201d she said, conclusively. Gidget barked, as if for punctuation, or maybe an amen.Before the 2006 Winter Olympics, Jacobellis starred in a commercial for Visa. A fictional coach tried to calm her nerves.\u201cImagine yourself on the medal stand,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one can touch you.\u201dIt is the same positive-thinking mantra athletes routinely hear. Shull does not buy it. It\u2019s O.K., even helpful, she said, to be nervous at the starting gate, to hate a certain part of the course, to have memories of falling as the next finish line approaches. Just talk about it.Foley admitted that Shull\u2019s advice to Jacobellis can make him uneasy.\u201cThe more she deals with it, in some ways, that\u2019s hard work \u2014 you\u2019re not allowing yourself to ignore all the feelings you have, and that\u2019s got to be difficult,\u201d Foley said. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth a try. We\u2019ve been there a lot of times, and it hasn\u2019t gone how we wanted for Lindsey, so why not work hard like this and see where we can get?\u201dFoley said Shull was not \u201ca miracle cure\u201d and nixed the idea of her attending the Olympics, preferring that Jacobellis keep a relatively normal competition routine. But Jacobellis and Shull met in California for a couple of days just before Jacobellis left for South Korea. They expected to continue their long-distance sessions leading to Thursday, the day of the women\u2019s snowboard cross competition.Back in Encinitas, in another time and place, Jacobellis allowed herself to daydream about the Olympics. She admitted to a \u201cvery strong love-hate relationship\u201d with them.\u201cI\u2019m hoping that through all the years that I\u2019ve been doing this, that these things will all come together and help keep me calm and focused, and hopefully I\u2019ll come through,\u201d Jacobellis said.Soon she was gone, on her skateboard trailed by two dogs, thinking she might spend the afternoon surfing. The Winter Olympics, past and future, felt far away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "American ISIS Suspect Said He Wanted to Report From Syria, Filing Shows", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the man also insisted to his interrogators that he traveled to Syria intending to work as a journalist and was arrested, later agreeing to work for the Islamic State to gain release from prison, the document also showed. The court filing does not accuse him of having fought for the group.The document, made public late Wednesday, was a description of facts about the man\u2019s case as gathered by the F.B.I. While it did not make his name public, it lifted much of the secrecy with which the government has draped his case since acknowledging that a Syrian militia had captured him and transferred him to American custody.The capture of the citizen, and the Trump administration\u2019s decision to hold him in wartime detention as an enemy combatant, has revived a legal and policy debate about the scope of executive power and individual rights that had subsided since the Bush administration claimed a right to hold two American citizen terrorism suspects indefinitely and without trial. The Obama administration rejected that approach.The filing publicly acknowledged for the first time the basic outline of the man\u2019s life, which has been previously reported based on unnamed sources \u2014 including that he was born in the United States but raised in Saudi Arabia, where he is a dual citizen \u2014 while filling in many new details about him.They include that he attended college in Louisiana \u2014 apparently studying electrical engineering \u2014 but did not earn a degree there. He is married and has a 3-year-old daughter, and he took two trips to the United States in 2014, shortly after her birth, in an effort to register her as an American citizen.The filing also contends he likely went to Syria in 2014 for several months and then returned there in March 2015. It says that he lied to the F.B.I. about several details, noting that travel records contradict his account of how long he was in the United States. And it cites Twitter posts and YouTube and Google searches that it portrays as indicating that he was a supporter of the Islamic State.Last September, as the Islamic State\u2019s self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq was collapsing, the man was captured by a Syrian militia at a checkpoint and identified himself as an American citizen before being turned over to the United States military. The filing said he was carrying $4,200 in American currency, a Global Positioning System device, a Quran, thumb drives with numerous files about weapons, and \u2014 in an odd detail it did not explain \u2014 a scuba mask and snorkel.The evidence \u201cis more than enough to carry the government\u2019s burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner is part of or substantially supported ISIL and is thus properly detained as an enemy combatant,\u201d the filing said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a habeas corpus lawsuit challenging the man\u2019s detention, winning a right to speak with him and gain his consent to represent him. It is asking a Federal District Court judge to order the Justice Department to either charge him with a crime or release him.People familiar with the case have said that the government lacks sufficient courtroom-admissible evidence to charge the man. Although he spoke freely during an initial interrogation conducted for intelligence purposes \u2014 a summary of that conversation is attached to the new court filing \u2014 he stopped talking and asked for a lawyer after being warned of his Miranda rights for a law-enforcement interrogation.The Trump administration is now trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to take custody of him, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. A judge has ordered the government to give the A.C.L.U. three days notice before any such transfer so that he could challenge it, if he wants \u2014 an order the Justice Department is appealing.Meanwhile, the underlying case is continuing. In a filing rebutting the government\u2019s factual account, the A.C.L.U. argued for a more favorable interpretation of the disputed facts about the scope and meaning of his involvement with the Islamic State, which is also called ISIS.In an interview on Thursday, Jonathan Hafetz, the lead A.C.L.U. lawyer on the case, maintained that the Trump administration lacked the legal authority to keep holding his client indefinitely in military custody.\u201cThe government has made numerous allegations which are inaccurate and misleading in many respects,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fundamental flaw in its position is that it has no legal authority to hold this citizen in military custody. If the government wants to detain him, it needs to charge him with a crime. Otherwise it must release him.\u201dBut the Justice Department filing argued that the government has legal authority to hold Islamic State members as wartime detainees \u2014 even if they are citizens. It cited laws enacted by Congress in 2001 and 2002 to authorize using military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and Saddam Hussein-era Iraq, saying they cover the Islamic State. That theory was first put forward by the Obama administration and has been disputed, but no court has ruled on whether it is correct.The Justice Department\u2019s court filing also backstopped that theory by claiming that President Trump, as commander in chief, wields inherent constitutional authority, independent of any act of Congress, to detain wartime enemies when they are captured on a battlefield where American forces are fighting.That claim recalled sweeping assertions of executive power made by the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11 attacks. The Obama administration shied away from invoking purported commander-in-chief powers \u2014 instead generally relying only on congressional statutes \u2014 but it also did not disavow them.Advertisement"}

We just have to rifle through a few crossword entries to locate them.Mr. Black offers us a set of three seemingly disparate theme entries and a revealer at 59A.This is a nice way to start our solving week, although I wonder if circling or shading the credit card name squares might have made this more of a Monday.22A: What an odd clue for a Monday. The actor John RITTER was way better known for \u201cThree\u2019s Company,\u201d \u201cAlly McBeal\u201d and as the voice of \u201cClifford, the Big Red Dog\u201d than he was for a movie that didn\u2019t do very well and came out nearly 30 years ago to boot. \u201cActor John of \u2018Problem Child\u2019\u201d strikes me as more of a mid-to-late-week clue.48A: Saying a silent \u201cthank you\u201d that this wasn\u2019t BETOGAED. TOGAED is not a great entry, but if you\u2019ve seen the classic college life movie \u201cAnimal House,\u201d you will get this.4D: The reggae artist INI Kamoze is one to know, not just because of his danceable music, but also because of his crossword-worthy name.A lot has happened since my last publication \u2014 I became a father, I made my way on air as a news anchor and sports announcer, and I met Will Shortz.Since I have more on my plate nowadays, I don\u2019t submit as often as I once did, but if a good idea crosses my mind, I will try to put it to paper.This idea just sort of popped into my head one day. I thought it was worth trying it out, but admittedly, I had trouble figuring out theme answers for VISA and DISCOVER. Maybe ELVIS ANDRUS for VISA? Maybe if this were a crossword in \u201cBaseball Digest.\u201dTruth is, the suggestion box under the Google search bar is what really helped me with these two. I began typing \u201cELVIS A\u201d to see what would come up and did the same for \u201cDISCO VER.\u201d The results I found seemed like legit answers, and Will apparently agreed.A couple of cool things I realized recently with this puzzle: By total coincidence, the TEX in VORTEX crosses into RITTER, which is neat. Also by total coincidence, PAPI is at 34-Down, and Big Papi\u2019s number was 34 (my favorite jersey number).Oh, and I\u2019m sure there will be nit-pickers out there who will find fault in my lack of MASTER CARD, but that just wasn\u2019t going to happen. As the commercial says, that\u2019s for everything else.Thanks for helping me find my cards, Mr. Black.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Poisons Are in Your Body?", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "Advertisement\nSurprised? So was I when I had my urine tested for these chemicals. (A urine or blood test is needed to confirm whether you have been exposed.)Let me stress that mine should have been clean.Believe me, the scariest horror stories are found in urology journals. If you\u2019re a man, you don\u2019t wring your hands as you read; you clutch your crotch.So I\u2019ve tried for years now to limit my exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Following the advice of the President\u2019s Cancer Panel, I eat organic to reduce exposure to endocrine disruptors in pesticides. I try to store leftover meals in glass containers, not plastic. I avoid handling A.T.M. and gas station receipts. I try to avoid flame-retardant furniture.Those are all common sources of toxic endocrine disruptors, so I figured that my urine would test pristine. Pure as a mountain creek.As I waited for the lab results, I continued to follow the latest research. One researcher sent a bizarre video of a mouse exposed to a common endocrine disruptor doing back flips nonstop, as a kind of nervous tic.Finally, I heard back from Silent Spring Institute. I figured this was a report card I had aced. I avoid all that harmful stuff. In my columns, I had advised readers how to avoid it.Sure enough, I had a low level of BPA, best known because plastic bottles now often boast \u201cBPA Free.\u201dBut even a diligent student like me failed the test. Badly. I had high levels of a BPA substitute called BPF. Ruthann Rudel, a toxicologist who is the head of research at Silent Spring, explained that companies were switching to BPF even though it may actually be yet more harmful (it takes longer for the body to break it down). BPF is similar to that substance that made those mice do back flips.Sigh. I thought I was being virtuous by avoiding plastics with BPA, but I may have been causing my body even more damage.My urine had an average level of an endocrine disruptor called triclosan, possibly from soap or toothpaste. Like most people, I also had chlorinated phenols (perhaps from mothballs in my closet).I had a high level of a flame retardant called triphenyl phosphate, possibly from a floor finish, which may be \u201cneurotoxic.\u201d Hmm. Whenever you see flaws in my columns, that\u2019s just my neurotoxins at work.Will these endocrine disruptors give me cancer? Make me obese? Make my genitals fall off? Nobody really knows. At least I haven\u2019t started doing random back flips yet.Yet my takeaway is also that chemical industry lobbyists have rigged the system so that we consumers just can\u2019t protect ourselves adequately.They are running the show, and we consumers are their lab mice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corporate America Is Suppressing Wages for Many Workers", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsEven after eight years of economic recovery and steady private-sector job growth, wages for most Americans have hardly budged. It is tempting to think that wage stagnation is intractable, a result of long-term trends, like automation and globalization, that government is powerless to do anything about.In fact, a growing body of evidence pins much of the blame on a specific culprit, one for which proven legal weapons already exist. But they are not being used.The culprit is \u201cmonopsony power.\u201d This term is used by economists to refer to the ability of an employer to suppress wages below the efficient or perfectly competitive level of compensation. In the more familiar case of monopoly, a large seller \u2014 like a cable company \u2014 is able to demand high prices for poor service because consumers have no other choice. It turns out that many corporations possess bargaining power over their workers, not just over their consumers. Their workers accept low wages and substandard working conditions because few alternative job opportunities exist for them or because switching jobs is costly. In other words, in the labor market, effectively a small number of employers are competing for their labor.The studies show that common features of the labor market give enormous bargaining advantages to employers. Because most people sink roots in their communities, they are reluctant to quit their job and move to a job that is far away. Because workplaces differ in terms of their location and conditions, people have trouble comparing them, which means that one cannot easily \u201ccomparison shop\u201d for jobs. And thanks to a wave of consolidation, industries are increasingly dominated by a small number of huge companies, which means that workers have fewer choices among employers in their area.When employers exercise monopsonistic power, wages are suppressed, jobs are left unfilled, and economic growth suffers. Unions used to offset employer monopsony power, but unions now represent only 7 percent of private sector workers, down from a peak of 35 percent in the 1950s. Combating the practices that employers use to monopsonize the labor market can lead to higher wages, more jobs and faster economic growth.While the movement against no-poaching agreements is a good first step, much more can be done to counter monopsonistic practices. First, the Justice Department and the courts need to make clear that no-poaching agreements are illegal even when they take place within franchises. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker are preparing to propose such a bill next week.Second, Congress should bar employers from subjecting low-income workers to noncompete clauses. These clauses serve no lawful business purpose when workers do not receive substantial training, while they cause significant hardship. A few states ban or significantly restrict noncompetes, but the federal government must step in.Antitrust reform to address labor market abuses is one of those rare issues that could secure bipartisan agreement. Democrats should support reform because it would help workers and lower-income families. Antitrust violations are also counter to the free-market ideals that Republicans claim to hold.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s review the week\u2019s tech news.All this got me wondering: What\u2019s the point of cable TV anymore?For a time, cutting the cord was one of those hipster affectations that came with sacrifices. A kind of asceticism was implied in the name. The cord, the familiar cable bundle of yore, required paying a whole lot for a bunch of bad TV you\u2019d never watch, just so you could have very convenient access to the handful of shows you sometimes did watch.Then along came DVDs and the internet, and now you could unbundle \u2014 you\u2019d pay a lot less for just the things you really wanted to see, provided you were O.K. hazarding some minor inconveniences.But as Netflix keeps driving trucks of money to TV\u2019s top producers \u2014 it plans to spend $8 billion on new content this year \u2014 the script has flipped. More and more, it\u2019s the people who haven\u2019t cut the cord who are missing out. Today, if you subscribe just to regular TV and don\u2019t bother with Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other online services, you\u2019re missing some of TV\u2019s biggest and most acclaimed shows. Plus, you\u2019re paying more.Cable subscriptions have been declining for years, and last year the decline accelerated. But the YouTube expansion shows that cutting the cord keeps getting easier, and the Netflix deal shows how non-cable services keep getting more attractive. This suggests an even faster pace of decline for cable. The bottom is going to fall out of the market, probably very soon.Chrome, Google\u2019s popular web browser, can now block ads. This seems weird because Google is the internet\u2019s largest advertising company. So how does an advertising company design ad-blocking software? Very, very carefully, it turns out, in a process rife with conflicts.So Google\u2019s new ad blocker is designed to block some ads, not all of them. The software will eliminate a dozen types of ads that the company deems intrusive or disruptive. But most ads, including most from Google, would skate through just fine.It\u2019s an interesting fight, but it may also be an irrelevant one. What\u2019s unclear is whether Google\u2019s limited ad blocker will stem the rising popularity of more restrictive ad blockers. For many people who hate online ads, it could already be too late for half measures.The New York Times\u2019s tech reporting team is gathering in San Francisco this week for a team-building offsite. I\u2019m looking forward to forgetting to catch Mike Isaac in a trust fall. We\u2019ll also be talking about some of the major themes we\u2019re aiming to cover in the tech world this year \u2014 artificial intelligence, crypto and the responsibility of tech companies, for example.But enough about us.

And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone X shows.\u2014 Peter EavisWith the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation.They may want to keep fretting, though.Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday.

But it\u2019s also unexpected because the revealer is an odd phrase, and not necessarily the way this particular gift is usually presented.The circled or shaded squares in each corner of the puzzles spell out the word ROSE. Usually, when we see a word formed in highlighted squares in different orders, it\u2019s a hint that the revealer will have something to do with mixing things up, but that\u2019s not the case today. They\u2019re just scrambled for no reason, like this:However, they are in \u201cboxes\u201d because they are, as the central revealers at 41- and 44A tell us, BOXED ROSES. I\u2019ve received long-stemmed roses that came in a box before, but I don\u2019t recall anyone referring to them as BOXED ROSES.In subtheme material news, Mr. Haight includes two long Down answers that are clued as puns on familiar phrases. These are cute. HAVE A HEART is clued as \u201cTry some Valentine\u2019s Day candy?\u201d and STEAL A KISS is clued as \u201cTry some Valentine\u2019s Day candy, sneakily?\u201dThere are some entries in here that seem tougher than your average Tuesday puzzle, like ARIKARA and MT. OSSA, but I did like I BELIEVE SO, ALMA MATER (clued cleverly as \u201cOld school\u201d), GO SIDEWAYS and MURSES (the last two make their New York Times debuts today).5A: Every time I see a clue that uses the word \u201ccourses,\u201d I think of school courses. Of course, it could also be food courses, and if you have enough of them, they add up to a MEAL (the answer is MEALS in the puzzle because of the plural clue.)8D: \u201cThe \u2018her\u2019 in the lyric \u2018I met her in a club down in old Soho\u2019\u201d has to be LOLA, right? L-O-L-A LOLA.33D: Wordplay alert! \u201cCommercial success?\u201d is not about being successful on the commercial market. It\u2019s about selling ad space, and the answer is AD SALE.I remember deciding to try to find some kind of boxed thing to use as a puzzle theme. No new ideas were popping up on the XwordInfo list. I went to Google and typed in \u201cboxed,\u201d then I tried one letter after another till I got to \u201cr,\u201d and boxed roses showed up. It didn\u2019t Google very well, but there were lots of pretty pictures of boxed roses, so it seemed commercially significant. I was pretty lucky to be able to stack the two words, and super lucky when HAVE A HEART popped up randomly on the fill. STEAL A KISS was a great sidekick, but ARIKARA was a bitter pill to swallow. It was nice that their tribe had just \u201cstarred\u201d in \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d but it\u2019s still pretty rough sledding for a Tuesday.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Crazy Idea for Funding Local News: Charge People for It", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe plan, for any would-be entrepreneur brave enough to try it, goes like this: Hire some very good journalists; just one or two are O.K. to start. Turn them loose on a large metropolitan area \u2014 try San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston or any other city going through waves of change, and whose local press has been gutted by digital disruption.Have your reporters cover stuff that no one else is covering, and let them ignore stuff that everyone else is covering. Don\u2019t do movie reviews, stock market analysis, Super Bowl coverage or anything else that isn\u2019t local. Instead, emphasize coverage that\u2019s actionable, that residents deem necessary and valuable for short- and long-term planning \u2014 especially an obsessive focus on housing and development, transportation, education and local politics.Package it all in a form that commands daily attention \u2014 probably a morning email newsletter \u2014 and sprinkle it with a sense of community, like offline and online networking events for readers.How will you fund all of this? This is the most important part: Shun advertising. Instead, ask readers to pay for it with real money \u2014 $5 or $10 a month, or perhaps even more. It will take time, but if you build it right, you just might create the next great metropolitan news organization.This plan may sound simplistic, almost like a joke. Wait, Sherlock, your big idea is to create a really good product and charge people money for it? Haven\u2019t people tried this before?Less than you might think. The short history of digital media is lousy with advertising, which promotes all the wrong incentives for online news \u2014 volume over curation, aggregation over original coverage, speed over accuracy.Yet few entrepreneurs have jumped on the subscription bandwagon for local news. The reluctance makes sense; local markets are by definition small, and journalism is expensive.But after studying Ms. Lessin\u2019s and Mr. Thompson\u2019s methods, I suspect there\u2019s a market for subscription-based local coverage. Someone just has to build it.How? Consider Ms. Lessin\u2019s plan for The Information, the tech news service she started in 2013 after spending eight years at The Wall Street Journal. Back then, online subscriptions seemed antiquated; many companies had experimented with charging users, but most had failed to win large numbers of subscribers, and the big money in media was in ad-supported sites aiming for rapid expansion through viral traffic.\u201cPeople thought no one would pay for news, especially tech news,\u201d Ms. Lessin told me last month. \u201cThe problem was the news business hadn\u2019t been focused on a key question: How do I deliver a differentiated product that people would pay for?\u201dHer idea for differentiation was to charge a lot for The Information \u2014 a subscription is $399 a year, close to what The Wall Street Journal charges for print delivery \u2014 but she would offer readers quality instead of volume.The Information publishes just two or three stories a day, often scoops and analysis, including a handy daily roundup of the most important stories in tech that day.Mr. Thompson\u2019s overhead is low: He is the only writer of Stratechery, which has become required reading among tech executives and many others in the industry. He declined to divulge any subscriber numbers, other than to say he\u2019s doing very well.A high-priced subscription site may well have a natural audience ceiling. Ms. Lessin declined to divulge her subscriber base but said it was \u201csignificantly north of 10,000,\u201d which is lower than the audience for many ad-based digital publications.Sure, there are reasons to be skeptical that this model could work in local news. Many subscribers to The Information and Stratechery think of the publications as a business expense \u2014 they work in tech or finance, wealthy industries that will pay just about anything for business intelligence.Yet there are striking overlaps between what those publications do and what a subscription-based local news start-up would look like. For one thing, a lot of those wealthy people also live in undercovered urban and suburban areas; if they\u2019re paying for news about tech, wouldn\u2019t they also pay for in-depth investigations into their kids\u2019 school district, their city\u2019s mayoral race or the traffic clogging their commute?There\u2019s also the opportunity to pay for a sense of community. The Information \u2014 through the Slack chat service, conference calls and in-person meet-ups \u2014 constantly brings subscribers together to talk about the industry. A local news start-up could do the same, selling not just news but a sense of belonging.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the subscription news business, you\u2019re not selling articles,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Why do they pay?\u201cNews happens in tech every day, and I do the thinking for them,\u201d he said. A subscription-based local news business would offer the same value: \u201cYou\u2019re selling people a feeling of being informed, of being good citizens \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re selling.\u201dNow we just need someone to build it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Books to Help You Understand Millennials and Beyond", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistWhen will someone stick up for millennials? We have been sheltered by our parents, swindled by our universities, deadened by our therapists, and for all this our reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press. Rising to our defense is Harris (our peer, born 1988, as the book\u2019s cover notes), a familiar provocateur from the internet\u2019s left flank. Harris contends that America has stiffed our generation, filling childhoods with homework and extracurricular activities. All of this ostensibly served to prepare us for college and fruitful careers, when really all it resulted in was the \u201calmost inevitable heartbreak\u201d of falling short of our parents\u2019 expectations and ours.Harris spins a recognizable story of a hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages. He uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork. And for what? \u201cEvery authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we could, and we did, but the market hasn\u2019t held up its end of the bargain.\u201dHe brings a fresh, contrarian eye to some of the usual data points. He sees in the Obama-era nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but \u201ca goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand.\u201d For rising tuition costs at America\u2019s public universities, he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures. He argues that millennials\u2019 deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors, who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers. He also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and YouTube stars. And he makes a surprising case that sexting isn\u2019t as harmful as it\u2019s cracked up to be.As generational advocates go, we could do worse than Harris. But he ends his book with a fatalism nearly as flippant as the generational critiques he loathes. Despite this moment of political fellowship among millennials, he writes off the possibility of meaningful change coming from government or social movements once we take over. I\u2019m not optimistic myself, no, but what is our generation if not rich in skills we may yet put to good use?Eler, who is the visual arts critic for The Star Tribune in Minnesota and also a millennial, has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy, self-expression and sex. In the selfie she finds \u201can aspirational image\u201d essential to \u201cbeing seen by others online.\u201d She sees the selfie as a lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem; she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes. And not all selfie-takers, she proves, are as oblivious as imagined.Unfortunately, Eler\u2019s book would have benefited from a more careful edit. Her discursive style is sometimes whimsical, but mostly distracting. She dwells on a topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie-related stories. Fake news in the 2016 election gets at least seven pages; the macaque who took a selfie and then saw PETA sue for his copyright gets just two. She provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad Tinder conversations but glosses over the July 2016 Facebook Live stream by Diamond Reynolds after her husband, Philando Castile, was shot by the police. And while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well, a section on social-media surveillance at Standing Rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting a meeting she had over coffee with a protester.In spite of its flaws, though, Eler\u2019s book alights on the source of the selfie\u2019s power: It is the easiest way to assert one\u2019s humanity in our hyper-networked world. Perhaps our much-fussed-over narcissism is not a flaw but a survival tactic.Her new \u201ciGen\u201d pities rather than disdains those born after 1995, arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled a new generation with profound psychological problems, including sleep deprivation, depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear. They drink less and have less sex; they socialize less without their parents present; they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall; they eschew church and even spirituality; they kill themselves more (but others less); they wait longer to get drivers\u2019 licenses and give birth. Twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students, which she supplements with first-person accounts from members of iGen. She concludes by offering this advice: \u201cDo not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of yourself. It is not your lover. Do not continuously turn your attention to it when you are talking with someone in person. It is not your best friend.\u201dTwenge is right to highlight smartphones\u2019 contributions to our malaise. In one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from a text sent without an immediate response, and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less in-person socializing, which breeds loneliness.She could stand to incorporate some of Harris\u2019s alarm about the economy. She duly recognizes income inequality as a prime source of iGen\u2019s anxiety about its future. But while she discusses how smartphones do their harm, she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market. Instead she tells marketers how to exploit iGen\u2019s diminished expectations, which struck me as tacky and not particularly useful, besides. The kids may spend too much time on their phones, but they know better than to trust brands.Jack Dickey, a 27-year-old millennial, is a staff writer for Sports Illustrated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Good Paperback Vibrations", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayLike a teakettle, my libido whistled before it screamed. As a preteen I walked the white sand beaches of Naples, Fla., where my family had moved from West Virginia. I scanned not for seashells but for the titles of paperbacks splayed on beach chairs and sandy towels. The covers were spotted with suntan oil and vibrated with the promise of occult knowledge. Mario Puzo\u2019s \u201cThe Godfather\u201d stood out. So did Judith Krantz\u2019s \u201cScruples,\u201d John Jakes\u2019s \u201cThe Bastard\u201d and Jean Auel\u2019s \u201cThe Clan of the Cave Bear.\u201d Over the next few years, like a flying ray, I pounced on copies of each.I\u2019d abandoned the books by J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis that my friends were pushing. Too woo-woo for me. I felt a stab of recognition when as an adult I read, in the playwright David Hare\u2019s memoir, the following: \u201cI couldn\u2019t give a damn who found the rabbit\u2019s foot or the magic mug, or where it was buried. The self-importance got up my nose. Anything valuable to be uncovered was likely to lie in the everyday, the specific.\u201d The valuable if strange things I would uncover, between soft covers, at too tender an age, would be about sex.The sex in the best-selling novels of the 1970s, and in the five years before and after that decade, was wilder and more insistent than it is in the popular fiction of today. You could typically boil a plot down to four salient points:1) I want it.2) How am I going to get it?3) I got it.4) How am I going to get it again?I\u2019ve not spent a great deal of time on psychiatrists\u2019 couches, but were I to hire one in earnest I suspect I\u2019d fill the initial sessions talking about my early paperback reading.You\u2019ve seen Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cGodfather\u201d movies. Have you read Puzo\u2019s novel, which was published in 1969? I was about to discover that it contains an extended subplot about a woman, Lucy Mancini, whose sex organs are so roomy that I feared someone would fall into them, as if they were an immense cannoli.Poor Lucy goes to see a leering doctor, who tells her awful things like, \u201cStop thinking in your head that you have a big box no man can love\u201d and \u201cBaby, I\u2019m going to build you a whole new thing down there\u201d and \u2014 vastly worse than the phrase \u201cstop thinking in your head\u201d \u2014 \u201cthen I\u2019ll try it out personally.\u201dSize is everything in Puzo\u2019s world. Sonny Corleone possesses a penis so titanic that his wife reports:I was an altar boy at St. Ann\u2019s Catholic Church. I began to think harder about the reasons people came to light candles.In Krantz\u2019s novel \u201cScruples\u201d (1978), there\u2019s a lot of rough sex of the \u201cplunged up into her savagely\u201d variety, even if no one calls anything macaroni. The \u201csecret smell\u201d of a man\u2019s \u201cpouchy globes\u201d was important to her characters. I wondered if I should up my hygiene game. \u201cUntil a woman has smelled a man precisely there, she thought, driftingly, she can\u2019t know him,\u201d Krantz wrote. The phrase \u201cshe thought, driftingly,\u201d can be mentally applied, by the way, to every sentence Krantz wrote.\u201cScruples\u201d alerted me to the international lesbian cabal. I suspected it was like the Shriners Club, to which my grandfather belonged, but with better fezzes. Krantz wrote about Harriet Toppingham, a fashion editor and a woman of \u201cuncompromising ugliness\u201d:\u201cThey had no means of knowing that Harriet was a member of the most hidden of all major sexual subgroups, an international network of middle-aged and powerful lesbians, women who range from the late 30s to the early 60s, women in high positions of authority or fame, all of whom know each other or know of each other, whether they live in New York, London, Paris or Los Angeles.\u201dThis passage inserted two questions into my mind: What are the other major sexual subgroups? And: How can I meet lesbians?An underrated book, among the mad pop masterpieces of the 1970s, is David Seltzer\u2019s novelization of \u201cThe Omen\u201d (1976). It\u2019s based on his own screenplay for the movie, about an adopted boy who, bad luck for everyone involved, is the Antichrist.Early on one man watches another perform a \u201cstrange and repulsive ritual\u201d \u2014 urinating onto his hands and washing his genitals with the urine. The man turns and says: \u201cTaught me this in the R.A.F. It\u2019s as good as penicillin.\u201d I tucked this information, curiously omitted from the Boy Scout Handbook, into my pocket.\u201cThe Omen\u201d explains how much people, especially men, like to hit each other. Sexual pleasure derived from beatings was a topic that would turn up again and again in these novels. In \u201cThe Omen,\u201d a missionary named Edgardo Emilio Tassone \u2014 who had \u201cthe fear of God literally beaten into him\u201d as a boy \u2014 goes to work in a \u201csoutheast corner of Africa.\u201d On Page 95, I read, squirming:\u201cHe beat them as he was beaten and came to realize that in the heat of religious ecstasy he took sexual pleasure in their pain. Among the young African converts, one came to worship him, and they shared carnal pleasure, defiling the primitive laws of Man and God. The boy\u2019s name was Tobu, of the Kikuyu tribe. When he and Tassone were found together, the boy was ceremonially mutilated, his scrotum opened and his testicles removed; the boy was forced to eat them while his warrior brothers looked on. Tassone himself barely escaped, word reaching him in Somalia that the Kikuyu had seized a Franciscan monk and skinned him alive in Tassone\u2019s stead. After skinning him, they made him walk until he finally fell dead.\u201d To this day I can stand to read, just barely, most torture scenes in novels. But I cannot read even a sentence about flaying. (\u201cLast week I saw a woman flayed,\u201d Jonathan Swift wrote in \u201cA Tale of a Tub,\u201d \u201cand you will hardly believe how much it altered her person for the worst.\u201d)Let\u2019s close with Auel\u2019s \u201cThe Clan of the Cave Bear\u201d (1980), possibly the worst novel I\u2019ve read all the way through. In it, a Neanderthal named Broud moves in on a young woman named Ayla and starts clouting her. It\u2019s a turn-on, so he keeps clouting. \u201cNever had he felt so stimulated \u2014 violence increased his passion and lust added force to his blows.\u201d He finished with a \u201cfinal agonized scream.\u201dWith a final agonized scream of my own, I put these books away. I would come to miss their exuberance if little else. My gateway drug, in terms of finding better fiction to read, was Scott Spencer\u2019s blessedly good 1979 novel \u201cEndless Love.\u201d No macaroni. No pouchy globes. No clouting. Just beautiful, hot, honest sex writing about, in his words, \u201cthat terror you experience when the possibilities of your life begin to match with the full range of your desire.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mexico Spyware Inquiry Bogs Down. Skeptics Aren\u2019t Surprised.", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 American officials have rebuffed repeated requests from Mexico to help investigate the use of government spying technology against innocent civilians, wary that Mexico wants to use the United States as cover in a sham inquiry, senior American officials say.The Mexican government has been on the defensive for months, battling revelations that surveillance technology it acquired has been used to spy on some of the nation\u2019s most prominent human rights lawyers, academics and journalists.But after reviewing the request, American officials decided not to get involved, leery that the Mexican government had little interest in actually solving the case because a serious investigation might implicate some of its most powerful figures, senior American officials said.In particular, American officials were worried that the Mexicans would try to trumpet the involvement of the United States to lend an appearance of credibility to a whitewash, the officials said.After it became clear that the technology had been used much more broadly than that, the Mexicans sent a list of questions to American law enforcement officials to show their seriousness about investigating.But the questions required no more than a basic computer science degree to answer, one American official said. The Mexican government \u2014 which operated the surveillance technology itself \u2014 was more than capable of solving the case on its own if it wanted to, the official said.The F.B.I. declined to comment.There are many potential reasons Mexican officials, if they were serious about investigating, might want American help, even if they did not necessarily need it. The Mexican public is deeply suspicious of its government, so the participation of American law enforcement officials could help build trust in the findings.But more than six months after the investigation was announced, some of the American concerns appear to be bearing out, according to victims of the spying and their lawyers, who have had access to the case files.The government inquiry has failed to make headway in many basic areas, they contend. Prosecutors handling the case have yet to question any of the officials responsible for operating the surveillance technology, according to the victims\u2019 lawyers and their review of the case file.The Mexican government declined to offer specific comments on the investigation but said it remains \u201cin the phase of exhausting different lines of investigation.\u201d It also said that it had been in constant contact with the group of forensic analysts that first discovered the existence of the spyware, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs, and that it had sought counsel from other national and international experts.The Citizen Lab seemed taken aback by the assertion.\u201cThat\u2019s a surprising statement, given that we have had exactly one meeting with them and have received no further follow-up,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher there. He said the Citizen Lab answered the government\u2019s questions at that meeting, in October, and even suggested a list of evidence to preserve for the investigation.The spying software, known as Pegasus, infiltrates smartphones to monitor every detail of a person\u2019s cellular life \u2014 calls, texts, email, contacts and calendars. It can even use the microphone and camera on phones for surveillance, turning a target\u2019s smartphone into a personal bug.But investigators have not even identified the government employees who operate the technology, or visited the offices where the spying operation was conducted, according to interviews with the victims and their lawyers and the the case files.Prosecutors have for now also declined to examine the servers used by the officials who operated the spying technology, according to the case files and the lawyers. Those servers, according to cyber-forensic analysts and the Israeli manufacturers of the spyware, would contain a record of every attempted hack on every single target.\u201cIt is highly likely that the political actors who were using this software are now keeping this investigation from making any progress at all,\u201d said Mario Ignacio \u00c1lvarez, a former deputy at the nation\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cThis is still a country where it is better to pray to the Virgin of Guadalupe for justice than to the authorities.\u201dThat is not to say that the case file is empty. It already stands several feet tall, stacked with sheaths of documents. But they are often as pointless as they are copious, lawyers for the victims of the spying contend.Investigators have included printouts of basic Google searches related to the case, including some of the victims\u2019 Facebook pages. And the bulk of the file is dedicated to the rolling responses from about 2,000 municipalities that were asked by prosecutors if they possessed the software. The requests include townships of fewer than 500 people with annual budgets that are a fraction of the roughly $80 million that the Mexican government spent to purchase the surveillance system.\u201cOnce more we have entered into a bureaucratic labyrinth that will take us nowhere,\u201d said Leopoldo Maldonado, a lawyer for a journalist protection group, Article 19, which is representing several victims in the case. \u201cThis is not a serious investigation.\u201dOne of the documents contained in the case file, according to those who have reviewed it, is an admission by the nation\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office that it purchased the software. But the prosecutors assigned to solving the case are employed by the attorney general\u2019s office \u2014 offering little hope to the spying victims that the agency will vigorously investigate itself.\u201cWe knew from the beginning that it would be very hard to have a real investigation, but this is a clear demonstration of the lack of an independent system in Mexico,\u201d said Carmen Aristegui, one of Mexico\u2019s most renowned journalists, who endured dozens of hacking attempts using the Pegasus spyware. \u201cWe are the political targets of a government that combats its critics with illegal tools.\u201dLawyers for the victims have taken the government to court, hoping to force a more thorough inquiry.In written responses to the suit, prosecutors say they are waiting for the opportune moment to review the servers and question participants in the hacking program, but have not refused outright to do so.They also claim that the cutting-edge malware does not allow them to track the targets, according to documents in the case file. \u201cThe software has no reporting function that offers a registry of numbers that might have been intercepted,\u201d according to the file.But this is at odds with the description of the spyware given to The Times last year by its manufacturer, the NSO Group. Officials at the company said the contracts were based on a specific number of spying targets, and that the system installed on site at the government agency tracked every time it was used.Even critics accustomed to the Kabuki dance of independent investigations in Mexico, where officials publicly promise to root out corruption but do little to punish the culprits, have expressed surprise. To some, the lack of an investigation is almost as worrisome as the spying itself.Prosecutors insist they need the phones of the spying victims to proceed with their investigation.But forensic experts \u2014 as well as victims of the spyware in Panama, where the former president has been charged with illegal espionage \u2014 say the target\u2019s phone is unnecessary to conduct an inquiry. The servers, they say, are all that is really required.One of the most glaring omissions in the file, the victims\u2019 lawyers say, is the contract that the Attorney General\u2019s office signed with the software manufacturer. While some of that and other material is secret for reasons of national security, the government says, there are other leads that prosecutors appear to have ignored.For instance, they have not questioned the individual in charge of the division that used the spyware, Tom\u00e1s Zer\u00f3n, a close ally of the president, according to the case files and the lawyers. The office, known as the Criminal Investigation Agency, was run by Mr. Zeron at the time of the hacking.Mr. Zer\u00f3n, through an aide, declined to comment.Independent groups, meanwhile, appear to be making some progress in unearthing details about the purchase of the software.This month, the group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity said it had discovered a link between an individual who was working for the Attorney General\u2019s office and the company that sold the software to the law enforcement agency.Salvador Camarena, an investigative editor with Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity, whose team has been looking into the companies associated with the sale, was himself a target of spying. But unlike other victims, he chose not to file a complaint with the government.\u201cI saw it as a waste of time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy on earth would they want to investigate themselves?\u201dBut in recent weeks, Mr. Camarena decided to file a complaint to review what the government had done.\u201cIt was journalistic curiosity,\u201d he said, \u201cto see what I could find out about who targeted me.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Happens When Athletes Do the Sportswriting?", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "FeatureThe Players\u2019 Tribune, a pet project of Derek Jeter\u2019s, allows the stars to tell their own stories. It\u2019s occasionally great \u2014 but is it journalism?Supported byBoston\u2019s callousness shocked people. ESPN broke news with details of back-room negotiations. The Boston Globe celebrated Thomas\u2019s bond to the city. FiveThirtyEight quantified the trade\u2019s impact on the Celtics\u2019 win-share probabilities. Barstool Sports posted a meme implying the Cavs\u2019 J.R. Smith \u2014 a man known to enjoy life \u2014 would be too high to notice his team had swapped starting guards. It was an onslaught of facts, justifications, adjusted advanced-analytics projections and bits. But no amount of coverage could ever fully account for such an unexpected transaction.Then, in early September, in a first-person essay for a website called The Players\u2019 Tribune, Thomas filled in the gaps: How he wanted to hang up on the Celtics general manager, Danny Ainge; how he broke the news to his two young sons; how, after some time, he forced himself to accept that his Boston ascendancy was done. Sports fans had long ago ceased to expect access to the intimate concerns of superstar players: They were too famous, too rich, too big. But here was access not just to the life of a star but also to the star\u2019s internal monologue. The Celtics front office had revealed that they saw Thomas as a mere asset \u2014 fungible, mobile, dispensable \u2014 and he responded by demonstrating his singularity. \u201cWhen I say this hurts, man, just know that it isn\u2019t because of anything anyone else did,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s only because of something I did. I fell in love with Boston.\u201d Reading it, I damn near cried.Thomas\u2019s article, more than any other in the site\u2019s history, underscored the elemental purpose of The Players\u2019 Tribune. Founded in October 2014 by the former Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter, along with the sports-marketing executive Jaymee Messler, the company\u2019s principle was that pro athletes were in dire need of an outlet in which to express themselves. Here, the athletes would be writing their own stories.The Players\u2019 Tribune originally gave athletes newsroom titles: David Ortiz, the jolly Red Sox slugger, was editor at large; Matt Harvey, the Mets hurler, was New York City bureau chief. On Twitter, jokes about Kobe Bryant \u2014 the editorial director! \u2014 flourished. Just imagine him screaming in the face of a middle reliever about a missing nut graf. For sports media, it was a way to grin in the face of the prickly existential fear they\u2019d lived with ever since social media forever changed their industry. Twitter and Instagram had already conditioned athletes to communicate with the public directly. Might they, the middlemen and middlewomen, one day be cut out altogether? Wouldn\u2019t athletes simply tell the same tales of humdrum perseverance that they do in Gatorade commercials? Didn\u2019t good writing still require good writers?Three years on, The Players\u2019 Tribune has become a regular source of breaking news: Kevin Durant announced his league-upheaving move to Golden State in July 2016 with an essayistic memo, which then become a recurring format. In November 2015, Kobe Bryant announced his retirement via 11 stanzas of spare, Japanese-style poetry, which, unfortunately, did not. And confessional pieces like Thomas\u2019s, written by N.H.L. also-rans and Brazilian soccer stars alike, have regularly gone viral.At its helm is Jeter, who spent 20 years in New York saying nothing to the press. He is an athlete famed, almost revered, for blankness. But the fact that he played in that Yankees spotlight for as long as he did and mostly avoided off-the-field notoriety suggests that Jeter might possess some hidden guile. After all, The Players\u2019 Tribune represents the first truly new wrinkle in sportswriting in a decade. But what is it, exactly? It\u2019s not fair to call it P.R. The access it provides is genuine. But you can\u2019t really get around one tricky fact: When you give the subject the final cut, you can\u2019t call it journalism either. Perhaps The Players\u2019 Tribune can be best understood as an effort by athletes to seize that most precious contemporary commodity \u2014 the narrative.But as meaningful access withered alongside print media, a new generation of sportswriters decided they would just stay in their living rooms and take their shots from there. The columnist Bill Simmons and the blog Deadspin pushed back against the hidebound conventions of sportswriting, the former with a hyperpersonal style defined by homerism, looseness and joy, the latter by happily pointing out all the ways we were being lied to. (I worked for Simmons at ESPN\u2019s Grantland for four years.) Take, for example, their coverage of Jeter. Simmons and the baseball writers at Grantland assailed this purportedly unassailable figure, running geeky statistical analysis to prove that, despite his five Gold Gloves, he was actually a miserable defensive player. Deadspin, originally a Gawker affiliate, delighted in unearthing Jeter\u2019s foibles. Once, it published a post suggesting he liked to watch his own highlights, in the nude, while shouting, over and over, \u201cYeah Jeets!\u201d That this was based on an unverified rumor sourced from Reddit didn\u2019t really matter. Deadspin was unconvinced that anyone, let alone a baseball player, should be uncomplicatedly revered. For millions of young fans, that mentality \u2014 that mainstream sports media presents a facile master narrative that is to be warred with at all times \u2014 became a defining principle.And then there\u2019s ESPN, which hovers above the whole system, Death Star-like, doing everything from dry game recaps to experiential multimedia packages to breaking-news pieces to talk shows that have come to define the way we shout about sports to websites like Grantland, which existed, to some extent, to question all of this. During his time at the network, the commentator Skip Bayless was well known for insisting that LeBron James was not, in fact, very good at basketball but was, rather, somewhat bad at basketball. And he never broke character. For the thinking sports fan, this was ESPN\u2019s great tragedy: The network wanted it all, every last nook, and so it coupled its ambitious, unparalleled coverage with shameless, soul-crushing shouting.For years, no one has dared to imagine a way to win back access. But The Players\u2019 Tribune did, by completely redefining it. The site gives its subjects final approval of their own coverage. Normally, this would be a journalistic sin, were it not for an elegant and cynical workaround: giving the subject the byline. The model has precedent in the form of the ghostwritten as-told-to sports memoir, which has bred some stone-cold classics: \u201cI Am Zlatan,\u201d the Swedish soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s prickly and strange 2011 autobiography, is one of the best things I\u2019ve ever read. (As a boy, Ibrahimovic celebrates personal milestones by stealing bicycles.) But being a bona fide literary achievement doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not brand management.Last fall, on the West Side of Manhattan, I visited the consummately start-up-like offices of The Players\u2019 Tribune, with its open-floor plan and glass-walled conference rooms, its espresso bar and its espresso bar\u2019s adjoining patio and its adjoining patio\u2019s stunning Hudson River views. Jeff Levick, The Players\u2019 Tribune chief executive, greeted me in his large, airy and spare office. Slim, small and slightly mod, Levick speaks quickly and while speaking quickly says things like \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201caspirations\u201d and \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cdisruption.\u201d He had come onboard just a few weeks earlier as the company\u2019s first C.E.O., and he was promising to turn a catchy idea with millions in financing from venture capitalists and athletes into a moneymaker. He was previously the chief revenue officer at Spotify, and, he explained, he saw the two companies as fundamentally alike. Both are \u201cplatforms,\u201d he told me: one for music, the other for what he calls \u201cA.G.C.\u201d \u2014 \u201cathlete-generated content.\u201dLevick was happy to tell me, in the classic manner of the disrupter, about how his company was about to upend an angry, worn-out industry. Sitting bolt upright, eyes locked onto mine, gesticulating with purpose, he pointed to the large flat-screen TV behind us: therein lay the enemy. \u201cI have ESPN on all day long, and I get where these athletes are coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys are the best in the world at what they do, and they can\u2019t catch a break! They\u2019re getting beaten up all day. Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t get beaten up like that.\u201d His point was this: All that unnecessary negativity that ESPN\u2019s TV shows churn out is ultimately a boon to the bottom line of The Players\u2019 Tribune because that negativity is persuading athletes to share their proprietary, much-desired content with The Players\u2019 Tribune.I suggested to Levick that there were still certain unique advantages that only traditional reporting can offer. \u201cWell, then, I guess the story of how the Isaiah Thomas trade went down would have happened somewhere else,\u201d he politely scoffed. \u201cThat, to me, was a piece of journalism that would never have been told through a sports reporter. They weren\u2019t going to get access to that story. And it\u2019s an amazing story.\u201dConboy had previously worked at Wired and Sports Illustrated and was brought in before The Players\u2019 Tribune concept had been publicly revealed, while athletes were still being recruited as investors. He remembers thinking, as it was explained to him in his first sit-down, that it could be interesting. \u201cOr,\u201d he recalled thinking, \u201cit could be terrible!\u201d Now he oversees a team of 10 out of an overall staff of nearly 80. They\u2019ve developed a few routine practices to attempt, as best as possible, to simulate an editor-writer relationship with the athlete. They push to get direct cell numbers and emails. They warn of the commitment to come. \u201cWe say off the bat, this is not a dashed off thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a transcript of an interview. You\u2019re signing up for a partnership. We wanna make a movie.\u201dSometimes, the athletes \u201ccome in hot\u201d with a draft or even just a long text message; other times, the athletes first want to talk through a difficult experience. When the former N.H.L. goalie Corey Hirsch wrote about the undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder that nearly pushed him to drive his car off a cliff, he spoke with Conboy five or six times. (Hockey has been the source of a number of The Players\u2019 Tribune\u2019s best stories, churning out compelling characters at a rate incommensurate with its place in the culture at large: The former Bruins enforcer Shawn Thornton once provided an anecdote about his Parkinson\u2019s-afflicted grandmother trying to talk him into letting her slug some booze out of the Stanley Cup.) Hirsch first revealed his story without being sure he would actually go through with publishing it. He was nervous about how his family would perceive it; and he nearly pulled it. That risk is part of the process at The Players\u2019 Tribune: Whether it\u2019s video or print, athletes have final cut and can kill a whole project. But Hirsch went through with it, and his article has been read more than a million times.Like Hirsch, the Miami Heat shooting guard Dion Waiters is not a player familiar to casual fans. But his April 2017 essay is perhaps the best thing the site has published. Waiters is a famously overconfident shooter \u2014 a chucker. In the article, through tales of violence, doubt, heartbreak and nausea, he doesn\u2019t bother defending himself. Instead, he doubles down. \u201cI see what people say about me,\u201d he writes. \u201cI see the GIFs and all that. They say, \u2018He never seen a shot he don\u2019t like.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s got irrational confidence.\u2019 \u2018He thinks he\u2019s the best player in the N.B.A.\u2019 Hell yeah I do.\u201d The essay was published during the N.B.A. playoffs, but the Heat\u2019s season was already over. The title of the piece: \u201cThe N.B.A. Is Lucky I\u2019m Home Doing Damn Articles.\u201dAfter Conboy finishes his ghostwriting, a lot of athletes can get judicious, carefully pruning or deleting moments of oversharing. \u201cWe want athletes that go in the Google Doc and just go to town,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s the best version of this.\u201d He recalled Isaiah Thomas\u2019s writing his first piece for the site. \u201cIt was 1 a.m. East Coast time, and he\u2019s texting about line edits,\u201d Conboy said. \u201c\u2009\u2018Move this around. What if this was said this way.\u2019\u2009\u201d Some players even act just like prima donna magazine writers and fight with their editors over every word. \u201cKobe writes his own drafts,\u201d Conboy said, smiling. \u201cLiterally, he writes his own drafts.\u201dBut most don\u2019t. In fact, the process, as Conboy described it to me, was oddly familiar. For the Waiters story, Conboy and his subject went out for cheese steaks in Philly, then later did a two-hour interview. \u201cProfile writing, it\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said, picking his words carefully. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting two hours anymore hardly anywhere.\u201d But Conboy could. Effectively, The Players\u2019 Tribune has found a way to simulate the access of olden times by putting control in the hands of the wealthy and attractive subjects. In a way, Conboy did profile Waiters. He just didn\u2019t receive the byline.Can this really be a going concern? That our obsessive sports media is missing heretofore untold, profound personal truths about our heroes? For all its peaks, on any given day reading The Players\u2019 Tribune, you might just run into a variation of \u201cHey [Insert City] \u2014 we\u2019re gonna give it our all this year.\u201d Neither the site itself nor its social media has become a real destination. According to comScore, the site gets a respectable 3.4 million unique views a month; its Twitter account has just over half a million followers. A lot of its content is, frankly, repetitive and predictable. The pieces that succeed effectively float away from The Players\u2019 Tribune and into the national conversation.In 2015 Katie Nolan, then the host of the scrappy, low-budget Fox Sports show \u201cGarbage Time,\u201d lodged a critique of The Players\u2019 Tribune model. \u201cIt isn\u2019t for us fans,\u201d she said in a segment on the show, which had a certain outsider credibility. (It has since been canceled.) \u201cIt\u2019s for the players who want to appear like an open book without the risk of getting themselves in trouble for being an open book. And maybe I\u2019m being cynical, but that sucks.\u201dI brought this up to Hoenig, the Players\u2019 Tribune editor. Hoenig has had a long, lucrative career. You get the sense that he\u2019s quite pleased to be at The Players\u2019 Tribune and that he\u2019s not all that worried about what happens next. Now, though, he let himself get worked up. \u201cIs it P.R. to say I\u2019m putting a face on somebody that you feel completely free to attack willy-nilly without knowing who they are?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s good strategy for an athlete to control his own \u2014 I don\u2019t even call it image \u2014 his own narrative. That\u2019d be a good strategy for you and me too.\u201dJeter spends most of his time in Miami, where he\u2019s the chief executive of the Marlins, and doesn\u2019t have his own full-time office here. We met later in a vacant office, under a wall of perfectly arrayed framed memories: photos from charity parties, past Jeter press coverage, Bryant\u2019s poem. In person, Jeter looked good \u2014 in his bluejeans and dark gray henley, the picture of casual bro chic. But there were moments that remind you that he has been around awhile. He rolled out a rotator cuff, slowly; he smashed a fist into a spike of pain on his lower thigh. His rookie season was 1996. He dated Mariah Carey! For the better part of the first half of his career, the worst-case scenario was a Page Six write-up on what Meatpacking District club he was at last night.I theorized that The Players\u2019 Tribune had been born as a retaliation to the gossip columnists who had poked and prodded him for so long. He shrugged it off. \u201cYou know how many phone calls I\u2019ve gotten from my mom through the years when I was younger asking me questions?\u201d he said. \u201cEventually you just try not to pay attention to it.\u201d He added: \u201cYou remember the Motorola two-way? When they came out? That was as good as it came. Then the color one came out. And all of a sudden. ...\u201d He trailed off. \u201cEverything you do is public knowledge.\u201dI asked him about Alex Rodriguez, his former teammate and frenemy, and a player famously, calamitously inept during his playing career at controlling his public image. (Just search for \u201cA-Rod kisses himself.\u201d) Did Jeter ever try to help him? \u201cI spoke with everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI would stress accountability to anyone that came to our organization.\u201dI asked whether, had today\u2019s athlete protests spread to the Yankees while Jeter was playing, would he have taken a knee. \u201cI\u2019m not in the clubhouse now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll say: Everyone has a right to peaceful protest.\u201dWhat did I know about Derek Jeter? Not much and certainly nothing new after this brief encounter. I left the interview feeling as though, intentionally or not, he\u2019d made a good case for access journalism\u2019s uselessness. We already live among the distorting effects of Twitter and Instagram, the uncanny and calculated sense of intimacy that social-media platforms provide. Now we have a model that simulates objective journalism, supposedly written by the people who were once subject to that journalism\u2019s scrutiny.Projecting The Players\u2019 Tribune model forward, we can imagine a world in which athletes simply don\u2019t need to talk to reporters, in an echo of what feels like the unstoppable atomization of all news and information. Politicians, TV showrunners, labor-union leaders: theoretically The Players\u2019 Tribune platform is replicable for any public professional. In the future, perhaps, every last person will get to broadcast his or her own particular worldview, free of objectivity, on a bespoke, partisan media organ, with slick photography and design. And it will be up to us to decide what version of the truth we want to believe.Amos Barshad is a writer based in New York.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A tale of three tech companies earnings.\u2022 CBS and Viacom are talking about getting back together.\u2022 A shake-up in Airbnb\u2019s C-suite\u2022 Why Europe matters for Facebook.\u2022 Regulators are worried that Bitcoin\u2019s price is being manipulated.\u2022 Jeff Immelt has gone from C.E.O. to V.C.\u2022 And when will Congress raise the debt ceiling?Apple reported record profit and sales, Amazon easily beat expectations, and Google-parent Alphabet posted a loss because of the new tax law.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:Apple\u2022 $61.6 billion \u2014 Revenue from iPhone sales, up 13 percent from a year earlier.Critics CornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:\u201cApple has long followed Mies van der Rohe\u2019s design precept that \u201cless is more.\u201d Now it\u2019s doing the same financially. The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge. But that\u2019s OK \u2013 persuading customers to pay more arguably requires as much genius as getting people to adopt the technology in the first place.\u201dAmazonCritics cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:Amazon.com is going gangbusters. But some of the nearly $700 billion internet retailer\u2019s fastest-expanding \u2013 and most profitable \u2013 businesses could be ones that irritate users. Over time, that could sully the company\u2019s image.AlphabetCritics cornerJennifer Saba of Breakingviews:Alphabet is stuck at the letter G. The holding company of Google was created to safeguard against conventionality and let moonshot ideas, like self-driving cars, flourish. Almost three years in, it\u2019s basically still just Google. Which means, in turn, that the A in Alphabet stands mainly for advertising.It wouldn\u2019t hurt Alphabet to put more energy into revenue sources that don\u2019t start with a G.Why now\u2022 Walt Disney\u2019s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.Critics cornerTara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly:\u201cCBS isn\u2019t safe from the industry\u2019s broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom won\u2019t provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities. Those synergies may amount to some $500 million based on what past deals have yielded, according to Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. That could create quite a lift for CBS\u2019s earnings.\u201dBelinda Johnson is moving up. Laurence Tosi is moving out. And don\u2019t expect the company to go public this year.Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company\u2019s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis.Between the linesThe context The company lineHere\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson:\u201cShe takes critical functions that might be seen as constraints in other companies, and clears a path so they can become competitive advantages and facilitate the growth of the business.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies:\u201cHaving worked with Belinda over the years and at Airbnb, I have been consistently impressed by her ability to anticipate issues and leverage strategic opportunities. She combines technical expertise with great care for her colleagues.\u201dAnd here\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi:\u201cHe helped Airbnb establish a rigorous financial discipline, aided our expansion into new businesses including into luxury rentals, which is now one of our core businesses, and helped us develop new and innovative ways to grow Airbnb and our businesses.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSome of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook.Facebook\u2019s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe.The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook\u2019s future growth. The company\u2019s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe\u2019s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States\u2019, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.That\u2019s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin\u2019s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg.The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday.More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex.\u201cThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,\u201d said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. \u201cIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.\u201dThe digital money flyaroundDetails, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point.The contextWhile a potential joint venture between Alphabet and Aramco isn\u2019t necessarily connected to the latter company\u2019s IPO, if a deal is struck before the offering, advisers to the company could pitch the pact as a way for investors to bake in technology valuations.It isn\u2019t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company \u2014 and therefore command a higher multiple \u2014 but it\u2019d be interesting to see bankers make that argument.\u2014 Stephen GrocerFrom the release:\u201cI am excited to join NEA because they understand how to work with visionary entrepreneurs to build successful technology and health care enterprises,\u201d Immelt said. \u201cI have a passion for these sectors and I am eager to work with NEA and its partners to develop great businesses, nurture talented leaders and grow diverse teams.\u201dand:\u201cJeff is deeply knowledgeable about the complex global innovation landscape we\u2019re operating in today and he understands how businesses must evolve to compete and win in that environment, particularly across industrial and medical technologies,\u201d said Scott Sandell, Managing General Partner, NEA.(Worth noting: Mr. Immelt\u2019s successor at G.E. is struggling to turn that company around. See below.)\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s where our colleague Peter Eavis says investors should focus:Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Today\u2019s a big day for tech earningsThe Treasury secretary argued that the cuts would eventually pay for themselves, but conceded that it wouldn\u2019t happen this year.The policy flyaroundAnalysts\u2019 takes:\u2022 Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch write, \u201cThis shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.\u201d\u2022 Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \u201cIn short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell\u2019s first press conference.\u201d\u2022 Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton said, \u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation.\u201dAnalysts over at Deutsche Bank think so. They wrote in a research note yesterday:As the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), G.E. increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.G.E. is the last survivor of the index\u2019s 12 original components from when it started in 1896, and has been in it continuously for more than 110 years.\u201cWe will be looking at how the company, from the board on down, handles the allegations,\u201d said Karen Wells, who directs the investigations and enforcement bureau at the state gambling commission.She said allegations in the settlement agreement weren\u2019t disclosed before the commission granted Wynn a license in September 2014, or at any point before The Wall Street Journal report.Shares in Wynn Resorts fell more than 3 percent yesterday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Crowdsourced List Set Off Months of #MeToo Debate", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWhen I made the document, I really wanted it to be accessible to women who would otherwise not be a part of whisper networks,\u201d Ms. Donegan said in an interview. \u201cSo, women who don\u2019t happen to have the friends who know about their new boss, or the woman who doesn\u2019t have the professional cache to have been told already, \u2018Oh, that editor \u2014 don\u2019t work with him.\u2019\u201dWomen in the industry started to share the link to the document, which allowed them to view and edit it anonymously. That day, while Ms. Donegan was at work, she noticed flurries of activity. By the time she arrived at a friend\u2019s apartment that night for a planned dinner, she was in a panic.\u201cI was a wreck,\u201d she said.Still, she hesitated when her friend suggested she take the document down.\u201cI felt really conflicted, because I could see what was going on that spreadsheet was incredibly valuable to the people who were using it,\u201d Ms. Donegan said.By then, the list had grown to include the names of more than 70 men, along with thumbnail descriptions of their alleged misconduct. The names of 14 men accused of \u201cphysical sexual violence by multiple women\u201d were highlighted in red, to distinguish them from men who were said to have committed lesser offenses like flirting aggressively or sending inappropriate direct messages to women on Twitter.Although the spreadsheet was no longer live, it was not gone. Recipients had downloaded it in the form of PDFs or had taken screenshots of it, and it lived on through forwarded emails.The BuzzFeed article, which did not identify Ms. Donegan as the document\u2019s creator, was posted the morning after she made the list inactive. The article, written by Doree Shafrir, explained how the spreadsheet worked, described the range of claims it included and noted the potential pitfalls of \u201clumping all of this behavior together in a big anonymous spreadsheet of unsubstantiated allegations against dozens of named men \u2014 who were not given the chance to respond.\u201dBut media organizations like BuzzFeed, Mother Jones, The New York Times and Riverhead Books \u2014 each of which had more than one current or former employee named on the list \u2014 started investigations soon after becoming aware of it.Mr. Witty, in a written statement, denied the accusations against him, although he acknowledged that he might have acted inappropriately. \u201cI am saddened to think that I in any way have contributed to or reinforced the imbalance of power between men and women in my industry,\u201d he said.The rest of those named on the list who lost jobs declined to comment.Some of the men whose names appeared on the document but did not end up suspended or fired said the list had nonetheless affected their professional and personal lives.\u201cIt\u2019s so na\u00efve to think that just because no one has spoken out, that means that there aren\u2019t any false accusations,\u201d said a man who agreed to discuss the document only if his name was not used, because he did not want to draw further attention to his appearance on the list. \u201cIt just means that the men that have been falsely accused are petrified.\u201dMs. Donegan said she was not aware of any false accusations and believed that the document\u2019s disclaimer was sufficient in expressing reasonable doubt.On the surface, the list did not to raise any legal issues, according to David A. Schulz, a First Amendment lawyer who is a lecturer at Yale Law School and has represented The Times. Ms. Donegan, he said, \u201chas a right to collect information and organize it in a useful way.\u201d Those who contributed to the document would be at risk only if someone named on the list sued for libel, he added.\u201cThe question is if there is specific information that shouldn\u2019t be in there and is false, in which case there may be liability against certain people for certain things,\u201d Mr. Schulz said.As the list gave rise to a steady stream of essays and social-media arguments, Ms. Donegan was lying low, worried, she said, that she would be identified as the document\u2019s creator on someone else\u2019s terms. She tried to distract herself by working on writing projects, including an essay detailing why she had started the list in the first place.Ms. Donegan kept working on the essay in which she would reveal herself as the document\u2019s creator.\u201cAll of this attention being paid to the question of my identity made it seem inevitable that my identity was going to be revealed, maybe even sooner than when the Harper\u2019s piece was published,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was really racing against the clock to get a lot of factors in place.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t pretend that the spreadsheet didn\u2019t frighten me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs the stories accumulated and it became clear that many, many more women were using the document than I had ever imagined, I realized that I had created something that had grown rapidly beyond my control.\u201dMs. Donegan said that before going public, she had taken steps to protect her own digital security as well her family\u2019s. She declined to comment on whether any of the men on the list had contacted her.After months of debate, Ms. Donegan has not wavered. \u201cWhat it was motivated by was a desire to make the world a little more fair and to even the playing field for women who are especially vulnerable,\u201d she said.Follow Jaclyn Peiser on Twitter: @jackiepeiser.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Alt-Weekly Crisis Hits Nashville. And Democracy.", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeeing The Scene on the auction block might not be surprising, but it\u2019s still heartbreaking. In a shortsighted effort to make the paper more appealing to buyers, SouthComm laid off some passionate, immensely talented journalists and seriously overburdened those who remained. Some of them are people I know because I once wrote for The Scene, and I have spent more than 20 years watching the difference this newspaper has made to my city.When classified ads \u2014 the bread and butter of the newspaper business \u2014 migrated online, newspapers big and small suffered. In towns like Nashville, midsize cities too small to sustain more than one daily paper, alt-weeklies morphed from journalism\u2019s irreverent younger siblings into necessary institutions. They covered news the shrinking dailies no longer touched, and they served as urgent competitors in areas where the dailies still invested resources, such as politics.In 1998, Nashville\u2019s Gannett-owned morning daily, The Tennessean, bought the evening daily, the 122-year-old Nashville Banner, and then promptly shut it down. But reporters for The Scene were still right there, still holding politicians accountable and covering local arts in the kind of depth the daily never even aspired to.\u201cA lot of the work that alt-weeklies do now fills in the gaps\u201d created by understaffed dailies, said the former Scene editor Steve Cavendish. \u201cIt\u2019s investigative work. It\u2019s cultural work. There\u2019s nobody else writing culture in this city. There\u2019s nobody else writing food in this city. There\u2019s nobody else writing arts in this city. The only place you see that coverage, really, is in The Scene.\u201dEqually important is what alt-weeklies bring to political reporting. The history of Southern politics is a history of cronyism, and the situation is hardly better now \u2014 and hardly unique to the South. Too often, public servants answer to special interests like the N.R.A. and the Koch brothers out of fear of facing well-funded primary challengers they have little chance of beating. In statehouses and city halls across the country, the only thing standing between an oligarchy and a true republic is often a local newspaper reporter working on an ancient laptop to shore up the bulwark of truth.In this climate, the importance of vibrant community alt-weeklies will continue to grow. While The Scene faces economic challenges, it is still a profitable newspaper. But it desperately needs a buyer willing to invest in its future \u2014 and, when necessary, to look beyond the quarterly bottom line to what the newspaper brings to this community.\u201cThe financial pressures on these papers are going to require a different kind of owner,\u201d Mr. Cavendish said in an interview. \u201cThere needs to be a new level of civic ownership that doesn\u2019t require a pound of flesh to be taken out every quarter, or every year.\u201dThe owners of a local newspaper need to understand that they have not invested in an engine for quarter-over-quarter shareholder profit. They have entered into a crucial compact with their fellow citizens. They have invested in the city itself.In sanctioning modest profits and sometimes fitful growth, the new owners of The Scene will earn the privilege of uncovering conflicts of interest that public servants would prefer to keep hidden, demanding access to public records the public doesn\u2019t yet know are theirs, helping people who are enduring injustice, and championing people who are quietly making a difference.Owning a local newspaper is not the way to wealth. It\u2019s the way to something far more important than wealth. In this age of \u201calternative truth,\u201d the real news, for all its deadline-driven mistakes, is our best hope for surviving the now-daily challenges to American democracy.The Nashville Scene is for sale. Someone who cares about the fate of this city \u2014 and this country \u2014 should buy it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$2.4 Billion Deal for Chelsea Market Enlarges Google\u2019s New York Footprint", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a tech takeover.Chelsea Market sits directly across Ninth Avenue from the company\u2019s headquarters at 111 Eighth Avenue, which is larger than the Empire State Building and covers the entire block between 15th and 16th Streets.But it is only the latest example of an internet behemoth, and even smaller tech companies, expanding rapidly in New York City.Amazon, Facebook, Salesforce, a cloud computing company, and Spotify, a music streaming service, are all enlarging their footprints here by hundreds of thousands of square feet. Employment at technology firms has grown three times faster in New York City than in the rest of the private sector, adding more than 50,000 jobs since the end of the recession in 2010, according to a report by the state comptroller.\u201cThe modern tech sector began on the West Coast when it was about developing new technology and programming,\u201d said Scott Rechler, chairman of RXR Realty, a Google landlord at Pier 57, a new mixed-use space on the Hudson River that is scheduled to open this year. \u201cIt\u2019s now about the implementation and application of technology. And that\u2019s presented an opportunity for New York, the business capital of the world. The talent pool is here.\u201dNeither side has made clear what Google\u2019s plans for the building are, and whether the popular food market will stay in place. But getting rid of tenants with leases would be a long-term process.At the end of 2017, tech firms accounted for 29.3 million, or 8 percent, of the 398 million square feet of office space in New York City, according to CBRE, a real estate company. In a snapshot of recent tech-sector activity, those companies have leased or renewed leases for 21 million square feet of office space in the last 10 years alone. If telecom companies are included, that number jumps to 26.8 million.Nine years ago, tech firms had only 17.6 million square feet of office space, or 5 percent of the office market.The tech firms generally prefer industrial spaces to the brass and glass towers of Midtown. Chelsea Market, where Google already leases 400,000 square feet of space, is a former factory building with expansive floors.Amazon has taken office space in what was once a warehouse at 450 West 33rd Street, although the owner, Brookfield, recently gave the building a face-lift and glass walls.Facebook has grown substantially at 770 Broadway, a landmark cast-iron building that was once a department store, on an entire block bounded by Eighth and Ninth Streets, between Broadway and Lafayette Street.But that trend may be changing, said Mary Ann Tighe, a broker and chief executive of CBRE in the New York region. When companies grow and need a more robust infrastructure, she said, some tech firms are migrating to traditional office towers.Salesforce, the cloud computing company based in San Francisco, moved its three Manhattan offices into a 41-story skyscraper at 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue. The Salesforce logo replaced the MetLife branding atop the building.And Spotify, the music streaming company, is moving from 620 Sixth Avenue and several other locations into nearly half-a-million square feet at the 4 World Trade Center skyscraper in Lower Manhattan.But it was Google that prompted real estate brokers, landlords, city officials and economists to sit up and take notice of the burgeoning tech sector a decade ago.In 2006, the company moved into 111 Eighth Avenue, a massive onetime shipping terminal, with tenants that included Verizon, Sprint, Web MD and BarnesandNoble.com. The building sat atop a high-powered fiber artery snaking along Manhattan\u2019s West Side. Employees used Razor scooters to navigate the blocklong corridors lined with work spaces, commissaries with free drinks and granola, and massage and game rooms.Google became a siren for other, smaller tech firms to move to the neighborhood, which was beginning to shrug off its industrial roots.In 2010, Google bought the building, also from Jamestown, for $1.8 billion, a breathtaking sum at the time. Not so long ago, blue-collar tenants had paid a very modest $6 per square foot for space there.But Google\u2019s need for space continues unabated. The company has been unable to dislodge the other tenants at 111 Eighth Avenue as quickly as it had hoped. The company has leased large blocks of space nearby, at Pier 57; at 85 10th Avenue, another former Nabisco cookie factory, between 15th and 16th Streets; and at Chelsea Market.Facebook has about 5,000 employees now in the Chelsea neighborhood, occupying a total of 900,000 square feet.Owning Chelsea Market would enable the company to create a campus akin to its headquarters in California, albeit one that is more vertical. Chelsea Market, like 111 Eighth, has been a front-runner in the evolution of the Chelsea neighborhood from an industrial zone to an area known for inexpensive space for food producers, restaurants and office tenants, and now as a tech-sector hub.An earlier version of a chart with this article misstated the number of tech workers in San Francisco in 2013. It was 79,000, not 7,900.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Connections: 50 Teenagers Suggest Creative Ways to Link Classic Texts to the World Today", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContestsSome texts came up so often that, if you\u2019re a teacher currently working with any of them, you could do worse than to search this post to find the many and varied ways students see their resonance. \u201cBrave New World,\u201d \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d \u201cThe Prince,\u201d \u201c1984,\u201d \"Othello\u201d and \u201cMacbeth\u201d are in that category.Certain issues in the news also appeared in all kinds of contexts. The #MeToo movement reminded students of literature like \u201cJane Eyre\u201d and \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d but one student also thought Newton\u2019s first two laws of motion applied, while another saw an analogy to the rock cycle in geology. Participants discovered that fake news is old news, with clear parallels in the plots of \u201cThe Crucible\u201d and \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d President Trump was compared to literary characters including Macbeth and Grendel, and his policies were invoked in examining topics as varied as \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d and the Indian Removal Act.Below, in alphabetical order, is a list of winners, runners-up and honorable mentions, including full essays by our top eight winners. All told, the list represents the work of 50 students, more than we usually call out in our contests. But not only were there simply that many ideas we wanted to honor, we also think the variety and originality of the choices speak for themselves: Any future student who wonders what school-assigned reading has to do with \u201cthe real world\u201d only has to look at this list to see how easy it is to answer that question.Is it really possible to control how people think? Today we are inundated with media from the moment we wake up: images, text messages, news stories. In school, students read articles, novels, and textbooks. If we took all of these stimulants away, would we still be able to think for ourselves, or would we lose the motivation to do so?This theme is one at the forefront of Ray Bradbury\u2019s novel, \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d which I recently read for my Literature class. The story examines a dystopian society where books have been banned completely. The average people in this story seem to lack emotional complexity; they have no desire to read because they have been taught that books made people upset. In the novel, there are a few people who question the status quo, but the majority of people live in a state of blissful ignorance.Though the novel is meant to depict a contemporary society that Bradbury could not have predicted, there are elements of its narrative that are uncannily similar to our world. Specifically, the mindset of our leaders. Following the mandate from the president disallowing the use of seven scientific words by the CDC in budget documents, I read an article in the New York Times called \u201cThought Control, Trump-Style\u201d published on December 18, 2017. The Trump administration has almost completely erased any trace of the LGBT+ community on government websites and banned the phrase \u201cclimate change\u201d from use by the Department of Agriculture. This virus has infected so many establishments that its ban on seven words in budget documents pales in comparison.Why are our leaders seeking to control the media we consume? Even the controversy of \u201cfake news\u201d is an attempt to restrict the press we see to only one side of the story. Our government has become a Mind Flayer of sorts: it sees itself as a superior race of thinkers and feels a need to dominate other beings to the point of mind control. This evil and fantastical government is what Ray Bradbury was trying to warn against in his novel. Complacency only breeds complacency. Congress will surely be more effective in passing legislation that Republicans are in favor of if the only news consumed by the American public leans to the far right, but what good does it do us as a society to all agree?American democracy is predicated on freedom of speech and the desire to seek knowledge. The very idea of precluding this information is a threat to our republic. It is scary to think that Bradbury saw signs of today\u2019s society almost seventy years ago. Perhaps even scarier is how many people in today\u2019s society have failed to become Guy Montags. It would be difficult to find someone who does not agree with the dangers presented in this book, but, unfortunately, it is not hard to find someone who agrees with the thought control of America\u2019s own Mind Flayer.If complacency breeds complacency, will deliberate minds produce deliberate actions?Stauffer\u2019s story begins her freshman year of college, when she remembers this paralyzing fear. She recalls going from a confident student; optimistic about the year, to a terrified, voiceless wreck. Her high school education had prepared her for the coursework but not the reality her actions impacted her future, and could possibly mean failure. Stauffer became so petrified that she stopped eating and participating in classes, dropped courses, lost weight, and eventually dropped out of college altogether. She\u2019d failed, and her worst fear had become a reality.Yet, somehow this wasn\u2019t as crushing as she thought it would be. Stauffer moved home, and inadvertently started seeking out education the same way Thoreau did: through experience. She found that the hands on experience of ballet and yoga studios and a nonprofit organization furthered her education more than any college course ever could. Eventually Stauffer found a way to finish her degree at the New School, a collection of universities that offered credit for real-life experience instead of academic courses. She went from the lowest point in her life to one of the highest, and all she had to do was fail.The moral is clear: there are gaps in our education system, and because of these gaps students aren\u2019t adequately prepared for their own futures. In his book Walden, Thoreau elaborates on the ideas Stauffer touches on in her article. As stated before, he believed learning through experience was exponentially better than a in classroom. When a rigid curriculum with expectations is set in place, students aren\u2019t given the same hands on learning as they would be without one. Just as Stauffer embraced this learning style in the New School, Thoreau did so in Walden Woods. For that is all Walden really is; Thoreau learning from nature by immersing himself in it, instead of seeing it on the pages of a book. A quote from Walden most fitting is as follows, \u201cWe boast of our system of education, but why stop at schoolmasters and schoolhouses? We are all schoolmasters, and our schoolhouse is the universe\u201d (Walden 10/15/1859.)Most of the literature I have explored in my English classes have been novels and plays with sophisticated language and complex storylines, but this semester we read an eye-opening essay about racism\u2013 \u201cWhite Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\u201d by Peggy McIntosh\u2013which finally made me realize that what my teachers say is true: the things we read and discuss do apply to the real world.I read Charles Blow\u2019s editorials regularly. The effect of his words is sharp and impactful. When I came across \u201cChecking My Male Privilege\u201d after the deluge of sexual harassment accusations came out in Hollywood and Washington, the connection was obvious.In \u201cUnpacking the Invisible Knapsack,\u201d McIntosh emphasizes how in our society, white privilege is so lethal because its beneficiaries are \u201ccarefully taught not to recognize [it].\u201d How can racism be eradicated if the people with advantages don\u2019t even know they have them? Unless white people recognize all the ways our quality of life can be so much higher simply because of the color of our skin, we will forever have this invisible pack full of assets and protections secured tightly on our backs.If we apply the same logic McIntosh uses in her essay to our discussions about sexual harassment in America, it\u2019s easy to see that most men are also conditioned to evade any blame whatsoever for the injustices so many women face. Just like the white people who attribute their success to their own merit and turn a blind eye to their privileges, the men who focus on the \u201cgood guys\u201d who don\u2019t grope or whistle or slap are choosing to overlook the privilege of physical dominance. It seems simple, but men can enjoy the luxury of knowing that a vast majority of the time, women don\u2019t have the physical superiority to victimize or overpower men for unwanted sexual behavior.In cases of both sexism and racism, privileges hurt both those without and with the privileges. White people might not condone racism, but their blindness to privilege leads them to believe that racism may not be as bad as the underprivileged make it seem. As Blow writes, it\u2019s extremely difficult to understand how bad something is if you never experience it firsthand, and so listening to people with fewer privileges is one of the best tools we can use to evaluate the state of discrimination black people and women are immersed in.Beneath the shimmery surface of American ideals, from John Winthrop\u2019s iconic imagery of the country as a \u201ccity upon a hill\u201d to the twentieth century metaphor of a \u201cmelting pot\u201d accepting all cultures, nationalities, and ethnicities, recent events reveal the underlying racism of a nation claiming to be \u201cpost-racial.\u201d In George Yancy\u2019s \u201cWill America Choose King\u2019s Dream or Trump\u2019s Nightmare?\u201d the professor illustrates how Trump\u2019s offensive and racist statements pertaining to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations highlight America\u2019s deceptive fa\u00e7ade as a beacon for civil liberty. A classic piece of American literature, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald unveils the flaws of high society during the Roaring Twenties, a period of both economic prosperity and unrivaled income inequality, through the narration of Nick Carraway. Reflecting current news, \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d showcases how harsh reality is often hidden under a superficial exterior.After moving to Long Island, Carraway optimistically believes in the American dream of working hard to be rewarded and achieve upward mobility. However, his encounters reveal the faults of the rich whose lifestyles and wealth are so widely admired. Tom Buchanan, a Yale graduate from a prominent family, has more than enough wealth to transport his polo ponies across the country while owning an elaborate mansion framed by French windows and half an acre of fresh roses. Despite Buchanan\u2019s dignified appearance and prestige, Carraway uncovers the truth of his racism, domestic violence, and immorality. At his own dinner party, Buchanan recommends a book claiming the importance of the dominance of the white race. That same night, a woman reveals his infidelity and the fact that everyone in town is aware of it. Not only is the man unabashedly unfaithful, but he frequently leaves bruises on his wife and breaks his mistress\u2019s nose during a disagreement. Meanwhile, the vanity of his wife and mistress is undeniable since Buchanan\u2019s exuberant wealth was the subject of their attraction. The sole genuinely magnanimous rich character, Jay Gatsby, is delusional and dependent on illegal means to maintain his lavish lifestyle.Although written nearly a century later, Yancy\u2019s op-ed examines the same theme of reality contradicting American ideals. Ever since the Declaration of Independence affirmed equality for all men and the United States emerged as the land of liberty, the nation claimed to be a republic of moral justice and equality. Yet on January 11, President Donald J. Trump revealed the contradictory truth when he made a racist and derogatory statement condemning immigrants from several nonwhite countries. The representative of the United States allegedly using \u201cshithole\u201d to describe the homelands of foreign immigrants is contemptuous and clearly inconsistent with America\u2019s image of acceptance and tolerance.In \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d Fitzgerald warns readers against accepting society at face value, a lesson that Yancy emphasizes as well. To learn from the misplaced optimism of Nick Carraway, Americans today must remain unaffected by the country\u2019s idealistic rhetoric of freedom and equality to speak out against our president\u2019s bigotry, rather than silently accepting the unjust reality of racism.Mark Twain was friends with abolitionist Frederick Douglass, yet he permitted grotesque drawings of escaped slave Jim in \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d Twain was a benefactor for African American students, yet he depicted Jim as helpless and inferior in the \u201canti-slavery\u201d satire. Twain clearly had conflicting views regarding African Americans. In his New York Times op-ed, \u201cThe Other Inconvenient Truth,\u201d author Charles Blow states, \u201cJust because one abhors violence and cruelty doesn\u2019t mean that one truly believes that all people are equal\u2026 Entertaining the notion of imbalance-that white people are inherently better than others in any way- is also white supremacy.\u201d Blow invents the term \u201csoft white supremacy\u201d to describe these beliefs. This concept offered me a way to navigate Twain\u2019s puzzling attitudes towards African Americans in Huck Finn.When reading Twain\u2019s classic with my AP English class, I was confused as to why the text wasn\u2019t resolutely anti-slavery. In the novel, protagonist Huck and Jim travel down the Mississippi to escape their lives in St. Petersburg, Missouri. It takes over 300 pages for Huck to realize Jim is a human being, and even then Huck infantilizes Jim by offering the grown man \u201chelp.\u201d In the book\u2019s last ten controversial chapters, Jim becomes subservient to Huck and Tom, refusing to stand up for himself even when made to complete ridiculous tasks. Jim\u2019s behavior in these chapters led me to suspect Twain believed slaves were too unintelligent and submissive to stand up to adolescents. Although Twain depicted Jim as a true human being, giving this book its \u201canti-slavery\u201d reputation, subtleties in Huck\u2019s and Jim\u2019s attitudes make me wonder if Twain \u201centertained notions of imbalance\u201d even though he didn\u2019t openly show it.Most importantly, Blow showed me that \u201csoft white supremacy\u201d still plagues our current times, most notably in the executive branch of our government. In 2011, Trump said President Obama needed to show his birth certificate to prove he was American-born. When announcing his Presidential candidacy, Trump stated Mexicans were drug dealers, criminals, and rapists. Trump said of the white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville that violence had taken place \u201con many sides.\u201d No, he didn\u2019t openly support the supremacists, but yes, he didn\u2019t really condemn them either. Recently, Trump called Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas,\u201d actively belittling her and Native Americans simultaneously.I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Blow speak on January 7th and his words continued to enlighten my understanding of white supremacy. Passive white supremacy, he said, is more deadly than open white supremacy because these feelings can increase exponentially when sparked. Those who turn a blind eye to hateful events are the ones who allow extremism to grow.I was disappointed that in the end of Twain\u2019s novel, Huck knows his Southern society has the wrong views about slavery yet he decides to turn his own blind eye. Huck\u2019s choice to escape to the West and ignore these issues on the final page is symbolic of the actions many in our country take today.It can be a terrifying thing to see decades of the pent-up rage of an oppressed person finally let out against their oppressor. This is the case in William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d when the Jewish moneylender Shylock brings his nemesis and lifelong tormentor, the Christian merchant Antonio, to court over an unpaid loan. The punishment, as agreed upon between the two men as a condition of the deal, is that Shylock may remove a pound of Antonio\u2019s flesh. But before Shylock exacts this cruel retribution, a friend of Antonio\u2019s makes a fascinating appeal in his favor. Portia claims that the true sign of strength is not the ability to take revenge, but to show mercy. Mercy, she says, \u201cblesseth him that gives, and him that takes \u2026 \u2018tis mightiest in the mightiest\u201d (Shakespeare IV.i.183-84). In June of 2017, half a millennium after Shakespeare\u2019s fictional court case, the Louisiana state legislature seemed to realize the same thing as Portia when they passed a series of unexpected but widespread criminal justice reform laws which aim to dramatically reduce the prison population and lower recidivism rates. Both instances show that the ability to have mercy gives the person in power an unparalleled opportunity to do good, and ultimately, to benefit themselves.At its surface, the Louisiana reform package could appear purely as an act of mercy: an attempt to help those who have fallen victim to the state\u2019s brutal justice system. On some level, this is all it is; surely there were legislators for whom this was their sole motivation. But whether intended or not, Louisiana stands to receive enormous gains from this package \u2013 it truly is \u201ctwice blest.\u201d As well as expanded parole and prison alternatives, which aim to help those convicted, the state expects to see an improvement in public safety and save over $180 million. The monetary benefits from this merciful outreach will help the state in ways that would never be thought of as connected to improving an inmate\u2019s life.However, conservative politicians, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, fail to see this link. They maintain that the best way to keep law and order among their constituents is to wield their power like a sword, striking down any who violate that peace. But Portia reminds us that mercy is what makes a ruler truly powerful; she calls it \u201can attribute to God himself\u201d (Shakespeare IV.i.190). Sessions and others must reject this easy show of power by way of force and cruelty in the justice system, choosing instead a path that will benefit disadvantaged citizens and show the people that they are worthy of the power we grant them. In this time of political distrust, the American people could use an indication that our politicians are capable of the \u201cawe and majesty\u201d that Portia speaks of (Shakespeare IV.i.186). I am certain that if they chose to show mercy, we would know beyond a doubt that they are worthy of leading us.I stumble upon a New York Times article, \u201cJudge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees,\u201d that makes me wonder if Hawthorne, the literary genius, is wrong.The article explains a recent case in which a judge, James Robart, lifted a Trump administration ban after hearing a compelling argument that Muslim refugees struggle to reunite with family members who have already legally settled in the U.S. due to discriminatory policies of the U.S. refugee program. Governmental lawyers counter-argued that the ban was necessary because it was in interests of national security.I sit at the breakfast table wondering if xenophobia was always that pronounced in the United States. It appears to me that xenophobia underlined the governmental lawyers\u2019 arguments; an attorney called the ban \u201creasonable and appropriate.\u201d I do not understand how a ban that targets certain groups, specifically Muslims, can be \u201creasonable.\u201d I ask my father, who grew up in an Italian immigrant household if he recalls facing immense oppression. He says no. I often hear people casually declaring that Muslims should not be allowed in the U.S. because they will bomb our cities. When did Muslim refugees become synonymous with terrorism? The answer: recently. How may you ask? The death of our shadows.Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d explores the concept of the shadow-self. The character Pearl is praised because she possesses no shadow. Hawthorne suggested that our world would be a better place if we did not have shadows, meaning our dark parts would be exposed to society. We live in Hawthorne\u2019s world, and it is not one of sublime beauty, rather it is one of chaos and disgust.With recent changes in administration, more people have become comfortable vocalizing xenophobic, along with homophobic, racist, and sexist, thoughts. It has become more common to witness politicians share their dark, most discriminatory, comments to gain support. Those thoughts are normalized, causing the death of our shadows.Shadows barricade impertinent comments and prevent xenophobia from manifesting itself into discriminatory policies like the ban seen in the New York Times article. Although Judge James Robart partially lifted the ban, part of it still exists, along with other similar policies. He\u2019s combating xenophobia, while others do little to eradicate discriminatory policies. By doing nothing, a shadow-less world exists. Perhaps if we had shadows, a ban would not exist to prevent Muslim families from reuniting. A Muslim father can watch his daughter blow out the candles on her birthday cake, and a Muslim mother can applaud when her son receives his high school diploma. But they can\u2019t.Hawthorne is wrong. His envisioned world has its perils. It allows xenophobia to persist, causing the unjust discrimination of certain groups like the Muslim refugees mentioned in the article \u201cJudge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees.\u201d We can live again in Hawthorne\u2019s imperfect world, where shadows exist, even finding it to be not so imperfect. A shadow can only exist with light; there is no light in a shadow-less world.In the New York Times article, \u201cCareers for Women in Technology Companies Are A Global Challenge,\u201d writer Alina Tugend discusses the similarities and differences for women around the world working in the tech field. Tech companies in the United States suffer from a male-dominated, \u201cbro\u201d culture that gives a cold shoulder to female coworkers. In other places, such as the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, the problem lies with class differences, leading to the alienation of middle-class and poor women. The article sums that, while the execution of these issues vary around the world, the underlying effect is still the same: women have a much harder time entering and remaining in the tech field.The lack of female representation in STEM is not new. While there are many factors that lead to this problem, the one with the deepest consequence is negative stereotypes planted at a young age.In psychology, we learned about the idea of stereotype threat: a phenomenon in which people are reminded of negative stereotypes of a group they belong to and hence perform on given tasks conforming to those stereotypes. In 1997, researcher Steven Spencer applied this idea to classrooms and discovered that equally intelligent women performed worse on a math exam than their male counterparts after being told that the test showed gender differences. This characterization evoked the negative stereotype of women\u2019s lack of math skills and led them to under-perform on the exam. In contrast, he found that if, before the test, participants were led to believe that both parties performed equally, women\u2019s scores were similar to the men\u2019s. Additional research post Spencer\u2019s experiment has further supported this idea, proving that negative stereotypes in gender as well as race and ethnicity reduces the performance of individuals.This institutionalized idea that women are not as capable of performing mathematical or technical tasks as well as men is deeply rooted in our culture, starting in elementary schools all the way to professional work settings. Learning about stereotype threat was eye-opening because it allowed me to see the deeper effects of the way we teach children about careers and how it differs in males and females. Dr. Spencer\u2019s experiment involved one math exam; however, the negative stereotypes about women\u2019s lack of technical skills are prevalent universally. The most corrosive part of this narrative is that men are lead to believe these same ideas, so in the future they are equally as unwelcoming of women, a disheartening reality reflected in our companies today.It is vital that we start debasing these myths and start encouraging women from young ages to be open about any career. Most importantly, we need to teach both men and women such values, so that men can also live in a world where the idea of women being empowered to work in any field is a standard, a world in which creativity and innovation need no gender classification._________ Whether heroes take the form of a mighty Anglo-Saxon warrior or a fierce Amazonian princess, the people who rise up to lead us out of the shadows of death are cultivated by the trials they face and the hope for a brighter future that we project upon them which are often rooted in the injustices we experience.A lot can be learned from the prisoners in the Stanford Prison Experiment. Despite the fact that they were innocent, not actual prisoners deserving of punishment, as the simulation progressed they increasingly accepted their abuse without protest. Of course while there are many factors contributing to the silence of sexual assault victims (social pressure, and the fear of losing their jobs among them), it is also true that many of these factors stem from the victim\u2019s powerless role, which is similar to the silence of the prisoners in Zimbardo\u2019s experiment. While the issue of sexual misconduct is complex and it is impossible to pinpoint any one cause, the findings of the SPE shed a startling light on the effect power has on both the victims and perpetrators of such a widespread epidemic.In the world we live in, fake news is becoming a threat to credibility. With the assistance of the Internet, no one can be completely sure what they are reading is accurate...During the Salem Witch trials in which The Crucible took place, news of witchcraft had spread like ivy. Accusations against Goody Proctor and Rebecca Nurse were the talk of the town not only in Salem, but also in neighboring towns. However, in the 1600\u2019s, people were not very educated and did not have much sense of the world; the majority of the townspeople of Salem and the neighboring towns believed everything they heard about witchcraft.Over the course of recent weeks, my AP World class has been conducting a mock trial to try Genghis Khan for being an uncivilized tyrant... As I did more research, not only for the trial but for a more personal understanding, I came across a New York Times article titled \u201cWhat Experts Know About Men Who Rape\u201d which went on to describe a study that took place to understand the science and psychology behind men that raped...Much like Genghis Khan, these men wanted power, especially if their sexual offenses were violent or aggressive. I believe that Genghis Khan was on a power trip and violated these poor innocent women to demean their societies and to show that he had enough power to do so.In the day and age of wealth, where consumerism is ubiquitous, it\u2019s become acceptable to compulsively fill desires through material gains, such as new clothes or electronics. After all, if we have the capability to harmlessly buy whatever we desire, then what\u2019s wrong with instant satisfaction?The problem is that we constantly reward ourselves, which in turn causes us to feel less grateful for items we receive. Just like the inhabitants of Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, we seek products to provide short bursts of satisfaction and often ignore more wholesome alternatives. Similar to the imaginary civilians in Brave New World, we are surrounded by consumables that are marketed for being quick: Amazon Prime, faster internet, minute-microwave rice, etc. Even subpar TV dinner can seem more attractive than a home cooked meal because of its immediate nature. However, better things come to those who wait.Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison\u2019s bildungsroman centered around an unnamed black protagonist (written to be symbolic of any black man), should not be relevant today. Ideally, Invisible Man should serve as a dated reminder of America\u2019s dark racial history; unfortunately, its underlying themes remain just as prevalent in today\u2019s world as they were when Ellison first released the novel 66 years ago. Charles M. Blow\u2019s Op-Ed \u201cA Rebel, a Warrior and a Race Fiend\u201d particularly highlights the similarities between the nameless protagonist\u2019s struggles and the deeply-embedded racism that still plagues modern America. Blow uses the racially-charged language of President Donald Trump towards black professional athletes to make a broader point about the \u201cracial inequities fused to the DNA of power in this country.\u201d The similarities drawn between Ellison\u2019s work, written in an overtly racist America, and Blow\u2019s contemporary opinion piece convey a depressing message regarding the glacial rate of social progress.Why is this [#MeToo] happening now? Why are all of these women all of a sudden sharing their stories? These questions seem to puzzle many, yet there is a simple answer: Newton\u2019s first two laws of motion can easily explain the growth of the #MeToo movement. Newton\u2019s first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force...While the initial force is debatable - whether it be President Trump\u2019s locker room talk, the growing women\u2019s rights movement, or simply women banding together against Harvey Weinstein - it is evident that a strong force had pushed this moment into action. The once silenced women now gained courage and support to speak up; this cause which was once at rest, is now in motion and will remain in motion.The unequal power dynamic that can exist between the oftentime male offender and female victim in these situations has been a pattern that has existed for generations, going as far back as Shakespearean times. This discussion of male power exerted over women plays out in Othello as we watch high-ranking, socially-influential men manipulate this power dynamic in their favor. As we see the mistakes of Venetian society, we remember our own as well.My junior year lit class focused on Shakespeare\u2019s Troilus and Cressida and the explicit objectification of women present throughout the play. The romance between idealistic Troilus and rational Cressida abruptly ends when Cressida is sold off forcefully to the enemy troop. In the fourth act however, the Greek soldiers welcome Cressida to the camp by doting her with compliments and kisses. The soldiers refer to her as \u201cmy fair lady\u201d and \u201csweet lady\u201d, neglecting the fact that they had ripped her out of her home and relationship against her will. This polite diction makes readers believe that Cressida is enjoying her time at the Greek camp, and we oversee the emotional torture she was forced to endure.Similar to Shakespeare\u2019s play, the reference to the sex slaves as \u201ccomfort women\u201d and \u201chalmonies\u201d impose a positive connotation on a subject that dare not be taken lightly, as we sometimes come to disregard the injustices these women endured.Considering that this play was written in the sixteenth century, during the Renaissance period, it is surprising and even baffling, that it is more relevant now than ever before. Today, everybody wants to be famous. Everyone wants to be noticed, loved and desired by everyone else. They want to raise eyebrows and swivel heads the moment they walk into a room and be important enough to make people stop chewing their food at the mention of their name.In Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play, Faustus\u2019 unbridled ambitions tragically lead to his downfall. After twenty-four years of enjoying all worldly pleasures, Lucifer along with his armada of devils drag Faustus into Hell for eternity as he cries out gut-wrenchingly.Sinking into pillows with a pair of fuzzy socks hugging my feet and the delicious aroma of cacao permeating the air, I lost myself in the world of \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Beyond the ball gowns and fancy cars, a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washed over me, and it wasn\u2019t due to the fact that I spent most of winter break in a similar position: curled up in bed, sipping hot chocolate. The real explanation was much less pleasant, as I realized that the same issues F. Scott Fitzgerald was commenting on in 1925 still exist today. We live in a society suffering from a severe lack of authenticity. There is no substance beneath our shiny exterior of purported principles. Maybe some of our historical documents provide a gilded barrier between what we say we represent and what we actually are. The article \u201cThe Heartbeat of Racism is Denial\u201d addresses this disparity between our stated beliefs and the reality of our condition.This poem describes a teacher who largely downplays the brutal and gruesome truths within history and even changes some history in order to protect the children\u2019s innocence. He describes the Ice Age as \u201cThe Chilly Age\u201d (3) and teaches that the \u201cEnola Gay dropped one tiny atom on Japan\u201d (12-13). This seems harmless and appears to keep the children happy and in a world of white picket fences, but the children in the poem are later on the playground \u201ctormenting the weak and the smart\u201d (15-16). The teacher\u2019s simplistic and inaccurate accounts of history is producing adverse effects on the children- information that is necessary for their educational growth and development has been kept from them, thus breeding ignorance, hatred, and violence.This same phenomenon is happening in current times as books are being banned from schools. This is a robbery of information, as most books that are banned include great lessons for children about the world and themselves.In Intuto, Peru, Amadeo Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda is the last man to speak the language of Taushiro, a language dating back centuries from the jungles of the Amazon. He hasn\u2019t had anyone to speak the language with, and it is highly likely that the language and culture will die with him. The last person Amadeo has spoken with in his native language was his brother, Juan, who died, along with his parents and others in his village, due to diseases such as malaria. Now that he is the last one, there is pressure on Amadeo to retain his culture and language....Learning a foreign language and learning the culture of another country will always have tremendous benefit, in all aspects of life and careers. We should never force someone to be in the position Amadeo is now in; we should work to maintain cultural diversity in order to benefit society and future generations.At the end of stories with important messages, there is a silence that speaks. Danish writer Karen Blixen\u2019s short story, The Blank Page, teaches this profound lesson. An old woman relays the advice her grandmother gave when teaching how to tell stories, \u201cWhere the storyteller is loyal...there, in the end, silence will speak.\u201d ...While in this tale the reluctance to represent every story comes from a place of shame, there are numerous reasons why some stories don\u2019t get told.These days, with access to thousands of news stories at any given moment, people have a nearly endless choice of what narratives to follow. In Nicholas Kristof\u2019s article My Worst Columns he writes about his least \u201cclicked on\u201d pieces for the New York Times website. All of his \u201cworst columns\u201d feature stories of injustice or of situations needing humanitarian attention. These are stories with a silence that speaks, but not that many people have ever read them....When Americans avoid reading stories that place, as Kristof puts it, \u201c...a spotlight on injustice or humanitarian need,\u201d they never get the silence that speaks, and choose instead brash, superficial noise. This is the narrative of 2017 America which focuses on the distracting, at-home crisis of Trump and disregards issues of worldly injustice.Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen 2000% in 2017; the newfound attention associated with this rise has brought record traffic levels to many cryptocurrency exchanges, many of them buckling under the pressure of thousands of market orders during highly volatile periods of trading. This meteoric and unsustainable rise has drawn many comparisons to famous speculative bubbles throughout history, but the most commonly referenced is the Tulip Mania experienced in 17th century Holland....While the comparison between Tulip Mania and Bitcoin may seem reasonable at first, given the unprecedented rise in bitcoin price combined with the hyper-speculative nature of Bitcoin itself, what sets bitcoin apart from the Tulip Bubble is its utility and widespread distribution. Unlike a Tulip a Bitcoin can be fractionalized, making it accessible to common folk even as the price increases. It can also be traded throughout the globe near-instantaneously using the blockchain, an incorruptible cloud based ledger system that records transactions in real time, all while continuously analyzing itself for errors...The comparison between Bitcoin and Tulip Mania is overblown and irresponsible for the press to be touting as it is a poor comparison to the history behind Tulip Mania.A recent opinion editorial piece titled \u201cMueller\u2019s Facts and Trump\u2019s Make-Believe\u201d discusses Donald Trump\u2019s contempt for the truth, especially in regards to maintaining his power, and how other political figures are influenced by his words and actions. This piece was written by Roger Cohen, published on December 5, 2017, and gives a general synopsis of the current state of Trump\u2019s presidency. However, it conveys the leader of the United States as a delusional, lying, and power driven similar to how Shakespeare conveyed Macbeth in his 17th century drama, Macbeth. The only difference between Cohen\u2019s portrayal of Trump and Shakespeare\u2019s portrayal of Macbeth is, Macbeth is a fictional character while Trump is actually the President of the United States.The motivations behind the Chinese Exclusion Act and President Trump\u2019s executive order are shockingly similar. Both were designed to limit the immigration of one particular ethnic group so those immigrants did not take jobs from the American population. But unlike the Chinese Exclusion Act, the president\u2019s executive order faced harsh criticism and was challenged in court on several occasions. It was repealed and replaced with another, less harsh version based on similar principles, which has again been challenged several times in court, eventually making its way up to the Supreme Court .Despite similarities between the two laws, the American people have learned a lot in the last 136 years. We\u2019ve learned that immigration doesn\u2019t hurt the economy - it might even help it. We\u2019ve learned that, true to American beliefs, the color of a person\u2019s skin or the religion they practice does not matter. In a time when increasing diversity and the equality of all people under the law is considered a good thing, Americans are unafraid to speak out for what they believe in and against what they don\u2019t.__________________Thank you, as always, to the teachers and students who took the time to participate.

{"Headline": "Review: When a Landscape (and Memory) Is All You Have", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt Review\u201cI wish that I had been born in Korea,\u201d the 11th-century Chinese poet Su Shi is said to have wept, \u201cso that I could see the Diamond Mountains in person!\u201dThis month\u2019s visitors to Pyeongchang will not be able to see them either. Mount Kumgang, just 90 miles as the crow flies from the Olympic Stadium, lies in North Korea \u2014 and, except during the years of Kim Dae-jung\u2019s Sunshine Policy, it has been impossible to travel there from the South (or, indeed, from almost anywhere). The mountains, central to the cultural history of both countries, have become a misty mirage in the South Korean imagination.You will find no photographs of the mountains in this show, nor in the insightful catalog. The museum relied on the South Korean government to assist with loans, so contemporary depictions of the North would have been touchy. But even now, when anyone can fly over Kumgang\u2019s peaks with Google Earth, these paintings offer a more complete view of the Korean landscape \u2014 where individual histories and national memories inform and reflect each other.If Korean painting has a golden age, it\u2019s the 18th and early 19th century; and if the golden age has a pre-eminent painter, it\u2019s Jeong. His paintings of the Diamond Mountains from 1711 are his earliest surviving works, and the suite alternates between painstaking depictions of specific mountain features and sweeping general views. In the album\u2019s first painting, he captures the dramatic sight of the dense, sparkling granite, whose peaks are as sharp as canine teeth, afloat in the negative space of the bronze silk ground.A subsequent painting in the album, of Buljeongdae Rock, a stark outcropping in the middle of Kumgang, sees Jeong render the white peaks in ink that fades from the top of the composition to the bottom, making the mountain range deliquesce as if in fog.In this album, as well as in later, brasher landscapes and in a scroll from later in the 18th century, Jeong made use of precise downward strokes for the mountain ridges, rather than gentle contours. For the vegetation on the peaks, he speckled the lines with countless perpendicular hyphens, each one a clear-cut act.By the 19th century, representations of the Diamond Mountains had extended past elite artists and the literati to folk figures, and a market for images of the peaks had taken hold. One of the surprises of this show is a folk painting, lent from Seoul\u2019s Leeum Samsung Museum of Art and nicknamed \u201cFireworks Kumgang,\u201d that forgoes the precision of Jeong\u2019s and Sin\u2019s visions for bizarrely isolated views arrayed with no regard for spatial hierarchies. The gray, crenelated clumps look little like mountains, and more like elephants on fire.The Japanese occupation of Korea, from 1910 to 1945, made visits to the Diamond Mountains more difficult. In 1918, the former court painter Jo Seokjin traveled to Kumgang and painted a 10-panel screen, whose more saturated passages of ink reflect western and Chinese artistic influences. The screen\u2019s most notable panel depicts the Nine-Dragon Falls, whose V-shaped valley gives onto a ripping white waterfall. He was not the only artist of the era enraptured by Nine-Dragon Falls.In 1921, Elizabeth Keith, a Scotswoman who was one of the very rare westerners to visit Japanese-occupied Korea, made a woodblock print of the gorge, whose rich greens and blues sharply contrast with the Korean grisailles. She took the name a bit too literally, adding in the nonet of dragons at swim in the pool of the waterfall and slithering through the trees on either side.With the division of the Korean Peninsula after World War II, Mount Kumgang receded into the imagination for artists from the South. The painter Lee Ungno never saw the mountains, but his expansive panorama of Kumgang (perhaps painted after he moved to Paris in 1958) offers a modern take on an old tradition. Dark principal strokes overlay sensitive passages of mauve and light blue, and while Lee favored far blotchier brushwork than in classical Korean painting, the vista is one that Jeong Seon would quickly recognize.Advertisement"}

In fact, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 2 percent the past two days despite the latest inflation data coming in much higher than expected.So what happened to those concerns about inflation? One explanation for why stock investors shrugged off the inflation data was a very weak report on retail sales. Investors seemed to take that as evidence the economy is not overheating and that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a very slow pace.Two weeks ago when the sell-off started, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow forecast for first-quarter G.D.P. fell to 3.25 percent from 5.4 percent two weeks ago.\u201cWhile it does appear that inflation is accelerating, it appears much less likely that the economy is really taking off and forcing the Fed into a more aggressive rate hiking cycle,\u201d write the strategists over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The bigger pictureA rising rate environment is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks. Jodie Gunzberg, the head of United States equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, points out that since 1971 the S&P 500:ProPublica\u2019s article centers on the bureau\u2019s handling of investigations into Wells Fargo. It reports that Mr. Mulvaney ordered restrictions on the accessing of personal data of Wells Fargo customers, a move that hampered the bureau\u2019s investigations. An exemption on the freeze was later granted to enforcement staff looking into Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance business. But ProPublica added:Mulvaney\u2019s order has had effects beyond enforcement, hampering the bureau\u2019s efforts to monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer protection rules and conduct research on financial products, according to several staffers. The freeze has even stymied state attorneys general, according to two C.F.P.B. staffers and one attorney for a state office.The tax overhaul requires funds to hold onto investments for three years to qualify for the lower rate. They\u2019ve been getting around it by creating single-member LLCs in Delaware to receive carried interest payouts.More from Miles Weiss of Bloomberg:Four LLCs have been created under the name of Elliott Management Corp., the hedge-fund giant run by Paul Singer. More than 70 have been established under the names of executives at Starwood Capital Group Management, the private-equity shop headed by Barry Sternlicht.The headline reason is his belief that Silicon Valley is too intolerant of conservatives and libertarians. But there\u2019s an interesting second reason in the article (emphasis added):The WSJ reports that Mr. Thiel will spend at least a bit more time working on a non-tech endeavor: a right-leaning media organization. He will still be involved in Founders Fund, the V.C. firm he co-founded, as well as stay on the boards of Facebook, the data consultancy Palantir and other tech companies.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cMy goal is to make it so the next generation grows up in a world where cancer is managed just like the common cold, and the body\u2019s natural regenerative engine remains empowered throughout our lives,\u201d said Dr. Hariri.Celgene, United Therapeutics, Sorrento Therapeutics, Human Longevity, the Dreyfus Family Office and Section 32 took part in the series-A funding.In other health care deal newsWhy? The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation report was higher than expected. But weaker retail sales tempered those fears \u2014 at least for equity investors.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeTo some, the bond market is a particularly prescient predictor of economic trends. So is it picking up on an inflationary surge that the Federal Reserve likely will take too long to recognize?But the overheating fears may be overdone. Yesterday\u2019s January inflation report was hardly conclusive. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that the January increase \u201cprobably overstates the underlying trend.\u201dStill, even though there are reasons to believe that while the U.S. economy is breaking out of its recent rut \u2014 thanks to big tax cuts and a revival of the global economy \u2014 it may not be as vibrant as it looks.The economic flyaroundNestl\u00e9 added that its future is likely to contain more deals in the several-hundred-million range of the Blue Bottle Coffee takeover. \u201cThe sweet spot is in small to mid-sized deals, but we don\u2019t want to rule out anything,\u201d its C.E.O., Mark Schneider, said.The deals flyaroundHe also offered this ambition: \u201cI want you to be able to take an Uber and get into the subway \u2014 if the trains are running on time, you\u2019ve got real-time data \u2014 get in the subway, get out and have an Uber waiting for you for right now. Or know that there\u2019s a bike right there for you that gets you where you\u2019re going in the fastest manner.\u201dWhether the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C. are the best venues for this type of regulation is something Congress will have to decide. Neither agency has experience in overseeing virtual currencies, so assigning responsibility to one (or both) will require increased appropriations to develop rules and effective oversight.\u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.

Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.\u2019s rule.The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: \u201cCourts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition\u2014tell the S.E.C.\u2014Congress imposed.\u201d By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers.One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don\u2019t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.\u2019s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation.\u2014 Peter J. HenningWhy?There didn\u2019t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish.Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday\u2019s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on.In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained.\u2014 Peter EavisBroadcom\u2019s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders. From the news release:Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS\u2019s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP\u2019s activist stockholders.Let\u2019s take a look at the math\u2022 Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price.\u2022 Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn\u2019t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year.The bet on the shareholder meetingBroadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm\u2019s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees.A Qualcomm representative didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe deals flyaroundLittle in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey\u2019s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cIf these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place.During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter.The tower would be the first major project under New York City\u2019s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area.Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software.Here\u2019s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor\u2019s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: \u201cWe are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.\u201dGlassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants.Skadden\u2019s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.The judge overseeing the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T\u2019s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not \u201cmade a credible showing\u201d that the White House had singled it out for retribution.The decision puts a crimp in AT&T\u2019s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal.AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list \u2014 but could call him during the trial if needed.The trial begins March 19.Symptom A: Albertsons buying Rite Aid to gain scale and enter the pharmacy businessSymptom B: Walmart\u2019s online sales growing just 23 percent in the fourth quarter, after it splashed out on Jet.com, Bonobos and more\u201cIt\u2019s the battle of the old generation versus the new generation,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. \u201cAnd right now the companies that are gaining share is the new generation.\u201dCritics\u2019 cornerElsewhere in Amazon newsFrom Peter Eavis:For the first time \u2014 and after much protest \u2014 public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of their C.E.O.s.

He and Hoover lived together in Los Angeles, New Orleans and then New York City. In 2013, they bought a ranch near Austin, and started raising two chickens, two goats \u2014 Biscuit and Bucket \u2014 and a family. By 2016 their brood had grown to include 10 cattle, three goats, chickens, ducks, geese, a guinea hen and a baby son. Holiday also has a 12-gauge shotgun, a .22-caliber rifle, a bow and arrow, and a .243 Winchester that he keeps by his bed to ward off coyotes.It is important for the book\u2019s readers to be aware that Holiday, the college dropout, is also a huge believer in Stoicism, an ancient Greek and Roman philosophy that preaches suffering, humility, acceptance and endurance without complaint. He became a zealot while at college after reading Marcus Aurelius\u2019 \u201cMeditations\u201d four times in a row and then affixing his favorite passages from the book to the walls of his dorm room. Holiday is nothing if not erudite; every time you turn around in \u201cConspiracy,\u201d he is trying to make profound points by quoting from a vast range of philosophers, statesmen and Great Thinkers \u2014 everyone from Machiavelli and Seneca to Kierkegaard and George W.S. Trow, and on and on.But incessant name-dropping aside \u2014 which tends to detract from his gripping narrative \u2014 Holiday has written one helluva page-turner. He documents how, starting in 2007, the secretive Thiel sought to take revenge on Denton for outing him on Gawker just because Denton could, and because he figured the news would generate the clicks and the kind of attention Denton and his erstwhile enterprise craved. Thiel, rightly offended, began a stealth campaign to punish Denton for his callous and cavalier behavior.When, in October 2012, Gawker made the momentous decision to publish without permission excerpts from a sex tape involving Hogan and his former best friend\u2019s wife, Thiel not only had the perfect protagonist in an equally angry and determined Hogan but also a legal theory based on the idea that Hogan\u2019s privacy had been invaded (as had Thiel\u2019s five years earlier). Unbeknown to Denton and his company\u2019s lawyers, Thiel had decided to bankroll Hogan in his legal battle against Gawker and Denton. In classic David and Goliath fashion, Denton tragically underestimated his foes and paid the iron price: As has been well documented elsewhere, Denton lost the five-count lawsuit in a Florida courtroom and was slapped with a $140 million verdict. Gawker Media had no choice but to file for bankruptcy; its carcass was sold to the highest bidder.To his considerable credit and for reasons that aren\u2019t entirely made clear, Holiday decided to write \u201cConspiracy\u201d after both Thiel and Denton approached him separately, wanting to share with him their views of the blockbuster case. He\u2019s less successful, it seems to me, in pushing his view throughout the book that Thiel, Mr. A, Hogan and Harder were involved in an old-fashioned \u201cconspiracy\u201d \u2014 in the Stoical sense of the word \u2014 to bring down Denton and his crew. Yes, they triumphed wildly, and beyond anything they could have expected. But couldn\u2019t that just be chalked up to having the better and more sympathetic legal argument rather than to having better tactics, strategies and a morally superior way of living?William D.

{"Headline": "Through a Tijuana Turnstile and Into Tacos and Tortas", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "On the BorderTijuana, steps away from San Diego, is full of flavor: birria tacos, Caesar\u2019s famous salads and creative Baja cuisine.Supported by\u201cYou\u2019re trying to kill me.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t an accusation, or even a question; just a matter-of-fact observation. My friend Shyema may never have actually been at risk of death, but I was about to find out if it was possible to lose a friend by overfeeding her.I hadn\u2019t intended to test the limits of a 12-year friendship when I proposed a weekend in Tijuana. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun,\u201d I promised. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch up. We\u2019ll eat tacos.\u201dAnd so Shyema and I focused on our taco crawl. I\u2019d spent weeks researching places to go in the border town, looking for landmarks, historic quarters, museums or pre-colonial ruins to cross off my tourist checklist. But instead, every tip yielded by my Google searches and interrogations of frequent Baja-goers came laden with calories. In Tijuana, the long lines are for taco stands, not monuments. So Shyema and I stepped through a turnstile in San Diego on a Friday afternoon and, with a quick glance by an official at our passports, walked into Mexico.That might come as news to people who still associate Tijuana with cartel clashes and mass executions. But as crime has gone down, tourism has gone up in recent years, and its proximity to Southern California makes it a popular jaunt for Los Angeles and San Diego residents who want to eat and drink well \u2014 and affordably \u2014 for a weekend, or even an afternoon. It\u2019s also a quick stop on the way to the wine lands of Valle de Guadalupe and the coastal town of Ensenada.Hopping between TJ \u2014 as it is commonly known by locals in Mexico and California \u2014 and San Diego is a way of life, as residents on both sides of the border crisscross for work, school, medical appointments and night life. Pursuits range from the divey to the thrifty in TJ: American teenagers partying on Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n; families stocking up on cheap groceries. If you live in the suburbs south of San Diego and have a Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection pass, which gives preapproved travelers expedited passage, it can be quicker to drive to Tijuana than downtown San Diego. This frequent back-and-forth makes this border crossing the busiest in the world, open 24 hours with 300,000 people passing through each day.Next, we walked to the kitschy restaurant La Corriente Cevicher\u00eda Nais and tried the Taco Kalifornia, shrimp and cheese stuffed in a pepper and shrouded in a tortilla, and a Pacifica Tostada, a ceviche of tuna, lemon juice, hot sauce, serrano peppers,and onions. Both were fiery and bright, with flavors hitting my tongue in unexpected places long after I\u2019d taken a bite.Light, flavorful, seafood-focused cuisine is Baja California\u2019s calling card. While the wall between Tijuana and San Diego \u2014 an imposing part of the landscape of this corner of the continent long before President Trump made it an issue in his campaign\u2014 clearly delineates a separation between the two countries, on the plate, lines are blurred and flavors are fluid. \u201cBaja cuisine is very much like California cuisine,\u201d Mr. Esparza said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cooking style that doesn\u2019t adhere to any kind of tradition. It\u2019s 100 percent Mexican, just not bound by any rules.\u201dCooks in Baja often eschew lard in favor of olive oil from area farms; wines from Valle de Guadalupe and oysters, sea urchin and the large clam geoduck from the ocean are on the menus. And the back-and-forth north to California has inspired chefs on both sides of the wall. San Diego has some of the best Mexican food outside Mexico, and the California city\u2019s booming craft brewery scene has spread south of the border.\u201cThe people who have restaurants in Baja, a lot of them grew up going between San Diego and Tijuana,\u201d Mr. Esparza said. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely that relationship between these two places.\u201d\u201cI opened Mision 19 seven years ago, when the city was not in good shape, when everything was happening,\u201d Mr. Plascencia said. \u201cWe thought if we open this restaurant, people will want to come and see that Tijuana is not going away, it\u2019s not going to die. It\u2019s going to get better.\u201dThe result is a modern celebration of Baja cuisine, the type of place where local residents come to mark a special occasion, perhaps over house-made pasta with octopus, beef fillet picadillo and Mexican chile peppers, or local tuna with cactus, xoconoxtle (a sour cactus fruit), black mole caramel and short-rib chicharron. \u201cBaja California is a young cuisine, not very traditional, and very creative,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s telling us how to cook or what to do.\u201dTras/Horizonte is the brainchild of chef Oso Campos, who, as he said, was \u201cborn and made in TJ\u201d but who has traveled extensively throughout Mexico and California. \u201cWe serve Mexican border cuisine,\u201d he said. \u201cUs as a people, we are a mix of all different cultures and lenguas. Tijuana is a young city trying to find its identity.\u201dThe city does seem to have a bit of a split personality: Centro, filled with cheap pharmacies and barbershops and street-food stalls, is gritty, but the landscape of the outlying suburbs is studded with shiny outposts of Costco, Office Max, Sears and IHOP, resembling a not-so-far-flung suburb of San Diego. Most businesses accept dollars, and even Uber has two faces: Riders can opt for Uber English, which guarantees English-speaking drivers at the same price as Spanish-speaking ones.\u201cWhen I told people I was going to Mexico, they laughed at me,\u201d Shyema said. \u201cThey said Tijuana wasn\u2019t Mexico proper.\u201d\u201cThey call Chula Vista the nicest neighborhood in TJ,\u201d said Gibran Huerta, a creative director in San Diego whose company has employees in both cities. I\u2019d run into him at One Bunk, which he\u2019d helped design. \u201cWhen you grow up in San Diego, you grew up with TJ in your life,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you live here you don\u2019t really see the border. It\u2019s a crazy cross-border lifestyle for those who aren\u2019t afraid to cross.\u201dOn Sunday, Mr. Huerta invited us to crash his group\u2019s breakfast plans. \u201cGo where the people are,\u201d he said, and according to him, that morning the people would be at an unassuming, unnamed cart at the intersection of Avenida C. Ni\u00f1os Heroes and Calle 4ta, which ladles vats of steaming hot birria, a beef stew from Mexico\u2019s Jalisco province. We weren\u2019t even sure if the stand would be there when we arrived, but there it was, doing brisk business at 10 a.m. on a Sunday. Mr. Huerta jostled through the crowd and ordered a round of tacos: heaps of birria encased in crunchy, flaky tortillas unlike any I\u2019ve ever eaten before.\u201cTijuana is not a picturesque place,\u201d said Mr. Huerta. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to eat, not to see.\u201dExcept there is one thing. While the specter of the wall looms large in politics, in Tijuana, it\u2019s been a fact of life since the 1990s. The border wall at Playas de Tijuana is not rhetoric but very real, an imposing slatted barrier 18 feet high that extends into the sea, separating Tijuana from San Diego County\u2019s Imperial Beach. On the Mexican side, it\u2019s a lively scene, with people gathering to walk on the beach, eat fresh coconuts, and take selfies with a wall covered in colorful murals. \u201cVive Libre Sin Muros.\u201d \u201cLove Trumps Hate.\u201d \u201cEarth Was Not Meant to Have Walls.\u201d And on each side of the wall, families who are separated by deportations and tenuous visa status gather for teary reunions through the barrier.\u201cWe\u2019ve been living with the wall all of our lives,\u201d Mr. Huerta said. \u201cTrump saying \u2018the wall, the wall\u2019 \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make a difference to us.\u201dShyema and I walked back the way we came, after a 40-minute wait at the pedestrian border crossing \u2014 not too bad for a Sunday afternoon. Our stomachs had survived Tijuana, and so had our friendship.An earlier version of this article misstated the level of violent crime in Tijuana.

These incidents are peculiarly American tragedies, and what\u2019s particularly heartbreaking is that they aren\u2019t shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the U.S. do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence.Two of the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history have occurred in the last six weeks. So let\u2019s not just mourn the dead, let\u2019s not just lower flags and make somber speeches. Let\u2019s also learn lessons from these tragedies, so that there can be fewer of them.

This has been spectacularly successful, reducing the death rate per 100 million miles driven by 95 percent since 1921.Take a look at the history of motor vehicle safety since World War II:Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.3581968  First federal safety standards for cars64201621.18\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910sDeaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.35First seatbelt offered in an American carFirst federal safety standards for cars81974  55 m.p.h. national speed limit1993  Car safety ratings introduced61978  Tennessee is first to require child safety seats1999  Airbags, invented in 1951, become mandatory1984  4New York is first to require seat belt use2000  Mandatory reporting of defects by carmakers201621.18\u201946\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s2000s\u201910s\u201916Frankly, liberal opposition to guns has often been ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive. The 10-year ban on assault weapons accomplished little, partly because definitions were about cosmetic features like bayonet mounts (and partly because even before the ban, such guns were used in only 2 percent of crimes).The left sometimes focuses on \u201cgun control,\u201d which scares off gun owners and leads to more gun sales. A better framing is \u201cgun safety\u201d or \u201creducing gun violence,\u201d and using auto safety as a model\u2014constant efforts to make the products safer and to limit access by people who are most likely to misuse them.What would a public health approach look like for guns if it were modeled after cars? It would include:If someone steals my iPhone, it\u2019s useless, and the same should be true of guns. Gun manufacturers made child-proof guns back in the 19th century (before dropping them), and it\u2019s time to advance that technology today. Some combination of smart guns and safe storage would also reduce the number of firearms stolen in the U.S. each year, now about 200,000, and available to criminals.We also need to figure out whether gun buybacks, often conducted by police departments, are cost-effective and help reduce violence. And we can experiment more with anti-gang initiatives, such as Cure Violence, that have a good record in reducing shootings.In Texas on Sunday, it seems that a man living near the church grabbed his gun and confronted the shooter after he left the church. It may be that this defensive use of a weapon saved lives, and the N.R.A. often hails this view that guns are necessary to counter gun violence.But really? Can anybody possibly see what unfolded in Texas as a success of gun policy?Percent of Households With Guns,by StateHawaiiMass.U.S. AVERAGE: 32% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE GUNS R.I.N.J.N.Y.Del.Conn.Ill.Calif.Fla.Md.Wash.N.H.Ind.OhioCo.Pa.IowaMinn.Ariz.Nev.N.D.Mich.Va.Ore.N.M.N.C.Tex.S.C.Neb.Kan.Ga.Mo.Okla.Wisc.La.Ky.UtahAla.MaineTenn.S.D.W.

The Las Vegas carnage, for example, might not have been prevented by any of the suggestions I make.That\u2019s true, and there\u2019s no magic wand available. Yet remember that although it is mass shootings that get our attention, they are not the main cause of loss of life. Much more typical is a friend who shoots another, a husband who kills his wife \u2013 or, most common of all, a man who kills himself. Skeptics will say that if people want to kill themselves, there\u2019s nothing we can do. In fact, it turns out that if you make suicide a bit more difficult, suicide rates drop.Here are the figures showing that mass shootings are a modest share of the total, and the same is true of self-defense \u2013 despite what the N.R.A. might have you believe.OTHER CAUSESDEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456VICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:OTHER CAUSESVICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589DEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:Yet while we should be moving toward sensible regulation, in fact we\u2019ve been moving in the opposite direction.

In 1995, Connecticut tightened licensing laws, while in 2007 Missouri  eased gun laws.The upshot? After tightening gun laws, firearm homicide rates dropped 40 percent in Connecticut. And after Missouri eased gun laws, gun homicide rates rose 25 percent.Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsEstimated change in\u201340%Estimated change in\u201315%Missouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change in+25%Estimated change in+16%Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsMissouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change inrate of gun homicide\u201340%+25%Estimated change inrate of gun suicide\u201315%+16%One of the lessons of gun research is that we often focus just on firearms themselves, when it may be more productive to focus on who gets access to them. A car or gun is usually safe in the hands of a 45-year-old woman with no criminal record, but may be dangerous when used by a 19-year-old felon with a history of alcohol offenses or domestic violence protection orders.Yet our laws have often focused more on weapons themselves (such as the assault weapons ban) rather than on access. In many places, there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms.In these two states, the laws affected access, and although there\u2019s some indication that other factors were also involved in Connecticut (and correlations don\u2019t prove causation), the outcomes are worth pondering.There\u2019s simply a scandalous lack of research on gun violence, largely because the N.R.A. is extremely hostile to such research and Congress rolls over. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did try to research gun violence, Congress responded by cutting its funding.Here is the American toll from four diseases and firearms over the years 1973-2012 \u2013 and the number of National Institutes of Health research grants to explore each problem over that same time.N.I.H. research awardsDiseaseNumber of casesRabies6556Polio266212Cholera400129Diphtheria1,33789Firearmsinjuries3>4 millionNumberof casesDiseaseN.I.H. research awardsRabies6589Polio266129Cholera400212Diphtheria1,33756Firearm Injuries3>4 millionOne approach that could reduce the abuse of guns is better training. As a 13-year-old farm boy in Oregon, I attended a N.R.A. gun safety class (which came with a one-year membership to the N.R.A., making me an N.R.A. alum who despises what that organization has become). These classes can be very useful, and audits found that more than 80 percent cover such matters as checking the gun to see if it\u2019s loaded, keeping one\u2019s finger off the trigger until ready to fire and being certain of the target.Yet the audits also suggest that trainers are more likely to advocate for the N.R.A. or for carrying guns than for, say, safe storage. This is a missed opportunity, for all classes should cover the risks of guns and alcohol, the risks of abuse with suicide and domestic violence, the need for safe storage, and so on. Here\u2019s what researchers found that the gun classes they audited actually covered:NOTDISCUSSEDPERCENT OF CLASSESWHERE DISCUSSEDTrainers encouragedgun carrying81%19Encouragedgun ownership7624Prevent unsupervisedaccess by children7030Encouraged gun usefor self-defense69316040Ricochet6040Theft preventionEncouraged membershipin gun-rights group5644Legal ramifications ofshooting in self-defense55455347Child access lawsRecommendation: whennot in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: usegun only as last resort4555Young childrenand gun accidents55457030Decision-making in crisesTheft is important sourceof firearms used in crime8020Techniques forde-escalating threats8515Recommendation:report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicidein household members90109010Domestic violence riskTopic discussedPercent of classes where discussedNot discussedTrainers encouraged gun carrying1981%Encouraged gun ownership2476Prevent unsupervised access by children3070Encouraged gun use for self-defense3169Ricochet4060Theft prevention4060Encouraged membership in gun-rights group4456Legal ramifications of shooting in self-defense4555Child access laws4753Recommendation: when not in use, store unloaded5050Recommendation: use gun only as last resort5545Young children and gun accidents5545Decision-making in crises7030Theft is an important source of firearms used in crime8020Techniques for de-escalating threats8515Recommendation: report stolen firearms9010Watch for signs of suicide in household members9010Domestic violence risk9010It may sometimes seem hopeless to make progress on gun violence, especially with the N.R.A. seemingly holding Congress hostage. But I\u2019m more optimistic.Look, we all agree on some kinds of curbs on guns. Nobody believes that people should be able to drive a tank down Main Street, or have an anti-aircraft gun in the backyard. I\u2019ve been to parts of northern Yemen where one could actually buy a tank or an anti-aircraft gun, as well as fully automatic weapons \u2014 and that area\u2019s now embroiled in a civil war \u2013 but fortunately in America we have agreed to ban those kinds of weaponry.So the question isn\u2019t whether we will restrict firearms, but where to draw the line and precisely which ones to restrict.Check out these polling numbers as a basis for action on gun safety:Agree with the following:Householdswith no gunsGun households50%Background checksfor all gun buyers93%96%Preventing mentally ill from buying guns8989Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289Ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines(10+ bullets)*5277Householdswith no gunsGun householdsAgree with the following:50%93%Background checks for all gun buyers96%89Preventing the mentally ill from buying guns89Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289A ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines (10+ bullets)*5277Looking ahead, I\u2019m optimistic that there can be progress at the state level, and some of the necessary research funding will come from private foundations. Maybe some police departments will put in orders for smart guns to help create a market.But the real impetus for change will come because the public favors it. In particular, note that 93 percent of people even in gun households favor universal background checks for gun purchases.The terrible truth is that Wednesday\u2019s school shooting was 100 percent predictable. So is the next one. After each such incident, we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims, but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability.Some of you will protest (as President Trump did the last time) that it\u2019s too soon to talk about guns, or that it is disrespectful to the dead to use such a tragedy to score political points. Yet more Americans have died from gun violence, including suicides, since 1970 (about 1.4 million) than in all the wars in American history going back to the Revolutionary War (about 1.3 million). And it\u2019s not just gang members: In a typical year, more preschoolers are shot dead in America (about 75) than police officers are.Yes, making America safer will be hard: There are no perfect solutions. The Second Amendment is one constraint, and so is our polarized political system and the power of the gun lobby. There\u2019s a lot of talk about banning assault weapons, for example, but the 10-year assault weapons ban didn\u2019t accomplish much for reducing gun violence, partly because defining assault weapons proved to be much more complex than anybody had anticipated (in the end, the definition depended partly on cosmetic features). And new restrictions have limited effectiveness because we have delayed so long that there are already so many guns out there. So it\u2019s unclear how effective some of my suggestions will be, and in any case this will be a long, uncertain, uphill process.But automobiles are a reminder that we can chip away at a large problem through a public health approach: Just as auto safety improvements have left us far better off, it seems plausible to some gun policy experts that a sensible, politically feasible set of public health steps could over time reduce firearm deaths in America by one-third \u2014 or more than 10,000 lives saved each year.So let\u2019s not just shed tears for the dead, give somber speeches and lower flags. Let\u2019s get started and save lives. Let\u2019s not accept that school classrooms can turn any moment into war zones.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s 2020 Campaign Announcement Had a Very Trumpian Rollout", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With just 980 days to go until the next presidential election, President Trump said Tuesday that he would run again in 2020, an announcement that several White House advisers said simply meant the president would step up his preferred and much-missed activity of performing for an adoring crowd.In effect, it continues the permanent campaign of a president who, from the time he took office over a year ago, has signaled his interest to run again and has kept holding campaign-style rallies. The president officially filed for re-election with the Federal Election Commission on Jan. 20, 2017, the day of his inauguration.But another part of Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement \u2014 that Brad Parscale, his 2016 campaign digital director, would be elevated to campaign manager \u2014 signaled a more complicated political maneuver on behalf of the president\u2019s family, and specifically Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, according to the president\u2019s advisers.Mr. Parscale did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, but in an interview with The New York Times in June, he described himself as a \u201cblue-collar kid from Kansas who understood what Trump was saying,\u201d and spoke at length about his devotion to the Trump family.\u201cI was always the family guy on the campaign,\u201d Mr. Parscale said. \u201cIf I saw or heard anything that I didn\u2019t think was good for the family, my loyalty was to the family first.\u201dIn another interview, in August, Mr. Parscale described his role on the 2016 campaign.\u201cI build the plumbing,\u201d he said. \u201cI changed the plumbing of campaigns, from moving it from TV to digital.\u201dKellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2016 and now a counselor to the president, described Mr. Parscale as an \u201cunbroken thread\u201d from that campaign. \u201cIt should surprise no one that family members and a major player who has not come inside the administration would be called upon to redouble that effort for the re-elect,\u201d Ms. Conway said.Last year Mr. Parscale also took a sizable cut from the Trump campaign. The biggest single expenditure of the $17 million it spent in 2017 was the $5.5 million it paid for digital advertising, nearly all of which passed through firms owned by Mr. Parscale.The campaign\u2019s announcement made a point of emphasizing Mr. Parscale\u2019s loyalty to the Trump family. The statement featured quotations from Mr. Kushner and Eric Trump, the president\u2019s middle son, who, along with his wife, Lara, and older brother, Donald Jr., have been active in the campaign.Mr. Kushner said Mr. Parscale \u201cwas essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run,\u201d adding, \u201cHis leadership and expertise will help build a best-in-class campaign.\u201dEric Trump described Mr. Parscale as \u201can amazing talent\u201d and said he \u201chas our family\u2019s complete trust and is the perfect person to be at the helm of the campaign.\u201dThe specifics of Mr. Parscale\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, including his tactics to reach voters using social media platforms, has also been of interest to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Last year, he agreed to meet with the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.President Trump may be itching to hit the campaign trail, where he is happiest, but the White House still has a rail-thin political operation. Despite efforts to hire new staff members, it has struggled for months to catch up to speed. And on Tuesday, the West Wing was set to lose another key aide: Mr. Kushner\u2019s spokesman, Josh Raffel, said he would be departing.The 2020 campaign announcement, as is common in Trump world, didn\u2019t quite go off without a hitch: For starters, it initially alarmed ethics experts, who said its description of Mr. Kushner as \u201csenior adviser and assistant to the president, and President Trump\u2019s son-in-law,\u201d was in violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits political activities by government employees. The announcement was later edited to remove \u201csenior adviser.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got a campaign that\u2019s obsessed with campaigning and doesn\u2019t even know what the Hatch Act rules are around Jared Kushner,\u201d Richard W. Painter, who served as a White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any idea what the rules are, and they really don\u2019t care.\u201dKatie Rogers reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

{"Headline": "Google Chrome Now Blocks Irksome Ads. That\u2019s a Good Thing, Right?", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingAs advertising has become more intrusive in recent years, hundreds of millions of web users have installed ad-blocking software to ward off full-page pop-ups, blaring video pitches that start automatically and large ads with unstoppable countdown clocks that obscure the content you actually want to see.On Thursday, Google did something about the problem: The company updated its browser, Google Chrome, so that it bans such ads by default on mobile devices and desktop computers.The change will probably improve the average person\u2019s internet day \u2014 and give the tech giant an even greater role in shaping the web.The update to Chrome, first announced last year, is not a universal ad-blocker, the company insisted, but a filter. It will affect only those websites that allow four types of desktop ads and eight types of mobile ads that violate the standards established by a group called the Coalition for Better Ads, of which Google is a member (as is Facebook).For the most part, the update has been embraced by the industry. After all, it seems like a win for publishers, quality advertisers and users alike.But Google did not become the creator of the world\u2019s most popular browser and a dominant advertising force by running its business in a manner that did not serve its own interests.With the Chrome update, the company hopes to come out ahead by lessening the temptation of web users to install more comprehensive ad-blocking software. In other words, Google is betting that ridding the web of especially intrusive ads will render it more hospitable to advertising in general \u2014 and more profitable for advertisers and Google itself.Utilizing Chrome\u2019s popularity in this way is yet another example of Google\u2019s singular position in the modern web.\u201cChrome literally exists to protect Google\u2019s advertising business,\u201d said Mark Mayo, a vice president at Mozilla, the company behind the web browser Firefox, a competitor to Chrome. \u201cGoogle has done a tremendous amount of stuff \u2014 their products are web-based \u2014 and probably most of it positive, but what we\u2019ve also seen, obviously, is a tremendous centralization.\u201d\u201cGoogle exploiting its browser dominance to shape the conditions of the advertising market raises some concerns,\u201d the foundation said.It took some time for Adblock Plus, which makes popular ad-blocking software that can be installed on Google Chrome, to figure out which types of ads, exactly, Google would be filtering, according to a company spokesman, Ben Williams. Once Adblock Plus had a firm idea, it determined that the update will not risk losing the interest of the tens of millions people who use its ad-blocking software.\u201cIt\u2019s laudable, what they\u2019re doing, getting rid of the worst of the worst formats,\u201d Mr. Williams said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it will cause people not to download ad blockers or to uninstall them.\u201dLikewise, Mozilla, which is paid by Google for traffic sent to its search engine through Firefox, depends on the company for much of its revenue.As of Friday, Google said that 65 percent of the sites with ads that were out of compliance with the new rules had already made changes to go along with them. Forbes, which has long greeted visitors with an inspirational quote built into an ad equipped with a countdown clock, was among them.\u201cA few months ago, we had one minor infraction, which we immediately fixed, and we are now compliant,\u201d said Laura Daunis Brusca, a Forbes spokeswoman.The Accelerated Mobile Pages framework provides standard formats for websites \u2014 including one for mobile websites to display Google Stories, a Google initiative that is very much like Snapchat Stories \u2014 as well as guidelines and limits for displaying advertising. The newly announced \u201cAMP for email\u201d project will allow users to complete tasks \u2014 such as submitting an RSVP or filling out a questionnaire \u2014 within Gmail.Publishers and advertisers have responded warmly to the speedy load times made possible by the Accelerated Mobile Pages program, but its adoption has also been rewarded more directly. According to Chartbeat, Google Mobile Search traffic to publishers that do not use Accelerated Mobile Pages has been flat over the past year, while publishers that have adopted the technology saw a jump of 100 percent in their mobile referrals from Google.With each improvement \u2014 whether it is the zapping of irksome ads or the restructuring of how mobile sites work \u2014 Google is continuing to consolidate its power over the web, which has lost its centrality in the modern internet ecosystem to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat.So far, what has been good for users has tended to be good for Google, and the other way around. But the collision of the old notion of the web as a free and open space and the reality of it as a digital territory increasingly colonized by commercial interests has provoked worry among some users.Scott Spencer, a director of product management at Google, said the company is sensitive to consumers\u2019 growing awareness of its power. \u201cGoogle is not neutral when it comes to the open web,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a search company, we want to ensure that there is a healthy and sustainable web for people to be searching and getting information from. We\u2019re also obviously an ad-serving company.\u201dHe framed Chrome\u2019s ad filter as the latest in a series of the browser\u2019s positive innovations, spanning back to the pop-up ad blocker in its original incarnation a decade ago and including more recent security protections against scams and malware.Mr. Spencer compared the web to a series of roads crowded by people trying to get to work. \u201cAt some point someone has the idea that we need to put in some traffic lights,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody likes waiting for the light, but everyone appreciates not getting stuck in traffic.\u201dGoogle is in a position to install and operate the traffic lights \u2014 with outside input, of course. It also raises questions about what sort of actor Google is on the web. Is it a government? A budding monopoly? A reluctant leader? All three?\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be doing this alone,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cWe understand the concerns that exist, and we want to make sure that other voices have a channel and are being heard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s Week in Tech: HomePod Whiffs, but Elon Musk Does Not", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsGood morning! Let\u2019s talk about tech.The HomePod reviews are in, and the verdict is: It\u2019s middling!Apple\u2019s smart speaker was originally due to ship last year. Now, after a delay and lots of speculation that it would face a rough go against Amazon\u2019s Echo, Apple\u2019s device is finally on sale.But most reviewers appraising the device this week suggested that it was best to wait. There are some interesting features in HomePod, but it has a long way to go to beat the competition.What doesn\u2019t it do well? Pretty much everything else, reviewers said. It\u2019s expensive \u2014 $349 versus $85 for an Echo. It\u2019s locked into Apple\u2019s music service, while competing systems let you play songs from a variety of sources.And most frustratingly, it\u2019s not very smart. Where Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s devices can answer a variety of questions and perform lots of different tasks (like order up an Uber or Lyft), HomePod\u2019s brain, Siri, needs evolution. Brian was particularly upset that the device kept playing music he didn\u2019t like. And for Nilay, the biggest complaint was that HomePod couldn\u2019t set two timers at once \u2014 basically table stakes in the smart speaker game.None of these are fatal. Siri is a cloud-based service, which means Apple can keep improving it from afar. Echo, too, wasn\u2019t so great to begin with. So I wouldn\u2019t count Apple out. The smart assistant war has barely started.Travis Kalanick took the stand, drank a whole lot of water, offered his thoughts on greed and Google, and introduced the world to the crazy lexicon of tech bros: \u201cunpumped,\u201d \u201cangsty\u201d and, most mysteriously of all, \u201claser is the sauce.\u201dAt the heart of the case is one question: Did Uber steal trade secrets from Waymo, Google\u2019s self-driving car spin-off, when it purchased Otto, a self-driving company founded by former employees of Waymo?The trial is expected to go on for weeks, but early on, Waymo seemed to score some wins. Kalanick conceded that during a \u201cjam sesh\u201d with Anthony Levandowski, the former Waymo engineer alleged to have stolen its secrets, he discussed the key technology at issue in the case, laser sensors. That\u2019s apparently when Kalanick jotted a note that included his conclusion that \u201claser is the sauce\u201d \u2014 it suggested Levandowski had convinced Kalanick of the importance of Waymo\u2019s tech.I\u2019m sure Uber\u2019s lawyers were unpumped about that.Here\u2019s something noteworthy from social media land. Snap and Twitter have long appeared at a disadvantage to the 800-pound social media gorilla, Facebook, and the smaller companies\u2019 financial results often proved it.There\u2019s some serious stuff here. This is the biggest rocket ever launched by a private company, and it paves the way for an even-larger rocket planned by Musk, called B.F.R., which could help realize Musk\u2019s dream of colonizing Mars. (As my colleague Kenneth Chang explained in this family-friendly newspaper about B.F.R.: \u201cThe B stands for big; the R for rocket.\u201d)But let\u2019s forget the serious stuff for a second. Look at the video of the Tesla\u2019s flight. What a world!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Settling With Uber, Waymo Faces Bigger Challenges", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow for Waymo, which grew out of Google\u2019s seminal autonomous vehicle project and is nearly a decade into an effort that aims to change the very nature of transportation, a much bigger fight looms outside the courtroom.Waymo\u2019s competition extends well beyond Uber \u2014 and a good part of that competition is directed by engineers it used to employ. Much of the artificial intelligence technology that has come out of Waymo\u2019s work and from research run by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is now available from other sources, making it easier for companies, even start-ups, to compete.\u201cWaymo may have a technical advantage,\u201d said Jason Doran, who helped run the delivery service Sidecar and joined General Motors when the carmaker acquired the start-up. \u201cBut they have to figure out a business model.\u201dIt is not uncommon for a tech pioneer to miss out on becoming the company that cashes in on the technology it has been working on. The industry is littered with stories of people with a great idea that someone else turned into a great business.The concept for the databases used by most of the world\u2019s big corporations came out of IBM. But another company, Oracle, turned that software into a big business. Researchers at the Silicon Valley lab of Xerox famously pioneered the technology that went into many of Apple\u2019s computers.And executives at Alphabet would certainly remember that Google was hardly the first internet search engine. It was just better than anything that came before it.Other than an ownership stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, that came with settling the lawsuit, Waymo has not made substantial money from those years of research.That is worth noting, because so many of the companies competing with Waymo are relying on the brainpower of its former employees. Dave Ferguson, a former Waymo engineer, oversees a start-up called Nuro, which is building a driverless car for shipping and delivering goods. Chris Urmson, a longtime Waymo engineer, is the chief executive of a start-up called Aurora. Brian Salesky, a third Waymo engineer, is now at Argo, an autonomous vehicle start-up backed by $1 billion in funding from Ford Motor.The question was whether he took trade secrets with him. Waymo accused Uber of conspiring with Mr. Levandowski to steal its trade secrets and feed them into a driverless car project already underway inside the ride-hailing company. With Friday\u2019s settlement, Uber has promised that its cars will operate without the help of Waymo\u2019s intellectual property.There are other issues for Waymo. Unlike Ford, General Motors or Toyota, Waymo does not manufacture and sell cars. Unlike Uber and Lyft, it does not operate a vast ride-hailing services where it could readily deploy vehicles equipped with its own self-driving technology.As the big automakers and the ride-hailing companies accelerate their self-driving projects, Waymo may need to find a way of inserting itself into these efforts or to build and operate a new self-driving service of its own.\u201cThere\u2019s the self-driving tech. But you also have to scale that tech. And you have to offer a service that people really want to use,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cYou have to get all of that right.\u201dWaymo executives were not available for interviews for this article. John Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, is scheduled to speak on Monday evening at a conference on artificial intelligence hosted by The New York Times.\u201cWaymo has the partnerships and technology needed to launch the world\u2019s first self-driving service this year,\u201d a Waymo spokesman said in a statement, pointing to how the company has fully self-driving cars on some public roads, has secured vehicles from Fiat Chrysler and has partnered with Avis, AutoNation, Lyft and others. \u201cAfter years of research and development, Waymo is now focused on operations and deployment.\u201dWhen Waymo was still operating under Google, its head start in this race was obvious. Google began testing its self-driving prototypes on public roads in 2010, and this is what set off so many other efforts.\u201cThis is profoundly important,\u201d said Mr. Urmson of Aurora, which is supplying self-driving technology to Volkswagen, Audi and Hyundai. \u201cWe can build on top of that revolution.\u201dThese techniques are spreading across the industry. And anyone can immediately tap into enormous amounts of computing power through cloud services operated by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and, yes, Google.Many car manufacturers believe they will eventually catch up because they can deploy so many more cars equipped with sensors that can record real-world activity.\u201cWhat the car companies have is the potential to harvest more data than anyone else,\u201d Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, the Silicon Valley research and development operation created by the Japanese car company, said in an interview last fall. \u201cIt may be this that matters the most.\u201dWaymo is unlikely to manufacture its own cars. But it may end up running its own self-driving service. Alphabet recently led a $1 billion investment in Lyft, and it could deploy its driverless cars through this existing ride-hailing option. Waymo is also running a private trial of its cars near Phoenix, and it has long hinted that it will offer some sort of undefined public service in the area.Operating this kind of service is no small thing, and some question whether Waymo is equipped to do so. \u201cThis is where the Ubers and the Lyfts have an advantage,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.He cautioned that the departures from Waymo may have an unintended consequence for the entire industry: Many smart people are needed in the same place to figure things out.\u201cYou need to have a lot of the best minds together to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my fears is that we have spread the field a little thin. As a result, we have actually slowed down the speed with which we can solve this problem.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Monitor Fake News", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The indictment of 13 Russians filed on Friday by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, details the secret workings of the Internet Research Agency, an organization in St. Petersburg, Russia, that disseminates false information online. According to American intelligence officials, the Kremlin oversaw this shadowy operation, which made extensive use of social media accounts to foster conflict in the United States and erode public faith in its democracy.But the Kremlin\u2019s operation relied on more than just its own secrecy. It also benefited from the secrecy of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Their algorithms for systematically targeting users to receive certain content are off limits to the public, and the output of these algorithms is almost impossible to monitor. The algorithms make millions of what amount to editorial decisions, pumping out content without anyone fully understanding what is happening.The editorial decisions of a newspaper or television news program are immediately apparent (articles published, segments aired) and so can be readily analyzed for bias and effect. By contrast, the editorial decisions of social media algorithms are opaque and slow to be discovered \u2014 even to those who run the platforms. It can take days or weeks before anyone finds out what has been disseminated by social media software.The Mueller investigation is shining a welcome light on the Kremlin\u2019s covert activity, but there is no similar effort to shine a light on the social media algorithms that helped the Russians spread their messages. There needs to be. This effort should begin by \u201copening up\u201d the results of the algorithms.In computer-speak, this \u201copening up\u201d would involve something called an open application programming interface. This is a common software technique that allows different programs to work with one another. For instance, Uber uses the open application programming interface of Google Maps to get information about a rider\u2019s pickup point and destination. It is not Uber\u2019s own mapping algorithm, but rather Google\u2019s open application programming interface, that makes it possible for Uber to build its own algorithms for its distinctive functions.The government should require social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to use a similar open application programming interface. This would make it possible for third parties to build software to monitor and report on the effects of social media algorithms. (This idea has been proposed by Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian Google employee who helped organize the Tahrir Square uprising in 2011.)Media watchdog groups have long been able to assess the results of the editorial decisions of newspapers and television. Whether those stories express the left, right or center of the political spectrum, they are openly available to independent organizations that want to understand what is being communicated.Extending this practice to social media would mean that a watchdog group could create software to analyze and make public whatever information from the platforms it might consider important: the demographics of the readership of a certain article, for instance, or whether a fake story continued to be widely disseminated even after being debunked.After the Mueller indictment, Twitter issued a statement noting that technology companies \u201ccannot defeat this novel, shared threat alone\u201d \u2014 referring to efforts like the Russian disinformation campaign. \u201cThe best approach,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cis to share information and ideas to increase our collective knowledge, with the full weight of government and law enforcement leading the charge against threats to our democracy.\u201dThis is true. And one effective form of information-sharing would be legally mandated open application programming interfaces for social media platforms. They would help the public identify what is being delivered by social media algorithms, and thus help protect our democracy.Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017, is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a fellow at Harvard Kennedy School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Real Digital Divide", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBut there\u2019s more to the problem. If you think middle-class children are being harmed by too much screen time, just consider how much greater the damage is to minority and disadvantaged kids, who spend much more time in front of screens.According to a 2011 study by researchers at Northwestern University, minority children watch 50 percent more TV than their white peers, and they use computers for up to one and a half hours longer each day. White children spend eight hours and 36 minutes looking at a screen every day, according to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, while black and Hispanic children spend 13 hours.In 2004, Dimitri Christakis of Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital wrote in the medical journal Pediatrics that \u201cearly exposure to television was associated with subsequent attentional problems.\u201d Even when controlling for socioeconomic status, gestational age and other factors, he discovered that an increase of one standard deviation in the number of hours of television watched at age 1 \u201cis associated with a 28 percent increase in the probability of having attentional problems at age 7.\u201dUnfortunately, too often the message we send low-income and less-educated parents is that screen time is going to help their children. Fifteen years ago, when I was a Big Sister to a girl who attended one of Brooklyn\u2019s worst middle schools, her mother was given strict instructions by teachers to purchase a faster computer as soon as possible to get her daughter\u2019s grades up. Today, thanks to lucrative contracts with school districts, tech companies are happy to bring screens into the classroom and send them home.But there is little evidence that such programs are helping students. Take Maine, which guarantees a tablet for every student. According to NPR, \u201cat a cost of about $12 million annually,\u201d the state \u201chas yet to see any measurable increases on statewide standardized test scores.\u201dWhen politicians and policymakers talk about kids and technology, it is usually about \u201cbridging the digital divide,\u201d making sure that poor kids have as much access as wealthier ones. But there is no evidence that they don\u2019t. According to a 2015 Pew report, 87 percent of Americans between the ages of 13 and 17 have access to a computer. For families earning less than $50,000 a year, that number is 80 percent. As for a racial divide, Pew finds that African-American teenagers are more likely to own a smartphone than any other group of teenagers in America.These facts have not been allowed to get in the way of the shiny-new-things approach to learning. In 2014, New York received a half-million-dollar grant to lend internet hot spots to low-income families. According to the Urban Libraries Council, such lending programs are \u201cthe latest buzz.\u201d Similar programs have begun in Chicago, Seattle and St. Paul, with funding coming from Google and other companies.But no one is telling poorer parents about the dangers of screen time. For instance, according to a 2012 Pew survey, just 39 percent of parents with incomes of less than $30,000 a year say they are \u201cvery concerned\u201d about this issue, compared with about six in 10 parents in higher-earning households.Make no mistake: The real digital divide in this country is not between children who have access to the internet and those who don\u2019t. It\u2019s between children whose parents know that they have to restrict screen time and those whose parents have been sold a bill of goods by schools and politicians that more screens are a key to success. It\u2019s time to let everyone in on the secret.Advertisement"}

The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note rose above 2.9 percent on Wednesday, well above the 2.4 percent at which it finished last year.Indeed, the index overshot expectations because two items \u2014 clothing and medical services \u2014 had very strong increases, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. Clothing was due for a big rebound because it seemed to lag a lot in recent months, Pantheon asserted. As for medical services, the jump there came from hospital costs, which Pantheon described as \u201cvery erratic.\u201dThe analysts at Hoisington Investment Management have in recent years highlighted stubborn weaknesses in the United States economy, and the firm still sees significant problems.

{"Headline": "Early Facebook and Google Employees Form Coalition to Fight What They Built", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A group of Silicon Valley technologists who were early employees at Facebook and Google, alarmed over the ill effects of social networks and smartphones, are banding together to challenge the companies they helped build.The campaign, titled The Truth About Tech, will be funded with $7 million from Common Sense and capital raised by the Center for Humane Technology. Common Sense also has $50 million in donated media and airtime from partners including Comcast and DirecTV. It will be aimed at educating students, parents and teachers about the dangers of technology, including the depression that can come from heavy use of social media.\u201cWe were on the inside,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former in-house ethicist at Google who is heading the new group. \u201cWe know what the companies measure.

Its first project to reform the industry will be to introduce a Ledger of Harms \u2014 a website aimed at guiding rank-and-file engineers who are concerned about what they are being asked to build. The site will include data on the health effects of different technologies and ways to make products that are healthier.Mr. Steyer said, \u201cYou see a degree of hypocrisy with all these guys in Silicon Valley.\u201dThe new group also plans to begin lobbying for laws to curtail the power of big tech companies. It will initially focus on two pieces of legislation: a bill being introduced by Senator Edward J.

{"Headline": "Dropbox Files for I.P.O., and Other \u2018Unicorns\u2019 Are Watching", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, it has long been a guessing game about which of the most richly valued technology start-ups would be next to test the public markets.While Dropbox may not have the glamour of a ride-hailing app like Uber or a streaming music service like Spotify \u2014 both of which are likely initial public offering prospects \u2014 the company is in the same broad group known as \u201cunicorns,\u201d which are start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by the private investors that have so far funded their growth. How Dropbox fares as it goes public could help determine whether other unicorns follow suit.Still, the public offering market has gotten off to a fast start this year, with some 34 companies raising $11.87 billion in the public markets to date, according to Dealogic, a data provider. This comes despite a bout of stock market volatility this month that briefly sent the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down more than 10 percent from its high in late January.\u201cWe\u2019ve been hoping that 2018 and 2019 would be the big year for tech and the unicorn class,\u201d said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, a firm that provides data on the public offering market. \u201cDropbox is definitely going to be a milestone.\u201dGoldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank are among the banks underwriting Dropbox\u2019s offering. A spokeswoman for Dropbox declined to comment.Since then, Dropbox, which is based in San Francisco, has grown into one of the leading file-syncing services, though it faces stiff competition from Google, Microsoft and others. In its filing, Dropbox said it had more than 500 million registered users, more than 11 million of whom paid for the service.Last year, the company lost $112 million, compared with $210 million the previous year. Its revenue rose to $1.11 billion last year from $845 million the year before.Whether Dropbox can support a high valuation in the stock market is unclear. Its closest point of comparison, a Silicon Valley storage company called Box, has a market capitalization of about $3.2 billion on annual revenue of about $400 million.Dropbox said in its filing that it expected its expenses to rise, and it said its revenue growth rate had slowed.Still, when it goes public, Dropbox will be an important moment, including for early investors \u2014 such as venture capitalists \u2014 who have pumped billions of dollars into an array of tech ventures and expect a return when the companies reach the stock market.Sequoia Capital, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm, is the largest institutional shareholder in Dropbox, with about 23 percent of its shares, and another investment firm, Accel, holds just over 5 percent, according to the company\u2019s filing.The biggest owners of Dropbox stock are its founders. Mr. Houston, 34, holds about 25 percent of the company\u2019s shares, and Mr. Ferdowsi, 32, holds just under 10 percent.At M.I.T., Mr. Houston, who belonged to the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, would head to the roof of the fraternity\u2019s building and sit on a folding nylon chair reading business and marketing books.\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to get my M.B.A. on the roof of Phi Delta Theta, but that\u2019s what happened,\u201d he said, speaking to M.I.T.\u2019s graduating class in 2013.Mr. Houston took a year off after his sophomore year and started an SAT prep company called Accolade with his former high school teacher Andrew Crick. The start-up did not work out, and Mr. Houston went back to school. After graduating, he repeatedly forgot to carry his USB memory sticks and said that inspired him to try to store files in the cloud.So he tapped Mr. Ferdowsi, still a student at M.I.T., to be his co-founder. The team received funding from Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley start-up incubator, becoming one of the firm\u2019s most successful investments.On Friday, in a founders\u2019 letter that accompanied their filing, Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi wrote about how they started Dropbox with the idea \u201cthat life would be better if our most important information lived in the cloud.\u201dAs their business has grown and more people have adopted their technology, Dropbox\u2019s mission has now become \u201cabout keeping people in sync \u2014 connecting people and their most important information,\u201d the duo wrote.Nellie Bowles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Criminals Hide Their Data Overseas", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsAmerican efforts to investigate crime and terrorism are increasingly impeded by a lack of access to data stored outside the country, even when it is held by companies subject to United States jurisdiction. Britain and other allied foreign governments face similar problems. All too often, officials in one country investigating a serious crime with victims in that very same country cannot get data they need simply because it is on a server halfway across the world. The internet is moving fast, and our legal constructs are not keeping up. This leaves tech companies in the difficult position of having to withhold information that could protect public safety.To make matters worse, a case at the United States Supreme Court could leave our governments and others with no effective way to obtain vital evidence of serious crimes. Oral arguments are scheduled for Feb. 27 in that case, which asks whether Microsoft may comply with a United States warrant to disclose information related to an American crime stored on a cloud server in Ireland. Microsoft argues that it cannot.Fortunately, there is a legislative solution to this problem that advances a model that empowers law enforcement. The Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Democratic senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Chris Coons of Delaware, and members of the House have proposed legislation that would clarify the legal authority of the United States to obtain data stored in another country, and would authorize special agreements to resolve potential conflicts of law. The bill would authorize the attorney general to enter into such agreements, but only with allies that respect privacy and protect civil liberties, and that have records of promoting and defending due process. The first one would be with Britain, which already has the authority to enter into such a pact.These agreements would not apply to foreign judicial orders directed at American citizens, or anyone in the United States, for that matter. Instead, the bill would promote swift justice among nations that share a common commitment to the rule of law, while protecting the privacy and safety of our citizens. The prime minister has stressed the great importance of the legislation to British authorities investigating criminal and terrorist activity. One of us, Paddy McGuinness, has testified before both houses of Congress to make the case for this change. President Trump adopted this priority upon taking office as part of his call for lawful access to information.In addition to improved law enforcement, this model advances American leadership in cybersecurity. American and British innovation created the internet, and United States-based companies dominate the online landscape. With that central role in the internet comes a responsibility to work with partners that share our values to support their safety and security. Any nation motivated to enter into an agreement with the United States will have to meet American standards of due process and ensure a commitment to the rule of law, not authoritarian whim.Some have argued that it is improper for the United States government to assert the authority to compel disclosure of data stored abroad. But Britain is one of many nations that already asserts this authority. The proposed law would not only put the United States on a par with these other nations but would also do so on its terms.Others argue the bill unwisely provides the American and British governments new powers to obtain private information. The reality is that courts in both governments already have the authority to compel a service provider to comply with a warrant, and we have a longstanding, but slow, treaty process for enforcing cross-border warrants. The Cloud Act considers these issues and provides thoughtful and swifter solutions. Neither government will issue a warrant without judicial approval.We can build an international system in which rights-respecting countries can have access to the data they need to investigate serious crimes regardless of where companies choose to store it. This legislation is the first step.The authority is critical. With it, law enforcement officials in the United States, Britain and other countries with similar due-process standards would be empowered to investigate people suspected of terrorism and serious crimes like murder, human trafficking and the sexual abuse of children, regardless of where the suspects\u2019 data happens to be stored. Obtaining access to overseas data held by companies subject to our jurisdiction is entirely consistent with our treaty obligations and international norms. With this legislation, our countries can meet these longstanding obligations, and meet them faster.The longer it takes to address this problem, the more our mutual public safety and national security will be undermined by the current legal obstacles to disclosure of data across borders.Advertisement"}

I had never met anyone like her before.\u201dMr. Spencer told Ms. Webb that he was one of six sons raised in Chicago by Lois and Scott Spencer, and that he was in the process of taking ownership of a trampoline park in Bakersfield, Calif.He had already completed a full-time, two-year mission in Carlsbad, Calif., through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, before graduating from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, with a degree in economics.\u201cHe seemed like a great guy, a real family-oriented man, but he lived in Mississippi,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cI mean, I could see if he lived in New York or Los Angeles or Chicago, but Mississippi? I couldn\u2019t even pretend that I had work or any other reason to be in Mississippi.\u201dMs. Webb\u2019s story began in Houston, where she was adopted and raised by Karen Webb-Milson, a preschool teacher there, and David M. Webb, a senior powering scheduler at Entergy, an electric power production company in The Woodlands, Tex.She was already a competitive gymnast by the time she arrived at Memorial High School in Houston, where she became a cheerleader, played lacrosse and was a member of the track-and-field team.\u201cI knew she was in great shape,\u201d Mr. Spencer said, \u201cbut I had no idea how incredibly athletic she was.\u201dShe moved on to Baylor, where she continued to play lacrosse.She graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in news-editorial journalism, with a minor in management and marketing. (She later received a certificate of entrepreneurship from the Latter-Day Saints Business College in Salt Lake City.)In November 2013, Ms. Webb moved to Manhattan, where she dabbled in modeling, acting and fashion writing before landing a job as a consultant to small businesses in the fitness industry.\u201cShe had long legs and a sprinting background, and after talking with her I could tell that she had the athletic drive and potential, which are the makings of a good skeleton athlete,\u201d said Ms. Gibbs, 33, who is representing Team USA at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.Her competitive juices flowing again, Ms. Webb went back to her desk and Googled the words \u201cOlympics,\u201d \u201cU.S.A.,\u201d \u201cSkeleton\u201d and \u201cCombine.\u201dWhat she found were three dates in November 2016 for skeleton combines, a series of sprints, long jumps and other physical activities the U.S. Bobsled & Skeleton Federation uses to help gauge an athlete\u2019s level of fitness and readiness for participation in the sport.She attended the first combine, in Lake Placid, N.Y., and then a second a few weeks later at Olympic Park in Park City, Utah.\u201cI was terrible at the beginning,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not the type of person who gives up on a dream so easily.\u201dIn late November of that year, Ms. Webb was focused on returning to Park City to attend a third combine when Mr. Spencer, suitcases in hand, entered her life.And though he was soon gone, he would not soon forget her.\u201cI left the restaurant that day and called a friend and said, \u2018Wow! I just met someone very, very special,\u2019\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201c\u2018I think I\u2019m in love.\u2019\u201dBut Ms. Webb was too busy spending time with her new love to pay much attention to him.\u201cI tried calling and texting her when I got home, but it didn\u2019t go so well,\u201d Mr. Spencer said with a sigh. \u201cShe never called me back.\u201dAs it turned out, Ms. Webb scored so high on her final combine in Park City, where she took her first icy plunge, that coaches invited her back to continue working out through January and February in 2017.She accepted the invitation, and then one day in February she answered her cellphone and heard a vaguely familiar voice: \u201cOh, hi Courtney, it\u2019s Ryan Spencer.\u201dHe said he was on his way to Utah to attend the blessing ceremony of a friend\u2019s son, and wanted to know if she would be able to spend time with him during his three-day stay in nearby American Fork.\u201cI needed a reason to be in Utah, and found one,\u201d Mr. Spencer said with a chuckle; he had remembered from their initial conversation that she would be training there. \u201cI guess I gave her quite a surprise.\u201dHe had in fact.\u201cI was stunned,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I had actually forgotten about him. I was like, \u2018Ryan Spencer?\u2019 Then it was like, \u2018Oh yeah, Ryan Spencer. O.K. This is kind of random.\u2019\u201dAfter attending separate Super Bowl parties, they got together at the home of Mr. Spencer\u2019s friend, and totally clicked.\u201cWe got to know each other better and had a great time,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cI found him to be a very charismatic, confident and cultured person.\u201d\u201cWe shared our first kiss that night,\u201d she said.The whirlwind had officially begun. Five dizzying months of long-distance romance ensued, and on Fourth of July weekend, Mr. Spencer proposed to Ms. Webb on a beach in Bridgehampton, N.Y., ultimately proving that he too was not the type of person who gives up on a dream so easily.\u201cI never thought of him popping back into my life the way he did as weird or creepy,\u201d Ms. Webb said. \u201cI actually appreciated his persistence. It showed me how much he truly cared about me, and just how badly he wanted me in his life.\u201dMischa Teichgraeber, Ms. Webb\u2019s childhood best friend, recalled listening to the horrors of the New York dating scene as told to her by Ms. Webb.\u201cA lot of guys were trying to court her, but she never felt right about anything,\u201d Ms. Teichgraeber said. \u201cWhen she started talking to Ryan, there was an instant difference. She had never clicked with anyone like that before.\u201dMs. Webb and Mr. Spencer were married Feb. 2 in a traditional Mormon \u201csealing ceremony\u201d at the Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in San Antonio, witnessed only by members of the church.When Terry J. Orgill, the temple\u2019s president, pronounced the couple husband and wife, sealing them together \u201cfor time and all eternity,\u201d they began to cry.\u201cRyan and I have not had a calm moment since we got engaged,\u201d Ms. Webb said later. \u201cBut when we walked inside the temple, I was feeling very calm and I felt at peace. I just knew that it was right.\u201dOn Feb. 3, their wedding festivities continued with a ring ceremony and reception at Ashton Gardens West in Houston, where they were joined by 168 guests, many from Chicago, others from Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York and Utah.Among them was Edward Spencer, the groom\u2019s 94-year-old grandfather, who led the brief ceremony. Standing at the altar, he was interrupted for a moment by his grandson, who whispered something in his ear.He then turned to the bride, who wore a white, short-sleeved lace wedding dress by Vera Wang, and said, \u201cAt this time your dad will give you away.\u201d\u201cThat wasn\u2019t in my script,\u201d the elder Mr. Spencer noted, as the chapel erupted with laughter.The bride\u2019s mother, who adopted Ms. Webb when she was 6 weeks old, stood by her daughter\u2019s side just before she walked down the aisle. \u201cShe is my superhero,\u201d Ms. Webb-Milson said. \u201cLook at all the things she\u2019s done in her life. I\u2019m just in awe.\u201dAt the end of the ceremony, the newlyweds danced and sang down the aisle to \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered,\u201d by Stevie Wonder, as the guests began making their way to the reception, where white roses and blue hydrangea arrangements adorned the tables.\u201cThey are crazy about each other, and now we have a great beautiful addition to our family,\u201d Mr. Spencer\u2019s mother, Lois Jean Spencer, said at the reception.Though Ms. Webb has decided to take some time off from skeleton while settling into the warmth of married life, she is eager to get back to her sled, inching closer to her Olympic dream with each and every whirlwind plunge.\u201cThe good Lord has taken me by the hand and led me on this wild ride,\u201d she said. \u201cThings have been moving along so quickly, but with every twist and turn, everything in my life, including Ryan, has lined up perfectly.\u201dSusan Anasagasti contributed reporting from Houston.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Valentine\u2019s Day, Considering Tech That Keeps Couples Together", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingAs the editor of Modern Love, you are constantly reading stories about people\u2019s relationships, including submissions that never make it to publication. With that bird\u2019s-eye view, how do you think tech has transformed relationships?In looking for love, tech gives us access, protection and the power of curation. Meaning we can shop for love from the safety of our homes while presenting only the best parts of ourselves to potential mates. So much control! How could anything go wrong?But actually, as with so much of tech, it\u2019s mostly the illusion of control. Because we can\u2019t really choose anyone even if it seems that we can. We can\u2019t protect our hearts with the glass of our phones. And we can\u2019t keep a potential mate from discovering who we truly are; we just increase the odds of their ultimately being disappointed by keeping them hooked to our \u201cbest\u201d self.But that whole approach is fueled by an expectation that our search for love is like finding a needle in a haystack. And from what I\u2019ve seen, love doesn\u2019t often work that way. Having too many choices is in itself inefficient and fantasy inducing.In my view, love is best found not in a haystack but in a pea pod. Here are your five peas. Or maybe nine peas. The anthropologist Helen Fisher claims that a human brain can reasonably consider only nine or 10 choices; beyond that, they turn to noise. So if you were to limit yourself to nine people and get to know them, give each a chance, you\u2019d probably fall in love with one.Even so, I\u2019m not one of those people who moan about how dating apps make things worse. It\u2019s just different, much the way online shopping differs from brick-and-mortar.When shopping online, you buy more stuff because it\u2019s so easy. Then you probably fantasize a little more about your new shoes or flying drone as you await their arrival, which means you\u2019re going to be disappointed more often because the shoes don\u2019t fit or the drone is poorly made. So you return them and start over \u2014 same as with the average online date. In the store, meanwhile, all of that trying on and rejecting would have happened in real time, much like getting to know and rejecting people at the bar or a party happens in real time, leaving you little time to fantasize.What\u2019s particularly misleading about online dating is how everyone on the site is trying to seduce you. They\u2019re trying to seduce everyone. They\u2019re all saying, \u201cDate me!\u201dOur smartphones now include photos, chat transcripts, contacts and more. Is it good for relationships to have so much of our lives public? What I\u2019ve noticed about young people who\u2019ve grown up with social media is the degree to which they bring a sense of audience to nearly everything they do. They see their own life as a performance, one that is constantly \u201creviewed\u201d by friends, family, aunts, cousins, strangers.But what\u2019s refreshing to me is how goofy a lot of it is. It\u2019s curated but not always to show perfection; in fact, imperfection seems to be the goal, something to laugh at, an ugly or embarrassing moment or expression or bad experience. They splash it all out there as a way of saying, \u201cThis is me.\u201d I think a lot of us who didn\u2019t grow up with that are horrified about having unflattering pictures of ourselves out there or embarrassing stories. We see that kind of online vulnerability as risky, and they often don\u2019t \u2014 they celebrate it.How has tech affected your job editing Modern Love?Tech \u2014 which for me mostly consists of my laptop and phone \u2014 has made me both happier and more stressed out, more engaged with the world and more isolated from my immediate surroundings, more in touch with my friends and family while I see them less and less. In my job, tech allows me incredible freedom \u2014 to do my work at The Times or from the beach, and whether I\u2019m feeling good or am sick in bed. I\u2019m writing this now on a train from New York City to Massachusetts on a brisk, beautiful Saturday in February. It\u2019s glorious, and at the same time my work and personal life have almost no boundary.What tech are you obsessed with in your personal life? I could not navigate the world without Google Maps, and I could not fully appreciate the world without Google Earth. I still don\u2019t get how either works. They are miraculous.I\u2019m a bad person to ask about that because I\u2019m on my phone all the time, too. I\u2019m just glad these things didn\u2019t exist when I had small children, because I know I\u2019d be like those parents you see at the playground, staring at their phones as their children try to get their attention.My immediate family is scattered \u2014 kids in college, my wife and I frequently in different cities \u2014 and these days that texting connection outweighs the negative of being on our phones when we\u2019re together. But just barely. With phone addiction, it\u2019s all about willpower. These days I\u2019m without my phone only in the shower.So I guess my parting advice to couples who want to remain present with each other: Spend more time together in the shower.Advertisement"}

Navalny, extended to the American service providers Instagram and YouTube, with Instagram coming under criticism from Mr. Navalny after some content was deleted from its accounts.By Thursday afternoon Google, the parent company of YouTube, had yet to remove Mr. Navalny\u2019s video.Last week, a politically connected aluminum tycoon, Oleg V. Deripaska, filed a lawsuit against a 21-year-old model and blogger, Anastasia Vashukevich, accusing her of sharing details of his private life. In 2017, Ms. Vashukevich posted video material and photographs from 2016 on her Instagram account that showed Mr. Deripaska sailing on his yacht with a deputy prime minister, Sergei E. Prikhodko.A court in Ust-Labinsk, a town in southern Russia where Mr. Deripaska went to school and where he pays some of his taxes, then ordered news media outlets and social media platforms, including Instagram and YouTube, to remove the offending material. The court instructed Russia\u2019s communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, to enforce its decision.Many websites complied with the order. Ms. Vashukevich removed the material from her Instagram account, but as of late Thursday, Mr. Navalny\u2019s investigation was still available on YouTube.That an order from a local court in Russia\u2019s politicized judiciary would be dutifully followed by a major government agency raised immediate questions among Kremlin opponents about whether Mr. Deripaska, who has close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin and other Kremlin officials, had been acting on behalf of the government to silence Mr. Navalny.The opposition leader thought so, citing the Kremlin\u2019s desire to sideline Mr. Navalny ahead of the presidential election next month. \u201cThis is a pretext to block the resources we use to conduct our election boycott campaign, to gather observers on polling stations to prevent the government from rigging the turnout at the upcoming election,\u201d he said in a video statement earlier this week.He also denied that the lawsuit had been a veiled attempt to muzzle Mr. Navalny. \u201cMr. Deripaska\u2019s claim is to protect his right for privacy and has nothing to do with any political struggle between Mr. Navalny and his political opponents,\u201d the spokesman said in an emailed statement.The spokesman denied any ulterior motives in the actions of the government agency, Roskomnadzor, asserting: \u201cAny suggestion that it acted at the instruction of the Russian government is ludicrous.\u201dBut Mr. Navalny\u2019s supporters asked why, if there had been no political motive, the agency did not just block the webpage carrying the investigation itself, rather than the entire website and some related ones.With most news media outlets controlled by the government, Mr. Navalny\u2019s website is virtually his only vehicle for distributing his investigations of corruption among members of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle.Over the past year, Mr. Navalny has used his website as part of an abortive campaign for president. He was banned from running against Mr. Putin because of a criminal conviction that he and rights advocates say was politically motivated. Having been stopped from campaigning, Mr. Navalny then devoted his energies to organizing a boycott of the vote, scheduled for March.Mr. Navalny and his team created mirror websites and called on supporters to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, which enable them to avoid access restrictions.\u201cEvery one of us should learn how to bypass blocks,\u201d Mr. Navalny said. \u201cThis becomes a mandatory skill for life in Russia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Blackface and Monkey Suit, Chinese Gala on Africa Causes Uproar", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 A lavish four-hour Lunar New Year show televised to millions across China on Thursday night set off a flood of indignation with its caricatures featuring blackface and African men in animal suits.Many found the portrayals offensive.Hannah Getachew, 30, a law student at Peking University who is from Ethiopia, said that while an apology from CCTV would be welcome, the damage had already been done.\u201cFor all of his faults, Bill Cosby hired a Harvard professor of psychiatry to consult on almost every episode of \u2018The Cosby Show\u2019 to ensure that there wasn\u2019t a single stereotype of people,\u201d Ms. Getachew said. \u201cChina should consider similar action. What we need now is a clear signal that this sort of event will never occur again.\u201dThe show, designed to celebrate China as an economic and cultural powerhouse and rehearsed many times before senior propaganda officials, is one of the most watched in the world, with an audience estimated at 800 million. The skit was intended to highlight relations between Africa and China.Dancers dressed as zebras, giraffes, lions and antelopes opened the sequence before the actress Lou Naiming appeared with her outsize rear and voluminous dress.Amid banter and confusion about a blind date for her daughter, the character expresses gratitude to Chinese doctors who once saved her life and says that \u201cChina has done so much for Africa.\u201dMs. Lou, her face covered in black makeup, gushes: \u201cI love Chinese people. I love China.\u201dRepeated requests for comment to an audience feedback hotline established by the broadcaster, CCTV, went unanswered Friday.CCTV chose Africa as a main focus of the New Year show in order to please the Chinese leadership as it forges strong relationships there, said Liu Haifang, associate professor of African history at Peking University. A summit meeting of African leaders is scheduled in China this year.\u201cChina has made a lot of contributions in Africa in the past few years,\u201d Ms. Liu said. \u201cThat\u2019s why CCTV was confident Sino-African relations could be a good topic to perform.\u201dThe choice backfired. The African Students Association at Peking University said in a post on WeChat, the popular social media platform, that while the woman on stage was an unfair representation, the students were most troubled by the men in the background.\u201cLet\u2019s not even talk about the black men wearing monkey suits,\u201d the post said.A human rights lawyer in Kenya, Gitobu Imanyara, said of the skit, \u201cWhat is disgusting is that we won\u2019t hear any official complaint from African governments who are complicit in the recolonization of Africa by China.\u201dTo offset such criticism, and to strengthen its foothold in Africa, the Chinese government offers training programs and scholarships to thousands of students from African countries every year.Many major Chinese universities host African students and have opened programs dedicated to the study of Africa. About 100,000 African students study and work in China, according to some estimates.With China\u2019s broad contacts across Africa, the producers of the New Year show should have known better, said Lina Benabdallah, an Africa specialist at Wake Forest University in North Carolina.\u201cIf CCTV was in some small, rural area, we can say this is na\u00efvet\u00e9,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is at a bigger level. Whatever the intention, it\u2019s not acceptable. There are tons of Africa study centers in China, tons of people for CCTV to check with.\u201dThe dean of one of China\u2019s African studies centers said that by Chinese standards the show was not racist.\u201cIn China\u2019s cultural context, animals represent many good qualities,\u201d said the dean, Liu Hongwu of the Institute for Africa at Zhengjiang Normal University. \u201cBlackface was not used to muck up the black people but rather because the Asian actress needed to perform an African woman.\u201dIn Kenya, where the skit was set, some voiced a weary recognition of old caricatures. Several Kenyans said it was clear why the Chinese broadcaster could not see its mistake.\u201cChina is walled off except for economic interaction,\u201d said Patrick Gathara, a cartoonist at The Daily Nation in Nairobi. \u201cThere\u2019s no Google, it\u2019s very policed, all social media is denied them. Their ideas of what goes on outside their borders is distorted.\u201dOther recent Chinese depictions of Africa have also gone awry.Advertisement"}

Russia is sowing divisiveness in an effort to sway voters, or worse. But this time the target isn\u2019t a coming election but the Oscars, according to one of two filmmakers whose documentaries have been nominated for Academy Awards and drawn the ire of President Vladimir V. Putin.That filmmaker, Feras Fayyad, spent nearly two years with several members of the White Helmets, the volunteer Syrian emergency medical workers, as they pulled survivors, bodies and severed limbs from mountains of rubble left by airstrikes.\u201cThey just keep attacking you, accusing you,\u201d Mr. Fayyad said during an interview last week at an Airbnb rental in the West Village. \u201cAnd the people who work with me, my team, I don\u2019t want them accused or attacked because of me.\u201dIn an email, James Walden, Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s lawyer, said his client was regularly being moved to undisclosed locations because of death threats, and Mr. Fogel said he hadn\u2019t seen him in a year.\u201cI worry about him, and I know that all of us who worked so hard to protect him worry,\u201d Mr. Fogel said.Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert in the Clinton White House who is now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that smear campaigns, buttressed by social media attacks, have become part of the standard operating procedure deployed by Russia against perceived enemies.\u201cRussia has a pretty good record on shaping the narrative, of creating a party line and reinforcing it from a variety of vantage points,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.The White Helmets group \u201cdoes serve in opposition areas and its work inherently benefits the forces that Russia opposes,\u201d Mr. Cordesman wrote in an email.\u201cRT-led disinformation campaigns on matters like this operate on another level to reality,\u201d Mr. Lister wrote in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s only one motivation here: to justify the indiscriminate bombing campaigns that have come to exemplify Russia and the Syrian regime\u2019s day-to-day war.\u201dMr. Fayyad is from the countryside outside Aleppo and, in March 2011, was working on another film, about the 1982 massacre in the city of Hama, when Syria\u2019s civil uprising began. Mr. Fayyad was arrested \u2014 he was accused of spreading false news, he said \u2014 imprisoned and tortured. (His nails were ripped out, he was shackled and hung by his hands from a ceiling, and sensitive parts of his body were shocked with electricity, he said.)For all the horrors he suffered, Mr. Fayyad was struck by his fellow prisoners\u2019 resistance and determination to survive, and how they buoyed each other by singing songs in the lowest of voices. Nearly a year later, he emerged wanting to make a film that showed how people endured in the teeth of war, and clung to the tiniest glimmers of solace and hope.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell the story of the White Helmets; I wanted to tell the story about these people as citizens of their society,\u201d Mr. Fayyad said. But accompanying the men on their gruesome rescue missions took a harrowing toll. \u201cIt kills something inside you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a film about our nightmare.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Flying Taxis May Be Years Away, but the Groundwork Is Accelerating", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Flying cars are just starting to inch their way out of science fiction. But that is not stopping some companies from planning for flying taxi services.A growing collection of tech companies, aircraft manufacturers, automakers and investors are betting that fleets of battery-powered aircraft will give rise to air taxi services, perhaps as soon as the next decade. Some of those taxis, the companies hope, may even use artificial intelligence to fly themselves.No one can say for certain if these new vehicles will turn out to be a real business. But many companies are already worried about being left behind.\u201cThis is the natural progression of the vehicles we make,\u201d said Ben Bridge, head of global business for Airbus Helicopters. \u201cWe want a seat at the table and a voice in the conversation that is happening.\u201dFlying cars even played a bit role in the recently settled legal fight over trade secrets between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car service spun out of Google.In court testimony this month, Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former chief executive, said he had heard that Larry Page \u2014 the chief executive of Waymo\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, who has a side project building new types of aircraft \u2014 was upset because Uber was \u201cdoing their thing\u201d with flying cars.Whatever you imagine a flying car to be \u2014 stop. What these companies envision is something like a helicopter but much quieter and more affordable. Think of a hobbyist\u2019s drone, but big enough to fit people. It would, in theory, be welcome in urban environments and affordable to more than well-heeled businesspeople. At least, that\u2019s the dream.Before there can be too much enthusiasm for these flying taxi services, it\u2019s worth noting that self-driving cars have yet to turn into a notable business for anyone, despite about a decade of research at tech giants like Google and billions in investment from Silicon Valley and the auto industry.Still, there are some reasons for the new enthusiasm. Battery improvements and the wide use of drones have spawned technological breakthroughs. The taxis would take off and land vertically like a helicopter, so they\u2019d take up less room. Because they would be battery-powered, they would be more environmentally friendly.For now, Airbus executives hope to gain from Blade\u2019s experience with an app that allows customers to reserve a seat on a helicopter. Airbus is expected to invest up to $15 million in Blade, which would represent about a 10 percent stake in the company, according to a person who is familiar with the transaction but not permitted to discuss the investment details publicly.Both companies see helicopters as an intermediate step until a new type of aircraft and taxi service hits the market. Rob Wiesenthal, Blade\u2019s chief executive, said a quieter and less expensive alternative to helicopters \u201copens up a whole new world.\u201dAirbus said it was preparing for a test flight by year-end for its CityAirbus aircraft, which carries up to four passengers and can reach a cruising speed of about 75 miles per hour. It plans to deploy the CityAirbus in 2023.Uber has said it expects to begin testing of its urban air taxis in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Los Angeles and Dubai in 2020. The company has landed exclusive deals for vertical takeoff and landing spots with real estate companies, including in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.Uber declared its interest with its Uber Elevate initiative in 2016, forecasting a future when it could offer 15-minute Uber Air rides from San Francisco to San Jose for $20. The 50-mile ride with Uber Pool, its car-pooling option, usually takes about two hours in rush-hour traffic and costs $83.It did not put a date on that future.In a concept video for Uber Elevate, a woman opens the Uber app, which gives her a choice of taking a ride with Uber Pool, UberX or Uber Air. She enters a nearby building and rides the elevator to the top floor, where she boards an air taxi in Uber Skyport.Uber is also establishing performance guidelines for its flying taxis, including asking that the new aircraft make only one-quarter of the noise of a small four-seat helicopter. Uber also has supplier deals in place with five manufacturers, including Textron\u2019s Bell Helicopter.\u201cWe believe the best way to get this idea off the ground is to partner with world-class companies and stakeholders that have a diverse set of specializations,\u201d an Uber spokesman, Matt Wing, said in a statement.Daniel Wiegand, a co-founder and the chief executive of the German air taxi company Lilium, said investors considered him totally crazy when he pitched the company in 2015.Mr. Kalanick said he told Mr. Page that he believed a flying service \u201csounds pretty cool,\u201d even though Uber wasn\u2019t building one. But once the aircraft are available, he said, \u201cI will make sure that our 50 million or so customers at the time can push a button and get a flying car.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is the Perfect Color Worth?", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureThat day, as the team decided on colors for Spring/Summer 2019, the theme was love. It was a balmy May morning, but Shah, with thin graying hair and glasses, was dressed in a navy blue buttoned sweater with a thick scarf wrapped loosely around his neck. He frequently interrupted with questions as the handpicked members of his team took turns presenting \u201cmood boards\u201d they had brought with them. Like oversize pages from a scrapbook, these displays included photographs, drawings, artworks, ribbons, textiles, paint samples, bits of plastic, lengths of rope, tourist tchotchkes and, in one instance, a piece of frilly lingerie.There were spirited, far-ranging discussions of art, film, music, theater, books, fashion, museum exhibitions and advertising \u2014 anything that might hint, even remotely, at where color was headed. Amid the clamor of voices, Shah asked an American forecaster in the room to give the view from across the Atlantic.\u201cWhat is the zeitgeist going on in the United States about color?\u201d Shah asked. \u201cAre they big colors? Are they strong colors? Prime colors?\u201d\u201cI think what\u2019s going on in the United States now is that it\u2019s all happening,\u201d the woman replied. \u201cIt\u2019s almost reflective of the conflict going on around us \u2014 where you\u2019re not having one definite color correction, but you\u2019re seeing examples in various areas. I think it\u2019s mostly about mixes.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s not about solids,\u201d Shah said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you put colors together?\u201d\u201cExactly, and different from what it\u2019s been before,\u201d the woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a counterculture type of a feeling \u2014 you deliberately use colors that would not ordinarily work together.\u201d\u201cAccidental colors,\u201d Shah said, coining a phrase.\u201cThat\u2019s a good way of putting it, yes,\u201d the woman agreed.The conclave broke for lunch, and Shah walked around the table alone, scratching his chin and muttering to himself while sorting mood boards into piles of similar colors \u2014 \u201cediting,\u201d he said. Occasionally he would wince at having mislaid a board, then pick it up again and set it down someplace else. He worked hurriedly, and by the time the others returned from their meals, he was finished, having arranged the materials into precise groups from which the winning shades could be selected. That afternoon, he and his collaborators finalized the palettes. In six weeks, the forecast would be available to anyone interested enough to part with $795.Color forecasters like Shah and his team at Pantone have tremendous influence over the visible elements of the global economy \u2014 the parts of it that are designed, manufactured and purchased \u2014 though their profession itself is all but invisible. If you\u2019re familiar with color forecasting at all, it\u2019s most likely thanks to a scene in the 2006 film \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d in which the fashion-magazine mandarin Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, explains to her young, fashion-skeptical assistant why the assistant, played by Anne Hathaway, happens to be wearing a sweater in a very particular shade of blue known as cerulean. Cerulean, Priestly explains, first showed itself a few years earlier in a collection by Oscar de la Renta and was soon adopted by a number of other influential designers before it \u201cfiltered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner, where you no doubt fished it out of some clearance bin,\u201d she says.\u201cThat blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sort of comical how you think that you\u2019ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you\u2019re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room.\u201d In reality, it was selected by Pantone. Six years before the release of \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d Pantone\u2019s forecasters named cerulean the company\u2019s first-ever Color of the Year.In the nearly two decades since then, as digital design and social media have expanded the ranks of color obsessives, Pantone has become not just a company but a sensation, its brand bestriding the globe like a behemoth. Its color forecasts, too, have retained their reputation as some of the most influential in the world, even as the field of competitors has grown crowded \u2014 not just with other companies but, thanks to the internet, with people on social-networking sites like Tumblr and Pinterest who have a knack for spotting color trends and enough followers to matter. For the class of fashion and industrial designers who make up Pantone\u2019s customer base, picking the right color \u2014 and exactly the right shade of that color \u2014 can feel like one of the most important decisions they\u2019ll make all year. Companies will pay almost anything to get it right, and the rarefied, vaguely mystical art of doing just that happens to be Pantone\u2019s business.More discoveries soon followed: magenta, Hofmann\u2019s violet, Lyons blue, malachite green, Bismarck brown and aniline black. By the 1880s, dye houses in Germany, which was by then the center of the chemical industry, and French textile mills were issuing seasonal color cards and ribbon samples of various synthetic shades. When the outbreak of World War I cut off the supply of German dyestuffs, threatening the color industry with collapse, a consortium of American mills and manufacturers formed the Textile Color Card Association, which developed the first industrywide color library and trend forecast, based solely on dyes that could be manufactured domestically. After the armistice, the group continued to be a hub for the best intelligence on color trends emanating from Europe\u2019s fashion capitals and, in 1955, renamed itself the Color Association of the United States. Similar organizations soon took form in other countries around the world.The modern color industry had arrived, if only in a confined sort of way. Born out of the fashion business, it remained rooted there for decades even as it exerted powerful influence on distant parts of the consumer economy, such as the automotive and home-furnishings sectors. But at the turn of the millennium, the color industry\u2019s center of gravity shifted seemingly overnight with a big bang in the field of industrial design: the release, in 1998, of Apple\u2019s iMac G3 desktop computer.Available in 11 translucent shades, from Bondi Blue to Tangerine, the iMac ushered in a new era in which consumers began to value everyday purchases not strictly, or even primarily, for their utility but as a form of self-expression. \u201cThat colorful plastic was everywhere in industrial design for the next several years,\u201d Virginia Postrel, the author of several books on aesthetics, told me. \u201cNot just consumer electronics but all sorts of ordinary objects like irons and trash cans. It was an easy and cheap way to make things look fun and fresh.\u201d Eventually, the enthusiasm faded; Apple itself shifted its palette to neutral whites, blacks and silvers. But the larger idea that the iMac inaugurated \u2014 namely that color choices are serious business and can determine the success or failure of any product in any industry \u2014 continues to ripple through the marketplace.Steve Jobs\u2019s revolution in commercial aesthetics would have been impossible without another one that occurred 35 years earlier. A nagging problem had troubled the color industry from its inception: how to communicate accurately the subtleties of perception. In his 1963 book, \u201cInteraction of Color,\u201d the Bauhaus artist and Yale professor Josef Albers wrote: \u201cIf one says \u2018Red\u2019 (the name of a color) and there are 50 people listening, it can be expected that there will be 50 reds in their minds. And one can be sure that all these reds will be very different.\u201d There are innumerable colors, he continued, but only about 30 names for them. And even if you could describe all of those colors, wouldn\u2019t your sense of them still differ from someone else\u2019s? As the British journalist Kassia St. Clair writes in \u201cThe Secret Lives of Color,\u201d \u201cYou could no more meaningfully secure a precise universal definition for all the known shades than you could plot the coordinates of a dream.\u201dThe man who came closest to doing just that was Lawrence Herbert. In 1956, Herbert, who had recently graduated with a degree in biology and chemistry from Hofstra University on Long Island, took a job as a press operator and color matcher at M\u2009&\u2009J Levine, a New York-based advertising firm and the parent company of a small printing concern called Pantone Press. As the company\u2019s founders turned to other lines of business, Herbert took over the printing division and in a few short years, pioneered a cheaper, more accurate printing method that allowed him to produce a full spectrum of colors from 10 basic pigments. Not long after that, he bought out the company\u2019s printing unit, along with its name, and in 1963 introduced the Pantone Matching System.Herbert\u2019s system was at once transformative and elegantly simple. It measured precisely the mixture of pigments necessary to produce a specific shade, each of which was assigned a reference number. Pantone then compiled the colors and numbers into books. Rather than provide inks directly, it sold the means by which a printer could faithfully and consistently reproduce any color in Pantone\u2019s library. In doing so, Herbert tamed color\u2019s mysterious nature and turned it into a commodity, in essence quantifying what had until then been unquantifiable.Pantone and its parent company, X-Rite \u2014 a maker of color-management systems and software that acquired Pantone in 2007 \u2014 now have 17 offices and production facilities around the world and offer products used by 10 million designers and manufacturers every day. Pantone\u2019s color library, which continues to grow by the year, contains roughly 10,000 unique shades. The company\u2019s expansion has been helped along by globalization and the offshoring of manufacturing. With designers in Europe, say, marketers in the United States and factories in China, a company can easily communicate color choices up and down the supply chain, so long as everyone involved references the same Pantone chip \u2014 Albers\u2019s 50 reds reduced to one.I met Beverly Bell, Pantone\u2019s manager of color and quality standards for textiles, in a dimly lit room adjacent to the factory floor. Nearby, an employee in a white lab coat was standing at a countertop light box, checking a fresh batch of cotton-based color standards for flaws. The box emits D65 light, which, Bell said, simulates the midday sun in Western Europe \u2014 supposedly the purest possible illumination and the industry standard for assessing color.Such exacting controls are in place at every stage of production. Cotton swatches, for example, after being dyed, are conditioned overnight in a machine that exposes them to D65 light and a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit at 50 percent humidity. Afterward, they are measured with a spectrophotometer, which compares colors against the Pantone standard with hyperaccuracy. If they pass inspection, the swatches are then hermetically sealed inside plastic, ultraviolet-resistant envelopes, which protect against fading. Colors applied to paper and plastic undergo similar testing.The final quality safeguard is the human eye. Every Pantone employee is required to pass an annual exam called the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Color Vision Test. The test taker has to arrange four rows of samples, 85 in all, into descending order based on their shade. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s actually working with color has to get a \u2018superior\u2019 rating,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo that means no more than three errors.\u201d That morning, trying my luck on a blue/purple row, I made only one mistake, and might have congratulated myself had Bell not already told me that Pantone\u2019s reigning color-test champion, a woman named Madlin Tadros, who works in the textiles department, has never erred in 21 years.The unremarkable appearance of Pantone\u2019s offices belies the excitement the brand engenders around the world. Designers, regardless of their industry, always seem to have Pantone\u2019s color books within reach, like some sacred text of a secret society. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you look at it,\u201d an interior designer told me. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine working with anything else.\u201d The company\u2019s color standards are often employed by exacting obsessives for decidedly off-label purposes too. A fish company recently enlisted Pantone to assist with a guide for sushi freshness. And Calvin Klein, according to Lisa Marsh\u2019s 2004 book, \u201cThe House of Klein,\u201d used to keep a Pantone chip taped to the wall next to the office coffee maker \u201cto ensure he\u2019d get just the right mix of coffee and milk every time.\u201dIn the past decade, Pantone has become a consumer brand in its own right: It now licenses clothes, shoes, cosmetics, kitchenware, furniture, cellphones, jigsaw puzzles, children\u2019s books, skateboards, key chains and thumb drives, in Pantone colors and bearing its logo. Pantone does not report financial information, but Fast Company wrote in 2015 that a full 15 percent of its millions of dollars in annual revenue now derives from commercial licensing.And the cult of Pantone extends far beyond the company\u2019s own merchandise. An online fan club of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for example, has taken to calling itself by the team\u2019s official shade of blue, Pantone 294. An authorized Pantone-themed boutique hotel in Brussels immerses its guests in a kaleidoscopic array of colors, right down to their bedspreads and coffee mugs. Several Instagram users, each with tens of thousands of followers, regularly pair their photographs with the corresponding Pantone chips, and a Brazilian photographer named Ang\u00e9lica Dass has made portraits of more than 3,000 people in 13 countries, all sorted by skin color according to the Pantone Matching System.This alchemy of color chips into cultural cachet is largely the work of Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, a small in-house consultancy, founded in 1986. A native New Yorker with shoulder-length brown hair, Pressman arrived at Pantone nearly 20 years ago, shortly after the color industry\u2019s iMac-inaugurated big bang, and since then has worked to make Pantone a household name. Her division produces several seasonal forecasts, as well as a magazine called Viewpoint Colour, which anticipate trends up to three years in advance. It has also helped brands \u2014 from Tiffany and Victoria\u2019s Secret to Barbie, Schweppes and the Royal Mail in Britain \u2014 develop proprietary shades. On the day I visited, Pressman showed me an uncut sheet of soon-to-be-released Pantone chips for Love Symbol No.2, a shade adapted from the purple paint on one of Prince\u2019s favorite pianos and commissioned by his estate after his death.That a company engaged in the manufacture of something so intangible \u2014 and, for most consumers, so useless \u2014 as color standards could develop a widespread and devoted following among people far removed from its intended clientele speaks to a larger cultural phenomenon: a growing popular enthusiasm for color in its own right and for its own sake, free of the constraints of form or function. Color\u2019s liberation owes much to the rise of the internet, particularly the explosion of photo sharing on social media. As this digital revolution took shape, Pantone found itself perfectly positioned to exploit it. \u201cPantone did not create desire for color,\u201d said Ellen Sideri, founder and chief executive of ESP TrendLab in the garment district in New York. \u201cIt has, though, facilitated the use of color globally by creating a common digital color language.\u201d A result is that \u201cour culture has become supervisual, and more than ever before. Color has become a definer of many things.\u201dEach December for nearly two decades, the Pantone Color Institute has tried to capture the moment in the form of its Color of the Year, which it has described as \u201ca color snapshot of what we see taking place in our global culture that serves as an expression of a mood and an attitude.\u201d This year\u2019s pick is Ultra Violet (18-3838), a bluish purple that, the company asserts, is associated with the counterculture, nonconformity, mindfulness and visionary thinking, and that \u201csuggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead and the discoveries beyond where we are now.\u201d The release of the Color of the Year occasions a media frenzy and, after it, a torrent of bandwagon-hopping service journalism: For months after this year\u2019s selection, Google Alerts continued to crowd my inbox with articles suggesting how I might use Ultra Violet to update my wardrobe, redecorate my living room, create floral bouquets or crochet a scarf. A Swedish art director created a recipe for an Ultra Violet-colored smoothie.Sometimes Pantone\u2019s pick validates an established trend, as Rose Quartz (13-1520) did for the shade popularly known as Millennial Pink in 2016 \u2014 about as risky a choice as the N.B.A.\u2019s picking LeBron James for Most Valuable Player. In other cases, like Ultra Violet, the company has treaded nearer to the leading edge, more a demonstration of power, perhaps, than astuteness. \u201cThe actual tones themselves I\u2019ve not loved,\u201d Jane Monnington Boddy, the London-based color director at WGSN, a tracker of global fashion trends, told me. But over all, she said, she was impressed with \u201cthe philosophy behind them and how they\u2019ve captured what\u2019s happening in life.\u201dThe Pantone Color Institute is less the elite unit its name implies than a loose network of specialists drawn from Pressman\u2019s contacts. They live in roughly 20 countries and travel the world, she told me, from the established fashion capitals of Europe to other \u201ctrend forward\u201d cities like Shanghai, Buenos Aires, Melbourne and Cape Town, scouring the fashion, technology, houseware, home-furnishing and automotive industries for glimmers of nascent color trends. \u201cI\u2019m very circumspect about who I bring in,\u201d Pressman told me. \u201cThat person has to be of a certain caliber.\u201dI visited Eiseman in July, when she was teaching her annual class on trend forecasting and color psychology at the Bainbridge Island Museum of Art, and she allowed me to sit in. When I met her at the museum, Eiseman, with her thick-framed glasses, jewelry and bobbed, sandy blond hair, bore more than a passing resemblance to Anna Wintour. Her long-sleeved shirt and patterned pants, precisely coordinated, offered an eye-catching blend of oranges, greens and blues, as if she meant her attire to double as a kind of couture business card.I sat in the back row of a classroom on the museum\u2019s second floor and watched her students file in. There were two dozen of them, most in their 20s or 30s, all but one of them women. Rami Kim, the founder of a color institute in Seoul who was on her third pilgrimage to Bainbridge, had brought along seven other South Koreans. Sitting to my right was a former nurse from South Africa, now an interior designer, who said she was hoping to learn more about color combinations, and to my left, a young woman who worked for a small family-owned party-supply company, who told me she was interested in the application of color to edible paper. The lone man in the class was a software engineer contemplating a change of careers to something \u201cmore creative.\u201d All the students paid $1,775 for the privilege of being there, and several of them spoke of their instructor with a respect bordering on reverence. \u201cThere\u2019s no one who can talk about color like she can,\u201d one of them told me.Promptly at 8 a.m., Eiseman switched off the lights and asked a student to close the blinds. \u201cThe colors will be more vibrant if we get more darkness,\u201d she said. For the next six hours, clicking through illustrative photographs from her travels to more than 60 countries, Eiseman delivered a cascade of assertions: Kids everywhere in the world gravitate to red, blue and yellow crayons; people living near the Equator tend to prefer brighter colors; readers have better recall if texts are printed in something other than black and white; gamblers place higher bets under red lights than under blue ones; there was no word for the color \u201corange\u201d in Europe until the fruit arrived sometime in the Middle Ages; blue shutters in the American southwest are meant to ward off evil spirits; many fire departments have begun painting their engines yellow-green because red, the traditional color, too often appears brown in twilight. At one point, when Eiseman paused to take questions, a young woman raised her hand.\u201cAre there people you can\u2019t teach color to, people who just don\u2019t get it?\u201d she asked.Eiseman thought for a moment, and said, \u201cYou get resistance from people when you\u2019re working, people who think that color is immaterial, not as important as everything else, but you can usually find something to talk about in their background, mostly coming out of their childhood, that will trigger a response.\u201dThe idea that colors exert powerful, often subliminal forces on the human mind is at once Eiseman\u2019s ardent belief and her professional stock in trade. As she wrote 18 years ago in \u201cPantone Guide to Communicating With Color,\u201d \u201csome experts believe that humans have an \u2018ancient wisdom,\u2019 that throughout eons of evolutionary history going back to the beginning of time, we have an associative memory concerning space, form, patterns and colors.\u201d Leveraging that wisdom and revealing the unspoken meanings and emotions conveyed by slight, almost imperceptible variations in color has been her life\u2019s work.Eiseman was born and raised in Baltimore. As a teenager, she dabbled in modeling and won a voice scholarship to the Peabody Institute, but turned it down after deciding against pursuing a career in music. A few years later she met Herb Eiseman, her future husband, a Hollywood talent agent who went on to lead the music publishing division at 20th Century Fox. The couple married and moved to the Los Angeles area, where Eiseman finished her bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology at Antioch University and, afterward, earned a counseling certificate from U.C.L.A. She and Herb had two children, and while they were in school, Eiseman began teaching classes part time at an occupational-training center for women in the San Fernando Valley.It was there that she began thinking systematically about color. \u201cThe concept that I developed was called the \u2018color clock,\u2019 and it was based on color as it appears in nature,\u201d she told me. \u201cHow Monet painted the haystacks, various things at various times of day, and how the color seemed to change because of the light.\u201d She applied the idea to women\u2019s clothes and cosmetics, \u201cusing my students as guinea pigs to see if it really held weight.\u201dIn 1983, she published a book called \u201cAlive With Color.\u201d Soon, she was fielding phone calls asking her to weigh in on the color of everything from living rooms to medical equipment. One caller was Pantone\u2019s Larry Herbert, who invited her to meet with him in New York. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know Pantone existed,\u201d she said. It turned out that Herbert, who\u2019d seen her book, was on the hunt for someone with expertise in the psychology of color, in part to help elevate his company\u2019s public profile. Eiseman jumped at the chance, and 33 years later, she\u2019s still Pantone\u2019s ambassador at large.Eiseman believes that our reaction to colors \u201cgoes beyond the psychological into the physiological\u201d and that colors carry inherent messages that all humans innately understand \u2014 the whispers of that \u201cancient wisdom.\u201d She doesn\u2019t deny the important influence of memory and social factors on color perception, but often, she says, \u201cour response is involuntary, and we simply have no control over it.\u201d As evidence, she points to word-association tests she has administered over the years during her work with Pantone. I asked to see a sample test and some results, but Eiseman refused and said they were proprietary. You can get a feel for her methods, though, from a 2015 interview she gave to Nautilus magazine. \u201cYou take a Pantone color chip and you ask, \u2018Give us the first word that pops into your mind when you look at this color,\u2019 and you see whether that corresponds to a positive, negative or indifferent response,\u201d Eiseman said. \u201cIf you show people a chip of Pantone Sky Blue, about 90 percent or more will respond in the same way: It\u2019s the color of the sky, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s a light color, it reminds you of that openness. It\u2019s a near-universal response that you get.\u201dYep, that\u2019s me down to the ground, I thought as I read it. But what about people who don\u2019t like blue? \u201cPerhaps you want to change your job, a relationship or even your life, and long for more excitement,\u201d Eiseman writes. \u201cYou wish that you were wealthy or brilliant (or both), because that would enable you to have all the good things in life without working so hard.\u201dAll that from a color? And the fortunetelling continues. Do you like green? \u201cYou are the good citizen, concerned parent, involved neighbor, the joiner of clubs and organizations.\u201d Have an aversion to red? You may be \u201cirritable, exhausted or bothered by many problems.\u201d Yellow? \u201cYou are optimistic, hopeful and encourage others to do their best.\u201d Perhaps strangest of all, though, is Eiseman\u2019s observation about those of us who dislike blue-green shades like turquoise or teal: \u201cA little voice inside you (was it your mother, your father or your roommate?) keeps telling you to clean up your room.\u201dThe flip tone of these pronouncements, combined with the lack of any grounding in scientific rigor or research apart from Eiseman\u2019s own observations, may tempt you to dismiss color psychology altogether, consigning it to the bin with other junk sciences, like phrenology or cold fusion. But a great many people take it seriously \u2014 so many, in fact, that for all my searching, I found only one person willing to question it. When I put Eiseman\u2019s assertions to David Comberg, a senior lecturer of design at the University of Pennsylvania, he scoffed and said that color preferences are highly subjective, unpredictable and, in his experience, \u201cprimarily influenced by culture and emotion and are not easily quantified.\u201d When we see red, for instance, are we reacting to the color itself or to a personal experience, perhaps buried in the subconscious, that we associate with it? \u201cAnd what about taste, smell and sound? Artificial intelligence and neuroscience may one day answer all this, but I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Comberg said. \u201cIt all seems subjective and irrational.\u201dBut among people in Eiseman\u2019s profession, as with the hordes of credulous color enthusiasts who populate the internet, her views are not only uncontroversial but well within the mainstream. \u201cWe are born to understand that green equals calming, because it\u2019s found in nature; red equals danger, because it\u2019s the color of blood,\u201d Jenny Ross, a creative- design manager in the footwear department at New Balance, told me. \u201cYellow equals energy, because it\u2019s the color of the sun.\u201d WGSN\u2019s Jane Monnington Boddy agreed, saying, \u201cPeople do have an inbuilt, preprogrammed understanding of colors, as animals do in nature.\u201d What else explains our instinct to recoil from red-and-black snakes, she asked, or from yellow-and-black flying insects?Ultimately, though, whether blue makes you think of the sky or Papa Smurf, by this point, color psychology may matter less to Pantone\u2019s success than something much less mysterious. \u201cHow do you sell color?\u201d David Shah had asked me rhetorically when I met him in London. \u201cYou can be 10 times cleverer than me. You can be much more intelligent, much more creative. But it\u2019s Pantone, with a million Instagram followers. If you\u2019re hidden away, even though your color is better, you don\u2019t win the argument.\u201dAt a certain point, Pantone\u2019s prognostications began to take on the weight of self-fulfilling prophecies. Much like investors who base financial decisions on the assessments of Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s, Pantone\u2019s clientele seems to understand that, for all the time and effort the company expends in identifying color trends, it\u2019s the judgments themselves, regardless of the research behind them, that matter most. \u201cBecause of our platform, we\u2019re able to promote,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s self-perpetuating \u2014 when people believe you\u2019re right, they buy you. You get to be right!\u201dWhen I brought up the Color of the Year, Shah trod carefully at first \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything about what I think about this, O.K.?\u201d \u2014 then went on: \u201cYou might go: \u2018Oh, my God! That\u2019s the most awful color in the world! Who would choose it?\u2019 And then you\u2019re like, \u2018I better be careful, because it\u2019s the Pantone Color of the Year, and everybody\u2019s looking at it, and if I don\u2019t, I could be left out.\u2019 When you\u2019ve got a platform like that, you can say it\u2019s the color of my toenails! Can I afford not to do it, even if I don\u2019t believe in it? It\u2019s a lot of smoke and mirrors.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the ownership of Pantone.

Now some private companies, like Jupiter, are trying to fill the gap.This remains a young and untested field, and it\u2019s unclear whether Jupiter or others can succeed as profitable enterprises. Scientists caution that predicting short-term climate effects in specific locations remains rife with uncertainty. Jupiter will have to persuade potential customers that its forecasts are reliable enough to give companies a competitive edge.\u201cIn economics, information has value if you would make a different decision based on that information,\u201d said Matthew E. Kahn, an economist who studies climate adaptation at the University of Southern California. \u201cIs that the case here?\u201dThe company is developing a variety of predictive tools, some of which look much like Google Maps, that it hopes will allow paying customers to zoom down to the city block level to get a better sense of the potential risks they face from storms, heat waves, wildfires or other climate-change effects in the coming decades.\u201cWe know the planet\u2019s getting warmer and sea levels are rising, but on a hyperlocal basis, the quality of those predictions can be much better than it is,\u201d Mr. Sorkin said.To create its flood maps, for instance, Jupiter looks not just at public data like satellite-based observations of rainfall and ocean currents, but also how changes in the urban landscape affect how water flows through cities. It then aims to harness recent advances in cloud-based supercomputing to combine that data with the latest climate model projections. The company\u2019s scientists plan to continually test their forecasts against observations \u2014 to see, for instance, how well they predict flooding from major storms \u2014 and publish their research in scientific journals.\u201cIf you want a full picture of flooding risk, you need expertise in weather, but also climate and hydrology and engineering and running complex models on the latest computer hardware,\u201d Mr. Sorkin said. \u201cAll of those specialized disciplines are usually heavily siloed within the public sector or the scientific community.\u201dJupiter\u2019s scientists will have to grapple with a number of technical challenges. While current climate models can provide broad statistical projections of how average temperatures and rainfall patterns are likely to shift across large regions over the coming century, it remains difficult to predict such shifts precisely over shorter time scales \u2014 which is what companies are often most concerned about.\u201cForecasting at 10-20 year time periods is perhaps the most difficult period to forecast,\u201d Simon Mason, a climate scientist at Columbia University\u2019s International Research Institute for Climate and Society who is not involved with Jupiter, wrote in an email. \u201cIf that is not enough, trying to predict severe weather events rather than long-term averages is even harder still!\u201d\u201cOne airline wanted to know how often the airport in Frankfurt would be closed because of snowstorms next year,\u201d Dr. Brasseur said. \u201cWe were unable to answer a question like that.\u201d\u201cThat certainly raised the stakes in terms of trying to get the best possible science on your side when you\u2019re pricing risk,\u201d said John Drzik, president of global risk at Marsh, one of the world\u2019s largest commercial insurance brokers, which is currently in talks with Jupiter to explore what types of data and risk analyses might be most useful to its clients.Mr. Drzik noted that many of the traditional catastrophic risk models used by the insurance industry are rooted largely in historical data and don\u2019t always grapple fully with how climate change could shift those risks in the future. While his company is still evaluating whether Jupiter\u2019s climate-oriented models are useful enough to be worth paying for, \u201cit grabbed us as something that had a lot of promise.\u201dAs global warming advances, experts say that governments will ultimately have to invest more in their own local climate prediction tools to help cities and industries adapt. But they also see a role for private climate forecasters, much as weather companies have sprung up to supplement the work the National Weather Service does.\u201cThe federal government could be doing a lot more,\u201d said James L. Buizer, who studies climate adaptation at the University of Arizona. \u201cBut there\u2019s still an important role for the private sector. If companies are going to benefit from this information, they ought to be paying for it. After all, it\u2019s their infrastructure that\u2019s going to get trashed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s the largest momentum swing in history \u2014 and it\u2019s not particularly close.\u201dThe bigger pictureThe cause of one of the most turbulent weeks in recent memory appeared to be widespread expectations that the global economy is improving and that growth would accelerate in the near future.That has led to fears that interest rate increases could cheapen the value of certain kinds of investments.More on the markets and economyNearly 70 percent of S.&P. 500 companies have reported results so far, and profits are on pace to grow 14 percent, according to FactSet. Analysts expected earnings to rise 11 percent at the end of the fourth quarter.\u2022 If that growth rate holds up, it would mark the third quarter of double-digit earnings growth in the past four.\u2022 All 11 of the S.&P. 500\u2019s sectors are reporting higher profits, and five sectors have reported double-digit gains.\u2022 74 percent of companies are announcing earnings above Wall Street estimates.\u2022 79 percent are reporting sales above forecasts.\u2022 S.&P. 500 companies that generate more than 50 percent of their sales abroad are on pace to report a 17.4 percent increase in their bottom lines. For those that get the majority of their revenue from within the United States, earnings are set to rise 12 percent.Nearly a year after Waymo first accused the ride-hailing company of plotting to steal important self-driving car technology, the two companies have settled their courtroom fight.After four days of arguments in Federal District Court here, Uber agreed to provide Waymo with 0.34 percent of its stock. Uber is now valued at about $72 billion, which works out to about $240 million, according to Waymo.Rand Paul, who temporarily halted the Senate\u2019s vote on the deal, said this:\u201cI want people to feel uncomfortable. I want them to have to answer people at home who said, \u2018How come you were against President Obama\u2019s deficits and then how come you\u2019re for Republican deficits?\u2019 \u201dDemocrats are to get more funds for child care and other goodies; hawks in both parties have won more money for the defense budget. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, still wants his border wall and an infrastructure plan. The mood of fiscal insouciance in Washington, D.C., is troubling.What\u2019s in the bill\u2022 The killing of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which was meant to cap Medicare spending\u2022 The extension of tax breaks for renewable and nuclear energy and a tax credit for carbon dioxide capture\u2022 Special tax rates for timber salesThe immigration issueNancy Pelosi both praised the budget deal and said that she wouldn\u2019t vote for it because it didn\u2019t protect Dreamers. Some Democrats called on her to force her colleagues to block the deal, but others pointed to its funding for domestic programs.The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both fell into correction territory on Thursday. Fed officials, though, have remained upbeat on their outlook for the United States economy and sanguine about the market\u2019s tumble.This week Robert Kaplan, the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said:\u201cI think it\u2019s healthy that there is some correction, a little more volatility in markets\u2026can be a healthy thing.\u201dWilliam Dudley, the New York Fed President, said:\u201cIf the stock market were to go down precipitously and stay down, then that would actually feed into the economic outlook, and that would affect my view in terms of the implications for monetary policy.\u201dMore in marketsShares in the two big names in package delivery were down in premarket trading today. Why?Amazon.com preparing to launch a delivery service for businesses, positioning it to directly compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.Dubbed \u201cShipping with Amazon,\u201d or SWA, the new service will entail the tech giant picking up packages from businesses and shipping them to consumers, according to people familiar with the matter.Amazon expects to roll out the new delivery service in Los Angeles in coming weeks with third-party merchants that sell goods via its website, according to the people. Amazon then aims to expand the service to more cities as soon as this year, some of the people say.Where else have investors felt fear about what Amazon might do to an industry?\u2014 Michael de la MercedBut there\u2019s still a lot they disagree on:Behind the scenes, the games reflect cozy ties between South Korea\u2019s government and Samsung \u2014 ones that continue to attract criticism.The company\u2019s chairman, Lee Kun-hee, is a longtime member of the International Olympic Committee and lobbied for years behind the scenes to bring the Winter Games to South Korea. The government saw Mr. Lee as so pivotal to its Olympic dreams that after he was convicted of tax evasion in 2008, the country\u2019s president then pardoned him expressly so he could resume lobbying for Pyeongchang.So extraordinary is the overlap between Samsung, South Korea and the Pyeongchang Games it is unlikely to be repeated, say IOC members and Olympics experts. Mr. Lee\u2019s lobbying and Samsung\u2019s close involvement are now considered inappropriate by some Olympics experts and voters.After Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even in the shadow of Facebook and Google, Peter Eavis writes:The tech flyaroundAdvertisement"}

The space station is currently scheduled to operate through 2024, but the expectation was that it would be extended through at least 2028.The budget numbers were confirmed by a person who was not authorized to talk publicly about them.In future years, the administration would like NASA\u2019s spending to drop to $19.6 billion and stay flat through 2023. With inflation, NASA\u2019s buying power would erode, effectively a budget cut each year.A NASA spokesman said he could not discuss the budget proposal until it was released.The proposal is just an opening bid. Congress decides the final spending numbers, sometimes adjusting them or ignoring a president\u2019s priorities. But an administration\u2019s wishes are often incorporated.Additionally, no one has been nominated for the No. 2 position, deputy administrator.\u201cI hope that those reports prove as unfounded as Bigfoot,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness, said on Wednesday during a Federal Aviation Administration conference on commercial space transportation.He decried \u201cnumbskulls\u201d at the Office of Management and Budget in the White House for coming up with the idea. \u201cAs a fiscal conservative, you know one of the dumbest things you can do?\u201d he said. \u201cCanceling programs after billions in investment when there is still serious usable life in it.\u201dThe same conference was attended by Scott Pace, the executive secretary of Mr. Pence\u2019s space council. While he did not discuss details of the budget, Mr. Pace suggested that money needed to be freed up for new initiatives.For NASA to push human spaceflight further, he said, \u201cthe kinds of commitment of resources that traditionally we\u2019ve done in low-earth orbit, we can direct some of that toward deeper space exploration.\u201dThe budget proposal promises \u201ca seamless transition to the use of future commercial capabilities,\u201d and allocates $150 million in 2019 to encourage commercial development in low-Earth orbit.The administration proposes $900 million for this goal through 2023. If structured like earlier NASA public-private partnerships, like the ones for carrying cargo and crew to the space station, the money would be split between two or more companies.By contrast, the United States has spent close to $100 billion building and operating the International Space Station.But space experts so far do not see how that would be viable economically because NASA currently spends $3 billion to $4 billion a year.\u201cI haven\u2019t really seen anyone talking about that,\u201d said Tommy Sanford, the executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group representing many of the new space companies. \u201cI think that\u2019d be difficult.\u201dMr. Sanford said the federation was concerned about setting a specific end date. He said it would be better to define benchmarks that commercial alternatives would need to achieve before the International Space Station is retired.In recent years, more companies have started using the station in areas like pharmaceutical research and manufacturing of fiber optical cable.\u201cIf we abruptly end that, without a smooth transition plan,\u201d John Elbon, vice president and general manager of space exploration at Boeing, said at last week\u2019s conference, \u201call that investment will be for naught.\u201dFor a greater focus on the moon, the budget plan describes investing in commercial companies to develop and fly robotic landers to carry experiments and other payloads to the moon.Those companies could include Moon Express and Astrobotic Technology, two companies originally created to compete for a $20 million grand prize in the Google Lunar X Prize. The X Prize Foundation conceded last month that none of the remaining competitors would be able to reach the moon before the prize expires on March 31. Both companies still plan to head to the moon in the next couple of years.In addition, Blue Origin, a space company started by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has proposed a larger lander called Blue Moon that could deliver several tons of cargo to the surface of the moon.Efforts to increase research and development aimed at next-generation space technologies for a range of human and robotic missions, one of the priorities of the Obama administration\u2019s space policy, would be refocused on nearer-term development on moon missions.For astronauts, the goal is still to reach \u201cthe vicinity of the moon\u201d in 2023. That is the current schedule for the first crewed launch of the Space Launch System, which would fly around the moon but not land.Under the proposed timeline, work on a lander would not start until that year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Profits Drove a Stock Boom. Did the Economy Pay a Price?", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneStocks are too expensive.This is not a market forecast. I wouldn\u2019t be particularly surprised if the Dow shrugged off its recent turbulence and continued its long upward thrust. What I contend is that if the American economy behaved in the way that most economists say market economies should, stocks would in all likelihood be cheaper.It is a grim proposition. Wall Street\u2019s titans might welcome the fact that equity prices have grossly exceeded what a well-functioning, competitive economy should deliver. But for almost everybody else, it amounts to a disaster. From wage stagnation to the depressed investment rates that are holding back long-term economic growth, many of the fault lines running through the American economy can be traced back to the same root cause powering the rise of America\u2019s overpriced stocks.What makes this particularly puzzling for scholars reared on the classical models of competitive economies is that all this happened despite a persistent decline in real interest rates. In a more orthodox economy, declining rates on corporate bonds would encourage a surge in corporate investment. As companies invested more and more capital, the returns on investments would gradually decline until companies\u2019 returns matched their cost of capital: the interest rate they pay to borrow.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.In a nutshell, the United States has built an economy where businesses don\u2019t invest even though it has rarely been cheaper to finance investment. Still, they reap spectacular profits that warrant runaway share prices.What happened? It turns out that there is one straightforward reason for the American economy\u2019s unorthodox behavior. As Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues argue, the standard economic theory based on competitive markets cannot apply when markets are not competitive. And competition, in the United States, is shriveling.The scholars argue that the American economy is afflicted by \u201crents\u201d \u2014 returns in excess of what investments would yield in a competitive economy, where fat margins are quickly whittled away by competition.These rents don\u2019t fall from the sky. Companies free of competitive pressures, with the power to set prices more or less at will, squeeze them from their customers and their workers. They pad corporate profits and send stock prices sky high.Global inequality, after widening for decades, has stabilized. The share of the world\u2019s income captured by the top 1 percent has shrunk since its peak on the eve of the financial crisis.Executives love it. The critical question is what these rents hold in store for the rest of us.Still, there are good reasons to worry about rising rents, no matter where they come from. Mr. Shapiro argues that while some measures of market concentration may not be meaningful, persistently high profits are of themselves a cause for concern.Profits as a share of output have risen by half over the last 30 years. Combined with evidence that large corporations are accounting for an increasing share of revenue and employment, Mr. Shapiro writes, \u201cit certainly appears that many large U.S. corporations are earning substantial incumbency rents, and have been doing so for at least 10 years, apart from during the depths of the Great Recession.\u201dThis is particularly true in the tech sector, where a handful of dominant companies \u2014 you know the ones I\u2019m talking about \u2014 have sustained spectacular profits for years. Their sky-high stock prices suggest that investors expect high profits to continue as well.\u201cThey probably are geniuses; what they are doing is wonderful,\u201d Mr. Shapiro told me. \u201cStill, you would expect competition to erode away the excess profits over time.\u201dHere is why we should worry.Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues built an alternative model of the American economy by doing away with the assumption of perfect competition. They contend that there are barriers to entry that stop competitors and allow rents to persist.In this economy, stock prices don\u2019t just reflect the future stream of normal economic returns that would accrue to a company\u2019s capital investment. They also include a claim to a stream of rents that generate \u201cpure profits.\u201d These profits can\u2019t be replicated by another company\u2019s capital investment. They are owned by a specific company.Rents interfere with incentives in a big way. Companies will spend more time and effort trying to preserve those rents \u2014 often by working to block rivals from their markets. Rivals will fight to grab a share of those rents for themselves, perhaps through lobbying. Amid all this jockeying, investment in productive capabilities will most likely be neglected as a secondary consideration.And inevitably, inequality will rise: The owners of the shares in the powerful corporations capturing the economy\u2019s growing monopoly rents will peel further and further away from the average Jane and Joe, who own little but their labor.This is not the kind of economy proposed by classical economic theory. It is not the kind of country portrayed by evangelists of the American dream. But it looks as if we are stuck with it, regardless of what the stock market does tomorrow.Advertisement"}

The theory: If a reassuringly large amount of new equity were created at the subsidiaries, the banks\u2019 creditors and trading partners would feel protected and not withdraw.

Lauren Dickens, the museum curator who brought the show to San Jose, put it more bluntly: \u201cThere\u2019s a suspicion that he\u2019s actually a Communist because he works under a Communist government.\u201dArt collective notwithstanding, Mr. Nguyen is no Communist, and he came to San Jose and met with community leaders to make the point. But he\u2019s also not one to shun controversy, at least in America. Vietnam, where all public exhibitions must be approved by a government agency, is another matter.Immigration, perhaps? No, that\u2019s more a problem in the United States.The collective had gotten started a few years earlier, with Mr. Nguyen and Phunam supporting their artwork by producing local television spots and splashy Vietnamese music videos. Looking for a name, they kept seeing the phrase \u201cpropeller group\u201d popping up in Google \u2014 for a PR agency, an advertising firm, a production company \u2014 so they adopted it. But some people found this confusing. Were they, as Mr. Nguyen wrote in the museum show\u2019s catalog, \u201can art collective pretending to be an advertising company, or an advertising company pretending to be an art collective?\u201d To which he replied, \u201cYes and yes please.\u201dSo, good luck trying to get a straight answer out of them. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in existing in a state of paradox,\u201d said Naomi Beckwith, a curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago who helped organize the exhibition that\u2019s now in San Jose.It\u2019s a state that reflects the situation in Vietnam in general and Ho Chi Minh City in particular \u2014 a Communist country mauled by decades of war that\u2019s now exploding with capitalist consumerism; a watery landscape where solid ground can be an iffy proposition; a city of some 8.4 million where the line between public space and private space becomes blurred. This is why, when Ms. Beckwith and Claudia Schmuckli \u2014 then the director of the University of Houston\u2019s art museum, now a curator at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco \u2014 came here to plan the Propeller Group exhibition, its members insisted they first explore the city and the vast Mekong Delta that flanks it.The film is also about fluidity. Good and evil spirits battle for the soul of the departed. A transgender street performer dances in a circle of flame. By the end of the film, the band is marching into the water, white uniforms and all. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a metaphor for reincarnation,\u201d Mr. Lucero said.Reincarnation is perhaps the ultimate form of liminality,so it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the members of the Propeller Group are fascinated by it. Mr. Lucero was born just three days after Mr. Nguyen in April 1976. The two have long joked that in a former life they met on the battlefield in the final days of the Vietnam War and killed one another, only to be reincarnated in their present forms.If individual members of the Propeller Group could die and be reborn, why not the collective itself? That is the message they\u2019re sending out now. The exhibition catalog opens with \u201cAn Obituary for The Propeller Group\u201d that says the collective \u201ctransitioned to reincarnation\u201d just before the show opened in Chicago. Since then, the three have largely gone their own ways. Phunam shot a Vietnamese film that opened in November, and he has others in the works. Mr. Lucero and his Vietnamese-born wife started a company in Ho Chi Minh City that makes finishes for furniture. \u201cI haven\u2019t completely given up on art,\u201d Mr. Lucero said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very, very stressful to me to do the kind of traveling you need to do to maintain this presence in the art world.\u201dMr. Nguyen is continuing as an artist. Though the Propeller Group has rarely shown in Vietnam, he has long been an influential figure here, thanks largely to an art center he co-founded in 2007. Called S\u00e0n Art (\u201cs\u00e0n\u201d means \u201cplatform\u201d), it offered critical resources to aspiring artists. But it all but shut down in 2016, chiefly because of government pressure.Mr. Nguyen went back to Bidong Island to make a film about the now-abandoned refugee camp. He was drawn by news reports that a monument erected by former refugees had been dismantled under pressure from the Hanoi government. Called \u201cThe Island\u201d and set in a post-nuclear future, the film was a highlight of the 2017 Whitney Biennial in New York.And the Propeller Group? The art world expects the name \u201cto be attached to specific members,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what if we completely challenged that?\u201d What if the collective simply carried on with new members? They are leaving all options open. Which raises the question: what is the Propeller Group anyway \u2014 three guys who constitute an art collective, or an art collective that used to be made up of three guys?Yes and yes please.Advertisement"}

Talya Minsberg, a social strategy editor for The Times who is in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to cover the Winter Olympics, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.As a social strategy editor for The Times, what tech do you use on the job the most?Part of the job of a social editor is thinking about how readers find news where they already are \u2014 on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat. So I try to consume news like we know many of our readers do, from their phones.When I\u2019m in charge of what goes out on our social channels, I use a MacBook and one extra monitor, nothing too fancy. The key is having a handful of listening tools at the ready. That means I\u2019m one of those people who have an obnoxious amount of tabs up at once. Crowdtangle, a social media analytics tool, Chartbeat, Tweetdeck, Facebook \u2026 I could go on.I also listen to a good amount of music that can help me zone in on my work. So I\u2019m a frequent user of Spotify and live performances I have favorited on YouTube.How much social media do you consume for work, what forms of it do you consume the most, and how do you handle the deluge?As most social media editors can attest, the job demands consuming a lot of media in all forms. Day to day, Twitter takes up most of my time and energy. I also dedicate a good amount of my attention to Facebook, Reddit and Instagram at the office.I\u2019m very much still working on how I handle the deluge. Some days it feels like I\u2019m always taking in information, from the moment I wake up and start listening to NPR. Creating methods to narrow down the \u201cneed to know\u201d helps me cut out some of the noise. That could be a zooming in on sources pertinent to a story I\u2019m working on or top news. Either way, creating lists and advanced searches on Twitter is invaluable. I also follow specific subreddits, track trending terms, and use Google Alerts.That being said, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s helpful for my mental well-being to take one day a week off from social media. For me, that\u2019s Saturday. It feels like a weekly cleanse and sometimes it\u2019s truly a challenge, which makes me realize just how much I really need to push myself to do it. For one day a week, I try to use my phone as one thing and one thing only: a way to text and call family and friends. Radical, isn\u2019t it?My first priority was ensuring I have a secure backup for everything. If something happens to my phone or computer, I wanted to make sure that wouldn\u2019t completely derail my work. I use a password manager, have two-step verification on everything that allows it, and keep lots of stuff in the cloud.I\u2019ve also kicked my listening tools usage into high gear. That means a wealth of new lists, alerts and threads I\u2019m watching that are Olympics- and sport-specific.Do you have to keep any tech gear warm in the chilly temperatures in Pyeongchang, and how do you plan to do so? Yes! As many have experienced, phones can die quickly in the cold. Since temperatures have been hovering between zero and 30 degrees Fahrenheit, I thought about creative ways to keep my gear warm and charged. I ordered dozens and dozens of hand warmers that I plan on also using as phone warmers. The backup plan to that backup plan is having more than one phone on me, and more than one external charger on me.What is our social media strategy set to be at the Winter Olympics?I\u2019ll tell you about the tool I\u2019m most excited about \u2014 a new messaging system with one of our sports editors, Sam Manchester. Sam will be sending messages from the Olympics to readers within The New York Times app.There are a handful of exciting things you\u2019ll see on the messaging app. But perhaps most exciting is the fact that you will actually be able to talk to Sam, who is a real-life human and not a bot! He\u2019s going to be your man on the ground who will take you behind the scenes of the Games in all their excitement and quirkiness.Outside of work, what tech product are you in love with using in your daily life right now?What could be better about it?The most frustrating feature is that you have to be within 100 yards of a theater to reserve tickets. I wish you could reserve tickets in advance without being there. I don\u2019t see a reason against it, especially if there was a penalty for not showing up at the movie after reserving tickets to dissuade no shows, \u00e0 la ClassPass.What do you do to get away from social media?I get moving. I\u2019ve been an avid runner since I was a little kid, and there\u2019s nothing that makes me happier than a good long run. I\u2019m hoping to get in some runs in the very early mornings in Pyeongchang, SmartWool included.Advertisement"}

Mr. Yang thinks he can sell the idea in Washington by framing it as a pro-business policy.\u201cI\u2019m a capitalist,\u201d he said, \u201cand I believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue.\u201dMr. Yang, a married father of two boys, is a fast-talking extrovert who wears the nu-executive uniform of a blazer and jeans without a tie. He keeps a daily journal of things he\u2019s grateful for, and peppers conversations with business-world catchphrases like \u201ccore competency.\u201d After graduating from Brown University and Columbia Law School, he quit his job at a big law firm and began working in tech. He ran an internet start-up that failed during the first dot-com bust, worked as an executive at a health care start-up and helped build a test-prep business that was acquired by Kaplan in 2009, netting him a modest fortune.He caught the political bug after starting Venture for America, an organization modeled after Teach for America that connects recent college graduates with start-up businesses. During his travels to Midwestern cities, he began to connect the growth of anti-establishment populism with the rise of workplace automation.\u201cUniversal basic income is an old idea,\u201d Mr. Yang said, \u201cbut it\u2019s an old idea that right now is uniquely relevant because of what we\u2019re experiencing in society.\u201dMr. Yang\u2019s prominent supporters include Andy Stern, a former leader of Service Employees International Union, who credited him with \u201copening up a discussion that the country\u2019s afraid to have.\u201d His campaign has also attracted some of Silicon Valley\u2019s elites. Tony Hsieh, the chief executive of Zappos, is an early donor to Mr. Yang\u2019s campaign, as are several venture capitalists and high-ranking alumni of Facebook and Google.Mr. Yang, who has raised roughly $130,000 since filing his official paperwork with the Federal Election Commission in November, says he will ultimately raise millions from supporters in the tech industry and elsewhere to supplement his own money.And although he said he was socially liberal, he admitted that he hadn\u2019t fully developed all his positions. (On most social issues, Mr. Yang said, \u201cI believe what you probably think I believe.\u201d)The likelihood, of course, is that Mr. Yang\u2019s candidacy won\u2019t end with a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Still, experts I spoke with were glad to have him talking about the long-term risks of automation, at a time when much of Washington is consumed with the immediate and visible.Erik Brynjolfsson, the director of M.I.T.\u2019s Initiative on the Digital Economy and a co-author of \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d praised Mr. Yang for bringing automation\u2019s economic effects into the conversation.\u201cThis is a serious problem, and it\u2019s going to get a lot worse,\u201d Mr. Brynjolfsson said. \u201cIn every election for the next 10 or 20 years, this will become a more salient issue, and the candidates who can speak to it effectively will do well.\u201dMr. Yang knows he could sound the automation alarm without running for president.

Silicon Valley holds extraordinary power over our present lives as well as whatever utopia (or nightmare) might come next. \u201cIf robots are going to run the world, or at the very least play a hugely critical role in our future, men shouldn\u2019t be programming them alone,\u201d Chang writes. \u201cThe scarcity of women in an industry that is so forcefully reshaping our culture simply cannot be allowed to stand.\u201dChang, the host and executive producer of the television show \u201cBloomberg Technology,\u201d is on to something important, even if her book doesn\u2019t quite do it justice. Some of the writing is blander than it needs to be, and she has a soft spot for worthy proclamations.But she is clearly engaged with and often incensed by her subject, and the best parts of \u201cBrotopia\u201d are those moments when she actively resists the \u201cit\u2019s all good\u201d ethos of the Bay Area and cuts down chauvinism with the disdain it deserves.The book includes a blistering chapter about the venture capitalist Peter Thiel and the self-styled PayPal Mafia \u2014 an all-male clique of company alumni who fund one another\u2019s business ventures. Thiel and a group of mostly conservative classmates from Stanford later founded PayPal and boasted about their entrepreneurial success, casting it as a vindication of their hiring strategy. None of the company\u2019s first engineers were women. As one founder admits, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know any.\u201dThe adulation of Sandberg gets surprisingly personal. Chang describes being pregnant with her first child in 2012, doubting her \u201cability to succeed as a working mom,\u201d and emailing Sandberg out of gratitude for her willingness to step into the fray. \u201cI gasped aloud when, 30 seconds later, Sandberg\u2019s reply hit my inbox.\u201dOne might have hoped that this intimacy would at least generate some pointed insights or candid quotes. But Sandberg gives Chang her well-worn lines about trickle-down feminism. \u201cWomen in leadership will help create the environment for more women in leadership,\u201d Sandberg tells her, in a sentence that sounds about as spontaneous as a TED Talk. \u201cWomen will create the institutional change we need.\u201d\u201cI believe this will happen,\u201d Chang writes. This credulity is as disappointing as it is puzzling. As her own reporting shows, Google found it hard to scale its good intentions as it grew, and last year it reported numbers comparable to the rest of the industry, with women accounting for less than a third of its work force and only 25 percent of its leadership roles. Google had regressed to the mean \u2014 and the mean, as it stands, isn\u2019t great for women.That last detail gave me pause, if only for how trite it is. As Chang herself wonders, \u201cIf these sexual adventurers are so progressive, why do these parties seem to lean so heavily toward male heterosexual fantasies?\u201d The party scenes she depicts are as poignant and depressing as \u201cRevenge of the Nerds.\u201d For all their talk of innovation, these entrepreneurs can\u2019t throw an orgy without resorting to clich\u00e9s.\u201cYou may think you\u2019re Steve Jobs, but really you\u2019re Roger Ailes or Bill O\u2019Reilly with a Bernie Sanders tattoo.\u201d That\u2019s one of the best quotes in \u201cBrotopia,\u201d and it\u2019s from Elisabeth Sheff, a polyamory expert.

{"Headline": "Is Loneliness a Health Epidemic?", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterPublic-health leaders immediately praised the idea \u2014 and for good reason. In recent decades, researchers have discovered that loneliness left untreated is not just psychically painful; it also can have serious medical consequences. Rigorous epidemiological studies have linked loneliness and social isolation to heart disease, cancer, depression, diabetes and suicide. Vivek Murthy, the former United States surgeon general, has written that loneliness and social isolation are \u201cassociated with a reduction in life span similar to that caused by smoking 15 cigarettes a day and even greater than that associated with obesity.\u201dBut is loneliness, as many political officials and pundits are warning, a growing \u201chealth epidemic\u201d?I don\u2019t believe so, nor do I believe it helps anyone to describe it that way. Social disconnection is a serious matter, yet if we whip up a panic over its prevalence and impact, we\u2019re less likely to deal with it properly.Anxiety about loneliness is a common feature of modern societies. Today, two major causes of loneliness seem possible. One is that societies throughout the world have embraced a culture of individualism. More people are living alone, and aging alone, than ever. Neoliberal social policies have turned workers into precarious free agents, and when jobs disappear, things fall apart fast. Labor unions, civic associations, neighborhood organizations, religious groups and other traditional sources of social solidarity are in steady decline. Increasingly, we all feel that we\u2019re on our own.The other possible cause is the rise of communications technology, including smartphones, social media and the internet. A decade ago, companies like Facebook, Apple and Google pledged that their products would help create meaningful relationships and communities. Instead, we\u2019ve used the media system to deepen existing divisions, at both the individual and group levels. We may have thousands of \u201cfriends\u201d and \u201cfollowers\u201d on Facebook and Instagram, but when it comes to human relationships, it turns out there\u2019s no substitute for building them the old-fashioned way, in person.In light of these two trends, it\u2019s easy to believe we\u2019re experiencing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of loneliness and isolation. Surprisingly, though, the best data do not actually show drastic spikes in either loneliness or social isolation.The other data on loneliness are complicated and often contradictory, in part because there are so many different ways of measuring the phenomenon. But it\u2019s clear that the loneliness statistics cited by those who say we have an epidemic are outliers. For example, one set of statistics comes from a study that counted as lonely people who said they felt \u201cleft out\u201d or \u201cisolated,\u201d or \u201clacked companionship\u201d \u2014 even just \u201csome of the time.\u201d That\u2019s an exceedingly low bar, and surely not one we\u2019d want doctors or policymakers to use in their work.One reason we need to be careful about how we measure and respond to loneliness is that, as the University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo argues, an occasional and transitory feeling of loneliness can be healthy and productive. It\u2019s a biological signal to ourselves that we need to build stronger social bonds.Professor Cacioppo has spent much of his career documenting the dangers of loneliness. But it\u2019s notable that he relies on more measured statistics in his own scientific papers than the statistics described above. One of his articles, from last year, reports that around 19 percent of older Americans said they had felt lonely for much of the week before they were surveyed, and that in Britain about 6 percent of adults said they felt lonely all or most of the time. Those are worrisome numbers, but they are quite similar to the numbers reported in Britain in 1948, when about 8 percent of older adults said they often or always felt lonely, and to those in previous American studies as well.In particular, overstating the problem can make it harder to make sure we are focusing on the people who need help the most. When Britain announced its new ministry, officials insisted that everyone, young or old, was at risk of loneliness. Yet the research tells us something more specific. In places like the United States and Britain, it\u2019s the poor, unemployed, displaced and migrant populations that stand to suffer most from loneliness and isolation. Their lives are unstable, and so are their relationships. When they get lonely, they are the least able to get adequate social or medical support.I don\u2019t believe we have a loneliness epidemic. But millions of people are suffering from social disconnection. Whether or not they have a minister for loneliness, they deserve more attention and help than we\u2019re offering today.Eric Klinenberg is a professor of sociology at New York University and the author of \u201cGoing Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why A.I. Researchers at Google Got Desks Next to the Boss", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 If you want to understand the priorities of a technology company, first look at the seating chart.At Google\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters, the chief executive, Sundar Pichai, now shares a floor with Google Brain, a research lab dedicated to artificial intelligence.When Facebook created its own artificial intelligence lab at its offices about seven miles away, it temporarily gave A.I. researchers desks next to the fish bowl of a conference room where its chief executive and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, holds his meetings.\u201cI can high-five Mark and Sheryl from my desk, and the A.I. team was right next to us,\u201d said Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, referring to Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer.A growing number of tech companies are pushing research labs and other far-reaching engineering efforts closer to the boss. The point is unmistakable: What they are doing matters to the chief executive. It may even be the future of the company.\u201cThe world is moving faster and faster. It is being driven by technology and innovation,\u201d said John Kotter, an emeritus professor at Harvard Business School who has written several books on business leadership. \u201cAnd a lot of these businesses are concluding that the speed of technological innovation should be the heart of everything.\u201dA year ago, the Google Brain team of mathematicians, coders and hardware engineers sat in a small office building on the other side of the company\u2019s campus. But over the past few months, it switched buildings and now works right beside the loungelike area where Mr. Pichai and other top executives work.\u201cAny C.E.O. thinks a lot about where people are sitting \u2014 who they can walk around and have casual conversations with,\u201d said Diane Greene, who oversees Google\u2019s cloud computing team and sits on the board of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. \u201cIt is a very significant statement that he has moved that group right next him.\u201dTo Mr. Byrne, shaking up the seating chart at Overstock was a bit like a common management tactic in the military, when an officer will work closely with a small \u201ccommand initiatives group\u201d that is considerably more nimble than the rest of the organization.\u201cWe were getting bureaucratic,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. \u201cAnd this was a way of creating added competition outside the bureaucracy.\u201dThese big companies are trying to duplicate the vibe of a Silicon Valley start-up, where the boss is next to everyone. As start-ups grow, they often put key technology teams next to the chief executive. Ms. Greene, who was the chief executive of the software company VMware, said she had always made a point of sitting beside the top engineers because they saw the company\u2019s future.There are limits to these arrangements. When Facebook built a team to explore the future of virtual reality on its vast social network, it made a similar desk move. The group is no longer seated next to Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook said this was because the group had grown too large. But across Silicon Valley, virtual reality is no longer the buzziest of topics. That honor belongs to artificial intelligence.At Overstock, Mr. Byrne walks past his small research team every time he leaves his office. Like Ms. Greene, he sees this as an opportunity for spontaneous interaction. The team members can discuss their work with him, and Mr. Byrne, a doctor of philosophy with a long history of unorthodox business choices, will share his far-reaching ideas with them. And he gets to hear, without the pressure of a formal presentation, what the engineers are excited about.\u201cIt was undeniable that proximity sparked conversation,\u201d said Judd Bagley, a kind of roving technologist and strategist who once worked in this group. \u201cPatrick prides himself on being able to walk up to anyone at the company, say \u2018hello,\u2019 and occasionally even eat french fries off the plate on their desk.\u201dIf a chief executive is close to these researchers, he or she is learning from them. But the boss is also showing them how important they are to the company. That is enormously valuable for engineers and mathematicians who are not necessarily generating immediate revenue, said Kevin Quennesson, a start-up executive who ran an A.I. team at Twitter.He also warned that companies risked putting too much pressure on researchers to produce results from work that was, by definition, a trip into the unknown. Amid so much spontaneous conversation with the chief executive, Mr. Bagley said, it is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between \u201cthe formal direction and informal brainstorming.\u201dStatus at Facebook was defined by how close your desk was to Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Mart\u00ednez said. And if you were close to the boss, other groups resented you.Priorities also tend to ebb and flow. At Overstock, a new Bitcoin project will squeeze in beside OLabs.

{"Headline": "The Tyranny of Convenience", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConvenience is the most underestimated and least understood force in the world today. As a driver of human decisions, it may not offer the illicit thrill of Freud\u2019s unconscious sexual desires or the mathematical elegance of the economist\u2019s incentives. Convenience is boring. But boring is not the same thing as trivial.In the developed nations of the 21st century, convenience \u2014 that is, more efficient and easier ways of doing personal tasks \u2014 has emerged as perhaps the most powerful force shaping our individual lives and our economies. This is particularly true in America, where, despite all the paeans to freedom and individuality, one sometimes wonders whether convenience is in fact the supreme value.As Evan Williams, a co-founder of Twitter, recently put it, \u201cConvenience decides everything.\u201d Convenience seems to make our decisions for us, trumping what we like to imagine are our true preferences. (I prefer to brew my coffee, but Starbucks instant is so convenient I hardly ever do what I \u201cprefer.\u201d) Easy is better, easiest is best.Convenience has the ability to make other options unthinkable. Once you have used a washing machine, laundering clothes by hand seems irrational, even if it might be cheaper. After you have experienced streaming television, waiting to see a show at a prescribed hour seems silly, even a little undignified. To resist convenience \u2014 not to own a cellphone, not to use Google \u2014 has come to require a special kind of dedication that is often taken for eccentricity, if not fanaticism.For all its influence as a shaper of individual decisions, the greater power of convenience may arise from decisions made in aggregate, where it is doing so much to structure the modern economy. Particularly in tech-related industries, the battle for convenience is the battle for industry dominance.Americans say they prize competition, a proliferation of choices, the little guy. Yet our taste for convenience begets more convenience, through a combination of the economics of scale and the power of habit. The easier it is to use Amazon, the more powerful Amazon becomes \u2014 and thus the easier it becomes to use Amazon. Convenience and monopoly seem to be natural bedfellows.Given the growth of convenience \u2014 as an ideal, as a value, as a way of life \u2014 it is worth asking what our fixation with it is doing to us and to our country. I don\u2019t want to suggest that convenience is a force for evil. Making things easier isn\u2019t wicked. On the contrary, it often opens up possibilities that once seemed too onerous to contemplate, and it typically makes life less arduous, especially for those most vulnerable to life\u2019s drudgeries.But we err in presuming convenience is always good, for it has a complex relationship with other ideals that we hold dear. Though understood and promoted as an instrument of liberation, convenience has a dark side. With its promise of smooth, effortless efficiency, it threatens to erase the sort of struggles and challenges that help give meaning to life. Created to free us, it can become a constraint on what we are willing to do, and thus in a subtle way it can enslave us.It would be perverse to embrace inconvenience as a general rule. But when we let convenience decide everything, we surrender too much.Convenience as we now know it is a product of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when labor-saving devices for the home were invented and marketed. Milestones include the invention of the first \u201cconvenience foods,\u201d such as canned pork and beans and Quaker Quick Oats; the first electric clothes-washing machines; cleaning products like Old Dutch scouring powder; and other marvels including the electric vacuum cleaner, instant cake mix and the microwave oven.Convenience was the household version of another late-19th-century idea, industrial efficiency, and its accompanying \u201cscientific management.\u201d It represented the adaptation of the ethos of the factory to domestic life.However mundane it seems now, convenience, the great liberator of humankind from labor, was a utopian ideal. By saving time and eliminating drudgery, it would create the possibility of leisure. And with leisure would come the possibility of devoting time to learning, hobbies or whatever else might really matter to us. Convenience would make available to the general population the kind of freedom for self-cultivation once available only to the aristocracy. In this way convenience would also be the great leveler.This idea \u2014 convenience as liberation \u2014 could be intoxicating. Its headiest depictions are in the science fiction and futurist imaginings of the mid-20th century. From serious magazines like Popular Mechanics and from goofy entertainments like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d we learned that life in the future would be perfectly convenient. Food would be prepared with the push of a button. Moving sidewalks would do away with the annoyance of walking. Clothes would clean themselves or perhaps self-destruct after a day\u2019s wearing. The end of the struggle for existence could at last be contemplated.The dream of convenience is premised on the nightmare of physical work. But is physical work always a nightmare? Do we really want to be emancipated from all of it? Perhaps our humanity is sometimes expressed in inconvenient actions and time-consuming pursuits. Perhaps this is why, with every advance of convenience, there have always been those who resist it. They resist out of stubbornness, yes (and because they have the luxury to do so), but also because they see a threat to their sense of who they are, to their feeling of control over things that matter to them.By the late 1960s, the first convenience revolution had begun to sputter. The prospect of total convenience no longer seemed like society\u2019s greatest aspiration. Convenience meant conformity. The counterculture was about people\u2019s need to express themselves, to fulfill their individual potential, to live in harmony with nature rather than constantly seeking to overcome its nuisances. Playing the guitar was not convenient. Neither was growing one\u2019s own vegetables or fixing one\u2019s own motorcycle. But such things were seen to have value nevertheless \u2014 or rather, as a result. People were looking for individuality again.Perhaps it was inevitable, then, that the second wave of convenience technologies \u2014 the period we are living in \u2014 would co-opt this ideal. It would conveniencize individuality.Consider the man of the early 1980s, strolling down the street with his Walkman and earphones. He is enclosed in an acoustic environment of his choosing. He is enjoying, out in public, the kind of self-expression he once could experience only in his private den. A new technology is making it easier for him to show who he is, if only to himself. He struts around the world, the star of his own movie.So alluring is this vision that it has come to dominate our existence. Most of the powerful and important technologies created over the past few decades deliver convenience in the service of personalization and individuality. Think of the VCR, the playlist, the Facebook page, the Instagram account. This kind of convenience is no longer about saving physical labor \u2014 many of us don\u2019t do much of that anyway. It is about minimizing the mental resources, the mental exertion, required to choose among the options that express ourselves. Convenience is one-click, one-stop shopping, the seamless experience of \u201cplug and play.\u201d The ideal is personal preference with no effort.We are willing to pay a premium for convenience, of course \u2014 more than we often realize we are willing to pay. During the late 1990s, for example, technologies of music distribution like Napster made it possible to get music online at no cost, and lots of people availed themselves of the option. But though it remains easy to get music free, no one really does it anymore. Why? Because the introduction of the iTunes store in 2003 made buying music even more convenient than illegally downloading it. Convenient beat out free.As task after task becomes easier, the growing expectation of convenience exerts a pressure on everything else to be easy or get left behind. We are spoiled by immediacy and become annoyed by tasks that remain at the old level of effort and time. When you can skip the line and buy concert tickets on your phone, waiting in line to vote in an election is irritating. This is especially true for those who have never had to wait in lines (which may help explain the low rate at which young people vote).The paradoxical truth I\u2019m driving at is that today\u2019s technologies of individualization are technologies of mass individualization. Customization can be surprisingly homogenizing. Everyone, or nearly everyone, is on Facebook: It is the most convenient way to keep track of your friends and family, who in theory should represent what is unique about you and your life. Yet Facebook seems to make us all the same. Its format and conventions strip us of all but the most superficial expressions of individuality, such as which particular photo of a beach or mountain range we select as our background image.I do not want to deny that making things easier can serve us in important ways, giving us many choices (of restaurants, taxi services, open-source encyclopedias) where we used to have only a few or none. But being a person is only partly about having and exercising choices. It is also about how we face up to situations that are thrust upon us, about overcoming worthy challenges and finishing difficult tasks \u2014 the struggles that help make us who we are. What happens to human experience when so many obstacles and impediments and requirements and preparations have been removed?Today\u2019s cult of convenience fails to acknowledge that difficulty is a constitutive feature of human experience. Convenience is all destination and no journey. But climbing a mountain is different from taking the tram to the top, even if you end up at the same place. We are becoming people who care mainly or only about outcomes. We are at risk of making most of our life experiences a series of trolley rides.An unwelcome consequence of living in a world where everything is \u201ceasy\u201d is that the only skill that matters is the ability to multitask. At the extreme, we don\u2019t actually do anything; we only arrange what will be done, which is a flimsy basis for a life.We need to consciously embrace the inconvenient \u2014 not always, but more of the time. Nowadays individuality has come to reside in making at least some inconvenient choices. You need not churn your own butter or hunt your own meat, but if you want to be someone, you cannot allow convenience to be the value that transcends all others. Struggle is not always a problem. Sometimes struggle is a solution. It can be the solution to the question of who you are.Embracing inconvenience may sound odd, but we already do it without thinking of it as such. As if to mask the issue, we give other names to our inconvenient choices: We call them hobbies, avocations, callings, passions. These are the noninstrumental activities that help to define us. They reward us with character because they involve an encounter with meaningful resistance \u2014 with nature\u2019s laws, with the limits of our own bodies \u2014 as in carving wood, melding raw ingredients, fixing a broken appliance, writing code, timing waves or facing the point when the runner\u2019s legs and lungs begin to rebel against him.Such activities take time, but they also give us time back. They expose us to the risk of frustration and failure, but they also can teach us something about the world and our place in it.So let\u2019s reflect on the tyranny of convenience, try more often to resist its stupefying power, and see what happens. We must never forget the joy of doing something slow and something difficult, the satisfaction of not doing what is easiest. The constellation of inconvenient choices may be all that stands between us and a life of total, efficient conformity.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

The device allows homeowners to monitor visitors at their front door through an app on their phone, even if they\u2019re not at home. Amazon has made home automation a major focus because of the success of its Echo family of products, which allow users to control thermostats, surveillance cameras and other connected devices using voice commands.Amazon\u2019s Echo Spot device already works with Ring doorbells, allowing people to look at footage from the cameras on the Echo Spot\u2019s screen. Amazon had invested an undisclosed amount in Ring through its Alexa Fund, which finances start-ups that integrate their products with Alexa, the Amazon intelligent assistant that powers Echoes and other devices.Buying Ring, though, suggests that Amazon has more ambitious plans for the product than it could achieve through a partnership.Luke Schoenfelder, chief executive of Latch, a start-up that makes a family of smart locks, said he believed that Amazon would make a more serious effort to enter the home security market and compete against companies like ADT, Comcast and Alarm.com. Mr. Schoenfelder speculated that Amazon could seek to make home security part of its Prime membership service, which today includes free and fast delivery of orders and video streaming.\u201cYou could imagine some kind of bundled offering with Ring\u2019s capabilities,\u201d he said.ADT\u2019s stock fell sharply after the deal became public on Tuesday afternoon. It ended the day down 4.6 percent.The companies declined to say much about their plans. \u201cRing\u2019s home security products and services have delighted customers since Day 1,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with this talented team and help them in their mission to keep homes safe and secure.\u201dRing\u2019s statement said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to achieve even more by partnering with an inventive, customer-centric company like Amazon. We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods.\u201dRing\u2019s internet doorbells start at $179. People who want to use them to record video must pay for that capability, with plans starting at $3 a month or $30 a year. The company also makes stand-alone security cameras.Amazon has taken some baby steps into home security. Last year it began selling an indoor security camera of its own design, Amazon Cloud Cam, and in December it acquired Blink, a maker of inexpensive internet security cameras and doorbells.Google, one of Amazon\u2019s biggest rivals, is also an increasingly important player in home automation and security, with its Nest thermostats and security cameras.James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said he believed that Amazon had bought Ring so it could add more intelligent capabilities to its doorbells and cameras, like the ability to use software to recognize faces at the front door.\u201cI think it\u2019s about going to the next level and having Alexa say, \u2018James, your fifth grader just walked in, and I locked the door behind them,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where these technologies have to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were lined up, wearing red-and-white track pants, powder blue and white T-shirts, sneakers, matching denim tops and bottoms, and pointed stiletto boots (though not all at the same time).The choreographer Benjamin Millepied stood several feet in front of them, while, o ff to the side, Ansel Elgort observed.\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing every time,\u201d Mr. Wainwright said of runway shows. \u201cThis is way more dangerous, way more inspiring, much more complicated. If I\u2019ve got to spend three months organizing something, I\u2019d rather it was this than a show.\u201d\u201cThis\u201d is a six-and-a-half-minute phantasmagoric vignette about shifting perspectives, set to an original track by Thom Yorke, best known as the lead singer of Radiohead. All the actors wear Rag & Bone\u2019s new collection, though it can be hard to see the clothes given how dizzying the visuals are, an effect achieved through the use of camera rigs that swing through the air, turn the landscape upside down and spin in circles. The rigs, some of which were flown in from England and some of which were built in New York, will be on view at an exhibition on Saturday, Feb. 10, at 107 Norfolk Street.\u201cThere was no sense of, \u2018We have to tell this narrative,\u2019\u201d Mr. Millepied said. \u201cWe were creating a mood that worked with that score, that space, that dark mystery, and doing something that had a good structure and showed everybody off.\u201dMr. Wainwright said, \u201cThe messaging here, seeing and not seeing things, is a reference to people living through their phones these days. This singular vision of seeing the world through a screen. Life\u2019s much more interesting than that. Life\u2019s much more than a two-dimensional screen.\u201dThis was not Rag & Bone\u2019s first foray into filmmaking. Along with more than two dozen other video projects, Rag & Bone Films has produced \u201cHair,\u201d a comedic improvised short starring John Turturro and Bobby Cannavale that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival last year, and a 2015 noir-style film about a driver in New York, featuring Michael Pitt and Astrid Berges Frisbey.But the scale of talent and effort involved with the Greenpoint production was unprecedented for the company. The film\u2019s three biggest stars \u2014 Mr. Elgort, Ms. Mara and the dancer Kandi Reign \u2014 are celebrities. Mr. Elgort recently shifted away from his \u201cFault in Our Stars\u201d teen fan base as the star of the film \u201cBabydriver,\u201d Ms. Mara is best known as the unrelenting journalist in \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and Ms. Reign has toured with Chance the Rapper and Young Thug, among others.Asked how Rag & Bone landed them, along with Mr. Millepied, Mr. Wainwright said: \u201cWe\u2019re just really nice.\u201d He added, \u201cYou can pay somebody through the nose to do something they don\u2019t want to do, or you can come up with something incredibly inspiring that they do want to do, and that was our approach.\u201dFor Mr. Wainwright, the effort and cost are worth it. \u201cThese things need to be able to stand alone,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not fashion films, they\u2019re not styled as fashion films, they\u2019re not planned as fashion films. They\u2019re films we provide the wardrobe for.\u201dThe clothes are there, they\u2019re colorful and stylish, and they appear functional (and several ballet dancers said they were more comfortable in the shoes and clothes than they would be in their usual costumes). But they are by no means the focus.Mr. Wainwright is fine with that. \u201cIt was never about the clothes,\u201d he said. \u201cVery few of the things we do are about the clothes. Rag & Bone is an apparel brand, but I think it\u2019s a brand that stands for a point of view rather than a specific look.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of Woke Capital", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are not two stories, though; they\u2019re different aspects of the same one. Corporate activism on social issues isn\u2019t in tension with corporate self-interest on tax policy and corporate stinginess in paychecks. Rather, the activism increasingly exists to protect the self-interest and the stinginess \u2014 to justify the ways of C.E.O.s to cultural power brokers, so that those same power brokers will leave them alone (and forgive their support for Trump\u2019s economic agenda) in realms that matter more to the corporate bottom line.Over time, though, free trade and globalization and deindustrialization made that postwar system less economically viable; the decline of labor and the collapse of the New Deal coalition made it less politically necessary; and the cultural revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s made its implicit moral values (heteronormativity for workers, a kind of penny-pinching puritanism for bosses) seem less congenial and more oppressive. And so we entered a period of corporate hegemony in both political parties, with fewer political compromises required for doing business.But there are other ways to compromise besides on wages, and at an accelerating pace our corporate class is trying to negotiate a different kind of peace, a different deal from the one they struck with New Deal liberalism and Big Labor. Instead of the Treaty of Detroit we have, if you will, the Peace of Palo Alto, in which a certain kind of virtue-signaling on progressive social causes, a certain degree of performative wokeness, is offered to liberalism and the activist left pre-emptively, in the hopes that having corporate America take their side in the culture wars will blunt efforts to tax or regulate our new monopolies too heavily.Much of this signaling is sincerely motivated. I\u2019m sure that lots of people in the corporate ranks at Delta or Alamo sincerely abhor the N.R.A., just as most of the people who demanded James Damore\u2019s firing from Google or Brendan Eich\u2019s ejection from Mozilla regarded both men as beyond-the-pale bigots.\u201cAs much as we fear corporations gone wild,\u201d Poulos concludes, \u201cwe love corporations that love us.\u201d And in a rich society people may prefer that their #brands prove this love by identifying with favored social causes rather than through the old-fashioned expedient of paying their workers a little bit more money.Or some people may prefer it, at least \u2014 the professional classes, blessed with material comfort, and those groups designated as being on the official winning side of history. For others, though, the Peace of Palo Alto has rather less to offer. It confirms the blue-collar suspicion that liberalism is no longer organized around working-class economic interests, and it encourages cultural conservatives in their feeling of general besiegement, their sense that all the major institutions of American life, corporate as well as intellectual and cultural, are arrayed against their mores and values and traditions.Between them these trends and sentiments will help sustain the Republican Party even as it lurches deeper into demagogy and paranoia \u2014 by making a vote for the G.O.P. the only way to protest a corporate-backed liberal politics that seems indifferent to the working man and an ascendant cultural liberalism that has boardrooms as well as Hollywood and academia in its corner.But of course so long as this same Republican Party remains itself pro-corporate in its economic ideology \u2014 as the Trumpified G.O.P., despite his populist forays, has determinedly remained \u2014 the corporate interests themselves stand to lose little from these polarizing trends. Their wokeness buys them cover when liberalism is in power, and any backlash only helps prop up a G.O.P. that has their back when it comes time to write our tax laws.The win-win scenario for woke capitalism can\u2019t last forever.

{"Headline": "As China Marches Forward on A.I., the White House Is Silent", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "Last summer, China unveiled a plan to become the world\u2019s leader in artificial intelligence, challenging the longtime role of the United States.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In July, China unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence and create an industry worth $150 billion to its economy by 2030.To technologists working on A.I. in the United States, the statement, which was 28 pages long in its English translation, was a direct challenge to America\u2019s lead in arguably the most important tech research to come along in decades. It outlined the Chinese government\u2019s aggressive plan to treat A.I. like the country\u2019s own version of the Apollo 11 lunar mission \u2014 an all-in effort that could stoke national pride and spark agenda-setting technology breakthroughs.\u201cIt is remarkable to see how A.I. has emerged as a top priority for the Chinese leadership and how quickly things have been set into motion,\u201d said Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security who helped translate the manifesto and follows China\u2019s work on artificial intelligence. \u201cThe U.S. plans and policies released in 2016 were seemingly the impetus for the formulation of China\u2019s national A.I. strategy.\u201d\u201cWe are still waiting on the White House to provide some direction\u201d on how to respond to the competition, said Tim Hwang, who worked on A.I. policy at Google and is now the director of the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative, a new organization created by the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and others to fund ethical research in artificial intelligence.American companies like Amazon and Google have done more than anyone to turn A.I. concepts into real products. But for a number of reasons, including concerns that the Trump administration will limit the number of immigrant engineers allowed into the United States, much of the critical research being done on artificial intelligence is already migrating to other countries, including tech hot spots like Toronto, London and Beijing.To China\u2019s growing tech community, driving the industry\u2019s next big thing \u2014 a mantra of Silicon Valley \u2014 is becoming a tantalizing possibility.\u201cThanks to the size of the market and the rapid experimentation, China is going to become one of the most powerful \u2014 if not the most powerful \u2014 A.I. countries in the world,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft and Google executive who now runs a prominent Chinese venture capital firm dedicated to artificial intelligence.The 2016 A.I. reports were shepherded by President Barack Obama\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy.The O.S.T.P., which has overseen science and technology activities across the federal government for more than four decades, is now run by the deputy chief technology officer Michael Kratsios. He had worked as a Wall Street analyst before serving as chief of staff for an investment fund run by Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist who supported Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential run. The administration has yet to name an office director or fill four other assistant posts.In a recent interview, Mr. Kratsios was adamant that any concerns over the administration\u2019s approach to A.I. were unfounded.\u201cArtificial intelligence has been a priority for the Trump administration since Day 1,\u201d he said. Mr. Kratsios added that the administration was particularly concerned with the development of A.I. in national security and as a way of encouraging economic prosperity.Many staff members in Mr. Kratsios\u2019s office are exploring issues related to artificial intelligence, he said. Mr. Kratsios also meets with a committee, set up by the Obama administration, that coordinates A.I. policy across the government.\u201cThe key thing to remember is that the front line of A.I. policy is at the agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House is a convener and a coordinator.\u201dIn an echo of plans laid out by the Obama administration, China\u2019s government said it intended to significantly increase long-term funding for A.I. research and develop a much larger community of A.I. researchers.There are several ways to do that, according to the Obama administration and China. First, educate more students in these technologies. Second, recruit experts from other countries.At the same time, both policy statements urged companies to share more technology and data. Huge pools of data are need to \u201ctrain\u201d A.I. systems, and in the United States much of this is locked up inside companies like Facebook and Google. Mr. Lee said China already has an enormous advantage here because its large population will generate more data and its companies are more willing to share.Artificial intelligence has been a focus of Chinese technologists for some time. By 2013, China was already producing more research papers than the United States in the area of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the main technology driving the rise of A.I., according to the Obama reports. Deep learning, which allows machines to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, is one of the main technologies driving the rise of artificial intelligence.It is unclear how much China as a whole is spending. But one Chinese state has promised to invest $5 billion in A.I., and the government of Beijing has committed $2 billion to an A.I. development park in the city. South Korea has set aside close to $1 billion of its own. Canada, already home to many of the top researchers in the field, has also committed $125 million to, in part, attract new talent from other countries.It is also difficult to say just how much the government of the United States is spending. Government organizations like the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation continue to fund new research in universities and the private sector. According to an O.S.T.P report, the federal government spent about $1 billion a year in 2015. The Trump administration says that spending jumped to $3 billion in 2017. But the current administration said that was not an apples-to-apples comparison to the 2015 tally, because it was not certain how the Obama administration made it calculations.\u201cWe may have a bunch of small initiatives inside the government that are doing good, but we don\u2019t have a central national strategy,\u201d said Jack Clark, a former journalist who now oversees policy efforts at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab co-founded by Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is confusing that we have this technology of such obvious power and merit and we are not hearing full-throated support, including financial support.\u201d\u201cThey are headed in precisely the wrong direction,\u201d said Thomas Kalil, who led O.S.T.P\u2019s Technology and Innovation Division under President Obama. \u201cThat is particularly concerning given that China has identified this as a strategic priority.\u201dGoogle operates another important lab in Montreal. Its London lab, DeepMind, may be home to more top-notch A.I. researchers than any other lab on earth. And Google recently unveiled new labs in both Paris and Beijing. Facebook, after creating its own lab in Canada, recently pumped 10 million euros, or more than $12 million, into its existing operation in Paris.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Britain wants its cake in Brexit talks.\u2022 One reason the Treasury balked on Dodd-Frank\u2019s bank resolution regime.\u2022 What happens now that China controls Anbang Insurance?\u2022 General Mills has bought the pet-food maker Blue Buffalo.The cloud storage company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering.DropBox is the latest so-called unicorn, Silicon Valley startups with a private valuation of more than $1 billion, to test the public markets.Here are the details:But revenue growth is slowing. Dropbox took in $1.1 billion of revenue in 2017, a 31 percent increase from $845 million in 2016. The company\u2019s revenue surged by 40 percent in 2016.Dropbox will have to convince investors that it can add new paying users at a fast clip. It had 11 million paying users in 2017, up 25 percent from 2016. But that was a significantly slower pace than the 35 percent increase in 2016.In theory, Dropbox could squeeze more revenue out of each user, but it has not managed to do that in recent years. Revenue-per-user was $111.91 last year, not that different from $110.54 in 2016 and $113.54 in 2015.Shira Ovide at Bloomberg\u2019s Gadfly uses a valuation for Box, a public company that stores and manages content in the cloud, as a guide for how much Dropbox might be worth on the stock market. Ms. Ovide\u2019s conclusion is not encouraging.\u2014 Peter Eavis and Stephen GrocerAndrew notes:It took real leadership for Clark Lauritzen, First National Bank\u2019s president, to make this decision. Will other C.E.O.\u2019s who talk about social responsibility follow suit? Mr. Lauritzen\u2019s bank is privately held by his family, so it may have been easier for him to take such a stand.Visa tried to distance itself from all of this by saying, \u201cVisa co-branded cards do not represent an endorsement by Visa of that cause or organization.\u201d But it also appears unwilling to sign on to the idea I proposed that it prevent customers from using its network to buy assault weapons, high-caliber magazines and bump stocks when it said in its statement about First National Bank ending its deal with the N.R.A., \u201cWe strive to make our payment services available to all people in all places, for uses consistent with local, national, and international laws.\u201dThe contextMore on gun controlsThe menu is a reminder of how often food is used to help understand Brexit.Why?The cake and cherries rhetoric thrown around in the Brexit debate suggest there is little middle ground between the European Union and Britain. But an alternative way to view the tensions is that so much trade goes on between Britain and the bloc, and others ties are so deep, that both sides will ultimately strike a new relationship that retains much of the existing one. As analysts at Nomura wrote earlier this week:In terms of the bespoke deal issue, we think it is not credible to say the U.K. can only take an off-the-shelf Norway / Switzerland / Turkey / Ukraine / Canada / Mexico deal. They were all bespoke deals when they were made. The idea that the world\u2019s seventh largest economy, an ex-member and a country that will still have strong institutional, economic and geographic ties to the E.U. should not get a bespoke deal is not reasonable, in our view.The paper, produced by the Belgian government for a meeting of diplomats last week, will prove a huge boost to British negotiators and gives new insight into E.U. thinking.\u2014 Peter EavisPresident Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda seems to have met its match in the obscure world of international financial regulation.A big reason the Treasury held back: The concerns of foreign regulators.Further, these judges, once designated, could engage in planning and coordination exercises, including cross-border efforts (e.g., the crisis management groups discussed above).Instead, fearing higher costs for United States banks, the Treasury apparently gave the concerns of foreign regulators considerable weight and took an internationalist approach.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Chinese manufacturer has built up a $9 billion stake, or just under 10 percent, in the German automaker and parent of Mercedes-Benz.From Bloomberg:The investment in the parent of Mercedes-Benz furthers Hangzhou-based Geely\u2019s foray into the European premium automotive market and ends months of speculation. The Chinese company, controlled by billionaire Li Shufu, already owns Volvo Cars AB, whose refreshed line-up of vehicles have made it a popular alternative to the German luxury stalwarts.Geely also gained control of British sports-car maker Louts Cars last year.The details\u2022 The Chinese insurance regulator said Anbang had violated regulations, putting into question its ability to pay claims.\u2022 A group that includes China\u2019s central bank, its securities and banking regulators, the country\u2019s foreign exchange regulator and other government agencies will oversee Anbang for a year.\u2022 The takeover could be extended if Anbang fails to complete an equity restructuring and resume operations.The contextFrom Keith Bradsher and Alexandra Stevenson of the NYT:Critics\u2019 cornerThe deals flyaroundThe tweet comes as Snap faces growing criticism from users about the redesign of its app.Critics\u2019 cornerRelatedThe tech flyaroundHere\u2019s The Information\u2019s Alfred Lee:Concerned about potential threats to share value and regulatory risks, venture capitalists are asking for rights to receive or buy cryptocurrency in the event of an offering.In some cases, several prominent investors and attorneys told The Information, venture capital firms are seeking to veto cryptocurrency offerings altogether.RelatedWith their average returns dragged down by the weak performance of hedge funds, venture capital and private equity, you would think endowments would be fleeing these so-called alternative investments, which are costly and mostly illiquid, as some large pension funds have done.The tweak would still keep the emergency structures introduced as part of Dodd-Frank as an option.From the NYT\u2019s Peter Eavis:Crucially, the Treasury also wants to keep the emergency government loan. But the Treasury\u2019s proposal does introduce an important and innovative change. It calls for a special type of bankruptcy regime for large financial firms, called Chapter 14. This new regime envisions having a set of specialist judges, working with regulators in the United States and around the world, who could plan for and oversee the bankruptcies of large banks.The banking flyaroundAdvertisement"}

But the steady move of technology companies into downtown San Francisco is shifting the center of gravity of what is arguably America\u2019s most innovative industry from the rambling, suburban streets of the Valley to the tightly concentrated and increasingly vertical neighborhood behind San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero.Facebook\u2019s decision last year to lease more than 400,000 square feet in a skyscraper across from the newly opened Salesforce Tower will put offices of the biggest names in tech \u2014 Google and LinkedIn among them \u2014 within walking distance of each other.In the middle of all this is the Transbay Transit Center, which opens in June and is advertised as the Grand Central of the West.\u201cThe building is starting to come to life,\u201d said Dennis Turchon, senior construction manager for the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, the public organization charged with building the structure.To critics it is a glorified bus terminal, and an expensive one at that \u2014 the cost hovers around $6 billion, according to the authority.Yet the transit center has ambitions to be much more. A 5.4-acre park on the roof has a half-mile walking loop, an outdoor theater and gardens populated by dozens of mature trees. It\u2019s an elevated park that has been compared to the High Line in New York. The tech offices that surround the center connect directly with the park, as does a gondola that will whisk visitors to the park for the sidewalk below.During a week in which the Trump administration has sought to put infrastructure on the agenda, the transit center, which was built with close to $600 million in federal money from the stimulus package during the Great Recession, is a rubber-meets-the-road test for America\u2019s infrastructure plans. The center was built on top of a giant underground concrete box designed to be the San Francisco terminus for both CalTrain, the railway that runs through Silicon Valley to San Jose, and high-speed rail, which is meant to connect San Francisco with Los Angeles.Building the 1.3-mile tunnel that will bring the tracks into the station will take years and hundreds of millions of dollars.

No one stops in Belleville. It\u2019s a place people drive through, heading somewhere else: the coast, the city. And yet here they are, two strangers who find themselves on neighboring stools at the local bar slash restaurant, the High-Ho. Both are nursing secrets. Polly Costello is on the run, not from one past but several, and Adam Bosk is hunting for something, though perhaps not the thing he thinks.Straightaway he notices Polly\u2019s sunburn. \u201cWhy would a redhead well into her 30s make such a rookie mistake?\u201d It\u2019s the first of many unspoken questions. \u201cSunburn\u201d is full of characters who at critical moments fail to ask the obvious: people who hold back because they\u2019re reluctant to betray their position; or because showing interest might encourage someone to fall in love with them; or because they aren\u2019t smart enough to be curious; or because they dread having their fears confirmed.But this is all in the future. For now, Adam and Polly sit on their stools with their secrets and their drinks (he orders red wine, and regrets this when it comes refrigerated; she has whiskey \u2014 on the rocks, of course), sizing each other up. Adam \u201cdoesn\u2019t go in hard. He\u2019s not that way. Doesn\u2019t have to be, if that doesn\u2019t sound too vain. It\u2019s just a fact: He\u2019s a Ken doll kind of guy, if Ken had a great year-round tan.\u201d (I\u2019ll admit I faltered here. Would any man claim comparison to a Ken doll?) Soon the pair are exchanging wisecracks and put-downs familiar from those black-and-white afternoon movies where characters speak more to conceal than to reveal, even as they fall for each other.So \u201cSunburn,\u201d though cool and twisty, has more heart than expected. It\u2019s generous in other ways, too. The particular atmosphere of unlovely Belleville is deftly conveyed: its motel and trailer park, its emptied-out Main Street and, of course, the High-Ho, where regulars gather to watch \u201cthe inevitable Orioles game on the inevitable TV with the inevitable shimmy in its reception.\u201d Yet there is beauty here too. You see the huge red sun sinking into the cornfields; you feel the dew underfoot.Now and then a tangential character who in another novel might only merit a line or two is given a vivid chapter of his or her own. Here\u2019s a recently dumped gay P.I. who\u2019s fussy about chef\u2019s salads; a video-store clerk who prides himself on his staff picks; a housewife who has a marble-topped kitchen island and white roses in a milk-bottle vase; and her sister, who has none of those things.Harriet Lane is the author of \u201cHer\u201d and \u201cAlys, Always.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uncovering the Secrets of the \u2018Girl With a Pearl Earring\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE HAGUE \u2014 \u201cHow did the \u2018Girl With a Pearl Earring\u2019 come to life? What steps did Vermeer take to make this painting?\u201dUsing a panoply of new exploratory technologies, some borrowed from medicine, with complicated names such as fiber optic reflectance spectroscopy, macro X-ray powder diffraction and optical coherence tomography, the museum hopes to harvest all kinds of data about the \u201cGirl,\u201d as everyone at the museum simply calls her, to explore her inner life.It is an exceedingly rare occasion that the Mauritshuis takes \u201cGirl\u201d off the wall, but it seemed justified for this enormous team effort, which takes place under the umbrella of the Netherlands Institute for Conservation, Art and Science and includes participants from the National Gallery of Art in Washington; the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam; Delft University of Technology; and the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands.\u201cThe expertise and the scientific equipment are coming from the whole world, converging on this one painting, this one masterpiece,\u201d Ms. Vandivere said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how much information we can gain with the technology at our disposal in a very short period of time \u2014 two weeks, working 24 hours a day, day and night.\u201dThe \u201cGirl\u201d is the star attraction of the Mauritshuis, a collection of Dutch 17th-century paintings that draws about 400,000 visitors each year. Removing her from public view for any length of time potentially affects attendance, so museum officials tried to keep the examination period as short as possible, and to keep her in the public eye as much as possible.Instead of taking her up to the restoration studio, Emilie Gordenker, the Mauritshuis\u2019s director, decided to put the whole research project on display in the museum\u2019s Golden Room, a regal chamber with 18th century d\u00e9cor, where the \u201cGirl\u201d and the research team will be enclosed in glass partitions while video monitors allow visitors to observe what\u2019s happening inside. A high-resolution, three-dimensional reproduction of the \u201cGirl\u201d created by Oc\u00e9, a Netherlands-based Canon company, will sit on an easel outside the glass chamber.\u201cGetting the \u2018Girl\u2019 out of her frame means that she\u2019s not visible in the way that she normally is for visitors, and that was a big concern for us because people come from far and wide to see this picture,\u201d Ms. Gordenker said. \u201cOccasionally she\u2019ll be lying on a bed with all kinds of cameras hanging around her, so you might not be able to see her as usual, or she might be half covered by a scanner. We wanted to make sure that for people who will come, they get taken along in the process.\u201dIt has been more than two decades since Vermeer\u2019s so-called \u201cMona Lisa of the North\u201d has been the subject of an examination, and since that time, there has been a great deal of advancement in the tools used to examine artworks. In 1994, researchers employed tools such as X-radiography, UV photography and infrared reflectography, and took tiny paint samples out of the painting.Today\u2019s imaging tools are noninvasive, which means there\u2019s nary a brush or Q-tip in sight, and there will be no removal of particles. The technologies that have been brought together for this examination will \u201ccull a few terabytes of data,\u201d said Joris Dik, one of the lead researchers, from Delft University of Technology. These can later be used to create high-resolution computer visualizations of the painting that were never possible before.\u201cI can imagine at the end we\u2019ll have something like Google Earth where you can click on all different layers and zoom in and out of the painting to see different elements within the layers of paint,\u201d he said.The \u201cGirl\u201d has been on display in the Mauritshuis since 1881. The work wasn\u2019t considered to be a particular highlight of the collection \u2014 which also includes Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cThe Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp\u201d and \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d by Carel Fabritius \u2014 until a major exhibition in collaboration with the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1995, followed by the publication of Tracy Chevalier\u2019s best-selling novel of the same name four years later and the subsequent 2003 film, starring Scarlett Johansson.Ms. Chevalier imagined the fictional subject for Vermeer\u2019s painting as a housemaid who is invited into the inner sanctum of the master\u2019s studio, and allowed to wear his wife\u2019s pearl earring for the portrait, creating a certain frisson between the artist and his model.Ms. Gordenker said that in reality, the picture probably wasn\u2019t painted as a portrait of any particular person. Trying to figure out the identity of the real-life \u201cGirl\u201d \u2014 if there even was one \u2014 isn\u2019t a question for research.\u201cOne of the things that makes this painting so spectacularly appealing is that we don\u2019t know,\u201d Ms. Gordenker said. That\u2019s one mystery that this year\u2019s inquiry will not attempt to solve.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the company that created a high-resolution, three-dimensional reproduction of \u201cGirl With the Pearl Earring.\u201d It is Oc\u00e9, not OC.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Do When Laptops and Silence Take Over Your Cafe?", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe was not. \u201cEverybody was at a laptop wearing headphones,\u201d Mr. Glanville said. He strode inside, unplugged the device that provided free Wi-Fi and tossed it into a bin in his office.He wanted a courtyard where people talked to one another, not a silent office for remote workers. And while anyone with a cellphone hot spot could connect without his help, he had made himself clear. On a recent weekday morning, almost a year and a half later, the courtyard was still full of people, but this time they were talking to one another. Only one was at his laptop.Starbucks may not feel the pinch, with its multibillion-dollar revenues and legions of grab-and-go customers, but for owners of smaller businesses, the math is grim.Owners face a choice: Get tough and encourage workers to relocate, or embrace them and hope that a combination of guilt and loyalty will inspire them to spend more or leave sooner.It\u2019s hard to know which is the right answer. \u201cThere\u2019s no social order here to tell us how to behave,\u201d said Mr. Glanville, as though he were contemplating a newly formed nation, which in a way he is. He took a no-tolerance stance on Wi-Fi because a single ground rule seemed more hospitable than a litany of restrictions.\u201cYou can\u2019t win that battle,\u201d said Mr. Nieto, who had already learned his lesson the hard way. \u201cThe first time I saw someone with a laptop I said, \u2018Sorry, no laptops,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cRight after that, I got a one-star review on Yelp.\u201dWhen she and Ms. Sodi open Pisellino, a new cafe, in April, the no-work attitude will be embedded in the design: a standing bar only 12 inches deep, no Wi-Fi, no outlets, five small cafe tables inside and 20 outside when the weather allows. Little opportunity to set up shop.Even companies committed to accommodating remote workers look for ways to improve the relationship. At Triniti, Mr. Wynn offers free Wi-Fi, but after two hours a customer must have \u201ca face-to-face interaction\u201d with an employee, he says, to get a new password. He relies on that interaction and the aromas from the kitchen to transform coffee drinkers into lunch customers, and has been gratified as the first wave of workers have started to order midday meals.If someone stakes out too much turf \u2014 if their belongings sprawl into nearby seating \u2014 it\u2019s time for a polite intervention. \u201cWe won\u2019t move anybody\u2019s stuff,\u201d Ms. Arnold said, \u201cbut an employee might start to clean the adjacent table and hope they get the hint.\u201dAnd if that doesn\u2019t work, eventually the furniture will send a message. \u201cThe seating isn\u2019t all that comfortable\u201d for long sessions, she said.He sees them as the nascent regulars of tomorrow \u2014 and with 300 seats, he can afford to invest 85 to 90 cafe and patio seats in the future, and still maintain a no-laptop policy in the main dining room.He employs subtle means to influence the behavior of working customers. Logging in for two hours of free Wi-Fi requires the user\u2019s email address, which goes onto the Rose\u2019s mailing list \u2014 and while people can log right back in, the expiration reminds them that it might be time to order another round. Servers circulate to ask if they can get something else for a customer tied to his electronic devices. And Wi-Fi service ends at 5:30 p.m., to signal that the workday has ended and dinner service is about to begin.Mr. Neroni tried extending the Wi-Fi until 7 one night, \u201cas an experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople looked up and figured we forgot to turn it off. And it was \u2018Oh, boy,\u2019 and a line of people carrying their open laptops into the dining room so they could keep working.\u201d He reminded the disappointed throng of the dining-room no-laptop policy and resumed the 5:30 cutoff.Like most cafes, the Rose doesn\u2019t provide electrical outlets; a dwindling battery should be a sign that it\u2019s time to go.Her self-imposed rules include working in one cafe or restaurant no more than three mornings a week, for no more than three hours at a stretch. She always orders a coffee and pastry, and frequently a lunch to go. Then she packs up and heads to another spot on her preferred list.The only casualty of the plan is her social life, which she had hoped might include the Rose as well: She tried a weekend brunch there, only to realize that it felt too much like the office.\u201cI couldn\u2019t enjoy myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept feeling that I ought to be working.\u201dHe budgets $350 a month to cover coffee, frequent breakfasts and lunch to go if he\u2019s headed straight to a meeting.

Daphne, the novel\u2019s heroine, also experiences these spells when she\u2019s startled. In fact, Daphne has troubles when she feels any emotion, be it love, ecstasy, horror, gaiety or anger. Her head lolls and her knees buckle. She goes bum over teacup. The condition is debilitating, and thus Daphne has had to arrange her life incorporating many fail-safes. First off, she dulls her emotions by drinking \u2014 a lot. She hardly ever drives. She belongs to a support group for similarly afflicted people, and she\u2019s adopted a \u201cgrinding, deadening\u201d routine \u2014 work, home and Pit Stop, her neighborhood bar \u2014 that keeps her \u201csurviving.\u201d At home, Daphne\u2019s an expert cook, spends lots of time perusing an interior design publication and leaves NPR on low volume. \u201cPattern, repetition, small, comforting tasks \u2014 with the constant low buzz of stimuli, there just isn\u2019t time or space enough to really feel.\u201d Just like that, Boast seems to have captured today\u2019s cultural zeitgeist.Daphne\u2019s profession is also chosen to temper emotional responses. She works at the pharmaceutical laboratory MedEval, where she tests heart devices on, wait for it, dogs \u2014 adorable, lonely dogs with names like Biscuit. Where you or I might train our bodies at a gym, Daphne instead toughens up by watching a loop of heart-wrenching videos of global disasters and starving children on the internet. It\u2019s difficult to feel compassion for Daphne\u2019s condition given her brutal coping strategies.However, even the best-laid plans are no match for the heart. Daphne meets and falls in love with Ollie, a sensitive construction worker who pushes her outside her comfort zone. He takes Daphne for long walks in Golden Gate Park, to concerts inside enormous cement drainage pipes where, \u201cin the close, echoing confines, the notes seemed to sound directly in my ears,\u201d and on a particularly dangerous outing to a protest march. Watching Ollie and Daphne fall in love is both sweet and fraught. Their romance provides the novel\u2019s first opportunity for the reader to empathize with Daphne \u2014 love and sex are tricky for all of us. Her humanizing is not without its costs: She finds it harder to shut out a co-worker\u2019s worries over his ailing daughter, or the suffering of the dogs. A friend at her support group keeps arriving with bruises from his recent collapses. Daphne\u2019s concern about all of it begins to trigger her own episodes. Her plight is universal; risk losing control over one\u2019s own life by embracing human intimacy, or remain in the safe isolation of a hermetically sealed existence.The novel is a loose retelling of Ovid\u2019s myth of Daphne and Apollo, in which the forest nymph prefers her freedom over the greedy love of the sun god. In the myth, as she flees Apollo, Daphne cries out to her father, the river god, to save her. Suddenly her legs stiffen, bark encircles her body and she turns into a laurel tree. Boast\u2019s own Daphne experiences a reverse evolution: As she comes to know Ollie, and to make timid forays into the politics and pain and tenderness of the world, she sheds her bark, her roots loosen. In the throes of new love, she thinks: \u201cSometimes I pray I could just stop dead in the middle of the street, in the middle of the day, and root myself fast in place. Then, almost immediately, I want him again.\u201dNatalie Serber\u2019s most recent book is the memoir \u201cCommunity Chest.\u201d Her story collection, \u201cShout Her Lovely Name,\u201d was a New York Times Notable Book.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Asked for Patience. Remarkably, Wall Street Complied.", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAllen Gillespie is one lonely stock analyst.Of the dozens of Wall Street analysts covering Amazon, he is the only one tracked by Bloomberg who recommends that investors sell the company\u2019s shares.Mr. Gillespie, a partner at FinTrust Investment Advisors, a wealth management firm in Greenville, S.C., questions whether Amazon deserves such a stratospheric share price.\u201cEverybody thinks I am crazy,\u201d said Mr. Gillespie, who also serves on the board overseeing South Carolina\u2019s pension fund. \u201cI have had people I\u2019ve never met email me to ask if I was serious.\u201dIt is a bold call indeed. Since Mr. Gillespie put a sell rating on the company last July, Amazon\u2019s shares have increased 37 percent, to $1,429. On Friday, one day after Amazon reported the biggest quarterly profit in its history, Amazon\u2019s market value briefly crossed the $700 billion mark, and its share price increased 3 percent even as the Dow fell 2.5 percent.For most analysts, the end is not yet in sight. When the investment firm D.A. Davidson & Company predicted last month that Amazon\u2019s shares could rise to $1,800, Morgan Stanley upped the ante the next day, forecasting a possible $2,100 share price.\u201cIt\u2019s an infatuation,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern business school, who recently published a book about Amazon, Google and other tech giants.How that infatuation developed is the story of a company that figured out how to tame Wall Street. In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along.Over its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway.\u201cI think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn\u2019t deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,\u201d said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon.In part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn\u2019t appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years.In a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company\u2019s ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them.\u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Long Term.\u2019\u2019Mr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.And its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year \u2014 hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see.Yet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.It may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true.\u201cIf Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,\u201d said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.)The reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street\u2019s old rules, which demand consistent profit growth.It wasn\u2019t always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys.But like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon\u2019s shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival.Mr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days. But it took many years for investors who had been burned by the dot-com crash to give Amazon a second chance.For long stretches from 2002 to 2006, Amazon\u2019s stock price languished, while it invested in researching and developing new technologies and businesses.Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets, looked at the company\u2019s slipping profit margins during that period and warned investors to stay away.Mr. Mahaney said he failed to realize \u201cthat all that spending on R.&D. was a bullish sign for the future.\u201d He has had a buy rating on the company for more than a decade.Those long-term investments, which Amazon didn\u2019t detail at the time, eventually gave rise to some of the company\u2019s most profitable businesses, like its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services.The success of the cloud computing business proved a tipping point. If investors allowed Amazon to spend time and money investing, patience would pay off.By now, Wall Street has been well trained to believe that Amazon has a strategy for Whole Foods and it will take time to carry it out.\u201cWhat the market finally figured out is Amazon is extremely good at investing those dollars,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the investment officer at Miller Value Partners.Ultimately, much of the investor confidence in Amazon reflects a belief in its future opportunity \u2014 what investors frequently call a company\u2019s \u201caddressable market.\u201dFor Amazon, the addressable market in retail is roughly $5 trillion in the United States and many times that globally, Mr. Miller said. And that\u2019s not even including the traditional information technology market that Amazon Web Services is attacking. \u201cI asked Jeff what the addressable market is for A.W.S.,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018Trillions and trillions.\u2019\u201dEven Mr. Gillespie, the skeptic, acknowledges that Amazon is \u201coperating extremely well.\u201d But he questions whether years of low interest rates have helped inflate Amazon\u2019s value because investors are so starved for return, they are willing to overlook some of the risks.Those risks, he said, include regulators deciding the company is growing too large or not paying its fair share in taxes.\u201cPeople tend to assume away these things,\u201d he said.Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Revamped Its Ad System. AT&T Still Hasn\u2019t Returned.", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAT&T, one of the nation\u2019s biggest marketers, has yet to return to YouTube nearly a year after pulling its advertising from the platform because of concerns that it could appear alongside offensive material.But that has not been enough for AT&T, which wants YouTube to get \u201cas close to zero tolerance for this issue as possible,\u201d Fiona Carter, the company\u2019s chief brand officer, said in a recent interview.\u201cIt became apparent to us as we worked through this that too much of the content our advertising could appear against was not brand safe \u2014 it was objectionable by any measure,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cYou really have an epiphany when you see some of that content.\u201dShe added, \u201cOur findings are that no matter the algorithm or the filters or the formula that you currently apply, nothing beats human review.\u201dOver the past year, major marketers have been demanding more accountability from Google, Facebook and the rest of the digital advertising ecosystem, as they have come to the conclusion that the same algorithmic tools that allow unprecedented access to consumers can be used to spread misinformation, hate speech and harmful videos that target children. On Monday, Keith Weed, the chief marketing officer of Unilever, called on tech companies to take greater responsibility for what appears on their sites and said that his company would not invest in platforms \u201cthat do not protect our children or which create division in society and promote anger or hate.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about the digital supply chain for several years but what happened last year is it became a societal issue, a people issue,\u201d Mr. Weed said in an interview after delivering remarks on eroding trust in tech companies at an industry conference in Palm Desert, Calif.Mr. Weed said that while he would pull dollars from the platforms \u201cif something happened which was completely inappropriate for our brands or our business,\u201d he wanted to work with the companies to improve their sites.\u201cWhat I\u2019m not doing is giving some sort of public ultimatum,\u201d he said.Brian Wieser, a media analyst at Pivotal Research, said that marketers were clearly having an influence.\u201cIf they said nothing then the only thing that would cause the platforms to act is the risk of government regulation,\u201d he said.But Unilever, he said, was not taking an especially hard line with the tech companies as far as its advertising budget. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they set a threshold and said companies who don\u2019t do this lose their money specifically,\u201d he said.Mr. Weed reiterated that position on Monday.\u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about here is moving the conversation along,\u201d he said.Unilever, for example, has been talking with YouTube about implementing more human screening of videos that include children to make sure that they are not being exploited.\u201cThere is nothing we take more seriously than the trust and safety of our users, customers and partners, and we will continue to work to earn that trust every day,\u201d a Google spokesperson said of Mr. Weed\u2019s remarks.Even though AT&T hasn\u2019t been spending money on YouTube ads in the past year, it has worked closely with the platform to improve its systems and is eager to have its ads again seen by YouTube\u2019s huge audience of teen and twentysomething viewers. YouTube has said that its manual reviews of Google Preferred channels would be complete by the end of March.\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful we can get back onto YouTube,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cIt delivers the scale we want but we had to roll up our sleeves and find that performance elsewhere.\u201dAT&T spent more than $1 billion on advertising in the United States last year through September, while Unilever spent $644 million, according to data from Kantar Media. AT&T was the sixth-biggest advertiser in the country during that period, Unilever was No. 16.AT&T also said that it would audit its programmatic ad spending in coming months, as it tries to better understand the process through which technology and automation place its online ads in front of consumers. That realm of advertising has drawn scrutiny from marketers in recent years amid reports that much of their spending, which is difficult to trace, is going to tech companies and agency fees rather than publishers.Ms. Carter said that it would be working with its agency, Omnicom\u2019s Hearts & Science, and the firms AdFin and Amino Payments to figure out how its money moves through those systems.\u201cI believe that marketers, and to a certain extent agency partners, have not been in control of the way the advertising process is moving,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon us to drive the key issues and shine a light on them and ensure that budgets are being spent in service of the right goals.\u201dAT&T\u2019s efforts underscore the strange world that advertisers are navigating online.\u201cFive, six, seven years ago, the majority of spend was in TV, print, even outdoor, and you had absolute clarity in where your advertising was appearing but far less data around who you were advertising against,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cWe\u2019ve flipped that now.\u201cWe have incredible data and insights into the people we\u2019re advertising against, but we no longer are really seeing across the digital ecosystem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "NBC Executive Takes Over Amazon Studios", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon had been on the hunt for a new executive, placing a strong emphasis on finding a woman, since October. In that time, streaming rivals like Netflix, Hulu and Apple have continued to gobble up television projects.Amazon has made the occasional splash at the Golden Globes and the Emmys with shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d but it has failed to gain the same kind of standing that Netflix and even Hulu have within Hollywood\u2019s creative community.It will be up to Ms. Salke, 53, to essentially hit the reset button.\u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeff Blackburn, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for business development and entertainment, said in a statement.A Fox executive, Dana Walden, and an A&E executive, Nancy Dubuc, had discussed the position with Amazon before each dropped out of talks.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited about the future at Amazon Studios,\u201d Ms. Salke said in a statement. \u201cIn the studio\u2019s relatively short existence they have innovated, disrupted and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop culture. I am both honored and emboldened by the opportunity to lead this extraordinary business.\u201dFor the last seven years, Ms. Salke has been second in command at NBC, where she and Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, engineered an impressive turnaround.Mr. Greenblatt, who joined NBC in 2010, and Ms. Salke, who came on board as president from Fox in 2011, found a network in deep trouble and well past its \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u201cER\u201d and \u201cFriends\u201d heyday.But now, propelled by \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and shows like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d NBC is poised to win the 18-to-49-year-old demographic among the four broadcast networks for a second consecutive season.Ms. Salke was one of the biggest champions of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d an emotional family drama whose popularity has surprised many industry veterans \u2014 as has its ability to sustain that success in its second season. On Sunday, NBC gave \u201cThis Is Us\u201d the post-Super Bowl slot, where it garnered an impressive audience of 27 million viewers.Ms. Salke has also helped deploy a strategy that brought NBC\u2019s comedy lineup back to life. After the lineup collapsed when \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d went off the air, she said the network would develop comedies that weren\u2019t meant to appeal to everybody. NBC has since found traction with offbeat comedies like \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and \u201cSuperstore.\u201d\u201cJennifer Salke is a world-class entertainment executive and deserves enormous credit for helping put NBC back on top,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said in a statement.But whether her success at helping turn around a broadcast network \u2014 which also relies on a healthy diet of Dick Wolf dramas \u2014 will translate to a streaming service is an open question.Amazon has been viewed in Hollywood as something of a sleeping giant, one of the few companies that could match Netflix financially if it deployed its cash properly. Netflix is poised to spend $8 billion on content this year.But Amazon has had several expensive missteps. \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s unfinished novel, debuted to little fanfare and was canceled. Likewise, several comedies, including \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson\u201d and \u201cI Love Dick,\u201d have been canceled in the last month.At the same time, Hulu has found real momentum. It is introducing several shows this year, including \u201cThe Looming Tower,\u201d a mini-series based on Lawrence Wright\u2019s book about the lead-up to the Sept. 11 attacks, this month and the second season of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d in April.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: The Beverly Hills Affordable Housing Loophole", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, who reports on economics from the Bay Area.What was surprising, even shocking, was the city that topped the very short list of places that are meeting their goal of affordable new residences: Beverly Hills. How could that be? Are Beverly Hills\u2019s residents feeling guilty about income inequality and mass building low-income housing as a result?Perhaps not surprisingly, Beverly Hills\u2019s apparently stellar record at building housing for poor people has more to do with politics and funny math than a sudden building boom.The progress report released last week is based on a series of housing goals that are decided by a regional body of governments. Over the eight-year period covered by the goals, Beverly Hills was required to build a total of three housing units: One very-low income housing unit, one low-income housing unit, and one moderately priced housing unit. In fairness, the wealthy Los Angeles County city far exceeded its numbers, at least on a percentage basis, by issuing permits for a total of nine low- and moderate-income housing units.The city was not required to build any high-income housing units, since it already has a lot of them. Nevertheless, it blew its goal of zero out of the water, and issued 75 new permits for high-income housing.Scott Wiener, the San Francisco senator who wrote the streamlining bill on which the recent report was based, said in an interview that numbers like those reported by Beverly Hills are why he is working on a new bill that would try to neutralize the role of politics in housing production by tying future state housing goals to economic measures like job growth. It would also carry forward past housing deficits so that cities that don\u2019t build will lose further control over local housing decisions as time goes on.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd and we see this around the state where communities that are whiter and more affluent are able to push down their numbers and essentially opt out of new housing,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Coming up this week:In 1875, a visitor to Yosemite recorded his predicament in a guest registry. \u201cCan\u2019t get out of Yosemite on account of a sick horse,\u201d he wrote, adding ruefully: \u201cYosemite Valley is a lovely place in which to be incarcerated.\u201dThat\u2019s a quaint picture of a park that has exploded in popularity in recent years. The park received more than 5 million visitors in 2016.And although February is usually one of the slowest months, the spectacular sunsets that occur during the last two weeks of the month at Horsetail Fall have become a major draw.

{"Headline": "After Florida School Shooting, Russian \u2018Bot\u2019 Army Pounced", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe accounts addressed the news with the speed of a cable news network. Some adopted the hashtag #guncontrolnow. Others used #gunreformnow and #Parklandshooting. Earlier on Wednesday, before the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., many of those accounts had been focused on the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThis is pretty typical for them, to hop on breaking news like this,\u201d said Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, a company that tracks online disinformation campaigns. \u201cThe bots focus on anything that is divisive for Americans. Almost systematically.\u201dOne of the most divisive issues in the nation is how to handle guns, pitting Second Amendment advocates against proponents of gun control. And the messages from these automated accounts, or bots, were designed to widen the divide and make compromise even more difficult.Any news event \u2014 no matter how tragic \u2014 has become fodder to spread inflammatory messages in what is believed to be a far-reaching Russian disinformation campaign. The disinformation comes in various forms: conspiracy videos on YouTube, fake interest groups on Facebook, and armies of bot accounts that can hijack a topic or discussion on Twitter.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.The researchers said they had watched as the bots began posting about the Parkland shooting shortly after it happened.Facebook, Google and Twitter have, to varying degrees, announced new measures to eliminate bot accounts, and have hired more moderators to help them weed out disinformation on their platforms.The bots are \u201cgoing to find any contentious issue, and instead of making it an opportunity for compromise and negotiation, they turn it into an unsolvable issue bubbling with frustration,\u201d said Karen North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cIt just heightens that frustration and anger.\u201dIntelligence officials in the United States have warned that malicious actors will try to spread disinformation ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. In testimony to Congress last year and in private meetings with lawmakers, social media companies promised that they will do better in 2018 than they did in 2016.But the Twitter campaign around the Parkland shooting is an example of how Russian operatives are still at it.\u201cWe\u2019ve had more than a year to get our act together and address the threat posed by Russia and implement a strategy to deter future attacks, but I believe, unfortunately, we still don\u2019t have a comprehensive plan,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, during a hearing this month on global threats to the United States. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a continuous assault by Russia to target and undermine our democratic institutions, and they\u2019re going to keep coming at us.\u201dWhen the Russian bots jumped on the hashtag #Parklandshooting \u2014 initially created to spread news of the shooting \u2014 they quickly stoked tensions. Exploiting the issue of mental illness in the gun control debate, they propagated the notion that Nikolas Cruz, the suspected gunman, was a mentally ill \u201clone killer.\u201d They also claimed that he had searched for Arabic phrases on Google before the shooting. Simultaneously, the bots started other hashtags, like #ar15, for the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting, and #NRA.The goal is to push fringe ideas into the \u201cslightly more mainstream,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. If well-known people retweet the bot messages or simply link to a website the bots are promoting, the messages gain an edge of legitimacy.The indictment also described how fraudulent Russian accounts on Twitter tried to push real Americans into action. The indictment said the fake Twitter account @March_for_Trump had organized political rallies for Mr. Trump in New York before the election, including a \u201cMarch for Trump\u201d rally on June 25, 2016, and a \u201cDown With Hillary\u201d gathering on July 23, 2016.By Friday morning, the bots that pushed the original tweets around the Parkland shooting had moved on to the hashtag #falseflag \u2014 a term used by conspiracy theorists to refer to a secret government operation that is carried out to look like something else \u2014 with a conspiracy theory that the shooting had never happened.By Monday, the bots had new targets: the Daytona 500 auto race in Daytona Beach, Fla., and news about William Holleeder, a man facing trial in the Netherlands for his suspected role in six gangland killings. It is unclear why.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Is Getting Paid to Save the Music Industry: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify files to go public.\u2022 Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles.\u2022 The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one?\u2022 What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?\u2022 The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope.\u2022 And is Jared Kushner\u2019s weakness his family business?Perhaps more than any other streaming service, Spotify has revived the fortunes of recording artists. It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday.The numbers are included in Spotify\u2019s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing\u2019s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, \u201cconsists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.\u201dThe filing says Spotify had \u20ac3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was \u20ac2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. \u201cThis decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,\u201d the filing said.But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that.\u2014 Peter EavisAccounting nerds delving into Spotify\u2019s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy.Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of \u20ac324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled \u20ac179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda?It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung \u20ac439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year.\u2014 Peter EavisDirect listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market.Spotify won\u2019t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days.Here\u2019s a look at the details:Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang.Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify\u2019s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public.In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby.Dick\u2019s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT:\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201dOver five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero.Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest.\u2022 Mr. Ackman\u2019s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet.How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high.Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIs it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no.BackgroundSnap\u2019s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock.The criticism has also overshadowed Snap\u2019s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent.BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock\u2019s annual report:As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as \u201ccommon ownership\u201d. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.The filing goes on to say:If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock\u2019s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years.What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy.To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes.Is it working? Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year.Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony.\u2014 Peter EavisSky is both a telecom operator \u2014 selling TV, internet and phone services \u2014 and a media company with its own original news, sports and entertainment programming.

{"Headline": "Google Legally Fired Diversity Memo Author, Labor Agency Says", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google did not break the law when it fired an engineer who wrote a memo critical of the company\u2019s diversity efforts, a lawyer for a federal labor agency said.Last year, James Damore, a little-known engineer on Google\u2019s search infrastructure team, incited outrage at the company and across Silicon Valley for making an argument that seemed to rationalize the pay and opportunity gap between genders at technology companies.Before he was fired by Google, Mr. Damore filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board saying that the company had violated his right to engage in concerted activity to address a workplace problem.But Jayme L. Sophir, an associate general counsel at the labor agency, said that Google\u2019s actions were acceptable because they made clear that Mr. Damore was being fired for comments that advanced stereotypes \u2014 not for speaking out about the company.The decision was published on Jan. 16 but was not made public until Thursday.Google made clear that Mr. Damore had violated its policies on harassment and discrimination when he argued, for example, that women were more prone to \u201cneuroticism,\u201d meaning that they exhibited higher anxiety and a lower tolerance for stress, the labor agency said.\u201cEmployers have a strong interest in promoting diversity and encouraging employees across diverse demographic groups to thrive in their workplaces. In furtherance of these legitimate interests, employers must be permitted to \u2018nip in the bud\u2019 the kinds of employee conduct that could lead to a \u2018hostile workplace,\u2019 rather than waiting until an actionable hostile workplace has been created before taking action,\u201d Ms. Sophir wrote.The decision said numerous Google employees had complained to human relations about Mr. Damore\u2019s memo and two potential engineering candidates withdrew their names from consideration because of what he wrote. Google declined to comment on Friday, while Mr. Damore and his lawyer did not respond to emails seeking comment.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka.Advertisement"}

Joined with them are the municipal authorities, which incur costs for traffic studies, engineering, implementation and enforcement.Leonia may be, as you say, \u201cground zero for the phenomenon,\u201d but let that be ground zero for a nationwide organization of communities and elected officials seeking to enforce the rights of residents to preserve the peace, safety, health and value of their neighborhoods, which are under increasing assault from app-directed commuter traffic.JEREMY STANTON, WASHINGTONTo the Editor:Some neighborhoods in Brooklyn have been adversely affected by navigation apps as seen in Leonia, N.J.I\u2019ve been a homeowner on Seeley Street in Brooklyn for 35 years and have seen our narrow, two-way street go from an occasional thruway to a rush-hour line of impatient truck, bus and car drivers exiting the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway or seeking a shortcut through residential streets.Leonia\u2019s fix \u2014 an almost total ban on nonresident cars during rush hour \u2014 is not ours, but navigation apps can create clogged streets in neighborhoods that need relief.HARVEY FISHER, BROOKLYNTo the Editor: The root cause of the problem facing Leonia, N.J., is a transportation system built to encourage driving in private cars. Investments in highways have induced demand, while public transportation has been neglected.As an example, my wife drives across the George Washington Bridge several times a week for work, and the only public transit options available take almost twice as long and are not much cheaper.Now app providers like Waze and Google are profiting from the decades of misguided policies that have created congestion.In the long run, the solution is getting drivers to pay a fair share of the cost they impose \u2014 through congestion \u2014 on other people.

{"Headline": "To Stir Discord in 2016, Russians Turned Most Often to Facebook", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2014, Russians working for a shadowy firm called the Internet Research Agency started gathering American followers in online groups focused on issues like religion and immigration. Around mid-2015, the Russians began buying digital ads to spread their messages. A year later, they tapped their followers to help organize political rallies across the United States.While the indictment does not accuse Facebook of any wrongdoing, it provided the first comprehensive account from the authorities of how critical the company\u2019s platforms had been to the Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 election. Facebook and Instagram were mentioned 41 times, while other technology that the Russians used was featured far less. Twitter was referred to nine times, YouTube once and the electronic payments company PayPal 11 times.It is unprecedented for an American technology company to be so central to what the authorities say was a foreign scheme to commit election fraud in the United States. The indictment further batters Facebook\u2019s image after it has spent months grappling with questions about how it was misused and why it did not act earlier to prevent that activity.Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, said the indictment laid bare how effectively Facebook could be turned against the country.\u201cFacebook built incredibly effective tools which let Russia profile citizens here in the U.S. and figure out how to manipulate us,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cFacebook, essentially, gave them everything they needed.\u201d He added that many of the tools that the Russians used, including those that allow ads to be targeted and that show how widespread an ad becomes, still pervade Facebook.Yet Facebook\u2019s multiple mentions in Friday\u2019s indictment renew questions of why the world\u2019s biggest social media company didn\u2019t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company\u2019s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia\u2019s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election. On Saturday, President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory.In Silicon Valley, where Facebook has its headquarters, some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public.\u201cMueller\u2019s indictment underscores the central role of Facebook and other platforms in the Russian interference in 2016,\u201d said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who had invested early in Facebook. \u201cIn its heyday, television brought the country together, giving viewers a shared set of facts and experiences. Facebook does just the opposite, enabling every user to have a unique set of facts, driving the country apart for profit.\u201dJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action \u201cagainst those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.\u201dHe added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place. \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\u201d he said.Facebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors. Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel\u2019s investigation.YouTube did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and \u201cis intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.\u201dAccording to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency, created in 2014 in St. Petersburg and employing about 80 people, was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes.The group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014, when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion. Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.By 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.The Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: \u201cHatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201dAround 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.By mid-2016, according to the indictment, the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States. That June, for example, posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook, they promoted a rally called \u201cSupport Hillary. Save American Muslims.\u201d For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook, the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.At every step, the Russians used Facebook\u2019s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. Those tools allowed them to get real-time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers.Researchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation, it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively.Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Your Dog Ready for Instagram?", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOh, Tuna, you really do have it all: a quirky breed name (a Chiweenie!), everydog imperfections (that overbite!), the sad-sack countenance (I mean, if Buster Keaton were a dog. \u2026). You even have the heartwarming back story: a rescue, adopted from a farmers\u2019 market in Los Angeles.Except for the bulldog, whose days of toil baiting bulls are long gone, these are sporting or working breeds, most with big floppy ears and obedient personalities, several of which have played the lovable family dog in generations of prime-time dog-food commercials.Compare that to the five most popular dog breeds on Instagram. The list, which the social media company compiled based on a search of breed names in users\u2019 posts, is strikingly different: pug, bulldog, terrier, Chihuahua and husky. (The data did not distinguish between types of terriers).So, what dog traits are favored by Instagram users? Well, for starters, they like dogs that look like them.Breeds like pugs and Boston terriers \u201creally resemble humans, or babies,\u201d Mr. Woo said. These so-called brachycephalic breeds, with their shortened heads, flat faces and barely there noses, \u201care very photogenic with their large, forward-looking eyes,\u201d Mr. Woo said. \u201cThey appear to be grinning or smiling,\u201d never mind that the \u201csmiles\u201d are often caused by breathing difficulties native to their breeds.Pug owners don\u2019t disagree.As actors or models, pugs are the canine equivalent of hams. \u201cThey were bred in China to sit at the emperor\u2019s feet and entertain,\u201d Ms. Mosier said.\u201cIt makes him instantly recognizable,\u201d said Allan Monteron, one of his owners. \u201cPeople stop us on the street and say, \u2018I follow that dog on Instagram!\u2019\u201dEvery feature of the corgi works as a visual punch line: those oversize Yoda ears, the squat \u201cHoney I Shrunk the Collie\u201d body, the 50-percent-off appendages, which make the corgi\u2019s movements particularly comical on social media.The same may be said of bulldogs, the one breed that appears in the top five of both Instagram and the American Kennel Club. Outside of social media, bulldogs\u2019 popularity will be assured so long as there are Anglophiles, Marine Corps veterans and college football fans in the state of Georgia.And on Instagram, where user names that include \u201cbulldog\u201d have seen a 60 percent surge in the past year, bulldogs check multiple boxes: They look like people (specifically, grumpy old men), have inherently comic features (the volleyball-size head, the tiny bow legs) and are easy to anthropomorphize.Because of their associations with the queen and the British Empire, however, both corgis and bulldogs seem out of step with the current vogue for rescue dogs and less rarefied breeds.\u201cI\u2019ve found that people prefer the more real, natural dogs,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cPoodles seem to give off a pretentious vibe, especially if they have the classic poodle haircut. The older generations love them, but I think the younger generation sees that style as fake, undogly.\u201dMany dog owners interviewed also said they see mutts, rescues and disabled dogs as a more ethical choice.\u201cI think the most difficult question posed to us is always \u2018Where did you get that dog? I want to get one exactly like it,\u201d said Francis Bott, who owns Agador with his partner, Mr. Monteron. \u201cIt is simple enough to provide the breeder\u2019s name, but we are big proponents of adopting rescues whenever possible.\u201d(They opted buy a hypoallergenic poodle mix from a breeder, Mr. Bott said, because their previous dog, a rescue Shih Tzu/Bichon mix, aggravated their allergies.)\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s an antidote to all the bad news we\u2019re so often bombarded with,\u201d Ms. Nosek said. \u201cThese accounts remind us that there are people, and dogs, out there doing good.\u201dEither that, or such dogs just provide a break from the pressure that the rest of us feel trying to look too perfect for Instagram.Advertisement"}

Will diversity continue to matter?\u201dAnd success on the court in no way ensures success on screens, Mr. Boyd noted.\u201cAs the number of platforms and distribution channels grows \u2014 social media, Amazon, Netflix \u2014 there is a big need for unique content and quality storytelling that can cut through the noise,\u201d said Mr. Carter, who serves as SpringHill\u2019s chief executive and has known Mr. James since boyhood. \u201cWe saw an opportunity to tell stories about people who look like us and think like us.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s working on a bunch of novels \u2014 fiction, but rooted in sport \u2014 and will be building shows and films from there, original from his own head,\u201d said Molly Carter, Granity\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cThis is better than any All-Star Game I was ever in,\u201d he said after posing with Allison Janney, an Oscar acting nominee for the ice-skating biopic \u201cI, Tonya.\u201dHollywood has a long history of casting athletes, who come with built-in fan bases and often exude a natural magnetism on screen. Johnny Weissmuller, an Olympic swimmer, starred in a dozen \u201cTarzan\u201d movies starting in the 1930s.Among basketball players, Michael Jordan appeared as himself in the original \u201cSpace Jam,\u201d which took in $337 million worldwide in 1996, after adjusting for inflation. Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson have tried acting, producing and hosting over the years, to mixed results.\u201cLeBron has done such a great job so far,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, wow, this can actually be done.\u201dMr. Kleiman, who is also Mr. Durant\u2019s manager, added that a generation of athletes had also watched music stars build business empires. \u201cKevin paid attention to the Jay Zs and the Puffys that came up ahead of him and provided a blueprint,\u201d Mr. Kleiman said.Thirty Five Media also aims to increase revenue on the channel with a twist on the endorsement deal.\u201cYou may not get Kevin Durant the spokesman \u2014 he can only personally represent so many brands authentically \u2014 but you can get branded content,\u201d Mr. Kleiman said.\u201cHe started telling me the very interesting story about his early days playing basketball and how his mom kept a really good eye on him,\u201d Mr. Grazer said. \u201cAnd that got us talking about another way to do \u2018Friday Night Lights,\u2019 which was a series and movie about a boy\u2019s identity and how things that seem imperceptible can be so seismic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Scraps Safety Driver Rules for Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 California regulators have given the green light to truly driverless cars.The state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles said Monday that it was eliminating a requirement for autonomous vehicles to have a person in the driver\u2019s seat to take over in the event of an emergency. The new rule goes into effect on April 2.California has given 50 companies a license to test self-driving vehicles in the state. The new rules also require companies to be able to operate the vehicle remotely \u2014 a bit like a flying military drone \u2014 and communicate with law enforcement and other drivers when something goes wrong.\u201cThis is a major step forward for autonomous technology in California,\u201d said Jean Shiomoto, director of California\u2019s D.M.V. \u201cSafety is our top concern and we are ready to begin working with manufacturers that are prepared to test fully driverless vehicles in California.\u201dUber has also deployed autonomous vehicles in Arizona, but it uses safety drivers in those cars.\u201cThis is a significant step toward an autonomous future in the state, and signals that California is interested in leading by example in the deployment of autonomous vehicles,\u201d Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement.John M.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s HomePod Has Arrived. Don\u2019t Rush to Buy It.", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixOn my second day with Apple\u2019s new HomePod, I asked the artificially intelligent speaker to play some music. Siri, the virtual assistant that powers HomePod, enthusiastically replied, \u201cO.K., let\u2019s get going with some Dashboard Confessional.\u201dI cringed. \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody likes Dashboard Confessional.\u201dAt the time, I gave Siri a pass. After all, Apple\u2019s HomePod, a rival to smart speakers from Amazon and Google, is supposed to study your music preferences over time to create special playlists just for you. I had had only one day with HomePod.But after a week \u2014 during which I asked HomePod to play my favorite tunes from artists like Beck, Talking Heads and David Bowie \u2014 the smart speaker still did not learn. Instead, like a stubborn D.J., Siri kept playing music by artists outside my music palette: Taylor Swift and Leroy Francis, to name just two.That leads to my conclusion: The $349 HomePod, which costs roughly three times as much as its competitors and arrives in stores on Friday, is tough to recommend to you, dear reader.Apple\u2019s speaker is certainly an impressive piece of hardware. Audiophiles will appreciate that it has a woofer with a custom amplifier and seven tweeters. The result is a speaker with a deep bass and rich treble that is loud enough to fill a large room with superb sound. HomePod makes the Amazon Echo and Google\u2019s Home sound muffled and tinny in comparison.But Siri on HomePod is embarrassingly inadequate, even though that is the primary way you interact with it. Siri is sorely lacking in capabilities compared with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. Siri doesn\u2019t even work as well on HomePod as it does on the iPhone.Even now, Apple is shipping the HomePod unfinished. On Day 1, the device will lack some cool features, like the ability to link several HomePods to create a multiroom sound system that Apple says will fill an entire home with music. That feature will come in a software update later this year.And there are other limitations: The HomePod requires an iOS device, like an iPhone, an iPad or an iPod Touch, to set it up. To use your voice commands to play music, you will also need to subscribe to Apple\u2019s streaming music service, Apple Music.So how exactly did I reach my conclusion on HomePod? I tested it side by side with Echo and Home smart speakers, grading them on their ability to accomplish 14 tasks across several categories, including music, productivity, commuting, home automation and cooking. Let me walk you through the process and results.Apple also provided statistics on smart speaker usage from the research firm Parks Associates. That report also found that playing music and getting the weather were the top uses of smart speakers, while roughly 20 percent of people enjoyed using them for tasks like accessing a calendar and searching for recipes.Amazon says most of its Echo customers use at least one \u201cskill,\u201d or third-party app. So I added the ability to use Uber, the most popular ride-hailing service, as a test.Now onward to the tests themselves.I set up a HomePod, an Echo and a Home in my house and began with a battery of question-and-answer sessions. First up: traffic.All the speakers gave a similar traffic estimate for a drive to San Jose, Calif. \u2014 roughly a one-hour drive on the freeway. But when I asked HomePod to summon a car from Uber, Siri responded, \u201cI wish I could, but I can\u2019t help with rides here.\u201dThe other speakers were happy to help \u2014 so I followed up with: \u201cHey, Siri, what gives?\u201d HomePod\u2019s colorful touch screen lit up to show it had heard my question, but Siri remained silent.Next, it was time for some cooking questions. All the speakers were able to flawlessly set a kitchen timer. But when I asked HomePod how to make pasta, Siri blanked and said, \u201cI can\u2019t get the answer to that on HomePod.\u201dThen it was time to move on to some work-related tasks. I asked Siri to schedule a meeting for Tuesday. Siri responded: \u201cI cannot access your calendar from here. Sorry about that.\u201d It couldn\u2019t look at my calendar for the day, either. Google Home and Amazon Echo, in contrast, managed to schedule new events and read my calendar for the day: a meeting in the morning, followed by a photo shoot and a business dinner in the evening.When I asked Apple about Siri\u2019s hiccups, the company said that for the first version of HomePod, it focused on including tasks that people use smart speakers for the most, like playing music and asking about the weather, and that it would continue to evaluate what other features to add over time.I wondered whether HomePod would do better with home tasks and decided to ask all the smart speakers to turn on a Wi-Fi-connected light bulb from the smart light company Lifx. In this test, HomePod got a higher score because setting up the smart light, which involved using the iPhone camera to scan a code on the instruction manual, was seamless and much easier than it was with Google Home and Amazon Echo, which required installing a third-party app.Bonus: The light turned on when I asked.One of the most crucial tests for HomePod had to do with audio. That\u2019s because Apple has long emphasized that the smart speaker is first and foremost a music player.Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s head of marketing, said at a gathering at the company\u2019s audio lab last week that Apple started developing HomePod six years ago with the intention of making a speaker that specialized in playing music in a unique way. The project started well before Apple introduced other services like Apple Music, which was released in 2015, and HomeKit, the home automation platform that was unveiled in 2014, he added.Mr. Schiller said Apple wanted to stay true to the original goal of the project \u201cwithout ever compromising that it\u2019s a speaker first.\u201dAll three speakers did great playing music. Echo, Google\u2019s Home and HomePod were each able to play specific songs by artists, generate playlists for specific artists or music genres, and play podcasts. HomePod got a higher score in audio with its superior sound quality factored in.Yet that\u2019s also where Dashboard Confessional came in and where HomePod\u2019s biggest shortcomings became apparent. Whenever I asked HomePod to \u201cplay some music,\u201d it never played music that was relevant to my preferences or listening history.That wasn\u2019t the case with the Google and Amazon speakers. When I asked those speakers to play music, the gadgets simply resumed what I was last playing on Spotify, which was satisfying.In response to my concerns, Apple said HomePod studies a customer\u2019s music preferences over time. I figured a week should have been enough.From the tests, I graded the speakers on their ability to accomplish each task on a scale from 0 to 4. (I gave a 0 for tasks that could not be done at all, a 2 for tasks that could be done with some issues, and a 4 for tasks that could be completed flawlessly.)So how did they all stack up in terms of grade-point averages out of 4.0? The final results:\u25a0 Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 3.4\u25a0 Google\u2019s Home \u2014 3.1\u25a0 Apple\u2019s HomePod \u2014 2.9An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a musical artist whose music was played by Apple\u2019s HomePod speaker without being requested.

He earned the slightly mocking nickname of \u201cPutin\u2019s cook.\u201dDespite his humble, troubled youth, Mr. Prigozhin became one of Russia\u2019s richest men, joining a charmed circle whose members often share one particular attribute: their proximity to President Vladimir V. Putin. The small club of loyalists who gain Mr. Putin\u2019s trust often feast, as Mr. Prigozhin has, on enormous state contracts. In return, they are expected to provide other, darker services to the Kremlin as needed.\u201cThe Americans are very impressionable people; they see what they want to see,\u201d the Russian state news agency Ria Novosti quoted Mr. Prigozhin as saying on Friday. \u201cI have a lot of respect for them. I am not upset at all that I ended up on this list. If they want to see the devil, let them see him.\u201dMr. Prigozhin\u2019s critics \u2014 including opposition politicians, journalists and activists, the United States Treasury and now the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 say he has emerged as Mr. Putin\u2019s go-to oligarch for that and a variety of sensitive and often-unsavory missions, like recruiting contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine and Syria.\u201cHe can fulfill any task for Putin, ranging from fighting the opposition to sending mercenaries to Syria,\u201d she said. \u201cHe serves certain interests in certain spheres, and Putin trusts him.\u201dThe most notorious venture linked to Mr. Prigozhin, however, is the troll farm that is accused of attacking opposition figures in Russia and seeking to magnify and aggravate social and political divisions in the West. Despite his frequent denials of any involvement, his critics say he and others like him provide a way for the Kremlin to engage in such activities while maintaining a discreet distance.The indictment on Friday says, among other charges, that Mr. Prigozhin frequently met in 2015 and 2016 with Mikhail I. Bystrov, the top official in the troll factory, which ran a disinformation campaign called Project Lakhta that by September 2016 had a monthly budget of $1.2 million.Boris L. Vishnevsky, an opposition member of the city council in St. Petersburg, who has called for an official investigation into threats by Mr. Prigozhin against journalists, said the Kremlin endorsed projects like the troll farm without directly organizing them.\u201cThis is done by somebody who receives large-scale government contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he gets these contracts is a hidden way to pay for his services.\u201dWhen the troll factory was formed in 2013, its basic task was to flood social media with articles and comments that painted Russia under Mr. Putin as stable and comfortable compared to the chaotic, morally corrupt West. The trolls soon branched into overseas operations focused on Russian adversaries like Ukraine and the United States.\u201cNeither Concord Company nor other structures owned by the businessman are in any way connected with the activities directed toward meddling in the U.S. election,\u201d RBC quoted one of Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s representatives as saying.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, also denied any Kremlin connection to the Internet Research Agency.Despite Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s veil of secrecy, limited details about his personal life have emerged, mostly through the Instagram accounts of his two grown children.One picture featured his son, Pavel, walking naked on the deck of the 115-foot family yacht. Other pictures showed a private jet and a vintage powder blue Lincoln Continental, said to be Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s favorite car.His daughter Polina posted a picture of the sweeping view from his wooded compound in Gelendzhik, the resort town on the Black Sea. The compound, including a pier for the yacht, was built in an ostensibly protected forest much beloved by Mr. Putin and his cronies, according to the Anti-Corruption Foundation.Delovoy Peterburg, an independent daily newspaper published in St. Petersburg, listed him last year as ranking 83rd among the city\u2019s 304 ruble billionaires, with 11 billion rubles, or almost $200 million. The newspaper included only property in the public record, said Irina Pankratova, an investigative reporter. If all property linked to him had been counted, she said, he would rank in the Top 5.An old rust bucket that he and his soon-to-be-jettisoned partners converted to the floating New Island Restaurant became St. Petersburg\u2019s most fashionable dining spot.Eventually, Mr. Putin himself showed up, towing world leaders. He hosted President Jacques Chirac of France and his wife in 2001 and President George W. Bush in 2002. President Putin celebrated his own birthday there in 2003.During these glittering occasions, Mr. Prigozhin made sure to hover nearby, sometimes even clearing empty plates.In just the past five years, Mr. Prigozhin has received government contracts worth $3.1 billion, the Anti-Corruption Foundation reported.Some Russian contract soldiers in Syria were back in the news this month after a Feb. 7 clash between Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, and Syrian government forces aided by Russian mercenaries. Reports about exactly what happened remain murky, but anywhere from five to 200 Russian soldiers have been reported killed. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday confirmed five deaths, but has refused to confirm that it has contract soldiers fighting in Syria, fueling anger among the families of those fighting about the lack of information.It has always been difficult to find his fingerprints directly on any of these shadowy firms, said Denis Korotkov, a reporter for Fontanka. The only clues are the companies\u2019 overlapping ties, including the same managers, shared telephone numbers or IP addresses.After studying this material, Fontanka and the Anti-Corruption Foundation concluded in 2016 that significant government contracts were going to clusters of fake companies designed to circumvent federal rules on competitive bidding.State regulators also reviewed eight Defense Ministry contracts won by businesses linked to Mr. Prigozhin and issued a stern rebuke in May 2017.Russian law mandates that any contract go to the lowest bidder, but the winning tenders were only a fraction lower than the rest. Otherwise the bids were virtually identical, the Anti-Monopoly Service said, calling the 2015 bids fixed.The government announced that it would not press charges. Nobody anticipates Mr. Prigozhin appearing in a Russian court any time soon.\u201cWe don\u2019t expect him to be punished given that he is among the president\u2019s closest friends,\u201d said Maksim L. Reznik, another St. Petersburg legislator demanding that he be investigated.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from St. Petersburg, Russia, and Oleg Matsnev from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Earnings Disappoint. Blame It on the iPhone.", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut when people get used to near perfection, then \u201cpretty good\u201d becomes a disappointment.Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, fell short of Wall Street expectations for its fourth-quarter profit, sending the stock down in after-hours trading. Its profits were weighed down by an increase in traffic acquisition costs \u2014 the fees Google pays companies like Apple to ensure that its search engine is the default option when people open a browser on the iPhone.On Thursday, Alphabet attributed the increase in costs to a rising number of people doing searches on smartphones. Those queries require the company to pay more to reserve screen real estate compared to searches on desktop computers.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company expects those traffic acquisition costs will continue to climb. She framed the increased expense as a positive, a sign that Alphabet was establishing an important beachhead on smartphones.\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have a strong position in a rapidly growing market,\u201d said Ms. Porat. Shares of Alphabet initially fell as much as 5 percent in after-hours trading before settling in at about a 2 percent decline.Alphabet said Google\u2019s traffic acquisition costs in the quarter increased 33 percent from a year earlier, to $6.45 billion. Last year, Bernstein Research estimated that Google would pay about $3 billion to Apple in 2017 to remain the default search option on Apple\u2019s mobile devices.Excluding the tax charge, Alphabet said its earnings per share was $9.70, compared with Wall Street\u2019s expectations for $9.98. Revenue grew 24 percent to $32.32 billion.The results underscored the strength of Google\u2019s position in digital advertising, a market it dominates with Facebook. In the fourth quarter, users clicked on 48 percent more ads on Google sites \u2014 including search and YouTube \u2014 than a year earlier.In 2017, two-thirds of every ad dollar spent on the internet went through Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s advertising systems, according to research from Goldman Sachs. What\u2019s more, Goldman Sachs estimated that 87 percent of the additional spending in digital advertising this year will funnel through these two companies.Alphabet also announced that John Hennessy, the former Stanford University president and a board member since 2004, had been appointed the company\u2019s new chairman. Eric Schmidt stepped down as executive chairman in December. At the time, Alphabet had said it planned to appoint a nonexecutive chairman.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twittter: @daiwakaAdvertisement"}

Yet on Friday, spot searches of the sites revealed that the noxious content was far from eradicated.On Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, searches for the hashtag #crisisactor, which accused the Parkland survivors of being actors, turned up hundreds of posts perpetuating the falsehood (though some also criticized the conspiracy theory). Many of the posts had been tweaked ever so slightly \u2014 for example, videos had been renamed #propaganda rather than #hoax \u2014 to evade automated detection. And on YouTube, while many of the conspiracy videos claiming that the students were actors had been taken down, other videos that claimed the shooting had been a hoax remained rife.Facebook faced renewed criticism on Friday after it was revealed that the company showcased a virtual reality shooting game at the Conservative Political Action Conference this week. Facebook said it was removing the game from its demonstration of its new virtual reality products.The resilience of misinformation, despite efforts by the tech behemoths to eliminate it, has become a real-time case study of how the companies are constantly a step behind in stamping out the content.

Any video flagged to us that violates this policy is reviewed and then removed.\u201dSam Woolley, an internet researcher at the nonprofit Institute for the Future, said far-right groups had started using internet brands to describe minorities \u2014 like \u201cSkype\u201d to indicate Jewish people \u2014 to trick software and human reviewers.Those who post conspiracy theories also tend to quickly repost or engage with similar posts from other accounts, creating a sort of viral effect that can cause the sites\u2019 algorithms to promote the content as a trending topic or a recommended video, said David Carroll, a professor at the New School who studies tech platforms.That duplication and repackaging of misinformation \u201cmake the game of snuffing it out Whac-a-Mole to the extreme,\u201d he said.That game played out across the web in the past few days, after a video suggesting that one of the most vocal Parkland survivors, David Hogg, was an actor became the No. 1 trending video on YouTube. After a public outcry, YouTube removed the video and said it would take down other \u201ccrisis actor\u201d videos because they violated its ban on bullying. YouTube has since scrubbed its site of many such videos.Yet some of the videos remained, possibly because they used slightly different terminology. One clip that had drawn more than 77,000 views by Friday described the shooting survivors as \u201cdisaster performers\u201d instead of \u201ccrisis actors.\u201dOther videos that were not about the Parkland survivors but that called the entire shooting into question also stayed online. A video posted last week by Alex Jones, the founder of the conspiracy theory site Infowars, titled \u201cRed Alert! Evidence Mounts Florida Attacks Is a Giant False Flag\u201d had attracted more than 300,000 views by Friday.On Facebook, some of the posts the social network had vowed to ban were still gaining traction. One lengthy post had been shared more than 3,800 times by early Friday. The post included a photo of Mr. Hogg and his classmate Emma Gonzalez with the text \u201cGlobalist Deep State Crisis Actors.\u201dAfter The New York Times contacted the author of the post, a self-described political analyst named John Miranda, the post disappeared. It is unclear if Facebook removed it. Mr. Miranda did not respond to a request for comment.The tech companies\u2019 increasing efforts to remove misinformation have a side effect: angering some of their most active users.Moe Othman, a comedian and commentator on YouTube who has about 60,000 subscribers, said that within 10 minutes of posting a video on Wednesday that suggested some Parkland students were actors, YouTube removed it and placed a strike on his account. YouTube terminates accounts after three strikes.Mr. Othman said in a private message on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. We live in a world where information is one of the most important tools.\u201d He added, \u201cIn this case, I see YouTube as a censoring machine.\u201dWould he stop using YouTube? No, he said, \u201cmainly because I\u2019m still a comedian who simply wants to make people laugh.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here are some tips to get by from someone who does it all the time.But take note: in Mr. Thibault\u2019s experience, these apps work best when you\u2019re trying to decipher something in writing, like a restaurant menu or a street sign, rather than in the midst of a conversation. Pointing with your hands and nodding or shaking your head, Mr. Thibault said, are an easy way to communicate with locals in the country you\u2019re in. \u201cGestures are almost all universally understood,\u201d he said. There are exceptions however. In many of the countries in the Balkans, for example, nodding means \u201cno,\u201d and shaking your head means \u201cyes.\u201d Also, although a smile usually conveys friendliness, in some countries such as Russia, locals don\u2019t smile at people they don\u2019t know. A quick web search for the country you\u2019re visiting and \u201cgestures\u201d or \u201cbody language\u201d will turn up anything you need to be aware of before you go.If you feel particularly uncomfortable in the country you\u2019re headed to, and you have to go anyway, relying on a local travel agent who knows both your and your destination\u2019s language can be incredibly useful. He or she can step in to help translate over the phone should any major issues arise, especially with things like flights, lodging, or other travel-related issues. Many agents also offer services 24 hours a day, so help is just a quick call away no matter what the problem may be. A tour guide can help you get a better grasp of the local language and is a good person to practice words and phrases with. Whenever Mr. Thibault visits a new country, he books a sightseeing tour with a guide on the first day of his trip. \u201cI use this day to learn about my destination and get familiar with the language,\u201d he said. You can always search the web for local tour guides and fixers before you go, or alternatively find a guide through your hotel\u2019s concierge a travel agent or by calling the local tourist office.

{"Headline": "How \u2018Lolita\u2019 Freed Me From My Own Humbert", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveIt was my uncle who gave me my first copy of \u201cLolita.\u201d My father had refused to buy it for me at the bookstore we often visited together.\u201cWhy that book?\u201d my father said as he and I arrived home.\u201cI just want it.\u201d We removed our shoes at the door, where religious superstition required all things unclean to be left. \u201cI wanted to read it.\u201dI was 15, a sophomore in high school, and had learned of \u201cLolita\u201d from an English teacher who had summarized the plot, citing it as an example of unreliable narration.My uncle knew the basics \u2014 the trope of the precocious girl, the Japanese fashion subculture, the heart-shape glasses \u2014 but he had not actually read the novel when he gave it to me as a gift a few weeks later, after I told him my father wouldn\u2019t buy it.My uncle liked to buy me gifts both little and lavish: what my parents could not afford, what they forbade me to have. The benefactor role made him feel as if he were filling gaps that my parents\u2019 conservatism had left in my life.So in whichever hotel room we were staying that night (with me tucked into bed, conned out of clothes), he tossed me the forbidden paperback and said, \u201cYou\u2019d better hide this. Your mother will have a fit if she sees you reading it. You know she doesn\u2019t trust you like I do.\u201dHe issued this warning even though I hid everything from my mother, as he had trained me to do. He knew that to groom girls you must erase mothers. I knew he had groomed girls before me from the tragic stories he told of Indian girls he had been with in England, stories in which he remembered himself as more savior than predator. I didn\u2019t know their names, but across his years of abuse we formed a tight-lipped sisterhood, our silence keeping him out of jail.I wanted to read \u201cLolita\u201d because I believed it would mitigate my sexual shame. The similarity between the novel\u2019s plot and my day-to-day life had sent me on a Google search, where I read excerpts and watched trailers of both film adaptations, categorized under \u201ccrime,\u201d \u201cdrama\u201d and \u201cromance.\u201d Until then it had never occurred to me to consider my relationship with my uncle under any of those genres. That anyone could think us a romance nauseated me, while crime and drama seemed overblown.He came into my life when I was 12 and he was 53, a close family friend in a country \u2014 the United States \u2014 where my family had few relations. Childless himself, married to a mystery woman, he became my uncle in the routine way I was taught to call Indian men \u201cuncle\u201d and Indian women \u201cauntie.\u201dHe was also a progressive voice in my conservative household, sympathetic to the \u201cAmericanness\u201d in me that my mother viewed as dangerous, especially regarding sex. While my friends were getting birds-and-bees talks, my mother prohibited tampons. I did not know what a menstrual period was until I got mine. Womanhood was far-off, a state of emergency that befell other people. We operated as if men did not exist.But I had curiosities and crushes, and I came to confide these to my uncle over the handful of day trips and conversations it took him to secure my trust, and for me to love him, as briefly I did, as a girl can come to love a man who is like a father to her.Under the false pretense of his wife joining us, he turned our day trips into overnights. On weekends he drove us into Manhattan, delivering me to acting classes and then picking me up for dinners and Broadway plays.Although I was taught to accept nothing from anyone, he bought me a wardrobe of risqu\u00e9 women\u2019s clothing and warned that rejecting his gifts would be ungrateful. At an age when I considered myself invisible to men, he found gratification in pointing out when a man on the street looked at me. I gazed at myself in the mirrors of the ritzy hotels where we stayed in rooms so extravagant that I was self-conscious about taking up space. Manhattan hotel rooms became Boston hotel rooms became Connecticut hotel rooms became seaside resorts and other locations I have worked diligently to forget.I did not acknowledge that the cost of his care was molestation. To acknowledge that would make it true, so I accepted his explanations that what he did to me was either universal or imaginary, and that my pain was a product of my own tearful hysterics.\u201cCalm down,\u201d he would say, his large, damp hand resting on my thigh. \u201cEveryone is taught how to do this, how to kiss. I don\u2019t get any pleasure from it. You\u2019re mischaracterizing things.\u201dI ran with this theory, of myself as an unreliable narrator.When I began attending a Catholic girls high school, a world of women materialized. My parents believed an all-girls education would put me on the path to an Ivy League college without the distraction of boys and their gazes.To function as a schoolgirl, I cordoned off the memories of the other life I led, a life dictated by the gaze of a middle-age man. Instead, I dreamed of growing up and getting away from him. When, during a car ride, I spoke about my hopes for college, he promised to get an apartment wherever I attended. He dreamed I would come home to him after class and live with him like a surrogate wife.I wept, devastated by the prospect of a future without exit. At the intersection he kissed my forehead, apparently mistaking my tears for joy.Over time it became harder to deny the reality of the abuse, but still I felt I could tell no one. Exposing my uncle would ruin him, and I considered myself too unimportant to upend a grown man\u2019s life. So I endured, pushing my family away and pulling my uncle close, and, I hoped, past suspicion.I felt as if I were growing into two identities, the woman I was and the woman-as-object eclipsing her. And in \u201cLolita\u201d I found a strange validation: that there was glamour to be had as an object of desire. If a pedophile\u2019s gaze could be normalized and even beautified, then perhaps I could normalize and beautify my own situation. It was easier to digest an image of myself as a nymphet than to confront the reality of my victimhood.Over time, the novel became more than a coping mechanism; it became a guide. I came to see how Lolita uses Humbert\u2019s obsession with her as a means to gain power over him. In the blue kidnapping car in which the two travel cross-country, she uses this power to accuse him of rape, of being a \u201cdirty man.\u201d While Humbert fumbles to justify booking one hotel room for them both, she names their situation for the incest it is. She knows she is Humbert\u2019s vulnerability and learns how to use herself against him.Eventually, so did I.The winter I first read \u201cLolita,\u201d my uncle was trying to remain in my mother\u2019s good graces, hoping he could convince her to appoint him as my legal guardian if tragedy ever struck. He was thrilled by the growing friction between my mother and me, fights precipitated by the sexy way I had started to dress and by her suspicion that I sneaked around with college men after school, which I did. His abuse had made me promiscuous to the point of recklessness, grateful for the simple fact that my body could still want. And I found that the more I wanted other men, the less I was willing to tolerate him.When he surprised me with an apartment he had rented for us near my school, I told him, for the first time, that I hated him, that he was as much a pervert as the man in the book. And once the accusations began, I could not stop. Although he already helped to finance my school fees, I also demanded envelopes of money, determined to be ungrateful, to exact collateral. Over dinners I told him about men I had been with and what we had done, at which point he would set aside his plate and moan that he had lost his appetite.It would be a few months before I reached my breaking point and exposed him to a schoolteacher, someone I knew would be legally bound to report him.Soon after, at the police station, I supplied an affidavit. I sat in a roomful of officers who prompted and recorded me through an incriminating phone call with my uncle, the contents of which were then played back to him after his arrest, after he had dismissed the molestation charges as my \u201cmischaracterizing things.\u201dI had not mischaracterized. The story I told was neither unreliable nor glamorous, and it didn\u2019t belong to him. It was, and is, mine.Bindu Bansinath is a senior at Columbia University and was an intern for the 2017 Modern Love college essay contest.modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Enter Correction Territory: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 Stocks enter correction territory.\u2022 Qualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s revised offer.\u2022 Snap and Twitter: From also-rans to worthy contenders?\u2022 BlackRock is reportedly setting its sights on Berkshire Hathaway and the Blackstone Group.\u2022 A top WSJ editor heads to Lazard.\u2022 Brunswick Group has named Neal Wolin as its new C.E.O.The Dow Jones industrial average and S.&P. 500 went more the 400 days without a pullback of 5 percent.That streak ended this week, and on Thursday, the two indexes fell into correction territory, defined as a pullback of at least 10 percent from their high. For both, it is the first time they have crossed into a correction since early 2016.The Dow plunged more than 1,000 points Thursday, its second decline of more than 1,000 points this week. The S. & P. 500 dropped 100 points, its third decline of more than 100 points in its history.On a percentage basis, the Dow fell 4.15 percent, the S. & P. 500 dropped 3.75 percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.9 percent.The bigger pictureAnxieties about inflation have driven the much of decline over the past week and a half. The yield on the benchmark Treasury note climbed above 2.85 percent \u2014 its highest level since 2014 \u2014 for the second time this week. Higher yields can crimp economic activity by raising borrowing costs, while also making riskier assets like stocks less appealing to bonds.Many market watchers say that investors should not worry about the recent spate of volatility in the stock market. Such swings, they say, are normal. They point to strong corporate earnings and a strengthening economy both in the United States and abroad as reasons to be optimistic about stocks.Investor sentiment has reversed in recent weeks as the sell-off in stocks gained momentum.According to the American Association of Individual Investors\u2019 weekly survey, bullish sentiment, or the percentage of respondents that say stocks will rise over the next six months, declined to 37 percent. The drop ended a streak of eight straight weeks with bullish sentiment above its historical average of 38.5 percent.It began the year at nearly 60 percent, its highest level since 2010.The contextThe survey has proved to be a good contrarian indicator. That means overly bullish sentiment often signals that the stock market is ripe for a pullback, while overly bearish sentiment often indicates that market may soon rally.The chip maker said its board had rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised $121 billion offer.The reasons\u2022 \u201cThe Broadcom proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm.\u201d\u2022 The offer \u201cfalls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction.\u201dQualcomm said that it was willing to meet with Broadcom to see if its issues with the offer could be addressed.The contextQualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.Till this week, many investors wondered whether Snap and Twitter had much of a future at a time when Google and Facebook are sucking up such a large share of digital advertising dollars. But after Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even as they remain in the shadow of Facebook and Google.\u2014 Peter EavisBlackRock itself raises a different comparison, according to Sarah Krouse of the WSJ \u2014 to Warren Buffett:The \u201cbest known\u201d example of BlackRock\u2019s approach with this new vehicle is Berkshire Hathaway, according to a fund-raising document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Omaha conglomerate run by Mr. Buffett is well known for its long-term ownership of companies.BlackRock\u2019s Long-Term Private Capital fund would be a tenth of Berkshire\u2019s $101 billion in cash. But it too would look to buy and hold positions for more than 10 years. Over all, though, this seems more akin to private equity.The practice has grown on Wall Street with the rise of activist investors, with investment banks touting their defense capabilities to corporate clients.Before becoming finance editor at the Journal, Mr. Berman oversaw the paper\u2019s business coverage and was its M.&A. reporter prior to that.Mr. Berman, who will join as a managing director and be based in New York, will start on Feb. 26.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedAndrew, with a bit of contextDennis follows in the footsteps of Steven Rattner, who worked as a reporter at the NYT in the 1980s before going to work as a banker at Lazard and becoming an influential financier. (Today, Mr. Rattner overseas Michael Bloomberg\u2019s fortune.)Dennis was my fiercest reporting competitor over the last decade and is one of the most talented financial journalists in recent memory.Mr. Wolin, who will remain based in Washington, will take over from the London-based Susan Gilchrist, who will become chairwoman of Brunswick\u2019s global clients operations and focus on client work full time.Alan Parker, Brunswick\u2019s founder, said in a telephone interview of the move, \u201cIt reflects the growth of the business and the business opportunity in America.\u201dThe contextIn some ways, the appointment of Mr. Wolin reflects that trend. Beyond his time at the Treasury Department, he previously worked as a senior executive at The Hartford, an insurer. And he was previously a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration.\u201cIncreasingly, I think senior executives and boards of directors have come to understand that a lot of their challenges and opportunitiess sit at the intersection of business and governments and society and so forth,\u201d Mr. Wolin said in a phone interview.Or as Mr. Parker put it, \u201cMore and more we hear ourselves described as a critical issues business.\u201dOther moves at Brunswick\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe recent stock market freak-out may have abated, but the dynamics that drove the sell-off \u2014 worries that faster global growth and hotter inflation will trigger faster-than-expected rate hikes \u2014 are alive and well in the currency markets.On Thursday, the Bank of England raised its growth forecasts for the United Kingdom, and Mark Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said rates would likely have to be increased faster than previously expected.The British pound promptly popped by more than 1 percent against the dollar, and yields on British government bonds rose. Treasury bonds yields in the United States also rose, with the 10-year note offering yields of nearing 2.90 percent.The sight of bond yields nearing 3 percent should keep stock investors on edge amid the growing conviction we\u2019re moving out of the era of low-interest rates, which were such a key ingredient for the near-decade-long bull market in stocks.\u2014 Matt PhillipsThe bigger pictureWhat business cares about in the proposal:\u2022 Nearly $300 billion in additional spending over the next two years\u2022 $20 billion for infrastructure spending\u2022 A lifting of the debt ceiling until March 2019The agreement will cause federal budget deficits to grow even larger, on top of the effects of the sweeping tax overhaul that lawmakers approved in December. But because the deal gives long-sought victories to both parties, the deficit effect appears to be of little concern.Steve Wynn is gone. And Wynn\u2019s shares leapt nearly 9 percent on that news.The deals flyaroundThe money will help the nearly four-year-old Swiggy build out its tech platform, expand its network and cut its delivery times.Behind the dealFood delivery is taking off in emerging markets just as it is in developed ones \u2014 but is focused even more on restaurants that make food explicitly for these services.Naspers Ventures\u2019s chief, Larry Illg, told Michael that lessons from Swiggy\u2019s rise could help it with other investments, like Delivery Hero. \u201cThe players tend not to cross borders, but consumer behavior is the same everywhere,\u201d he said.The tech flyaround\u201cI literally feel like I just scored a decade\u2019s worth of guitar lessons from Elvis,\u201d Jonathan Bush, the company\u2019s founder and C.E.O., told Michael.The big questions\u2022 Is Mr. Immelt, whose successor at G.E. is trying to turn the company around after years of stagnation, the right man to chair Athenahealth?\u2022 Can a company founder take direction from an outsider?Yesterday\u2019s newsletter misspelled the surname of Slack\u2019s C.F.O.

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Spoilers", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationOne fateful summer evening, I hurried home from work, eager to catch up on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d I don\u2019t have cable, so I often watch my shows a day or two after they air, usually via some streaming service or an app. At the time, I had become an obsessive avoider of spoilers, the kind of person who stayed off Instagram and Twitter during live episodes of popular shows, even going so far as to turn off notifications to avoid reading about a reveal or twist that would ruin a surprise.That night, blissfully unaware of what was to come, I switched on my television, expecting to be greeted with the medieval tones and three-dimensional map of Westeros that signal the show\u2019s start. Instead, I was confronted by a massacre: This episode was \u201cThe Rains of Castamere,\u201d popularly known as the Red Wedding. Some friends and I shared an account, so the episode began where the previous person stopped watching, at the precise moment a pregnant character is stabbed in the stomach. I felt as if I had been stabbed in the stomach. I had invested nearly 30 hours into one of the biggest buildups of modern television only to have it \u2014 and my preciousness about spoilers \u2014 ruined.The celebrated film critic Pauline Kael once wrote that movies function as escape pods, portals to parallel universes that can be radically different from emotional norms and societal conditioning of our own. What she meant was they parceled out freedom, allowing viewers to lose their selves in an effort to find greater connection to the self. \u201cA good movie can make you feel alive again, in contact, not just lost in another city,\u201d she wrote in 1969.Since then, movies \u2014 and now, increasingly, television shows \u2014 have become even more intense and immersive, ensuring that we lose ourselves more freely in them. Today\u2019s directors aim for attention totality in order to capture easily distracted audiences. A 2015 study conducted in part by James Cutting, a psychologist at Cornell University who chronicles the evolution of Hollywood cinematography, found that filmmakers have adapted their shooting styles to try to keep up with changes in our attention spans. Since the 1950s, the average shot time has dropped to less than four seconds from 12 seconds. Volume and cadence are manipulated to keep our eyes glued to the screen \u2014 think about the dubstep subwoofer beat drop that happens right before the tidal wave hits, or when a superhero performs an elaborate stunt involving an aerial body roll over a flaming vehicle. In other words, the highs are higher, and the lows are nonexistent.And maybe it works \u2014 for adrenaline junkies. But losing myself in a film almost guarantees an anxiety attack. Most times, at the movies, my stress levels are ratcheted up so high that I can barely sit through the full production without excusing myself, clutching people next to me or crawling out of my seat, incapacitated by the unknown.Yet I love TV and movies, so in order to keep watching, I started spoiling them for myself. Spoilers have become a virtual Xanax, triggering a relaxing sensation that envelops my entire body. For a little while, the world unspooling before my eyes makes complete sense, and I can be assured of no unwelcome surprises. It\u2019s a simulacrum of comfort of my own making, and I indulge in it as much as I can.Luckily, the internet has made my habit easy: Reddit threads prepared me for the nauseating baby-cannibalism moment in \u201cMother!\u201d and helped me stomach the tension building up during \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d A surreptitious Google search during Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s \u201cDetroit\u201d gave me the grit to endure its grim relentlessness. And a handy site called TheMovieSpoiler.com readied me for the excessive bloodiness of \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201dI\u2019m not a total barbarian: I never divulge endings or let on that I know them. There\u2019s even some evidence that the audience\u2019s enjoyment is heightened when they have a sense of what\u2019s going to happen. Once I\u2019m clued in, I can actually let myself be spirited away, as the directors and screenwriters intended, enjoying the things I\u2019m normally too wired to enjoy: the sweeping landscape shots, skillful cinematography, meticulous wardrobe choices. The more films and TV shows I spoil for myself, the more I am convinced that truly interesting stories can\u2019t be ruined \u2014 the plot thickens with the viewing like a rich sauce. I\u2019ve become a much better student of the movies, and a better companion at them.My constitution has been weakened by the current political and ecological climate: It\u2019s less fun to watch a movie about people lost at sea or adrift in space when I\u2019m also genuinely worried about cities struggling to recover from a devastating hurricane, a torrential downpour, a mudslide or raging wildfires. Entertainment isn\u2019t an escape if it\u2019s offering windows into the exact same kind of stress we\u2019re experiencing third hand, around the clock, piped in via social feeds and news alerts. TV shows and movies are a rare form of atemporality, and in an ever-changing, always-on world, spoilers feel irrefutable \u2014 sheer access to them gives the illusion of control.Kael wrote that \u201cwhen we go to the movies, we want something good, something sustained, we don\u2019t want to settle for just a bit of something, because we have other things to do.\u201d This is what entertainment has most to offer.

{"Headline": "Waymo v. Uber Trial Opens With a Battle of Sports Metaphors", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It is not often that a sports metaphor becomes the news of the day in a legal fight over intellectual property theft accusations between two tech industry titans.Waymo contended that Uber had done so by colluding with Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer, to take his former employer\u2019s intellectual property and bring it to the ride-hailing service.In Boston sports vernacular, that sort of cheating is called \u201cpulling a Rosie Ruiz.\u201d It is not a compliment.But in the last few years, competitors have been hiring former Google engineers for their own self-driving-car projects. Among them, Uber is considered formidable because it has billions to spend and can test the technology using its vast ride-sharing network.In an indication of how closely this case is being followed, a line to get into the courtroom at the federal courthouse in San Francisco started forming an hour before the trial was scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m.The witness list includes technology billionaires like Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former chief executive, and Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet. The judge, William Alsup, even said he had been informed that someone was impersonating him on Twitter.Waymo argues that Uber has misappropriated eight trade secrets pertaining mainly to lidar \u2014 an abbreviation for \u201clight detecting and ranging\u201d \u2014 sensors that help the cars navigate on their own. The company is asking for an injunction preventing Uber from developing an autonomous vehicle using its lidar technology. In addition, it wants financial compensation for Uber\u2019s use of the technology.Waymo\u2019s lawyers repeatedly drew a comparison to Ms. Ruiz, one of the most brazen cheaters in sports history. Charles K. Verhoeven, Waymo\u2019s lawyer, said Uber, like the disgraced marathoner, wanted to win no matter what and realized that it couldn\u2019t win playing by the rules.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing this case because Uber is cheating,\u201d said Mr. Verhoeven, who is a partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. \u201cThey took our technology to win at all costs.\u201dHe highlighted internal communications from Uber executives talking about how winning was an imperative and saying that the company needed to find \u201ccheat codes.\u201d The internal messages also noted that the lidar technology being developed by Mr. Levandowski was essential for Uber\u2019s success in self-driving cars and that there was no substitute.In their opening statements, Uber\u2019s lawyers countered that the company had developed its technology on its own and that any similarities were due to the information\u2019s being generally known or easy to figure out for Uber\u2019s engineers. And there is no evidence that any of Google\u2019s technology made its way to Uber, they said.So why, then, has Waymo dragged Uber into court? To kill a competitive threat, said Bill Carmody, Uber\u2019s lawyer.\u201cThat was quite a story, but I\u2019m going to tell you right upfront: It didn\u2019t happen. Period. End of story,\u201d said Mr. Carmody, who is a partner at the law firm Susman Godfrey. \u201cLike most conspiracy theories, it doesn\u2019t make sense when you hear the whole story.\u201dIn Mr. Carmody\u2019s version of events, when Uber hired a team of self-driving engineers in 2015 from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Google\u2019s management became concerned that it would become a footnote in the history of self-driving cars.To emphasize that the files downloaded by Mr. Levandowski before leaving Google were never found at Uber, Mr. Carmody reverted to the Ms. Ruiz comparison: Waymo was actually a race official who looked for evidence of cheating but couldn\u2019t find any.John Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive and the first witness called by the company, said he and Mr. Levandowski had had disagreements about the direction of Google\u2019s self-driving-car project. He said Mr. Levandowski had wanted faster progress even if it came at the expense of safety features.Before his departure from Google, Mr. Levandowski sent an email in January 2016 to Mr. Page, Alphabet\u2019s chief executive, saying the self-driving-car project was \u201cbroken.\u201d He argued for permission to create a rogue team to compete against their co-workers, because the company was moving too slowly.\u201cHe went from someone I called a friend to someone I considered an enemy,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Bitcoin Reveals About Financial Markets", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe spectacular increase and recent plunge in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have raised concerns that the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble will cause financial markets to crash. They probably won\u2019t, but the Bitcoin bubble should finally destroy our faith in the efficiency of markets.Since the 1970s, economic policy has been based on the idea that financial market prices reflect all the information relevant to the value of any asset. If this is true, market prices are the best estimates of the value of any investment and financial markets should be relied on to allocate capital investment.The hypothesis survived the absurdities of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well as the meltdown in derivative markets that led to the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. Although the hypothesis should have been refuted by those disasters, it lived on, if only in zombie form.But at least each of those earlier bubbles began with a plausible premise. The rise of the internet has transformed our lives and given rise to some very profitable companies, such as Amazon and Google. Even though it was obvious that most 1990s dot-coms would fail, it was easy to make a case for any of them individually.As for the derivative assets that gave us the global financial crisis, they were viewed favorably in light of a widely held theory, known as the \u201cgreat moderation,\u201d that suggested that major economic crises were a thing of the past, thanks to certain systemic changes in the way developed nations ran their economies. The theory was backed by leading economists and central bankers. Asset-backed derivatives were, ultimately, a bet on the great moderation.The contrast with Bitcoin is stark. The Bitcoin bubble rests on no plausible premise. When Bitcoin was created about a decade ago, the underlying idea was that it would displace existing currencies for transactions of all kinds. But by the time the Bitcoin bubble took off last year, it was obvious that this would not happen. Only a handful of legitimate merchants ever accepted Bitcoin. And as the Bitcoin bubble drove up transactions charges and waiting times, even this handful walked away.For a while, Bitcoin was used for transactions that people wanted to keep secret from government authorities, like drug deals. It soon became apparent, however, that if authorities wanted to track these transactions, they could. For instance, Silk Road, the first major online drug market, which made use of Bitcoin, was shut down by the F.B.I. in 2013.Hardly anyone now suggests that Bitcoin has value as a currency. Rather, the new claim is that Bitcoin is a \u201cstore of value\u201d and that its price reflects its inherent scarcity. (By design, no more than 21 million Bitcoins can be created.)Most economists, including me, dismiss this claim. And if the claim is false, Bitcoin\u2019s value is obviously another deadly strike against the efficient market hypothesis.Consider: If Bitcoin is a \u201cstore of value,\u201d then asset prices are entirely arbitrary. As the proliferation of cryptocurrencies has shown, nothing is easier than creating a scarce asset. The same argument would apply to any existing financial assets. Any stock in the S & P 500 could be priced not in terms of future earnings prospects but on the basis that people choose to value it highly.Suppose, more plausibly, that Bitcoin has no underlying value and will eventually become worthless. According to the efficient market hypothesis, financial markets will correctly estimate the true value of Bitcoin and will drive the price to zero immediately.But that hasn\u2019t happened either. Until recently, it wasn\u2019t even possible because the Bitcoin markets were themselves as opaque as the currency.Now it is possible: Futures trading for Bitcoin on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has been going on since December. But Bitcoin prices rose after the creation of futures trading and began their sharp decline only when governments took measures to limit speculation.Current futures contracts in Bitcoin extend as far as June of this year. According to those contract prices, the market expects Bitcoin to retain its value well into the future.Whatever happens to Bitcoin, we must not lose sight of a more fundamental \u2014 and more worrisome \u2014 development: A financial product with a purely arbitrary value has been successfully introduced in the world\u2019s most sophisticated financial markets.Bitcoin probably won\u2019t bring financial markets crashing down. But it shows that regulators need to cut those markets down to size.John Quiggin is an economist at the University of Queensland in Australia and the author of \u201cZombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk Among Us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Making of a No. 1 YouTube Conspiracy Video After the Parkland Tragedy", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYouTube\u2019s list of \u201cTrending\u201d videos typically includes funny clips, updates from popular YouTube personalities, movie trailers and viral TV segments. On Wednesday, for a brief time, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube featured David Hogg, a survivor of the massacre last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.The caption claimed, falsely, that Mr. Hogg, 17, was not a student, but an \u201cactor.\u201dThe video, originally posted last August, was a brief local news segment. In it, Mr. Hogg was interviewed by the CBS affiliate in Los Angeles after witnessing a dispute between a lifeguard and a swimmer at Redondo Beach.On Tuesday, a YouTube user who went under the name \u201cmike m.\u201d copied and re-uploaded the video with a new caption: \u201cDAVID HOGG THE ACTOR....\u201dThe reposted video moved its way up the trending list overnight. By Wednesday morning, it had accumulated more than 200,000 views.\u201cI had no idea where all the attention was coming from,\u201d said \u201cmike m.\u201d in an online chat interview with The New York Times. \u201cI just noticed it started to take off.\u201dMany commenters were confused. \u201cWhy is this on trending, especially on news? Nothing special,\u201d wrote one. Others, tipped off by the caption calling Mr. Hogg an actor, knew exactly what they thought they were seeing: \u201cSomeone get this kid an Oscar!\u201d one wrote.By noon on Wednesday, YouTube had pulled the video for violating its policy on harassment and bullying.It was not the first time that YouTube had served not just as a source of fringe conspiracy theories, but as an accomplice in their rapid spread.In the wake of this latest tragedy, which left 17 people dead at the school in Parkland, YouTube still seemed caught by surprise by the rise of another video meant to peddle a baseless theory.\u201cIn 2017, we started rolling out changes to better surface authoritative news sources in search results, particularly around breaking news events,\u201d YouTube, which is owned by Google, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen improvements, but in some circumstances these changes are not working quickly enough. In addition, last year we updated the application of our harassment policy to include hoax videos that target the victims of these tragedies.\u201dUnlike the other unhinged clips that have garnered significant attention on YouTube in the recent past, the video of the Parkland survivor originated with neither a conspiracy-oriented media organization like Infowars nor one of the popular YouTubers who have catered to far-right subcultures and fringe political factions.Instead, it was posted to the infrequently updated account run by \u201cmike m.\u201d Up until the reposting of the video featuring Mr. Hogg, the account had fewer than a dozen videos and fewer than 1,000 followers. Although he declined to provide much information about himself or give his full name, \u201cmike m.\u201d said that he was a 51-year-old man living in Idaho.His uploads included a handful of little-watched videos suggesting he is an avid fan of conspiracies. What inspired him to traffic in an unfounded theory about the Parkland shooting \u2014 aside from \u201chaving more time on my hands these days,\u201d he said \u2014 were posts he had seen on the popular conspiracy site Godlike Productions. He pointed to comments on the site that claimed Mr. Hogg had been \u201ccoached\u201d before giving interviews to members of the media who covered the massacre. It\u2019s also where he found references to the beach video from last August.Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Mr. Hogg addressed the explosion of conspiracy theories head-on. \u201cI\u2019m not a crisis actor,\u201d said Mr. Hogg, who had been visiting family and friends when he appeared in the Los Angeles news segment. \u201cI\u2019m someone who had to witness this and live through this and I continue to be having to do that. I\u2019m not acting on anybody\u2019s behalf.\u201dThe video posted by \u201cmike m.\u201d rapidly gained steam nonetheless.What propelled this one to popularity \u2014 and eventually into YouTube\u2019s promotional apparatus \u2014 came from outside the platform.Links to the video proliferated on 4chan, where users have gleefully embraced the conspiracy theories and mocked the shooting victims. When it hit YouTube\u2019s Trending page, some on 4chan celebrated: \u201cTRENDING IN THE USA,\u201d began one thread in the far-right politics board called /pol/. \u201cWE\u2019RE BREAKING THE CONDITIONING.\u201dThe \u201cmike m.\u201d video also found traction on Twitter, on Facebook and in stories and comment threads on conspiracy sites. It rose in the circuitous and unexpected manner of a viral video, rather than one that had been calculated to game YouTube\u2019s algorithms by seizing on interest in breaking news or tragedy \u2014 it had no catchy headline, no recognizable personality, no vast theorizing. And yet it blasted through YouTube\u2019s safeguards and somehow kept going, exposing the platform as vulnerable to sudden influence from inside and outside its walls.After YouTube removed the video, \u201cmike m.\u201d said his account had received a \u201cstrike\u201d \u2014 that is how YouTube warns users that they have broken the site\u2019s rules or violated its guidelines. (Three strikes and you\u2019re out.) \u201cI mean, why strike me over a beach confrontation video???\u201d he said. A second video he had posted about the shooting was gaining popularity Wednesday morning, he said, until it, too, was deleted, and another strike was added to his account.Anonymous and remorseless, \u201cmike m\u201d was undeterred. \u201cThere is more to this kid than appears on MSM,\u201d he said, using the common shorthand for \u201cmainstream media.\u201d Asked if he would think twice about posting such videos in the future, he said, \u201cNo not at all.\u201dHe said he was worried about his account getting deleted, adding: \u201cBut I am not going to stop.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They hope several hundred students will enroll.The idea is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations \u2014 like autonomous weapons or self-driving cars \u2014 before those products go on sale.\u201cTechnology is not neutral,\u201d said Professor Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. \u201cThe choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications.\u201dBut until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning \u2014 computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Mr. Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-M.I.T. ethics course.\u201cA lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data,\u201d Professor Levy said. \u201cIf data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise.\u201dThe curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data \u2014 like whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records \u2014 to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Mr. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions like: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans?Some universities offer such programs in their information science, law or philosophy departments. At Stanford, the computer science department will offer the new ethics course, tentatively titled \u201cEthics, Public Policy and Computer Science.\u201dThe expectations for the course are running high in part because of Professor Sahami\u2019s popularity on campus. About 1,500 students take his introductory computer science course every year.Advertisement"}

(it\u2019s a small town near the Vermont state line)2. Where and when was your first puzzle published?3. How did you get into puzzling? What is your first memory of solving?My grandfather, who was an immigrant, used to solve crosswords to practice his English. He\u2019d tear a puzzle out of the paper and carry it around in his pocket with a little stub of pencil. He\u2019d ask me for help \u2014 to challenge me \u2014 when I was maybe 9 or 10 years old. Later, a family friend got me a subscription to Games Magazine in the 1980s. I can\u2019t remember ever not solving word puzzles, or not being fascinated by language.4. What made you decide to try your hand at making a crossword puzzle?It also turned out that I shared some close mutual friends with a puzzle editor, Ben Tausig of the American Values Club, and eventually I got up the courage to ask him to mentor me. Since then I\u2019ve also had some opportunities to collaborate, which is a great way to learn (and enormous fun). I\u2019ve been very, very lucky to meet people in the overlapping constructor and solver communities who have been supportive and kind.5. Why do you do this to yourself?6. Do you use a computer software constructing program, and if so, which one? What do you like about it?7. How many hours a week, on average, do you spend on refining your tools, like your word list?I\u2019m pretty new at this business, so I don\u2019t yet have my own carefully curated word list \u2014 a friend kindly gifted me his, so I\u2019m standing on the shoulders of giants in that department. In general, though, it\u2019s hard to quantify. I probably spend a lot of unconscious time processing ideas. I have a Google Doc of notes and themes that is mostly rejects and dead ends. It\u2019s convenient because I can add to it using my phone.8. What entry or entries would you NEVER put in a puzzle, and why? Or, with what entry would you deliberately fail the \u201cbreakfast test,\u201d and why?It\u2019s interesting to me that G-SPOT has appeared in The New York Times puzzle plenty of times, but PAP SMEAR hardly ever. I guarantee that there are many solvers who think about pap smears at breakfast and are not grossed out. Why should the human body offend anyone? And why should we further stigmatize illness or disability by pretending that they\u2019re not appropriate for language games? I\u2019m more offended by N.R.A., which appears constantly in grids, than by sexuality or women\u2019s health or so-called profanity. I think puzzles can also be a space to engage with social and political issues \u2014 recently I put SEXTS in a grid and clued it as an opportunity to open a conversation about consent, instead of as a throwaway joke.9.
