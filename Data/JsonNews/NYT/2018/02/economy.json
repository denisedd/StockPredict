{"Headline": "15 Claims From Donald Trump\u2019s Speech to Conservatives, Fact Checked", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump addressed a range of policy issues, from tax cuts to gun policy to immigration, at Friday\u2019s annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference. Below is a look at some of the facts and figures he cited that were accurate, false or could use some additional context. Also, Mr. Trump is not the first president in 45 years to enact tax cuts. Tax legislation was signed into law by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Further, the cuts passed under Mr. Reagan and Mr. Obama were larger, as a share of the economy, than those recently signed by Mr. Trump. Under the Obama administration, the United States offered to cut emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels, by 2025, as part of the Paris agreement.Mr. Trump is likely referring to the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program to help poorer countries mitigate the effects of climate change.

{"Headline": "Kosovo Finds Little to Celebrate After 10 Years of Independence", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKosovo JournalI have visited Kosovo frequently since arriving for the first time in late 1998 for a two-week trip. I returned in February 1999 and based myself in Pristina, the capital, until 2005. In the years since, I usually visit Kosovo at least once a year, often more.Much has changed for the land and its people. Returning this winter, I was struck by how the relentless optimism of Kosovars had yielded to disillusionment. The people seemed weighed down by resignation, as well as widespread disgust at perceived government corruption.\u201cI swear to God, if it wasn\u2019t for all those who have laid down their lives for this, I would say let\u2019s go back to the way it was before,\u201d one man told me. \u201cWe had a better life then; we had more opportunities.\u201dWhat he says is a veritable heresy in Kosovo, and he did not want his named used for fear of seeming unpatriotic. Fear is still a fact of life for many.Mitrovica remains a largely frozen and divided city. Fear infuses the Serbian part. One resident described the police as being like flowers, for decoration.I had photographed Mr. Ivanovic many times. He once led a feared paramilitary group that guarded bridges over the Ibar River, which divides the Albanian and Serb areas.Mr. Ivanovic later transformed himself into a more pragmatic politician. Before his death, he had accused the local mafia of controlling the city. Many residents believe the mafia work on behalf of the Serbian capital, Belgrade, and speculate that Mitrovica may yet be formally partitioned.In the rest of Kosovo, Albanian and Serb communities cooperate more. But psychic scars are everywhere, even if the landscape has been transformed by gleaming highways, giant gas stations and shopping malls.The road from the border with Albania, which runs through the city of Gjakova and onto Prizren, is itself like a scar, a poignant reminder of wartime massacres.It runs alongside the mountainous border and was used as a crossing point by the Kosovo Liberation Army rebels during the war. The villages bisected by the road suffered greatly.For many years, the site of the massacre near Meja was marked by simple graves, Muslims and Catholics mixed together. Now it appears that a more permanent memorial is being established. Black marble sarcophagi lie in rows 18 deep and up to 25 across.The same road runs to Gjakova, now rebuilt after much of the town was burned down, including its Ottoman-era bazaar. It then passes through Xerxe and Krushe, broken villages where most of the men were executed.In Gjakova, I visited two women, Nusrete Kumnova and Ferdonije Qerkezi. During the war, Ms. Kumnova\u2019s only son was taken and disappeared. Ms. Qerkezi lost her husband and four sons.The remains of two of Ms. Qerkezi\u2019s sons have since been found and buried. Her husband and the other two sons are still missing.For these women, time does not move on. Ms. Qerkezi has turned her home into a museum dedicated to their memory.Upstairs, their rooms are as they left them. Toys, soccer balls and pieces of clothing are carefully wrapped in plastic.In another room, display cases hold the bullet-ridden clothes of the two sons whose bodies she recovered, a terrible reminder of how their lives ended.She dismisses questions of how she feels about Kosovo\u2019s independence anniversary with a simple, \u201cPah, don\u2019t ask!\u201dWhile there is great disappointment with the political and economic situation, there are nonetheless shoots of optimism. Artistically and culturally, Kosovo is booming.Kosovo-born artists like Rita Ora, Dua Lipa and Era Istrefi are regulars on the international music charts. Pristina\u2019s clubs, bars and live music venues \u2014 where there are few ethnic boundaries \u2014 thrive.Petrit Halilaj, a young artist, was awarded a special jury prize at the Venice Biennale last year.Through a strange twist of fate, I photographed him when he was an 11-year-old refugee lined up at a food distribution point in Kukes, Albania. His wartime experiences still infuse much of his work.On my last day in Kosovo, news broke that Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj had been refused a visa to visit Britain. The reaction seemed to be widespread embarrassment, as he had also recently been refused a visa for the United States.Since its independence declaration, Kosovo has been recognized by just 111 of the United Nation\u2019s 193 member states. Crucially, Russia, China, Serbia and five European Union countries do not recognize it.\u201cFor as long as we are stuck in this ghetto, we will have problems,\u201d Arben Berisha, the chairman of the Arsenal supporters club in Kosovo, told me. \u201cWe need our young people to go abroad to study and then bring their expertise back.\u201dDriving toward Macedonia to catch my flight home, I took one of the new highways linking Kosovo to Albania, and I couldn\u2019t help wondering: If the prime minister himself can\u2019t travel, what does it mean for the rest of the Kosovars?Crippled by low wages, unemployment, a stagnant economy and an inability to travel, where were all of these bright, shiny highways leading them?Produced by Gaia TripoliAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Content of the G.O.P.\u2019s Character", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet if you step back a bit and think about it, Trump\u2019s latest outbursts were very much in character \u2014 and I don\u2019t just mean his personal character. When did you last see a member of the Trump administration, or for that matter any prominent Republican, admit error or accept responsibility for problems?Don\u2019t say that it has always been that way, that it\u2019s just the way people are. On the contrary, taking responsibility for your actions \u2014 what my parents called being a mensch \u2014 used to be considered an essential virtue in politicians and adults in general. And in this as in so many things, there\u2019s a huge asymmetry between the parties. Of course not all Democrats are honest and upstanding; but as far as I can tell, there\u2019s almost nobody left in the G.O.P. willing to take responsibility for, well, anything.And I don\u2019t think this is an accident. The sad content of modern Republican character is a symptom of the corruption and hypocrisy that has afflicted half of our body politic \u2014 a sickness of the soul that manifests itself in personal behavior as well as policy.Before I talk about that sickness, consider a few non-Trump examples of the lack of character that pervades this administration.Remember this story the next time someone talks about liberal \u201csnowflakes.\u201dOh, and by the way: Roy Moore still hasn\u2019t conceded.Nor, by the way, are we only talking about politicians. In my neck of the woods, I remain amazed by the unwillingness of right-leaning economists to admit that they were wrong in predicting that the Fed\u2019s efforts to rescue the economy would cause runaway inflation. Being wrong is one thing \u2014 it happens to everyone, myself very much included. Refusing to admit and learn from error is something different.And let\u2019s be clear: Personal responsibility isn\u2019t dead everywhere. You can ask, for example, whether Hillary Clinton apologized sufficiently for her initial support of the Iraq war or her missteps in 2016 \u2014 but she did admit to making mistakes, which nobody on the other side ever seems to do.And the character flaws of the party end up being echoed by the character flaws of its most prominent members. Are they bad people who chose their political affiliation because it fits their proclivities, or potentially good people corrupted by the company they keep? Probably some of both.In any case, let\u2019s be clear: America in 2018 is not a place where we can disagree without being disagreeable, where there are good people and good ideas on both sides, or whatever other bipartisan homily you want to recite. We are, instead, living in a kakistocracy, a nation ruled by the worst, and we need to face up to that unpleasant reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plumbing Problem Shows Powers and Limits of 3 Tax Programs", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI didn\u2019t imagine that doing my taxes would make me grateful for a frozen pipe.That pipe forced a bathroom renovation at our house. No, my wife and I didn\u2019t enjoy the chaos \u2014 a sluggish contractor managed to stretch the repair over nearly six months.But our excruciating plumbing experience was invaluable in showing me the strengths \u2014 and the limitations \u2014 of the leading online tax-return preparation programs.Until I ran into my bathroom dilemma, the online tax-preparation software lulled me into thinking I had a tiny accountant implanted in my computer. But it\u2019s important to remember that the truth is more complicated.The programs make the routine parts of doing your taxes \u2014 entering information and doing calculations \u2014 as easy as filling out an online survey. You just answer the questions posed in the programs\u2019 interviews and type in numbers.But when complexities arise, you can still find yourself fretting over Internal Revenue Service rules, as I did with the broken-pipe home-office deduction. The programs are like a global positioning system app on a smartphone \u2014 helpful but not perfect. Most of the time, the tax programs send you in the right direction, and if you know roughly where you\u2019re headed, you\u2019ll arrive much faster. If not, you can end up wandering hither and yon. And the Internal Revenue Code is scarier than a dark wood when you\u2019re lost in it.I\u2019ve been reviewing tax software since 2010. When I started, TurboTax had the slickest technology, Block gave the best tax guidance and TaxAct was a bargain. These days, TurboTax and Block are mostly interchangeable \u2014 at least they were for my household\u2019s return. They\u2019re easy to use and give access to ample help options. Both also disappointed me in surprising ways this year: A document upload didn\u2019t work with TurboTax, and a Block human helper failed to follow up. More on those problems below.This year, I opted to try TurboTax\u2019s most expensive online offering, TurboTax Live, which was $149.99 for a federal return in mid-February. Prices from each of the providers can change throughout the tax season, and, for many filers, each state return is typically about $37. (All three offer free filing for folks with simpler returns. And some banks and brokerage firms offer credits toward the purchase of the programs.)TurboTax Live gives access to human helpers while you\u2019re working on your return and a review by a tax expert before you file. If you skip the help, TurboTax\u2019s top-shelf online option for my situation is Self Employed, which cost $89.99 in February.Almost as soon as I plunged into my return, TurboTax asked how I was feeling. The options I could click were \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t ask.\u201d I wanted to check \u201cI\u2019m not looking for therapy.\u201d (Note to TurboTax: Better options for next year might be \u201cethical,\u201d \u201cangst-ridden\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve already set up a tax shelter in Panama.\u201d)That was a disappointment, as an upload fills in many of the entries on a return, saving time and toil. The problem might have been me. I\u2019m the sort of simpleton who remains mystified by the controls of our car\u2019s electronic displays, six months after my wife, Mary Ellen, bought it. I only recently figured out how to change the radio station.The next step \u2014 electronic import of wages and investment income \u2014 worked as easily as ever. Mary Ellen\u2019s W-2 data and our investment information flowed right in. Just out of curiosity, I deleted the W-2 and tried to import it via a smartphone photo. That worked, too.I\u2019m self-employed and must file Schedule C, where I tote up my business income and expenses. Entering income is just a matter of typing in the information from 1099 forms. Expenses \u2014 and the deductions they provide \u2014 are where a tax-preparation program really helps.As do Block and TaxAct, TurboTax asks lots of questions about the likely outlays of a wayfarer in the gig economy \u2014 insurance, equipment, supplies, business use of a car and a home office. The program makes clear that, under I.R.S. rules, a home office must be used exclusively for business. But what does that mean for my bathroom?TurboTax pointed out that, if you have a home office, a portion of repair and maintenance expenses can be allocated to it. My office accounts for 7 percent of the square footage of our house, which makes 7 percent of some expenses deductible.That sounded straightforward. But then I started thinking. First, the bathroom isn\u2019t attached to my office. It\u2019s across another room. Second, it\u2019s not just for my business. I don\u2019t turn off the water at the end of the workday. After reading the guidance embedded in TurboTax, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, taxwise, about the frozen-pipe repair.I tried checking the I.R.S. website, but to my untutored eyes, the instructions seemed to have been written in Sanskrit, a language that, sadly, I can\u2019t read. I called TurboTax\u2019s help line and was connected to a person who identified himself as Anthony. (I didn\u2019t say that I was a reporter and didn\u2019t insist on his full name.)I clicked through the rest of the return without trouble. I couldn\u2019t actually file it, but that wasn\u2019t TurboTax\u2019s fault \u2014 Mary Ellen and I hadn\u2019t received all of our tax documents. That also meant that I couldn\u2019t try the expert review. I wondered whether it would be worth the money.\u201cIf folks are rational, only the people with really complicated returns will use this service,\u201d she said.Many people just have wages and some interest and investment income, she said. Because the program can vacuum up much of that information electronically, there\u2019s little need for a backstop.Professor Blouin said she could see two groups \u2014 self-employed people and students \u2014 potentially benefiting from an expert review. They\u2019re eligible for lots of deductions and tax credits, and the rules around those can be confusing, she said. \u201cThe education provisions, especially, can be complicated. There are multiple credits you have to wade through.\u201dFor this year\u2019s tryout, I opted for Block\u2019s online Self-Employed program, which cost $74.99 in February. Block, too, offers tax reviews by its internal gurus. Its Tax Pro Review can be added to any return, with the price rising to $89.99 from $49.99 as returns become more complex. With review, our return would have cost a total of $164.98.A PDF upload of last year\u2019s return worked fine \u2014 which was a relief \u2014 and so did the import of investment information and taking a photo of a W-2.The Schedule C slog was much like the one for TurboTax, a smooth ride until I reached the home office deduction. This time, I opted for help via electronic chat and was connected to Jay. The backing and forthing took longer \u2014 maybe it was the typing. Soon enough, he rendered his verdict: \u201cYou may deduct the repairs to the bathroom which is exclusively used by your home office.\u201dDamn \u2014 that vexing \u201cexclusively\u201d again. I\u2019d probably confused Jay by mentioning that we had more than one bathroom and had renovated another while repairing the broken pipe. Still, he seemed to be suggesting that the repair was deductible only if I barred the bathroom door to everyone but me. Maybe I could install one of those coin-operated locks and increase my business income. But would Mary Ellen approve?Once I completed the return, Block told me I could pick the pro who would review it. I loved that \u2014 it was like merging taxes and Tinder, the dating app. The program offered dozens of photos of tax preparers, beside brief bios.I chose Kenneth Surabian, in nearby Burlington, Mass. Block said he was a \u201cmaster tax advisor\u201d with 36 years of experience and told me to watch my email because \u201cKenneth will contact you today.\u201d I never heard from him. I considered calling the two Block offices listed next to his picture but decided he should be calling me. Plus, I wasn\u2019t yet ready to file. (The company later said Mr. Surabian would have contacted me, had I completed my return.)TaxAct Dashes Deduction DreamTaxAct is the Henry David Thoreau of the online tax-preparation business \u2014 it marches to the beat of its own drummer.It orders its interview differently than the competition, starting with health insurance questions and then asking about tax payments you\u2019ve already made. It also drops in more questions that explicitly mention farming or farm-related businesses, perhaps because its maker is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.Otherwise, it works much as the others do: You chug through an online interview and plug in numbers. TaxAct offers the same timesaving features \u2014 upload of a PDF of a previous-year return and electronic import of wage, bank and investment information. It lets you take pictures of W-2s, too, though I couldn\u2019t manage to snap one with my phone that the program would accept. I tried a couple of times.Mark said the tax agency emphasizes that a home office should be a separate space but the bathroom was part of the rest of the house and not connected directly to the office. He said some expenses, like replacing a roof, can be allocated partly to a home office because they\u2019re not realistically teased apart; not even the I.R.S. expects you to replace the roof over your office separately.I told Mark thanks and hung up, even though he may have flushed my dreams of a deduction down the drain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Game Plan for Democrats (Actually, 16 of Them)", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:\u201cI am not a member of any organized party \u2014 I am a Democrat,\u201d Will Rogers said more than 80 years ago. His words still have a ring of truth. If Democrats are to retake control of one or both houses of Congress (and ultimately the White House), they must work together, even if they do not always agree on particular issues.Democrats can unify on a number of principles: a) We are the party of Main Street, not of Wall Street. b) Honest government is essential. c) Government should promote change to benefit ordinary Americans before the rich. d) A humane immigration policy is right. e) We do not yet have full equality among our citizens, but that is a goal we should pursue.A party expressing such values can appeal to a large majority of our citizens, and speak for them against the forces that have degraded the nation in so many ways.To the Editor:Democrats should fight dirty, play dirty, beg, borrow, steal, do whatever it takes. \u201cWhen they go low, we go high\u201d doesn\u2019t work. Playing nice got us to this point with President Trump. This country may not survive another Republican Congress, so Democrats have to do what it takes.Democrats also need to infuse the party with new blood, especially women and people of color. No more Bernie, Hillary and Biden.Democrats need to be the party of the future. Republicans are the party of rich old white men.Then play dirty, Democrats. Yes, go after Mr. Trump. He is widely despised among everyone I know. Just take our country back.To the Editor:Democrats should focus on the real problem \u2014 congressional Republicans. They are the ones hurting Americans, slyly enacting cruel legislation while the media focuses on the latest outrage by President Trump.So, don\u2019t mention Mr. Trump\u2019s name at all. Instead, show each voter how his very own representative or senator has hurt him personally. Show him the tax \u201ccut\u201d math \u2014 how many taxpayers\u2019 taxes will increase, conveniently only after the midterms. Show him how the vote to repeal Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will increase his premiums.Democrats must constantly press concrete examples of Republican-caused harms, and hammer this message home relentlessly: Your Republican representative in Congress has not, does not and never will help you. He or she does not care about you.MARIE JORDAN, OAK PARK, ILL.To the Editor:The varying Russia scandals are difficult to follow even for well-informed people spending a good deal of their time on the multiple threads. They are confusing and \u2014 for many voters the Democrats need \u2014 beside the point. Let Robert Mueller do his business and support him throughout. Otherwise restrain yourself. There may turn out to be not much there. There certainly aren\u2019t many votes.To the Editor:As a progressive member of the party who has consistently felt dismissed and belittled by mainstream Democrats, I would strongly recommend that they treat the progressives as though we matter, and that our opinions and positions have value. To disregard or ridicule our interests and then to insist that we must vote Democratic is demoralizing. We have enough trouble motivating people to vote without treating them as though their only importance to the party is pulling the Democratic lever.It\u2019s true that both sides of the party need to compromise and work together in order to win, but so far \u201ccompromise\u201d seems to mean \u201cprogressive people, do as you\u2019re told.\u201dT. COLE, BOSTONTo the Editor:I have been a registered Democrat since being able to vote, and I come from a very progressive family. Nonetheless, the Democrats\u2019 persistent pushing of identity politics has made it nearly untenable for me to vote for my party in 2018 \u2014 yes, even in the face of Trumpism. The Democrats need to ease off the \u201ccis white male bashing\u201d and foster a narrative not based on identity politics, lest they lose their centrist base to appease a vocal radical fringe. Continuing doing what the party is currently doing is not convincing any middle-class and poor Rust Belt voters that we are the party that is best for them. We can\u2019t afford another \u201cdeplorables\u201d gaffe in 2018.To the Editor:The Democrats need to focus on a positive, inclusive and simple issue. I would suggest \u201cfairness,\u201d which strongly resonates with most people, including with many Trump voters who constantly complain that the system is rigged. Many people on the right feel that they have been left behind while others (immigrants, minorities, \u201cwelfare queens,\u201d etc.) are cutting the line and unfairly using the government to their advantage. This anger needs to be redirected toward the real source of unfairness: the rich who take advantage of the poor and the middle class. The Democrats should above all explain as clearly as possible the causal link between the Republican tax cuts (very generous to the rich) and the Republican budget (very cruel to the poor and middle class).PATRICK SINGY, NISKAYUNA, N.Y.To the Editor:When I was growing up (I\u2019m 71), the Democratic Party was a bold, brash big tent of diversity representing the working class, bursting at the seams with a plethora of viable and colorful candidates. It was the party that conceived Social Security, Medicare and the Civil Rights Act and was willing to fight for those programs, damn the consequences, because they were right and just. Flash forward to now.The Democratic Party needs to begin by replacing the likes of the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, with new, exciting, dramatic figures. It needs to persuade young Democrats to run for leadership roles and national office. It needs to fully re-establish itself as the party of the working class and the forgotten, willing to pursue its ideals, damn the consequences.GREG JOSEPH, SUN CITY, ARIZ.To the Editor:To prevail in the midterm elections, Democrats need to get practical about border security, prevention of illegal immigration and sensible legal immigration. American citizens and legal immigrants have suffered enough from a lack of all three. The Republicans get this issue. The Democrats do not.The Democrats will have to change their tune on this or they will continue to be in the minority at the national level, even if the Republicans are on the wrong side of almost every other issue.To the Editor:Democrats need to own up to the reality that Donald Trump got elected despite his personal flaws, not because of them. Voters have known since early 2016 that he says mean, ridiculous, asinine things, yet they tolerated him because he spoke about real problems affecting real people. Expressing outrage at his daily transgressions does nothing but remove Democrats from the people they need to win back \u2014 Trump voters who supported Democrats in past elections.KYLE DAVIS, HONOLULUTo the Editor:If the Democrats do not welcome \u201cpro-life\u201d candidates and planks into their party, they are ceding millions of well-educated voters of conscience who see abortion as a primary issue. So many people ignored President Trump\u2019s shortcomings because he said he was anti-abortion, even though most of his life he was pro-choice. The entire Democratic agenda is probably more pro-life than the Republican one because of its emphasis on health care, safety net programs and eradicating poverty. Yet abortion will be the deciding issue for many voters and a test of the inclusiveness needed for Democrats to win.To the Editor:Looking toward the 2018 midterms, Democrats have two clear advantages: a uniquely corrosive president with dismal approval ratings, and the historic trend of midterms swinging toward the opposition party. Offsetting these advantages, however, is the leftward march the party has taken since the Obama years, in which identity politics (transgender bathrooms, protecting illegal immigrants, fighting \u201cwhite privilege\u201d) and welfare-state economics (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren) have come to dominate the party\u2019s message. The result has been a party adored by coastal progressive states, but disconnected from much of the rest of the country. (More than one-third of House Democrats come from just three states: California, New York and Massachusetts.)There is nothing wrong with leading on progressive values, but for Democrats to win nationally they must first win back the country\u2019s moderate center. They can start by repositioning themselves not as the party of post-white America (in a country still over 72 percent white), but of all Americans. And they should certainly never refer to Republican tax plans that allow most Americans to keep more of their own money as \u201cArmageddon\u201d (as did the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi).It is not too late for Democrats to radically alter their appeal to the broader American electorate. If they do, all Americans will benefit from a true national debate over issues and ideas.STUART GOTTLIEB, NEW YORKThe writer, a former Democratic policy adviser and speechwriter in the Senate, teaches international affairs at Columbia.To the Editor:To be successful in November, Democrats need to make clear whom we are fighting for: every person, in every community. The anguish of a mother who lost her son to gun violence in Chicago is not so different from the pain of the father who lost his daughter to opioids in West Virginia. Our dreams are inextricably linked as well. Wherever we come from, we believe that every kid deserves a quality education. We believe that a job is about both financial security and a sense of dignity. We support Dreamers and laid-off coal miners. We demand justice for women, and we demand that our veterans get the mental health treatment they need and deserve. Every person counts. Every community counts.Democrats must fight for them all. Winning that fight is about more than winning elections. It\u2019s about providing opportunities where none seem to exist, and hope in places filled with despair. It\u2019s about summoning the spirit that compelled our party to champion the New Deal, the Great Society and the credo of Yes, We Can. If we find that spirit again, there are no limits on what is possible for our party, and for the future of our country.To the Editor:Democrats must stop playing the victim \u2014 even those who may actually be victims, for we all know how unfair life can be \u2014 and must drop the politically impractical emphasis on identity politics. Democrats must stress policy and politics rather than personalities and prejudice, from the president on down.Democrats must focus on what works for the bottom 90 percent, rather than demonizing the top 10 percent. Most people, wisely or not, believe they can become wealthier. Advocating what works for most people is far more effective than merely blasting the well off.Democrats need to stress the sheer volume of votes needed to overcome gerrymandering, voter suppression and other tools so effectively used by the G.O.P.Most of all, Democrats must appeal to the vast majority of voters who are either center-left or center-right.To the Editor:Dear Democrats:You want our votes? Show us clearly what you would do if you regained the majority in Congress. Prepare a detailed counterprogram for us, as Newt Gingrich did with his Contract With America in 1994.Have a plan for health care like Medicare for all. Specify what you will do to make sure we have clean air and water, worker safety, good transportation and better infrastructure. Craft a fair immigration agenda. Show us a real tax reform that helps the middle class, the motor of our economy. There are so many good ideas: a carbon tax, a financial transaction tax to fund necessary programs. Fight poverty. Address climate change. Help women reach real equality.No slogans \u2014 we want an evidence-based plan. Show that you are different, that you are not for the 1 percent only. Be the populist that President Trump failed to be.To the Editor:President Trump is bold and strong. Democrats, on the other hand, are careful and weak. The Affordable Care Act is a mess. Most people, except the insurance industry and its friends, want Medicare for all. We\u2019re sick of milquetoast Democrats. Support single-payer health care, raising taxes on the rich, taxing Wall Street transactions and making public higher education free. Support labor unions, paid parental leave, the Equal Rights Amendment and renewable energy. Bring the United States into the 21st century!Don\u2019t waste time going after Mr. Trump; everyone knows what he\u2019s about already. Democrats need to be more than the lesser of two evils. Be something we can be proud of, something that will motivate us to get out and vote.Advertisement"}

When he caught fish that are subject to strict catch limits, like gray sole or cod, he would report that his nets were filled with something far more plentiful, like haddock.\u201cWe call them something else, it\u2019s simple,\u201d Mr. Rafael told visitors who seemed interested in buying his business. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it for over 30 years.\u201d He showed off a special ledger labeled \u201ccash.\u201d And he described an under-the-table deal he had going with a New York fish buyer, saying at one point, \u201cYou\u2019ll never find a better laundromat.\u201dBut Mr. Rafael\u2019s visitors turned out to be Internal Revenue Service agents, and the conversations, caught on tape and described in court documents, began the unraveling of Mr. Rafael, whose reign over a segment of this region\u2019s fishing industry gave him his larger-than-life nickname, \u201cthe Codfather.\u201dAs Mr. Rafael sits in prison, having pleaded guilty to lying about his catches and smuggling cash out of the country, nearly two dozen of his boats have been barred from fishing for species like cod and haddock, grinding part of the centuries-old maritime economy in the nation\u2019s most lucrative fishing port to a halt.Fishermen, ice houses and shoreside suppliers who once did business with Mr. Rafael are anxious, as their own businesses have slowed or stopped. Regulators, who oversee a federal system aimed at limiting what the industry fishes for, want more penalties, raising doubts about the future of the port when it comes to groundfish, the bottom-dwelling species like cod that were once the backbone of the fishing industry in New England.\u201cThere are a lot of people on this waterfront, very hardworking people, whose livelihood depends on Carlos\u2019s landings,\u201d said Jon Mitchell, the mayor of New Bedford. \u201cThey don\u2019t deserve to suffer along with him.\u201dTony Fernandes, a captain on one of Mr. Rafael\u2019s boats, said he was collecting unemployment benefits and waiting to learn when he may be able to fish again. \u201cHe\u2019s putting in his time and he paid his fine,\u201d he said of Mr. Rafael. \u201cWe are in limbo.\u201dBut Mr. Rafael also served as a dealer for the seafood that came off his boats, which prosecutors say made it easier for him to lie about what he was catching and how much he was getting for it.\u201cCarlos Rafael has been well known in the commercial fishing industry for 30 years,\u201d said Andrew Lelling, the United States attorney for Massachusetts, who prosecuted the case. \u201cAnd, for almost as long, federal law enforcement has heard rumors and concerns about Rafael acting illegally.\u201dSome people in New Bedford saw Mr. Rafael far differently \u2014 as a Robin Hood of sorts, with a pack of cigarettes and a dinged-up Silverado. He was a Portuguese immigrant who had started out cutting fish and eventually provided jobs for many people along a waterfront that has been bustling since Herman Melville immortalized its cobblestone streets and whaling ships in \u201cMoby Dick.\u201dHe saw an opportunity eight years ago when the government moved forward with a new regulatory system in New England, after Congress mandated that science-based limits be used to prevent overfishing. The cod catch, long a staple of New England\u2019s economy, had fallen over the years.Instead of the former approach of limiting how many days boats could spend at sea, the new regulations by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration set specific ceilings on how many fish could be caught. The rules instantly were contentious, especially when regulators set low limits for dwindling species like cod to help them rebound.Fishing allocations were divided among 19 regional \u201csectors\u201d of fishing boats in the Northeast, and boat owners were granted permits based on their fishing history \u2014 so those with the most boats seemed primed to win out.\u201cWe were saying, catch shares are going to lead to consolidation, catch shares are going to lead to integration, catch shares are going to lead to corruption,\u201d said Scott Lang, a former mayor of New Bedford.Mr. Rafael came to control most of the permits for groundfish in his sector, but by 2015, he was pondering selling his business. His asking price: $175 million.So when the I.R.S. agents \u2014 who posed as Russian mobsters interested in buying Mr. Rafael\u2019s business \u2014 came along, Mr. Rafael was quick to talk to them.Explaining why his business was worth even more than it might appear to on paper, Mr. Rafael laid out all that he had done to misreport what fish he was catching. At points, he seemed to worry that he might be getting set up. \u201cYou could be the I.R.S. in here,\u201d Mr. Rafael said in one recorded conversation, though he swiftly dismissed the idea, noting that he didn\u2019t think the I.R.S. employed Russians. \u201cThat would be some bad luck!\u201dLast year, in a case that married international financial crime with flaky fish fillets, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy, tax evasion, bulk cash smuggling, false labeling and falsifying records. In September, he was sentenced to about four years in prison as he stood before a courtroom packed with fishermen who had worked for him.\u201cI did it because I wanted to make sure my people kept getting a paycheck,\u201d Mr. Rafael wrote in a statement read by his lawyer. \u201cThe waterfront is a hard world we work in.\u201dThe judge, William Young, of the Massachusetts U.S. District Court, seemed unmoved. \u201cThis was not stupid,\u201d the judge said, \u201cthis was corrupt.\u201dMr. Rafael\u2019s lawyer, William Kettlewell, did not respond to messages seeking comment.Mr. Rafael\u2019s punishment was cheered by environmentalists, regulators, and fishermen up and down the coast who saw him as having muscled out smaller boats and having marred the whole region. The case also raised questions about the effectiveness of a regulatory system that allowed one man to become so dominant and to skirt the rules for so long.\u201cHe\u2019s the biggest player in the most high-profile fishery in New England,\u201d said Peter Baker, with the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s ocean conservation effort. \u201cThey should have been able to detect what he was doing long before they did.\u201dJohn Bullard, who was NOAA\u2019s northeast regional administrator until the end of January, said the regulatory system had worked well elsewhere. He said he had banned ground fishing in Mr. Rafael\u2019s sector through at least the beginning of the next fishing season in May because the industry there had failed to accurately report its catches and stay within fishing limits. \u201cThey have a very basic job to do, to count fish, and they didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Mr. Bullard, who is also a former mayor of New Bedford.The future of Mr. Rafael\u2019s empire is a matter of intense debate. Federal authorities have seized some of his boats and fishing permits, and they are seeking to revoke more permits in a civil action that also asserts misreporting in Mr. Rafael\u2019s scallop fleet.Fishermen in other ports hope Mr. Rafael\u2019s permits will be transferred to their areas, while fishermen in New Bedford are fighting to keep them local. Some boat captains worry that they may face scrutiny, even though they say they had no part in Mr. Rafael\u2019s crimes.(Mr. Rafael told the undercover agents that the captains knew of his schemes; Mr. Lelling, the prosecutor, said a decision was made to go after Mr. Rafael, and not the fishermen working for him.)Some of the piers in New Bedford have settled into an icy unease as the industry sputters forward without Mr. Rafael.As fog shrouded the port and a single seal bobbed in the harbor on a recent morning, Ian Saunders unloaded redfish from one of the few boats active at this hour. \u201cThis is my first boat this week,\u201d Mr. Saunders said.The owners of shoreside businesses spoke of heavy losses.\u201cI go home, I can\u2019t sleep,\u201d said Anne Jardin-Maynard, the owner of a settlement house, which handles payroll and accounting for fishing boats, including Mr. Rafael\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s the ice plants, the fuel companies, the gear places \u2014 everybody\u2019s affected by this.\u201dPorfirio Caneira, 60, the first mate on the Green Acres, one of Mr. Rafael\u2019s idled, tied-up vessels, looked out at the pier and recalled the scene from an earlier time: welders, painters, workers, all scurrying around on these boats.\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t see anybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The WeWork Manifesto: First, Office Space. Next, the World.", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "The brash, ambitious founders of WeWork, a global network of shared office spaces, want nothing less than to transform the way we work, live and play.Supported byOn a cold February morning at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the skeleton of a modern 15-story building was rising from a muddy construction site along the East River. As long and as tall as a cruise ship, the sleek glass structure loomed above rusty, century-old dry docks, serving notice to the industrial neighborhood that the new economy was coming.When Dock 72 is completed this year, if the aggressive timeline holds, it will represent the fullest expression of Mr. Neumann\u2019s expansive vision to date. There will be an enormous co-working space, a luxury spa and large offices, for other companies like IBM and Verizon, that are designed and run by WeWork. There will be a juice bar, a real bar, a gym with a boxing studio, an outdoor basketball court and panoramic vistas of Manhattan. There will be restaurants and maybe even dry cleaning services and a barbershop.It will be the kind of place you never have to leave until you need to go to sleep \u2014 and if Mr. Neumann has his way, you\u2019ll sleep at one of the apartments he is renting nearby.It\u2019s an all-encompassing sort of ambition, and Mr. Neumann is the brash and idealistic pitchman. Simply by encouraging strangers to share a beer at the office, he argues, WeWork can heal our fractured society.\u201cHow do you change the world?\u201d Mr. Neumann asked in a recent interview. \u201cBring people together. Where is the easiest big place to bring people together? In the work environment.\u201dIt may sound simplistic, but around the globe, companies are buying whatever it is that Mr. Neumann and his co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, are selling. WeWork has rapidly expanded to 20 countries, assembled a formidable executive team and attracted some 200,000 members. Big companies like JPMorgan Chase and Siemens are signing on as tenants, and revenues are growing fast, expected to top $2.3 billion this year.A company ostensibly about co-working now employs yoga instructors, architects, teachers, environmental scientists, software engineers, molecular biologists and social psychologists.Is it all a bit much for a young company still trying to build out its core business? \u201cI\u2019ve made that argument,\u201d said Bruce Dunlevie, a WeWork board member and partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. But, he said, \u201cgreat entrepreneurs like Adam don\u2019t listen to guys like me.\u201dAs WeWork expands in all directions, it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model. Critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage \u2014 leasing a space, spiffing it up, then subleasing it out to other tenants. The company owns hardly any properties, giving it precious few hard assets. Its growth projections strike many as unattainable, and it has missed expectations before. A number of upstarts loom as potential competitors, seeking to replicate WeWork\u2019s success. And many WeWork tenants are unproven start-ups that could quickly fold.IWG, a publicly traded co-working company that has more members and more real estate than WeWork, is valued at just $2 billion. Yet Mr. Neumann has convinced investors that WeWork is worth 10 times that figure.\u201cAdam\u2019s explanation for the valuation of WeWork speaks for itself,\u201d said Chris Kelly, co-founder and president of Convene, a company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms. \u201cThis is not an Excel spreadsheet calculation. He believes there\u2019s an energy behind the brand, and he\u2019s gotten people to invest at that valuation. He has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms.\u201dIndeed, to assess WeWork by conventional metrics is to miss the point, according to Mr. Neumann. WeWork isn\u2019t really a real estate company. It\u2019s a state of consciousness, he argues, a generation of interconnected emotionally intelligent entrepreneurs. And Mr. Neumann, with his combination of inspiration and chutzpah, wants to transform not just the way we work and live, but the very world we live in.It\u2019s an audacious, perhaps delusional plan for a company that made its mark by building communal desks and providing refreshments. And so far, it seems to be working.Mr. Son, WeWork\u2019s largest investor, is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come, making his multibillion-dollar investment a veritable bargain.The notion that white-collar workers might actually like their offices is a relatively new one. From the countinghouses of industrial England to the skyscrapers of 1980s Manhattan, offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space, often with row upon row of unglamorous desks.\u201cThe only kind of model that anyone had for laying out a large workplace was a factory,\u201d said Nikil Saval, author of \u201cCubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.\u201d \u201cSo the office was made to resemble an assembly line.\u201dThis dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest, at least for some, during the dot-com bubble. Tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and Ping-Pong tables, making work spaces less formal. Free food became commonplace.Raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream, and today, more and more employees \u2014 especially millennials \u2014 expect enlightened, unconventional offices.Enter WeWork. With people bouncing between employers, jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely, the demand for co-working was suddenly real, and ready to be monetized. Mr. Neumann, who grew up on a kibbutz in Israel, had an epiphany: Bring the communal vibe to the office.Soon he and a friend \u2014 Mr. McKelvey, an equally tall Oregonian who grew up on a collective and was working as an architect \u2014 founded an eco-friendly co-working space in Brooklyn. They sold it, but they quickly turned around and started WeWork in 2010.\u201cMe and Miguel have this common ground,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cWe both grew up in very close communities.\u201dWeWork didn\u2019t invent co-working spaces, of course. IWG, better known as Regus, has been around for decades. But Mr. Neumann and Mr. McKelvey quickly hit upon a recipe that drew throngs of start-ups: an industrial chic aesthetic, some big common areas with comfy couches, free beer and piped-in pop music.Individuals pay as little as $45 a month for occasional access to a desk in a common area. Start-ups can pay a few thousand dollars for a private room on a month-to-month basis, and some big companies pay millions of dollars a year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations.It\u2019s a formula that has caught on from New York to Tel Aviv to Shanghai. In New York alone, WeWork has 49 spaces, most of them nearly full. At the WeWork in Harlem, dance companies share space with hair care start-ups in a common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians. At a WeWork in TriBeCa, fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in a spartan space decorated with neon lighting.For WeWork to really succeed in changing the way we all work, it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees. The strategy is an odd reversal for WeWork, which made its name catering to freelancers and start-ups.The Weather Channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous WeWork in Midtown Manhattan. Barbara Bekkedahl, who runs the group, said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish.But Ms. Bekkedahl had a complaint, too, one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space. She suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lacking.\u201cAs a TV sales team, we groom and dress for outside sales,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the techie and start-up types housed at WeWork aren\u2019t facing customers all day, so don\u2019t always have the same standards.\u201dGripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down WeWork\u2019s business with corporate clients, especially if Mr. Neumann makes good on his promise to save them money. Because WeWork is building out so much space and buying so much furniture, Mr. Neumann says, he can renovate and operate an office for a fraction of the cost that companies would normally spend.\u201cWe have economies of scale,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll cut your operational costs between 20 to 50 percent.\u201dIt might seem like another instance of Mr. Neumann\u2019s talking a big game but for the fact that more and more companies \u2014 GE, HSBC, Salesforce and Microsoft among them \u2014 are signing on.For years now, big companies have outsourced payroll processing, janitorial services and security. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to a company like WeWork.\u201cWe only have 200,000 members,\u201d Mr. McKelvey, 43, said. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. We need to have two million and then 20 million.\u201dBankers and lawyers poured out of skyscrapers and made for the suburbs on a recent Monday night in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. But at 110 Wall Street, a building controlled entirely by WeWork, the party was just getting started.Last year, this 1960s-era office tower was converted into a mixed-use development of Mr. Neumann\u2019s design. There is a co-working space. On the ground floor are trendy restaurants including Westville, Fuku, Momofuku Milk Bar and a bar called the Mail Room.And then there is a WeLive: a complex of about 200 fully furnished apartments rented out on a short-term basis. Tenants get the signature WeWork aesthetic of unpolished wood and wrought iron, as well as various perks. There are hot tubs on the terrace. There are arcade games and a pool table in the laundry room. There are a chef\u2019s kitchen and a communal dining room. At a bar on a residential floor, a happy hour was brewing and free Tempranillo was flowing.The brothers are all in: They live in WeLive, work in the adjacent WeWork space and exercise at WeWork\u2019s nearby gym, Rise.\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d Jake DeCicco said. \u201cYou just roll out of bed, go down the elevator and get to work.\u201dHad Mr. Neumann been there to share a beer, those words would have been music to his ears. He believes that creating a work and living environment where people mingle is in fact a world-changing innovation. Each WeWork has a \u201ccommunity manager\u201d who keeps tabs on members, makes introductions and organizes social activities.If more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water, the thinking goes, they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another\u2019s socially responsible start-ups, and then the world will be a better place.\u201cOnce you choose to enter a WeWork, you choose to be part of something more \u2018we\u2019 than \u2018me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cPeople start coming together. They\u2019ll see each other in the elevator, they talk in the stairways. There\u2019s a thousand other things they do.\u201dElevators. Stairways. Hardly world-changing innovations. But WeWork takes extra steps to encourage fraternization. Like beer kegs that never run dry.More than most companies, WeWork promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue. Posters on the wall encourage people to have a drink. There are wine tastings at WeLive. Company parties feature top-shelf liquor. Mr. Neumann has a well-known penchant for tequila, and a well-stocked bar is prominent in his office.On a recent Tuesday at 4:07 p.m., the community manager of a WeWork in Midtown Manhattan sent an email reading: \u201cIt\u2019s time to get your creative juices flowing! Join us on the 5th floor to drink some wine & paint a beautiful picture.\u201d Just after noon on Valentine\u2019s Day, there was an invitation to share wine and cake in the common area.But so far nothing \u2014 not alcohol, labor disputes, questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity \u2014 has managed to alter the company\u2019s trajectory.\u201cWe\u2019re a disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on a day-to-day basis,\u201d said Mr. Dunlevie of Benchmark. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenon.\u201dIn September, WeWork will open its most ambitious project to date: a kindergarten. It may also be the effort that tests whether WeWork is flying too close to the sun.The creation of Mr. Neumann\u2019s wife, Rebekah, 39, the school is known as WeGrow. When it opens, it promises a well-designed space with a curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for 3-year-olds on up.WeGrow fits neatly into Mr. Neumann\u2019s expansive vision for creating a generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs. But the risk-reward calculus is different when starting a school.WeGrow won\u2019t scale as rapidly as WeWork has, so the financial upside is limited. Yet should something go wrong, the fallout could be devastating: It\u2019s one thing to be responsible for the internet going out or paper running low at the communal printer. It\u2019s another thing to take responsibility for the health and development of someone\u2019s child.\u201cWe all understand how complicated and regulated school is compared to the simpler business that we are already in,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cBut we decided we\u2019re going to go into education. If you really want to change the world, change kids when they\u2019re 2.\u201dAs he proselytized, Mr. Neumann was sitting on an enormous leather couch in his Chelsea office, which is bigger than many New York City apartments. It included a conference table, a video conferencing setup, several desks, a bar, spreads of food, a Peloton exercise bike, a climbing machine, a boxing bag hanging from the ceiling, a gong, an antechamber where assistants work and a private bathroom.\u201cIt\u2019s going to work,\u201d Mr. Neumann continued. \u201cIs it going to be perfect? Definitely not. Are we going to make mistakes? A hundred percent. Are we going to be comfortable admitting those mistakes? Definitely. It\u2019s what we do here.\u201dThough such unbridled zeal can be abrasive to some, it could also be viewed as the mark of a peripatetic savant. Walter Isaacson, the biographer of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo da Vinci, counts Mr. Neumann as a friend, and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed.It can be tempting to dismiss WeWork as just another overvalued start-up that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na\u00efve investors. With little more than faddish interior design, free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers, Mr. Neumann claims to have conjured up a whole new paradigm for white-collar workers \u2014 and for education \u2014 and vows that it can change the world.It\u2019s the kind of utopian prattle that can come off as dangerously out of touch at a moment when a backlash against big tech is brewing. But if any of these potential pitfalls concern Mr. Neumann, he doesn\u2019t show it.On this, the first night of festivities, Mr. Neumann would oversee a \u201cShark Tank\u201d-like competition for socially responsible small businesses \u2014 ranging from a start-up that made customized prosthetics to a food-delivery service staffed by refugees \u2014 each vying for a $1 million prize.Earlier, Mr. Neumann had rattled off the company\u2019s achievements and outlined some of its more outsize ambitions. As the evening\u2019s performer, the Grammy-winning rapper Macklemore, waited backstage, Mr. Neumann went on an impromptu riff about how people should \u201cmake a life, not just a living,\u201d the company\u2019s aspirational motto.Mr. Neumann also stated that it was important to support social entrepreneurs. \u201cOf course that makes a lot of sense, but who\u2019s going to pay for that?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018Well, Masa might!\u2019\u201dThe line generated a laugh among the hundreds of knowing employees in the room \u2014 Mr. Son, whose nickname is Masa, was conveniently absent \u2014 but it was a tell from Mr. Neumann, a sly admission that at this point he is playing with house money.Confetti fell from the rafters. The winners cried on stage. Mr. Neumann took it all in, beaming.Even Macklemore was taken aback by all the money flying around. \u201cI was just watching it, chugging a Red Bull,\u201d he said shortly into his set, \u201cand I immediately thought, \u2018Damn, I should have got into technology.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When You\u2019re a \u2018Digital Nomad,\u2019 the World Is Your Office", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "FeatureA global network of live-work spaces is springing up to serve this new breed of millennial wanderer.Supported byAt the time of the inn\u2019s construction, the surrounding area was known as Riverside; like the rest of the city, it became a hotbed of real estate speculation over the coming decades. As a new residential neighborhood grew around it, the inn remained a holdout from another era. In the \u201980s, its rent was $100 a week, and the buildings were crumbling. Then, in 1990, a preservationist bought the property and turned it into a bed-and-breakfast, and in 2015, it was flipped again to a hip hotel group. Two years ago, the buildings were leased by a start-up that intended to return them to their original use, housing itinerant workers \u2014 albeit a very different kind.That company is called Roam, and since its founding in 2015, it has constructed an international housing network for so-called digital nomads, a growing demographic of people who travel the world while working remotely over the internet. Roam operates complexes of furnished, single-occupancy residences in four cities (Miami, Tokyo, London and Ubud, in Bali), with three more on the way (in New York, Berlin and San Francisco). The idea is that you never have to leave the system: Roam is everywhere you want to be. Residents pay rent starting at $500 a week to comfortably live and work, two activities that quickly become indistinguishable within Roam\u2019s confines.More than a mere chain of upscale hostels, Roam signals the crystallization of a moment long in the making. Telecommuting has been feasible since the days of dial-up, but the early digital nomads were pioneers, planning solo trips around the world, seeking out spare rooms and spotty connections in the name of escaping drudgery back home. Roam aims to make dislocation easy and glamorous, transforming digital nomadism into a mainstream, off-the-rack proposition. To date, Roam has hosted more than 2,200 members, a wandering group of entrepreneurs, programmers, freelancers, retirees and tourists who call themselves \u201cRoamies\u201d the way stationary types might namedrop their hometowns.In October, I went to Miami to try out the Roam brand of nomadism for a week. My Uber from the airport passed through the city sprawl at dusk and deposited me outside the Miami River Inn gate. I punched in the key code I had received by email and swung open the heavy door. Inside, cutesy chalkboard signs pointed the way to Roam\u2019s communal kitchen and its co-working space, while warning nonmembers to stay out. In the courtyard, canvas shades were stretched among palm trees, sheltering clusters of wire chairs; a shipping container had been turned into an open-air bar with outdoor couches. I wandered, slightly lost, around the compound until I found Luisa Paganini, Roam\u2019s young head of customer operations and the acting community manager in Miami. She handed me keys for a room on the second floor of the yellow house.I opened the door onto a bedroom with an attached bathroom and enclosed porch, sparsely furnished with all-white side tables, dresser and bed, but no desk or television. The room\u2019s white walls lacked even the desultory kitsch of hotel art, which I never thought I would miss until it was gone. My suitcase was the only sign of human life. I didn\u2019t feel haunted; I felt like the ghost.Though he doesn\u2019t look the part, Haid spent much of his life in the hospitality business. He grew up at his family\u2019s small inn in Obergurgl, a tiny Alpine village in Austria with 5,000 inhabitants in the winter and only a handful in the summer. He spent most of his time alone in nature, escaping from the inn\u2019s tight communal quarters. \u201cOur living room was literally the guest room,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t have his own bedroom, forcing an early adjustment to sharing space, something he hated as a boy.Yet the flow of tourists through Obergurgl gave Haid a hint of the wider world, which he escaped into as soon as he was able. He learned computer programming from print magazines and eventually, in 2005, founded a start-up that built custom search engines. By 2011, it had been folded into another company and then closed, leaving Haid, at 33, successful but directionless. He bummed around London and San Francisco for a while, using up accumulated airline points, staying with friends and feeling as if he had missed out on his youth.As Haid was becoming more itinerant, the \u201cdigital nomad\u201d lifestyle was emerging from the intoxicating ether of techno-utopianism into the real world. The term\u2019s commonly cited origin is a 1997 book, \u201cDigital Nomad,\u201d by Tsugio Makimoto, a Japanese semiconductor scientist, and David Manners, a British journalist. The book presciently predicts that advances in communication technology \u201cwill make us geographically independent of our homes and offices,\u201d leading to \u201ccerebral nomadism\u201d \u2014 we will travel the world hunting down information and relationships, much as our ancestors stalked the plains for prey.It wasn\u2019t until around 2007 that a coterie of bloggers began promoting the lifestyle and its possibilities. The trend lashed together backpacker culture, monetized web presences and the happiness-optimization schemes of Timothy Ferriss, whose influential book \u201cThe 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich\u201d was published that year. One early advocate was Tynan Smith, a former professional gambler and pickup artist \u2014 he appears in Neil Strauss\u2019s \u201cThe Game\u201d under the pseudonym Herbal \u2014 turned blogger, who decided to go nomadic in early 2008. Traveling the globe became a way for Smith to regulate his cost of living according to how much his various online hustles brought in, a strategy that Ferriss called \u201cgeoarbitrage.\u201d If you\u2019re scraping together $1,000 a month, the logic goes, the money will go further in Thailand than in New York.With the rise of smartphones, roaming data plans and cheaper air travel, this strategy has proved popular. Nomad hubs have been cropping up anywhere a low cost of living intersects with a high quality of life, most often in Southeast Asia: Chiang Mai, Bangkok, Ubud and Ho Chi Minh City have all become popular destinations on the circuit, as have cheap European cities like Lisbon and Madrid. During his initial travels, he says, Smith mostly encountered backpackers running down their savings, but subsequent generations of nomads emerged: first, marketing consultants often banking on sketchy S.E.O. schemes; next, freelance writers and programmers. Lately, Smith says, he increasingly encounters full-time employees whose bosses allow them to travel and work remotely.While living part time in a Mission District warehouse commune that he helped establish, Haid came upon the thriving Bali nomad scene during a prolonged stay in Ubud in late 2014. With the nearby tropical beaches, convenient co-working spaces and attractive nomadic crowd, \u201clife was really, really good,\u201d he told me, his voice tinged with more than a hint of nostalgia. \u201cI experienced firsthand that you can be just as productive in this beautiful, nice environment where you can have perfect $9 massages each day and amazing coffee.\u201d A start-up, Haid reasoned, could offer the same experience to anyone with enough money and an appropriate passport. At first he called the business Caravanserai, the word for Silk Road merchant hostels, but he simplified it after getting too many blank stares.Haid sought investors in 2015, when you could still practically stumble into venture capital, especially with a pitch that went something like \u201cUber for international housing.\u201d He brought on two co-founders, Dane Andrews and Flo Lauber, and raised $3.4 million to open Roam\u2019s first spaces, at the Miami compound and a converted boutique hotel in Ubud, which features a polished-cement communal kitchen and a courtyard pool. Roam Tokyo is in Akasaka, with blindingly minimalist rooms and a vintage-furnished communal kitchen. The London location is a plush Victorian in the upscale Chelsea neighborhood, attracting human rights lawyers commuting to The Hague as well as start-up developers.Roam has evolved into a miniature global corporation, with a dozen staff members, most of them digital nomads themselves, living among its locations, communicating through the chat platform Slack, checking in over weekly conference calls and scanning any print mail that comes in for online dispersal. Roam has no offices and no headquarters except its locations. For its clients and employees alike, the start-up provides a comprehensive structure for a post-place life.My conversations with Haid wandered from mundane details of hospitality design \u2014 choosing the right industrial fixtures in the kitchen, for heavy use \u2014 to the philosophical roots of nomadism. A surprising thing about Haid is the range of leftist flourishes he adds to any discussion, referencing everything from radical economists and the British filmmaker Adam Curtis to Verso Books and the state of \u201clate capitalism.\u201d In his mouth, they seemed less a coherent politics than a business plan, a means of predicting and profiting from the incipient future. Traditional careers began disintegrating after the financial crisis, Haid theorized, and soon advances in A.I. and robotics will cause further disruption. \u201cThere is not necessarily work there for everyone,\u201d he said. If jobs are no longer static or stable, then the notion of a permanent home must also be rethought. Nomadism, Haid argued, allows the discontented or disenfranchised to design new, sustainable lifestyles in the global marketplace. It\u2019s a means of letting human capital find the path of least resistance, wherever it may be.There is a vicious plausibility to Haid\u2019s vision. The macroeconomic pressures he describes in the urbanized West \u2014 a lack of affordable housing and linear careers \u2014 are particularly tough on millennials, who are also, incidentally or not, a historically unattached generation, with low rates of marriage, homeownership and childbearing. If the usual trappings of adulthood don\u2019t seem attainable, and a permanent sense of precariousness seems unavoidable, why not embrace impermanence instead? Already there are partial nomads all around you; you just might not think of them that way yet. There\u2019s the writer who spends a few months of every year in Berlin, making up for diminishing freelance wages with cheap Neuk\u00f6lln rent; the curator bouncing between New York and Los Angeles; the artist jumping from Tokyo residency to Istanbul fellowship. In the competitive freelance economy, geographic mobility has become a superficial sign of both success and creative freedom: the ability to do anything, anywhere, at any time.Those in less artsy careers who chase that same sort of freedom may find it illusory. The new technologies that have liberated us from place have also made employers more comfortable with remote workers, but only because we can be so easily monitored. Combine this interconnectivity with an increasing population of freelancers \u2014 over a third of the American work force makes money in the so-called gig economy \u2014 and you have the makings of a nomad boom. Haid estimates his target customer base to be around 1.2 million people who make over $80,000 a year and could live anywhere. Pieter Levels, creator of the social network Nomad List, believes there to be a nomad population in the high hundreds of thousands.Haid claims that Roam is already profitable. In crowded cities, it\u2019s not hard to keep rooms occupied \u2014 empty spaces are also listed on Airbnb \u2014 and the company has a clever business model that limits its risk: Property developers work with Roam to format and furnish buildings, then Roam leases and operates them, much as a hotel does. (The Miami compound is on a five-year lease.) Roam\u2019s largest cost is scouting new locations, which can be difficult. The company started Roam Madrid in a former convent, but it closed it after finding the conditions too austere even for nomads.The major selling point of Roam is its community, in which no one is supposed to feel strange or isolated, as Haid once did, for leading an itinerant life. The Miami crowd, I found, was surprisingly diverse in age and race. (Like the tech industry that the nomad scene came from, its adherents skew young, white, Western and male.) Over the week, I hung out with South American software developers, two coupled entrepreneurs from Switzerland, a middle-aged American contractor who works for I.B.M. on international events, an Israeli machine-learning expert and a 75-year-old retired real estate agent, Lino Darchun, who seemed to recognize in Roam an opportunity to counteract loneliness. \u201cMy wife passed away,\u201d he told me. \u201cI wanted to just make a lifestyle change.\u201d He went on: \u201cI can afford something pricier than Roam, but I had such a good time here.\u201d And the community did seem like a better place than most to redefine yourself. Another Roamie, a 48-year-old named Stacie Harrison, was also grieving. She lost her boyfriend, a pilot, to a plane crash in 2016 and moved to Roam Miami from Phoenix, her hometown.Daily routines around the compound varied in proportions of work and socializing. The Israeli, Uri Wolfovitz, commuted to a nearby WeWork to collaborate with his start-up co-founder, who actually lived in Miami. Wolfovitz had no long-term plans to stay, because, as he explained, the start-up would thrive or die within a year. Miami is decidedly second-rate as a tech hub, so he was stuck in a limbo that made Roam useful, if not ideal. \u201cIt\u2019s no place to start a company,\u201d he told me with characteristic bluntness in the kitchen one afternoon. \u201cThis city is [expletive].\u201dAt Roam, I found an instant routine, with morning yoga classes on the lawn in the company of a stray black cat (\u201cRoamy\u201d), nightly beers at the outdoor picnic table and a weekly email newsletter listing special events and new-member introductions (\u201cBrent and Michael, married for 25 years, sold their home in Seattle last year and are now planning several years of travel\u201d). On Wednesdays, there\u2019s a \u201cfamily dinner.\u201d For the one I attended, Hanna Boethius, half of the couple from Switzerland and a freelance nutritionist, led the charge with a low-carb, gluten-free meal of sous-vide steak, raw broccoli salad and vegetable lasagna without noodles.As Hanna and her husband, Sebastian, founder of a remote software agency, hustled about the kitchen, I perched in the corner with Harrison, whose enthusiasm never flagged. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hybrid between a summer camp for adults and a reality-TV show without the cameras,\u201d she cheerfully warned me about life at the compound. At Roam, she was working on a website that helps users posthumously distribute their digital documents; progress on the site seemed slow, and when I inquired, she blamed the developer she contracted \u2014 who was also remote. More than the younger members, Harrison seemed to struggle with the consequences of her newly unbounded lifestyle. \u201cI feel like all of my old belief systems say I should get a job and find a regular apartment, and my new, emerging belief systems are saying maybe there\u2019s another way,\u201d she told me as she showed me around her sunny, spotless room later in the week. \u201cI needed a fresh start. I\u2019m all about doing what makes me happy \u2014 I just want to be by the beach.\u201dThe environment encouraged a fast, confessional intimacy. Remote freelance work was one of the few things we all had in common, and so it was a constant topic of discussion: how to stay motivated, entrepreneurial, sane. Sebastian tried to sell me, to no avail, on the benefits of \u201cketo-clarity,\u201d or the enlightened mental state that comes from a low-carb, high-fat diet.Sometimes Roam felt more like immersive group therapy than tourism, because I wasn\u2019t leaving the compound that much anyway. I didn\u2019t have a rental car, and dense Miami traffic made even Uber a hassle. One evening, Marco Andrade, a young Brazilian software engineer, taught a group of us how to play the not-safe-for-work version of Bears Vs Babies, an overwhelmingly complex card game that involves genitalia, explosive diarrhea and fighting monsters. Then we moved on to Cards Against Humanity. More than anything else, it reminded me of high school in the suburbs without a driver\u2019s license.In this closed social system, roles and hierarchies develop much as they do on reality shows, just as Harrison had suggested to me at dinner. Long-term residents like Gregg Albert, the gregarious I.B.M. contractor, and a Bloomberg journalist named Nathan Crooks, who had each been living there for six months or more, acted out an earned authority, introducing new guests into the routine. Roam\u2019s live-in community managers played camp counselors, urging on social activity in a pleasant albeit intermittently patronizing way. As Roamies arrived and departed, even in the week I was there, the social texture shifted in subtle and compelling ways, placating any incipient boredom: It was always changing and remaining the same.Can you imagine a pair of noise-canceling headphones for geography? That\u2019s how I started to think of Roam. When you want to, you can block out your sense of place entirely and exist in a hazy, calm, featureless space that could be anywhere. This nomadic bubble goes beyond a hotel in that it stretches around the world and is built to encompass your entire life; it promises to become your post-geographical home. Yet I found there to also be an anxiety to this hermetic placelessness, no matter how beautifully unburdened or minimalist it appears. Living anywhere is a lot like living nowhere.Haid sees nomadism as a solution to our technologized, globalized lives, but it seems less like a fix than like an extension or intensification of the same condition. You travel in order to work, or vice versa, but the work becomes all-consuming. For better or worse, Roam has a way of removing what makes travel travel: culture shock, surprises and even loneliness, that feeling of being somewhere no one can find you.I went to Miami anticipating a lifestyle shift. I could lie on the beaches the city was built to provide access to, get things done and explore a different place while being supported in my esoteric freelancer habits by a like-minded group. But the last of these goals was the only one I could ever seem to advance. I occupied most of my time at the bamboo Ikea desks of the co-working space, sweating over a coffee mug, trying to write \u2014 just as I do in Brooklyn. On the last morning at Roam, I realized I had barely even seen the ocean, so I took a car from Little Havana to Crandon Park Beach, an island nature preserve that used to be a coconut plantation. I left my bag on the sand and waded out into the warm, shallow water.It was comforting to float there alone, moving with the gentle waves as they passed. It felt like what I should have been doing all along \u2014 embracing freedom, warm weather, the open horizon \u2014 but I had spent so much time being a nomad that I forgot to do the actual traveling. It\u2019s not much of a solution to the predations of capitalism: You can go anywhere, as long as you never stop working.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Does a True Populism Look Like? It Looks Like the New Deal", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe early history of American populism, culminating in the New Deal, suggests a more productive and less damaging kind of populism. When populism succeeds, it does so not by cosmetic gimmicks but by going after the roots of economic injustice directly.At the 1896 Democratic National Convention, the 36-year-old former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan delivered what became one of the most famous lines of American political oratory: \u201cYou shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\u201d Bryan\u2019s immediate target was the gold standard, an emblem of the globalization of his day, which he blamed for the economic difficulties of what he called the \u201ctoiling masses.\u201d Bryan ran for president that year as the joint candidate of the Democratic Party and of the People\u2019s Party, also known as the Populist Party.The populists of the late 19th century had many grievances, but the flames of their discontent were fanned by opposition to economic globalization. Under the gold standard, markets for money, goods, capital and labor had become intertwined among nations as never before. As John Maynard Keynes would later rue, a well-to-do inhabitant in a major capital city like London \u201ccould order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth.\u201dGlobal competition also drove American agricultural prices down. And the rules of the gold standard enforced tight money and credit conditions \u2014 what we would today call austerity policies. The consequent economic distress among farmers in the South and the West fueled the populist movement. The populists viewed the railroads as well as the financial and commercial interests of the Northeast, the defenders of the gold standard, as their main opponents. Throwing off the shackles of the gold standard and reclaiming national monetary sovereignty became their rallying cry.Populism in the 21st century is as much a reaction to globalization as its late-19th-century version. While the backlash in the United States and Europe differs in specific details, the broad outlines are similar. Large segments of the workers in these advanced economies \u2014 older, less-skilled manufacturing employees and the communities they live in \u2014 have seen their earnings decline or stagnate and their relative social status take a big hit. These groups see governments as increasingly in the pocket of financial and business elites, the big winners of globalization. The discontent in turn fuels populist leaders who promise to wrest control from faceless global market forces and re-empower the nation-state.The populist backlash unleashed by advanced stages of economic globalization should not have been a surprise, least of all to economists. The warning signs are right there in the basic economic theory we teach in the classroom. Yes, globalization expands economic opportunities: There are gains from trade. But globalization also entails stark distributional consequences, with some groups almost always left worse off. Factory closings, job displacement and offshoring are the flip side of the gains from trade.What is more, these redistributive effects loom larger relative to the overall economic gains as globalization advances and trade agreements begin to aim at less consequential barriers. In other words, in its late stages, globalization looks less and less as if it is expanding the overall economic pie and more and more as though it is simply taking money from some groups and giving it to others.In principle, an active government can take the edge off the resentment produced by redistribution. In Western Europe, an extensive welfare state has historically provided the safety nets that in turn enabled levels of economic openness that are much higher than in the United States. But often the response of the government has been to plead incapacity in the face of inexorable global economic realities: \u201cWe cannot tax the winners \u2014 the wealthy investors, financiers and skilled professionals \u2014 because they are footloose and they would move to other countries.\u201d This reinforces populists\u2019 yearning to reassert national economic control.William Jennings Bryan ultimately failed in his quest for the presidency, and the People\u2019s Party imploded because of regional and ideological divisions. But many of the Populists\u2019 economic ideas, such as the progressive income tax, regulations on big business and much greater government control of the economy, were absorbed by the progressive movement and became part of the political mainstream.It wasn\u2019t until 1933 that the Populists\u2019 main plank, the end of the gold standard, was adopted. By then the United States was mired in the Great Depression, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had decided the economy needed the monetary boost that adherence to the gold standard precluded. Internationalists complained that Roosevelt acted unilaterally, but he had little patience with orthodox economic ideas or shackles \u2014 foreign or domestic \u2014 on his conduct of economic policy. At home, he had to fight conservative courts to put his New Deal reforms in place.By his day\u2019s standards, and perhaps also today\u2019s, Roosevelt was an economic populist. But the New Deal reinvigorated the market economy and saved capitalism from itself. It may also have saved democracy, as it helped staved off the dangerous demagogues and chauvinist ideologues, of which there were plenty (such as Father Coughlin and Huey Long).The lesson of history is not only that globalization and the populist backlash are tightly linked. It is also that the bad kind of populism spawned by globalization may require a good kind of populism to fend it off.President Trump and his European counterparts have capitalized on the economic difficulties of the middle and lower-middle classes by wrapping them in narratives that exploit prevailing ethno-nationalist prejudices. In the United States, they attribute declining wages and job prospects to Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters and the federal government\u2019s preoccupation with minority groups at the expense of the white middle class. In Europe, they lay the blame for the erosion of the welfare state and public services on competition from immigrants and refugees. But none of this really helps the middle and lower-middle classes. Worse, the illiberal politics of the strategy undermines democracy.If our economic rules empower corporations and financial interests excessively, then the correct response is to rewrite those rules \u2014 at home as well as abroad. If trade agreements serve mainly to reshuffle income to capital and corporations, the answer is to rebalance them to make them friendlier to labor and society at large. If governments feel themselves powerless to institute the tax policies and regulations needed to address the dislocations caused by economic and technological shocks, the solution is not just to seek more national autonomy but also to deploy it toward such reforms.A populism of this kind can seem like a frontal attack on the economic sacred cows of the day \u2014 just as earlier waves of American populism were. But it is an honest populism that stands a chance of achieving its stated objectives, without harming fundamental democratic norms of tolerance and equal citizenship.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As the Streaming Wars Heat Up, Ryan Murphy Cashes In", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe battle between the Hollywood establishment and the streaming-media giants has caused big changes in the entertainment industry in recent months, driving up the prices of major stars and series producers while leaving traditional companies in danger of losing relevance.Mr. Murphy was in an ideal bargaining position not only because he possesses a fecund imagination able to spin out one successful series after another, but because Apple and Amazon have lately proved themselves willing to spend their way into rivalries with the old-line movie studios and television networks.Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, \u201cThe goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201dThat statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes.Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos\u2019s signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood.\u201cWhat Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there\u2019s a new template in town,\u201d Ms. Walden said. \u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator.\u201dRick Rosen, the head of TV at the agency WME, said it had become clear that Netflix was now able to outspend the companies that had been around since the early days of the movie business.\u201cAs a representative of talent, if you have top-top talent, you must talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d be negligent if you didn\u2019t. Top talent wants to pitch to Netflix.\u201dAnother competitor in the expanding streaming industry, Hulu \u2014 which is available only in the United States \u2014 has gained momentum recently with original series like the much-decorated \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and now has 17 million subscribers. While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters.With the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts.The mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry \u2014 one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space.\u201cWere the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,\u201d said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. \u201cIf the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us.\u201dMr. Murphy declined to comment for this article.Disney \u2014 a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger \u2014 has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney\u2019s own television studio has not been a reliable supplier.The day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network\u2019s long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d) and Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d).\u201cWith more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,\u201d he said.The money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: \u201cWhen this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I\u2019m interested in that and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201dThe Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year \u2014 and when the streaming services are spending in manic style.And it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right.The question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion \u2014 a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Most Dangerous Enemy: Demographics", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyWhen the whirlwind of the Winter Olympics spins to a close this weekend, the host city, Pyeongchang, South Korea, will settle down to a life beyond aerial flips, halfpipe pretzels and metronomic North Korean cheerleaders. The place will become, once again, a quiet spot where very few children live \u2014 its population a disproportionately elderly one, dependent on an imperiled social-security system. Pyeongchang played a happy Olympic host, but its everyday economic reality highlights an existential threat shadowing South Korea. It\u2019s not (or not only) the North Korean missiles and nuclear weapons arrayed across the border just 50 miles away. The more intractable danger is a demographic time bomb already starting to detonate across South Korea and all over East Asia.Japan, with its shrinking population, has long been the region\u2019s pace setter for demographic doom. But South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has plummeted to one of the lowest in the world, barely more than one child per woman. Throw in rising life expectancy, and South Korea is now aging faster than any other advanced economy on Earth. Between 1975 and 2015, its median age soared to 41.2 from just 19.6. In Gangwon, the potato-growing province that encompasses Pyeongchang, the median age is expected to pass 60 by 2045. (The median age in the United States, now 37.9, is predicted to creep up to 42 by 2045.) Thousands of South Korean schools have already been abandoned for lack of students.The economic fallout of this demographic shift could be devastating. After transforming itself from a poor, war-ravaged agricultural society into a manufacturing giant in just a few decades, South Korea now faces one peril of prosperity: a labor shortage that will be a drag on both the economy and the pension system for its aging residents. Like the rest of East Asia, Seoul has tried to increase birthrates, offering child care bonuses, fertility treatments, even gifts of beef for families with newborns. Some of its efforts, though, come across as little more than pressuring women to marry and reproduce. In one instance, the government published (and then retracted) an online \u201cbirth map\u201d that showed, in shades of pink, the number of women of childbearing age by city and region.Failing in its push, South Korea opted to pull. It has brought in \u2014 cautiously, but still much more actively than China or Japan \u2014 a growing number of foreign migrants. Back in 1990, the country was so insular that it had fewer than 50,000 foreign nationals. Today there are more than two million, a 40-fold increase, most from China, Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia. \u201cWhat other options are there?\u201d says Mihyung Park, the head of the South Korea office of the International Organization for Migration. \u201cThe South Korean economy cannot function without foreign workers.\u201dMost of the migrants work in agriculture, construction or manufacturing, doing the so-called 3-D work (dirty, dangerous and difficult) that the locals eschew. One conundrum of the South Korean economy is that even as foreign workers are needed more urgently, youth unemployment has climbed to just under 10 percent, nearly triple the overall rate. It results from a mismatch: Well-educated young South Koreans want the kind of corporate jobs that globalizing companies are taking overseas, while low-skilled laborers from China and Southeast Asia find plenty of work in traditional industries being vacated by aging Koreans.There are also about 150,000 \u201cmarriage migrants,\u201d mostly Chinese and Southeast Asian women, who have come, with the government\u2019s support, to settle down (and presumably procreate) with local Korean men. Though some of these marriages have ended in divorce, more than 5 percent of the children born in South Korea are now multiethnic. By one estimate, foreign-born or multiethnic Koreans will make up an estimated 10 percent of the entire population by 2030.Immigration may seem like an obvious answer to any labor crisis. South and Southeast Asia have an abundance of poor, young, underemployed workers, while East Asian economies (including those of Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan) need to replenish shrinking labor forces and reinvigorate, even repopulate, their societies. And the benefits run both ways. In 2015, according to a recent World Bank report, immigrants sent more than $430 billion in remittances to developing countries \u2014 three times the total global aid to them. The World Bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, who moved to the United States from South Korea as a child in 1964, has argued that, with the right set of policies, immigration can be \u201can engine of economic growth.\u201d \u201cIf countries with aging populations can create a path for refugees and migrants to participate in the economy, everyone benefits,\u201d he said in 2015.Yet immigration has long been anathema in South Korea, as it is in China and Japan. For decades, South Korean schoolbooks preached the virtues of ethnic and cultural homogeneity. Korean identity, for example, is based on the myth of a common ancestor, Dangun, who founded the kingdom in the Korean Peninsula thousands of years ago. Even the central drama of the Winter Olympics \u2014 the rapprochement between blood brothers North and South Korea \u2014 feeds into the narrative of ethnic nationalism. \u201cMany South Koreans look at North Koreans not simply as blood relatives, but as a potential source of cheap labor,\u201d says Katharine H.S. Moon, a professor at Wellesley College and nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAs long as the dream of unification exists, foreign workers from other countries will be stuck in a kind of holding tank \u2014 without movement toward integration.\u201dEducated young Koreans don\u2019t cling so tightly to the equation of blood and nation. Yet on the question of citizenship, they often wind up on the same side as staunch ethnonationalists. Though more tolerant of foreign workers, the younger generation is also wary of letting them become citizens, lest they dilute the nation\u2019s identity \u2014 an attitude that seems to have stiffened during the country\u2019s prolonged economic slump. One of Seoul\u2019s main immigration programs, the Employment Permit System (E.P.S.) brings in about 275,000 guest workers for up to five years \u2014 without offering a path to citizenship. Some human rights activists say the E.P.S. so strictly binds workers to a single employer that it is akin to slavery, and migrants leaving the program have swelled the ranks of undocumented workers in South Korea to more than 200,000.Seoul is more welcoming to ethnic Korean migrants from China. Known as joseonjok, they are the descendants of Koreans who arrived in northeastern China in the late 19th and the 20th centuries, fleeing famine and, later, Japanese occupation. The more than 600,000 joseonjok, who are granted less restrictive visas, are concentrated in the construction industry. If they marry locals, they \u2014 like all marriage migrants \u2014 can take an accelerated path to naturalization. Few outsiders, though, have become citizens faster than the 19 foreign-born athletes (from Germany, Canada and elsewhere) who joined the South Korean Olympic team to help it compete in some of its weaker sports, like ice hockey and luge. Not all Koreans applauded the inclusion of these particularly skilled immigrants \u2014 and the instant citizenship they were granted \u2014 even if a few of them did learn some lines of the national anthem.Immigration, of course, can deliver more than just short-term benefits. Recent studies suggest that sustained bursts of growth and innovation tend to occur in places buffeted by cultural crosscurrents, invigorated by fresh energy, talents and perspectives. This is not only true in 21st-century America. Consider the ninth-century ferment of the Tang-dynasty Chinese capital Chang\u2019an (present-day Xi\u2019an). The Silk Road metropolis was home to thousands of Turks, Arabs, Uighurs, Indians and many others. The cross-fertilization of languages, cultures and ideas within the dynasty led to major advances in art and technology, like the invention of everything from gunpowder to woodblock printing.Seoul is not about to become a modern-day Chang\u2019an, however. (Nor is Beijing.) The government celebrates the families of marriage migrants \u2014 there are \u201cmulticultural\u201d television dramas about them \u2014 and showcased a multiethnic children\u2019s choir singing the national anthem at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony. But it is not seriously considering broader integration for foreign migrant workers. Most South Koreans, Moon says, \u201care still very reluctant to entertain the possibility that immigration can be a dynamic, innovative force.\u201dJust a few decades ago, South Korea was a poor, traumatized country sending its own low-skilled migrants out into the world as an economic lifeline. It should be a point of pride that the country\u2019s rapid development \u2014 the so-called \u201cMiracle on the Han River\u201d \u2014 has turned it into a magnet for Asian immigration. But the demographic changes are coming fast, too. \u201cThe demand for foreign workers will only intensify,\u201d says Park from the International Organization for Migration, \u201cso South Korea better prepare itself.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a professor at Wellesley College.

{"Headline": "Brazil Looks to Crack Down on Fake News Ahead of Bitter Election", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Worried that Brazilians will soon be flooded with fake news ahead of a critical presidential election, the country is setting out to crack down on organized efforts to intentionally mislead voters.The officials leading the effort argue that the right to free speech cannot come at the expense of an illegitimate outcome, in an election that could dramatically alter the course of Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy.At Justice Fux\u2019s direction, Brazil\u2019s Federal Police recently established a task force of law enforcement and intelligence personnel, which is developing strategies to prevent fake news from being produced and to limit its reach once misleading content starts spreading online.\u201cIt is not our intention to infringe on anyone\u2019s freedom of expression or their right to voice an opinion,\u201d said Eug\u00eanio Ricas, the director of the Federal Police\u2019s organized crime division, who is leading the fake news task force. \u201cThe big question is when does a personal opinion become a lie about a candidate that is published with the specific intent of harming them and in doing so interfering with an election.\u201dJudicial officials say the task force is studying the tactics used by groups that have been active in spreading fake news in the past and assessing under which current laws they could most effectively be charged. They have also been consulting and negotiating with American technology companies, including Google, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, in hopes of turning them into partners in the fight against fake news rather than targets of enforcement actions and fines.If their initiative succeeds, Brazilian officials say that the October election, which will take place in a deeply polarized society, could serve as a template to address a problem that has undermined faith in democracy across the world.While officials are mainly concerned about fake news strategies deployed by rival campaigns, not a foreign power, they caution that such tactics are often planned and executed abroad, which makes shutting them down difficult.Yet it is unlikely that lawmakers will pass controversial legislation before the election, according to politicians and analysts.That leaves officials having to make use of laws and regulations they view as anachronistic for a 21st-century problem.These include electoral and defamation penal codes that were passed before the internet existed, and a dictatorship-era public security law from the 1980s that prohibited spreading rumors with the potential to generate panic or unrest.\u201cThose laws are not adequate to apply to the tactics of today,\u201d Mr. Ricas said. \u201cThe evolution of the internet and communication,\u201d he added, \u201cmakes it hard to be relying on laws from the \u201980s, the \u201960s, the \u201940s.\u201dThe legal situation has made building constructive relationships with technology companies a pinnacle of the plan.They have a powerful incentive to cooperate because the tribunal headed by Justice Fux is in the process of finalizing guidelines for electoral advertising online. At a time when Brazilian politicians are increasingly turning to social media rather than traditional outlets to target voters, the social media platforms are positioned to make a windfall.This reliance on social media to get the campaigns\u2019 messages out are expected to put the companies in the cross hairs of fake news disputes, and they say they are doing what they can to combat the problem.\u201cThe elections in Brazil are a priority for us, and we have been taking a series of steps to make sure our platform gives people a voice, encourages civic engagement and helps strengthen democracy,\u201d a press officer for Facebook said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have made several product improvements to reduce the reach of low quality content, eliminate the economic incentives behind most fake news, and prioritize content from trustworthy and informative sources.\u201dGoogle, which has been sued and fined dozens of times in Brazil as part of efforts to get online content removed, has met with judicial officials to explain the advances, and limitations, of its tools to combat fake news.\u201cWhile there is always more to do, we believe the actions we are taking will help prevent the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality and downright false information,\u201d a Google press officer said in a statement.Law enforcement officials in Brazil have expressed particular interest in WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook, which has about 120 million active users in Brazil.While government officials and the technology companies\u2019 representatives say their discussions have been cordial and productive to date, the companies have made it clear they do not intend to become arbiters of truth.Mr. da Silva is by far the leading target of negative fake news stories in Brazil, according to an analysis by Veja, a weekly newsmagazine, which recently published a cover story about misinformation campaigns. One example was an article falsely claiming that Mr. da Silva had said he would ascend to the presidency even if it meant trampling the federal judge who convicted him of corruption and money laundering last year.Mr. Bolsonaro is the rare Brazilian public figure who is the subject of more fake news stories that cast him in a positive light than a negative one, according to Veja\u2019s analysis. A spokesman for Mr. Bolsonaro did not respond to an emailed query about whether the campaign considers the use of fake news a legitimate electoral tactic. Mr. de Silva recently said such tactics should not be employed.Marina Silva, a former environment minister who is running third in the polls, announced that she was recruiting an army of volunteers to discredit the type of disinformation campaigns that she said derailed her past two bids for the presidency, in 2010 and 2014. False stories spread on social media about Ms. Silva before those elections included a claim that, as an evangelical, she intended to ban video games and an accusation that her bodyguards once fatally beat a gay man who tried to approach her.\u201cWe have already seen troublesome initiatives and a proliferation of laws aiming at active monitoring and regulating of online speech and delegating fact-checking to authorities,\u201d the group said.But Justice Fux pointed to the American election as a cautionary tale about what can happen if there is no effort to check false information.\u201cIn the American election, freedom of expression trumped over fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cHere in our country we recognize that while a right may be exercised, it can also be abused.\u201dLis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But because the agreement gives both parties what they wanted most, the deficit impact appears to be of little concern. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Speaker Paul D. Ryan all quickly embraced it.\u201dCritics corner\u2022 Hard-line conservatives were unsparing in their assessment of the deal.\u2022 Representative Nancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats, said she could not agree to any budget deal that was not accompanied by a debate over legislation to protect the fate of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers.\u201cRevenue was $286 million, up 72 percent from a year earlier and about $30 million more than analysts had expected. Daily users rose nine million to 187 million, the best growth in over a year. The retention rate of new Android users, a special focus for Snap, jumped nearly 20 percent over the previous year.\u201d\u201cThe company lost $350 million in the quarter, or 13 cents a share, which was narrower than the loss of 16 cents that was expected by analysts. And it also contrasted with the carnage of the prior quarter, when Snap recorded a net loss that was twice the forecast.\u201dThe bigger pictureThe results have helped quell some of the concerns about the company\u2019s slowing revenue and user growth in the face of increased competition from the likes of Facebook.Critics cornerIn the early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump lamented that in the \u201cold days,\u201d stocks would rise on good economic news, saying \u201cToday, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down.

Shear and Alan RappeportIn recent months, many powerful men have had to step down from senior positions as they have faced accusations of sexual harassment, but none were the head of a public company like Mr. Wynn. How would the board, shareholders, regulators, customers and unions react?We now know something about the shareholder perspective: Shares in Wynn Resorts were up 7 percent in early-morning trading today. Regulators in Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau are still conducting their own investigations.But the biggest unresolved question remains the board and its conduct.The board set up a committee of independent directors to carry out an investigation after the WSJ article, but it was not clear how rigorous it would be. The board did not have a track record for holding Mr. Wynn accountable.In an email exchange with me, Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard law professor and an expert in corporate governance, asked why the board did not suspend Mr. Wynn from his position pending the investigation, or demand that he not interact with Wynn Resorts employees, a step that would have limited his ability to influence the board investigation.One remaining way to assess the board\u2019s resolve will be Mr. Wynn\u2019s separation agreement, which is not yet finalized.When the WSJ article was published, Mr. Wynn denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, calling them \u201cpreposterous.\u201d On Tuesday he said, \u201cI have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity.\u201dIt is not clear why Mr. Wynn decided to step down. It may have been pressure from gaming regulators. Customers might have been pulling back.Mr. Wynn may have wanted to preserve the value of his own stake in Wynn Resorts. But as it stands, it does not look like the board was a strong force.\u2014 Peter EavisSteve Wynn has stepped down from his $17 billion casino empire, a little over a week after allegations of forced sex and other sexual misconduct claims emerged in a WSJ investigation.Top executives spent hours with Mr. Wynn going over plans for a new casino he would like to build in Las Vegas, according to a person familiar with the matter, while the company\u2019s general counsel hopped on a call with other executives to discuss the Vegas Strong Fund, a nonprofit formed in the aftermath of last year\u2019s mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, according to a person familiar with the call.He also attended the company\u2019s 1,500-guest Super Bowl party on Sunday, the WSJ says.In a statement, Mr. Wynn blamed his exit on \u201ca rush to judgment\u201d that took \u201cprecedence over everything, including the facts.\u201dThe big questions\u2022 Do other S. & P. 500 C.E.O.s now have something to fear?\u2022 And is the Wynn empire \u2014 from Las Vegas to Macau to, soon, Massachusetts \u2014 now ripe for a takeover or breakup?Critics\u2019 cornerLAT staff have chafed at the decisions of Tronc and its chairman, Michael Ferro.

Thursday they are off 3 percent.Critics cornerBlame the VIX/machines/debt?\u2022 Steven Mnuchin suggested yesterday that algorithms might be behind the whipsawing: \u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions.\u201dOn one side: Brian Chesky, the home rental giant\u2019s co-founder and C.E.O., who wants it kept private a while yet.More from Olivia Zaleski:Despite pledging support for Chesky\u2019s desire to keep Airbnb private, Sequoia Capital partner Alfred Lin, along with Jeff Jordan of Andreessen Horowitz, wanted to explore the possibility. In December, they asked Michael Grimes, the head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, to present options for going public, said people close to the bank.Ultimately, Mr. Tosi \u2014 who didn\u2019t see eye to eye with Mr. Chesky on other issues and generally did not fit in at Airbnb \u2014 resigned.An Airbnb spokesman denied there was ever any intent to pursue an I.P.O. this year.The tech flyaroundMr. Carstens also argued that cryptocurrencies were freeloading on existing financial infrastructure and the legitimacy that came from being linked to it.Most digital currencies are unlikely to survive in their current form, and investors should prepare for coins to lose all their value as they\u2019re replaced by a small set of future competitors, Goldman\u2019s Steve Strongin said in a report dated Feb. 5.\u201cCrazy things can come true.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Slack\u2019s C.F.O.

{"Headline": "When Wall Street Writes Its Own Rules", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionOn July 25, 2013, a high-ranking federal law enforcement officer took a public stand against malfeasance on Wall Street. Preet Bharara, then the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, held a news conference to announce one of the largest Wall Street criminal cases the American justice system had ever seen.Steven A. Cohen, the founder of SAC and one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men, was never criminally charged, but his company would end up paying $1.8 billion in civil and criminal fines, one of the largest settlements of its kind. He denied any culpability, but his reputation was still badly \u2014 some might argue irreparably \u2014 damaged. Eight of his former employees were charged by the government, and six pleaded guilty (a few later had their convictions or guilty pleas dismissed). Mr. Cohen was required to shut his fund down and was prohibited from managing outside investors\u2019 money until 2018.Now, with the prohibition having expired in December, Mr. Cohen has been raising money from investors and is set to start a new hedge fund. He\u2019ll find himself in an environment very different from the one he last operated in. His resurrection arrives as Wall Street regulation is under assault and financiers are directing tax policy and other aspects of the economy \u2014 often to the benefit of their own industry. Mr. Cohen is a powerful symbol of Wall Street\u2019s resurgence under President Trump.As the stock market lurched through its stomach-turning swings over the past week, it was hard not to worry that Wall Street could once again torpedo an otherwise healthy economy and to think about how little Mr. Trump and his Congress have done to prepare for such a possibility. Stock market turbulence typically prompts calls for smart and stringent financial regulation, which is not part of the Trump agenda. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s first acts as president was to fire Mr. Bharara, who made prosecuting Wall Street crime one of his priorities. Mr. Trump has also given many gifts to people like Mr. Cohen.On the presidential campaign trail, Mr. Trump made promises to help working-class Americans \u2014 the \u201cforgotten men and women\u201d who have seen their opportunities for meaningful economic advancement decline over the past two decades, even as those at the top of the economic ladder have become even wealthier. Once in office, he abandoned many of those promises. Instead, he has placed the considerations of high finance at the top of his priorities, far exceeding what even his friends at big banks, hedge funds and private equity firms could have hoped for.The most potent evidence may be found in the handling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers against unfair practices by banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions. Its first permanent director, the former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray, ran the agency aggressively, to the loud protest of the banking industry and its Republican allies in Congress.After Mr. Cordray\u2019s departure in November, Mr. Trump replaced him with the White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who once described the agency as a \u201cjoke.\u201d Mr. Mulvaney immediately started cutting back its power. The agency must ask for new funding each quarter; its most recent request was for $0, which suggests that he intends to starve it of cash.There are other signs of Wall Street\u2019s rising influence. The new tax act passed by Mr. Trump\u2019s party includes an array of benefits for the investor class. During the campaign, Mr. Trump promised to eliminate the \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole, which gives many hedge fund and private equity fund managers tax rates that are lower than those of most people who pay income tax. He declared that hedge fund managers were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d through their extra-low taxes.Regulators who police the financial markets have been told in ways that are subtle and not so subtle to pull back on aggressive enforcement. Republicans, with the help of some Democrats, are taking steps to weaken the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010 with the intent of making the financial system safer and of discouraging certain kinds of risk-taking by banks and other financial firms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Dreams of World Power for Himself and China", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSince China began to open to the West in the late 1970s, the United States and its allies have tried to integrate it into the political and economic system they built after World War II, hoping that economic progress would lead eventually to political liberalization.Mr. Xi\u2019s move proves that policy has failed and that China will set its own path, challenging the liberal order based on the rule of law, human rights, open debate, free-market economics and a preference for elected leaders who leave office peacefully after a fixed period. Despite increasing concerns about China\u2019s evolution, the West has yet to come to grips with this threat.Nevertheless, he has persuaded the party to effectively make him emperor for life by announcing plans to amend the Constitution to abolish term limits, which would have ended his presidency in 2023.The changes seem to ensure that Mr. Xi will continue pursuing his agenda, which has begun to lift millions of people out of poverty, reformed state-owned enterprises, protected the environment and built strategic industries. If all goes according to plan, he could preside over the transition when China eclipses the United States as the world\u2019s largest economy in absolute terms within two decades.Diverging from the free-market path, Mr. Xi has involved his government more deeply in economic affairs, reining in China\u2019s private companies and insisting on more market access abroad for Chinese businesses while limiting opportunities for foreign companies in China. That\u2019s a major reason the Trump administration formally declared China a strategic competitor and is preparing to impose tariffs on some Chinese imports and to limit Chinese technology investments in the United States. The two sides will have a chance to discuss the matter when China\u2019s top economic strategist, Liu He, visits Washington this week.Mr. Xi has also been touting China as an alternative model to politically strained democracies like the United States, and such ideas, fueled by Beijing\u2019s checkbook diplomacy, have found resonance in places like Rwanda, Cambodia and Thailand.But doubling down on the strongman model is risky. By moving from an autocratic collective to one-man rule, Mr. Xi has upset the political norms that were put in place to erase the personality cult of Mao and make political transitions more predictable.The system Mr. Xi has created also makes it less likely he will receive sound policy advice or be challenged on decisions in ways that could avoid mistakes. That\u2019s because he solidified his power base during the first term by waging an aggressive campaign against corruption and dissent, silencing political rivals and stacking the ruling Politburo with loyalists reluctant to speak up.One has to wonder what such control will do to innovation, a driver of progress in successful economies. Or whether knowing he has a job for life, Mr. Xi \u2014 who has presented himself as a benign father figure overseeing China\u2019s peaceful rise \u2014 may be tempted by other risks, including in foreign policy.By consolidating unfettered power, Mr. Xi now owns it all. If he fails, there is no one to blame but himself. And there are many daunting problems facing China, including an aging population, a need to maintain high growth rates, and heavily indebted state-owned and private businesses.Whether Mr. Xi succeeds or fails at this experiment in dictatorship matters not just to China but the rest of the world as well. He is increasingly dominating the international space as President Trump cedes America\u2019s traditional leadership role, including its defense of democratic norms.The American counterbalance must be more creative and comprehensive than just starting a trade war, as Mr. Trump is inclined to do. In this regard, the White House\u2019s response to Mr. Xi\u2019s power grab was not encouraging. \u201cThat\u2019s a decision that would be up to China,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Monday.Advertisement"}

That is great news for Americans\u2019 401(k), retirement, pension and college savings accounts.\u201dAnd then, well, you know. Stocks plunged Friday, and on Monday the market continued to plummet. The Dow fell almost 1,600 points at one point before finishing down more than 1,100 points, or 4.6 percent.Fingers, of course, are pointing.The president\u2019s critics have said his decision to tether his success or failure to the stock market was ludicrous.Yes, it was a mistake, but not for the reason you might think.The reason for the market\u2019s downward turn isn\u2019t that investors believe his stimulus measures, like tax cuts and deregulation, are failing, or might fail.It is quite the opposite: Investors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down by raising interest rates faster than expected.Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. Don\u2019t forget what set off the plunge on Friday: better-than-expected job growth numbers.It is very possible that by the time election season comes around for 2020, even if this market dip is simply a blip, the economy will be, or will have been, in a recession.Before all the pundits pass out from hyperventilating over the market \u201ccorrection\u201d \u2014 and quick fact-check: technically a correction is defined as a drop of 10 percent or more \u2014 let\u2019s take a deep breath: The market\u2019s fall may seem precipitous, but it has dipped only 8.5 percent from the top.That\u2019s certainly significant, especially if you jumped into the market in the last several weeks for the first time. But, in truth, it\u2019s as if we had turned back the clock to where the stock market was in the middle of December, when investors \u2014 and, yes, the president \u2014 were proudly cheering its success.The market was always bound to turn downward after a record run. Early last week, Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, predicted as much, saying, \u201cWhatever the trigger, a correction of some kind seems a high probability in the coming months.\u201d He probably didn\u2019t appreciate how quickly he would be proved right.Despite a steady drumbeat of optimism about the economy from top business executives \u2014 and rightly so, given the record results they\u2019ve been producing and expect to produce over the next year \u2014 some investors have been quietly suggesting that the market was starting to look expensive when factoring in the likelihood of inflation.For now, that fever may be breaking, but it is likely to be only temporary. \u201cThese big declines are just minor corrections in the scope of things, there is a lot of cash on the side to buy on the break, and what comes next will be most important,\u201d Mr. Dalio wrote in a note to his clients Monday.How long this bull run will continue is anyone\u2019s guess, but the betting line is that while it may have another a year or two, it will end.\u201cOur analysis of these metrics suggests that the current expansion will end as soon as late 2019,\u201d Guggenheim wrote.Just in time for the next presidential election.An earlier version of this article misstated the context of a comment from Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners.

Rather, it followed a determination that a member of the board\u2019s Republican majority had a conflict of interest in the earlier vote.On Monday, three other board members, including its Republican chairman, Marvin E. Kaplan, voted to vacate the December decision, citing a determination that Mr. Emanuel \u201cis, and should have been, disqualified from participating in this proceeding\u201d because his former law firm had handled a related case.That opens the door for the more expansive, Obama-era standard to remain in place for several more months, perhaps even years.Wilma B. Liebman, a Democratic former board member who served as chairwoman early in the Obama administration, said it was highly unusual for a labor board ruling to be reversed because of a conflict \u2014 perhaps illustrating the stakes involved.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Ms. Liebman said.Two Democratic senators, Patty Murray of Washington and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been outspoken in recent months in pointing to Mr. Emanuel\u2019s potential conflicts.The issue before the board involved a doctrine known as joint employment. A company, like a fast-food corporation, that is deemed a joint employer of workers at a franchisee can be held liable for violations of their labor rights \u2014 such as illegally firing workers involved in an organizing campaign \u2014 and can be required to bargain with them if they unionize.Before 2015, a company could be considered a joint employer under federal labor law only if it exercised direct and immediate control over workers at the franchise.But in a case known as Browning-Ferris, the board ruled that the parent company could be deemed a joint employer even if the control it exerted was indirect \u2014 for example, if it forced the franchisee to use software that committed it to certain scheduling practices. The board ruled that the parent company could also be considered a joint employer if the company had the right to exercise control over a franchisee that it did not exercise in practice.The more liberal definition of who qualified as a joint employer removed a potentially significant obstacle to workers at fast-food restaurants and hotels who sought to unionize. A parent company that terminates a franchise agreement to avoid doing business with a franchisee whose workers are trying to unionize may face legal liability for doing so if it is considered a joint employer.In December, the board, with its new Republican majority, took up a case known as Hy-Brand and voted to revert to the pre-2015 standard requiring direct and immediate control.But that case did not raise any questions that hinged on what standard to apply \u2014 the Obama-era guidelines or the previous ones. Partly as a result, the inspector general argued in his report, it was simply a pretext for relitigating Browning-Ferris.\u201cThe practical effect of the Hy-Brand deliberative process was a \u2018do-over\u2019 for the Browning-Ferris parties,\u201d the inspector general stated.This created the potential conflict for Mr. Emanuel, whose former law firm had represented a party in the Browning-Ferris case. If the more recent case was simply a do-over for the previous case, the inspector general argued, then Mr. Emanuel should have recused himself.Ms. Liebman, the former chairwoman, said the board would presumably be able to try again. But she said it would have to wait for a case raising its own questions about which joint-employer doctrine is correct, rather than simply use any vaguely related case as a pretext for revisiting the Obama-era decision.\u201cIn some future case, where the issue actually arises and some party is seeking a reversal of Browning-Ferris, where more of a deliberation goes on, that could be another vehicle,\u201d she said, adding that there was less likely to be a conflict for Mr. Emanuel in that instance. \u201cThis is likely just a reprieve.\u201dFor their part, business groups frustrated with the frequently shifting joint-employer definition argued that it was yet another reason for Congress to settle the issue with legislation.\u201cThis throws the whole situation back into question for a potentially extended period,\u201d said Matthew Haller, a senior vice president at the International Franchise Association. \u201cOur focus has been \u2014 and remains \u2014 on the need for Congress to provide legislative certainty.\u201dMr. Haller added that the House had passed such legislation in November and that it was now all the more urgent for the Senate \u201cto step into the breach.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In this teaching resource, we suggest a variety of ways teachers across subjects \u2014 from English language arts to science and social studies \u2014 can turn these Olympics into opportunities for learning.How are you teaching with the Olympics in your classroom? Let us know in the comments._________1. Sports WritingGood sports writing brings readers directly to the action, so they can visualize the buzzer-beating 3-point shot, the game-changing interception or the nerve-racking back flip on the high beam.The first thing you notice, as he glides on camera, is that Brown does not look like a typical figure skater. His face offers all the endearments of a cartoon, so expressive that you assume the performance will be comedic. His costume is emerald and black, with gold embellishments that make you wonder, idly, when Claddagh rings are going to become popular again. He takes his place and sends his dark eyes sailing level across the ice, and by the time he hits the crest of the first note, something has happened and is going to keep happening for as long as you watch.\u201cDoes \u2018Riverdance\u2019 bang?\u201d you ask yourself uneasily. \u201c\u2018Riverdance\u2019 might actually bang.\u201d Suddenly, here come the goose bumps. The elasticity of his Russian splits belongs to ballet; his flexibility is less like rubber bands than ribbons. His spins are so beautiful that they look as if they might at any moment exit his body completely and go floating off like the flowers in \u201cFantasia.\u201d And running alongside the joy is something grave, which seems to me to be respect for the gift.On second and 2 from the New England 33, Brady stepped up in the pocket and either never sensed defensive end Brandon Graham or thought he could evade him. Graham slapped the ball out, and it bounced into the arms of Derek Barnett, who recovered at the Patriots\u2019 31. Brady sat on the ground, his head down, as the Eagles danced around him.What do students notice about the writing? What literary techniques does the writer use? What words or descriptions stand out, and why?Then assign students to watch an Olympic event on TV and describe a dramatic sports moment in detail, paying close attention to word choice, sentence structure and tone.For fun, you can ask students to remove any references to the actual name of the sport in their descriptions, and then have them read their sports moment aloud. The rest of the class should listen carefully and try to name the Olympic event._________2. Global PoliticsIn 1988, the last time South Korea hosted the Olympics, North and South Korea were more alike than different, separated by an arbitrary line yet joined by history, language and the bonds of family.Both Koreas had come a long way, emerging from colonial rule and rebuilding their economies after a devastating civil war.But the Olympics in Seoul in 1988 ended up being a turning point. Over the past 30 years, the two countries have diverged sharply \u2014 economically, politically and culturally._________3. Design and FashionThe 100-day countdown to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, may have just begun, but the race to the fashion finish line among the various teams is well underway.She continued:Thus far, the leader seems to be ... sportswear!But this year, it\u2019s as if, in the weird circular way of fashion, sports clothing, which has been exerting its own influence in ateliers and on catwalks for the last few seasons in the form of streetwear and athleisure, has now effectively changed that game enough so that when designers move to the Olympics, their actual sportswear looks again like sportswear. Roll your eyes if you want to. It\u2019s true.Then, assign students to propose a new clothing design for a country, perhaps for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo or the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. They should draw a sketch and write a description._________4. Geography_________5. PhysicsHave students use the language of physics to describe what is taking place in various Olympic events. To help them deconstruct athletic feats like the quadruple jump in figure skating or the backside double-cork 1080 in snowboard slopestyle, students can use Times interactives that slow down and narrate the action in the following sports:Make sure they use relevant academic vocabulary they have studied in class, such as kinetic energy, angular momentum, friction and aerodynamics._________6. Argument Writing and DiscussionAny event that brings together delegations from over 90 countries for two weeks is bound to stir up some controversies and questions. Teachers can use these issues as prompts for argument writing and discussion before, during and after the Olympics. Each prompt includes a link to a related Times article. Note: The list below is just a starting place, since certainly more issues will arise before the Games are completed._________7. South KoreaAsk students: How much do you know about South Korea? They can do a quick-write and pair-share.The final product can be a written day-by-day itinerary, including location, activities and highlights, plus a travel map.

{"Headline": "Dow Jones and S.&P. Slide Again, Dropping by More Than 4%", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the global financial crisis a decade ago, a few simple guidelines have helped investors make sense of the markets.Global growth and inflation will be perpetually weak. Central banks will help by keeping interest rates low. And stocks will almost invariably rise.The rule book is now changing, a shift that is sending tremors through the financial markets. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell by more than 4 percent on Monday, deepening its losses from the previous week and erasing its gains for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average sank by 4.6 percent. Bond yields, the basis for key borrowing costs such as mortgage rates, have risen fast in recent weeks.In trading in Asia on Tuesday morning, markets signaled another tough day. Major stock markets in the region plunged after the drop in the United States on Monday, suggesting the pain could continue. In Japan, stocks were down more than 5 percent in morning trading, while shares in Hong Kong were down more than 4 percent.Those sharp moves come as investors digest the growth prospects for the world \u2014 and rebalance their views on the relative merits of stashing their cash in risky assets like stocks, safer spots such as government bonds and the myriad investment opportunities offered by a global economy moving in sync.The world\u2019s largest economies are all expanding, as the most important central bank, the United States Federal Reserve, is draining billions of dollars from the financial system and raising interest rates. And investors are concerned that tenuous signs of inflation could mean central banks around the world will start to remove their support even faster.It\u2019s an interesting complexity for investors to assess. What\u2019s good for the economy isn\u2019t always good for the markets. The strong job report last week fueled hopes that wage growth would follow. But higher wages could lead to higher inflation, creating new challenges for the central bank to manage.New leadership at the Fed is adding a degree of uncertainty. Jerome H. Powell was sworn in as the 16th chairman of the Federal Reserve on Monday, after the departure of his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. The markets do not have a clear understanding of exactly how, if at all, Mr. Powell\u2019s views on unemployment and inflation will differ from that of Ms. Yellen.Stocks surged broadly during the president\u2019s first year in office. By late January the S.&P. 500 was up 27 percent since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. But the last few days of trading cut those gains to just 17 percent.\u201cWhen you get this kind of sell-off, it kind of feeds on itself,\u201d said Michael P. Ryan, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Wealth Management.Although the market opened lower on Monday, it actually had climbed into positive territory in the morning. But the declines snowballed throughout the afternoon. The 4.1 percent drop was the worst for the S.&P. since August 2011.Back then, the sell-off followed growing concern about a chaotic budgeting process in the United States. A showdown between Congress and the Obama administration over the debt ceiling brought the country to the brink of default. In response, credit rating firm Standard & Poor\u2019s stripped the United States of its triple-A rating, spooking markets.The economy today is in tricky territory from a markets perspective. Investors have been excited about the prospects of the tax cuts, but they are also fretting that the government may be spending too much to pay for them.Economists often advise governments to run large deficits during recessions to stimulate growth. But the United States economy is already solid.It grew at an annual pace of 2.6 percent last quarter. Unemployment was 4.1 percent January.In essence, the $1.5 trillion tax cut may be stimulus that the economy does not need. The extra money raises the prospect that the economy could overheat, stoking inflation.\u201cWe\u2019re pouring a tremendous amount of fuel on the fire,\u201d said Rick Rieder, who oversees roughly $1.7 trillion in assets as global chief investment officer for fixed income at the asset manager BlackRock.Global investors are also trying to navigate a changing economic backdrop.Against the strength, investors are wondering whether those central banks will tamp down on their efforts to help growth, which could send interest rates higher. Investors are anticipating that the European Central Bank could pull back, depending on the economic conditions.The weakness on display in the United States set the tone for foreign markets. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dropped by 2.6 percent on Monday. Benchmark equity indexes in France, Italy and Spain all fell by more than 1 percent.In the United States, financial stocks endured some of the steepest drops, led by Wells Fargo. After the close of trading Friday, the large lender was the subject of an extraordinary regulatory action when the Fed barred it from growing until it improved corporate controls.Industrial stocks tumbled 4.5 percent. The aluminum maker Arconic fell 8.9 percent after its earnings failed to impress investors. The company also said it would bolster capital spending to ramp up production.Likewise, ExxonMobil fell 5.7 percent Monday. The energy giant disappointed investors with its quarterly earnings report last week. The energy sector was one of the worst-performing parts of the S.&P. 500, falling by 4.4 percent.The corporate environment reflects forces, along with the changing course of global central banks, that could further add to the choppiness of markets.For example, oil prices have risen as global growth has picked up steam. That encourages energy companies like ExxonMobil to increase investment, as does provisions in the tax overhaul that make capital spending more advantageous. ExxonMobil has said it plans to spend $50 billion on investments in the United States over the next five years.Those investments could be good business moves and help feed into the broader economy. But they could also send share prices lower in the short term, as investors have become accustomed to companies using investment dollars to buy back their own stock, a popular move for corporations in recent years. Goldman Sachs analysts recently noted that corporations themselves represent the single largest source of demand for stocks in the United States.Now, the combination of global growth and tax incentives to make capital investments \u201cactually completely changed the paradigm to just borrow to buy back your stock,\u201d said Mr. Rieder of BlackRock.Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Craft Breweries Are Helping to Revive Local Economies", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetThe travelers, who came from Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, snapped up as many cans and bottles as they could buy, at $16 a four-pack. After a sip or two by tailgates, some headed out in search of a meal, their tourist dollars funneled into a downtown betting on a rebound.\u201cWe are having an impact on the community, for sure,\u201d said Ricardo Petroni, a co-owner of Equilibrium, which opened in 2016 in a former meatpacking plant that had been seized over nonpayment of taxes. \u201cWhen we moved here, you could see old scars of bad times,\u201d Mr. Petroni added, \u201cbut you can tell that now, new things are flourishing.\u201dAcross the country, in once-bustling manufacturing centers, breweries are giving new fizz to sleepy commercial districts. If alcohol-based businesses were blamed for a breakdown of society in the Prohibition era and beyond, breweries are now being seen as a force for good.\u201cThe economic ripple effects are definitely there,\u201d said David Barnett, a Chicago-based senior research analyst for JLL, the commercial brokerage firm. Breweries \u201ccreate a cool tourism aspect for out-of-towners, but it\u2019s been good for residents as well.\u201dAlthough they are small, those breweries pack an economic jolt. In 2016, they contributed about $68 billion to the national economy, the association said.The Northeast, Midwest and West still represent much of the industry, but 36 states doubled their production of craft beer from 2011 to 2016, according to Mr. Barnett, who last year wrote \u201cThe Craft Beer Guidebook to Real Estate,\u201d a JLL report. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to ignore an industry that has grown this much,\u201d he said.In searching for places to make specialty beverages like sour beers and stouts, breweries seemed to adhere to a formula. They like early-20th-century buildings with up to 10,000 square feet and lofty ceilings, said Sandy A. Barin, a vice president with the commercial real estate firm CBRE based in Minneapolis who counts brewers among his clients.Usually renters instead of owners, breweries in Minneapolis typically sign five-year leases and pay $4.50 a square foot annually, Mr. Barin said, although tenants are usually on the hook for renovations, even if landlords offer credits for finishes like paint and carpeting. \u201cThe setup is usually pretty expensive,\u201d he said.Over all, breweries, usually with tap rooms, occupy about 624,000 square feet in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro region, up from 507,000 square feet in 2016. And in 2017, 11 new breweries opened in that area, according to CBRE, with 11 more expected this year.Offering food broadens breweries\u2019 appeal, making a visit to them into \u201cmore of an all-inclusive night out,\u201d Mr. Barin said.Breweries have boomed nationally in the last few years. The industry was on track to post a growth rate of 5 percent in 2017, based on midyear calculations, said Bart Watson, the association\u2019s chief economist. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much of a slowdown,\u201d he said.But in many places, the industry remains highly subsidized, raising questions about whether breweries can make it on their own, and how long that might take.The building that houses Equilibrium, for instance, was sold to the brewery for $260,000, with $225,000 of that forgivable if the brewery remained in business for at least five years, said Mr. Petroni, who along with his partner, Peter Oates, invested $1.4 million to upgrade the property. Ten people work there today.\u201cWe realized in the 1980s and 1990s that industry wasn\u2019t really coming back to any of these cities,\u201d said Maria Bruni, the economic development director of Middletown. \u201cOur community is very supportive because we\u2019ve been staring at these buildings for 20 years and doing nothing.\u201dFinancing from New York State, which under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has become a major backer of the brewing industry, seems to also be a key. Equilibrium, for example, has so far received $204,000 in state grants.Though breweries are plentiful, none were on the city\u2019s west side, a blue-collar former furniture-making center, when Mr. Andrus and his partner, Max Trierweiler, sought to open one in a dormant 1891 firehouse. Neighbors who were worried that another bar would hurt the struggling area spoke out at zoning meetings, he said.But opponents may have come around since the brewery opened in 2012. Mitten closes earlier than bars in the area, Mr. Andrus said, \u201cand we attract a lot of families.\u201d The brewery, which is profitable, seems to have also attracted investment in the neighborhood. Across the street is a gin distillery, in a former clothing store, and another corner has a barbecue joint, in a former hamburger stand. Other breweries have also arrived in the area.Perhaps unsurprisingly, property values are also on the rise. Mitten\u2019s 6,000-square-foot firehouse, which cost $220,000, is worth about $600,000, Mr. Andrus said, which is \u201clargely because of us.\u201dWhether craft breweries are a fad or will endure may come down to drinkers\u2019 tastes, but evidence suggests passion for the product is high.On that January day in Middletown, Bob Helligrass and Jaime Loughridge, friends from the Albany area, sat eating lunch at Tapped, a bistro next to Equilibrium that opened around the same time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spreadsheets at Dawn: The New Tax Battle Is All About Data", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The new Republican tax cut is providing a powerful weapon for the law\u2019s supporters and detractors, as well as investors and analysts, who are mining data on how companies are spending their windfalls in a battle to sway the behavior of voters and executives alike.In the two months since President Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax bill into law, a vast arsenal of spreadsheets has begun to capture, in real time, the effect of the tax cut as it works its way through corporate balance sheets. Traders are compiling data to find value in a volatile stock market. Advocates of corporate responsibility are hoping to shame companies into passing more of their savings on to employees or charities. Partisans are using it to sway public opinion.Advocates are hoping that the more information they can bring to the surface, the more they can bend companies\u2019 or voters\u2019 behavior with it.\u201cWhat we want to create is sort of a living thing that puts companies on notice,\u201d said Martin Whittaker, chief executive of Just Capital, a nonpartisan group that has compiled data on how 90 public corporations plan to spend their tax savings, and which will send letters to 875 companies on Wednesday seeking more information on those plans. Its initial release includes breakdowns of how individual companies will allocate their tax savings, based on their public statements and disclosures.Paul Tudor Jones, a hedge fund titan who is a co-founder of Just Capital, said he hoped publication of that data would lead to a dialogue among executives and the general public \u201cabout what\u2019s the most equitable way to distribute this windfall we just received.\u201d By the middle of the year, he added, the group should have enough information from public disclosures and survey responses to get a fuller understanding of where the money is actually headed. \u201cWe\u2019ll learn a lot,\u201d he said.The group\u2019s initial findings suggest shareholders of 90 large corporations \u2014 including Home Depot, Pfizer and Capital One \u2014 are reaping far more of the benefits of the law than workers or consumers. Pay or benefit increases for workers account for 6 percent of the savings those companies report from the law, the group calculates, while job creation accounts for 22 percent. More than half of the money going directly to workers takes the form of one-time bonuses, as opposed to permanent raises or benefits.Those bonus announcements have dominated headlines, though, in part because of the tireless compilation work of Mr. Kartch, the vice president for communications at Americans for Tax Reform. \u201cNobody was expecting those announcements,\u201d Mr. Kartch said; Republicans had largely argued that corporate rate cuts would unleash business investment, which would raise productivity and, with it, worker pay.When companies began announcing them in late December, after the bill had passed but before Mr. Trump had signed it, Mr. Kartch sent an email to staff members and affiliates of his organization, asking them to flag \u201cany statements you see from companies raising wages/paying bonuses/hiring due to the tax bill.\u201d He said he would keep a running list and include smaller businesses that \u201cwould otherwise be overlooked by national media.\u201d\u201cIt will get more detailed with time,\u201d Mr. Kartch said, \u201cbut for now, it\u2019s all the raw material up there for anybody who wants it.\u201dOutside groups are compiling a much broader array of data on what companies plan to do with their savings. Morgan Stanley has surveyed its stock analysts over their expectations of how companies they cover will spend their tax savings. Last week, its researchers released a 23-page report, counting appendixes, that contends stock traders may be overvaluing some companies by underestimating how much of their tax savings they will invest in workers and operations, as opposed to passing on to shareholders.Just Capital is hoping to round out the picture further, by pushing companies that have not disclosed their tax windfall plans to answer 11 questions \u2014 including spelling out how much of the savings they will put toward raising workers\u2019 compensation, lowering consumer prices and minimizing environmental impact. Mr. Jones said the group would follow up weekly, as necessary, with phone calls and other attempts to collect the information.\u201cMy attitude is,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to get the data one way or another.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dangerous Course Israel Should Avoid", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsTEL AVIV \u2014 When Vice President Mike Pence spoke to the Knesset on Jan. 22, legislators who oppose a two-state solution sent a clear signal that they have taken President Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as a green light to proceed with initiatives to annex portions of the West Bank.The signal came in two parts: As Mr. Pence reiterated America\u2019s commitment to Israeli-Palestinian peace, every member of the governing right-wing coalition stayed silent while opposition legislators rose to applaud. More stunningly, the Knesset\u2019s speaker, Yuli Edelstein, declared that Israel will \u201cdevelop the whole of the country, including Judea and Samaria,\u201d referring to the biblical names for the entire West Bank.But none of the legislative initiatives toward that goal addresses the implications for Israel\u2019s security that would come with them. That is a potentially fatal lapse, because what now seems to be under serious consideration would have disastrous consequences for Israel\u2019s security and would undermine American interests throughout the Middle East.It is no accident that none of the proposals suggests annexing the entire West Bank. Even the most zealous legislators realize that absorbing all of the West Bank\u2019s 2.7 million Palestinians would threaten Israel\u2019s existence as a Jewish and democratic state.Consequently, those seeking to block prospects for separation from the Palestinians into two states look for a \u201cluxurious annexation\u201d: absorb as much of the land, with as little of the population, as possible.Competing proposals put forward by the end of January included annexing all Jewish settlements in the West Bank without touching areas populated by Palestinians. Another would annex the Gush Etzion and Ariel settlement blocs plus the Jordan Valley. Yet another would create a region called \u201cGreater Jerusalem.\u201dThe most popular among annexationists was perhaps the most extreme: Education Minister Naftali Bennett\u2019s proposal calling for the annexation of \u201conly\u201d the 60 percent of West Bank land designated Area C (Israel\u2019s major settlement blocs now occupy about 7 percent of Area C). The area surrounds 169 \u201cislands\u201d of Palestinian towns (called Area A) and villages (Area B). Spread throughout Area C and in isolation from one another, these disconnected 169 communities, which constitute the remaining 40 percent of West Bank land, would not be annexed.That\u2019s the plan. But how would it work? What would be the fate of the 300,000 Palestinians now living in Area C? Logic dictates that Israel would have to offer them citizenship or a permanent residence status equal to that of Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem. Either status would have to bring free movement throughout Israel.Even though movement from the West Bank is restricted by a security barrier, a few terrorists even now manage to enter Israel. With Area C annexed, identifying the few bad guys seeking to kill Israelis among the 300,000 new Palestinian Israelis from Area C (who would have unfettered access to Israel) would be difficult and costly.The physical barriers required to prevent residents of Areas A and B from filtering into Area C en route to Israel would be a security nightmare. The perimeter of each of the 169 Palestinian islands would have to be treated as an international border. To separate the annexed land from the islands it encircles, 1,200 miles of new barriers would be required, along with hundreds of security gates that would allow controlled Palestinian movement from one enclave to another or from their enclaves to land of theirs in Area C (where 75 percent of the land is owned by Palestinians). The cost of building such a barrier system would be about $10 billion, and constructing the gates, along with associated security measures, would cost far more.Palestinians would view Israeli annexation as a game-changer, foreclosing the option of a viable Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority would collapse, and Israel would have to impose martial law and provide basic services to all Palestinians in the West Bank. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman has estimated the annual cost of social security alone for Palestinians at $6 billion. The yearly cost of health, education and other government services could be $5 billion more.With the collapse of the Palestinian Authority, Palestinian-Israeli security coordination would vanish. Many of the Palestinian troops would turn their weapons on Israelis, and the Palestinian street would most likely explode. This would leave Israel\u2019s military and its domestic security agency, Shin Bet, to take full security responsibility not just in the newly annexed Area C, but also for the millions of Palestinians in Areas A and B, where Palestinian security agencies now operate in close coordination with the Israel Defense Forces.This, in turn, would necessitate an increase in the I.D.F.\u2019s presence throughout the West Bank; the standing army could not do the job alone and a mobilization of reserves would be required. This, too, would tax the Israeli economy and severely diminish military preparedness for other security threats, most directly from Syria, where Iran seeks to establish a presence, and Lebanon, where Hezbollah has become more experienced at combat.Arab governments might not be able to ignore potentially violent domestic expressions of outrage at Israel\u2019s actions. Accordingly, Israel\u2019s diplomatic and security relationships with Egypt and Jordan might not survive, and chances for additional relationships would vanish.Israel\u2019s relationship with the American Jewish community would also be jeopardized, with annexation attempts further alienating large numbers of American Jews and accelerating the alarming trend of Jewish youth distancing themselves from Israel \u2014 a trend that undermines a major pillar of Israel\u2019s long-term national security.And not only Israel would suffer. All of this would come back to haunt the Trump administration, by undermining its efforts to forge an American-led regional coalition harnessing the resources of Israel and moderate Arab states to check Iran\u2019s hegemonic ambitions \u2014 a goal that serves the strategic interests of all.We are both former Israeli generals, but we are not alone in these comments. They are based on the findings of a task force composed of members of a network of over 275 retired generals from all of Israel\u2019s security services, who retain the view that an eventual two-state solution is essential to Israel\u2019s security, as well as to its Jewish and democratic character.A two-state solution may not soon be in the cards. But preserving conditions for an eventual separation from the Palestinians must remain a primary Israeli strategic objective. No annexation fantasy can be allowed to undercut it.It is the height of irresponsibility for Israeli politicians to propose annexation and for Americans, if they care at all about Israel, to egg them on.Danny Yatom, a retired major general who was the director of the Mossad intelligence agency, is a member of the steering committee of Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security. Amnon Reshef, a retired major general who was commanding general of Israel\u2019s Armored Corps, is the chairman of the network.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Learn to Love Deficit Spending They Once Loathed", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Big government is officially back in style.Republicans propelled themselves to power in Washington by promising an end to fiscal recklessness. They are now embracing the kind of free spending and budget deficits they once claimed to loathe.While the White House says it plans to offset that $200 billion through unspecified cuts, none of the other spending is paid for at a time when the nation\u2019s debt already tops $20 trillion.\u201cWith this deal, we will experience trillion-dollar deficits permanently,\u201d said Andy Roth, vice president of the conservative Club for Growth. \u201cThat sort of behavior, the last time I checked, is not in the Republican platform.\u201dLast May, the Trump administration released a budget projecting the United States would swing from a deficit of $440 billion in 2018 to a surplus of $16 billion in 2027. The budget called for deep cuts to domestic programs and a robust increase in military spending.Instead, the opposite has happened as Washington has opened the spending spigot in ways once unimaginable to the Republicans\u2019 fiscal discipline wing.Some budget experts have pointed out that the budget deal, which Mr. Trump supports, is more costly than the fiscal plan that Hillary Clinton proposed during her 2016 presidential campaign.Paul Winfree, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, calculated that the 2019 base level of nondefense discretionary spending surpasses what President Barack Obama sought in his final budget request.\u201cThis is the new baseline,\u201d said Steve Bell, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cWith this and the tax cuts, a balanced budget becomes a pipe dream.\u201dRepublican lawmakers are re-entering a \u201cdeficits don\u2019t matter\u201d phase, like the ones that persisted during the Reagan and Bush presidencies. That has conservative economists queasy, as they look at a government budget that is only going to face more stress as an aging population turns to Medicare and Social Security and drives up spending levels.\u201cRepublicans were very concerned about debt and deficits during President Obama\u2019s two terms in office. Then their concern kind of evaporated,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cI do think as an economic reality, deficits do matter.\u201dMr. Strain said the implications of the nation\u2019s debt trajectory included significantly higher interest payments, a loss of confidence in American Treasury bonds and less room to maneuver in a recession.The White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget is expected to release its fiscal 2019 budget next week. Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said the budget outline would \u201coutline a path toward fiscal responsibility\u201d and that Mr. Trump remained concerned about fiscal discipline.\u201cHe is concerned about spending in Washington,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cHe\u2019s expressed that for years.\u201dLeft-leaning economists are also scratching their heads at the speed at which Republicans seem to be disavowing their commitment fiscal restraint.\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit surprising and puzzling,\u201d said Jason Furman, a former chairman of Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, noting that trillion-dollar budget deficits is uncharted territory during a period of full employment. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had anything like that outside of a war or a recession.\u201dFor their part, Republican leaders who back the budget agreement are focusing on their desire to bolster military spending. They insist they would like to cut spending on programs such as Medicare and Social Security, the biggest drivers of the debt, if the political will were there.\u201cWe\u2019re going to work on other entitlement issues this year,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s the entitlements that need to be reformed if we\u2019re going to deal with the debt.\u201dBut Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has ruled out addressing entitlement programs this year.To Republicans who oppose the spending bill, the days of Tea Party activists railing against the growing debt seem like ancient history.\u201cWe\u2019re living in an unprecedented time from the standpoint of spending, and it\u2019s very concerning,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who considers himself a deficit hawk.The desire to reduce deficits could return.A fight between Republicans and Mr. Obama over federal spending and deficits ultimately led to passage of the 2011 Budget Control Act, whose spending caps would be lifted as part of this budget deal.Mr. Strain, of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested that for deficit reduction to become a prevailing policy for Republicans, another Democratic president might be required.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that movie before, and I don\u2019t see any reason to think we won\u2019t see it again,\u201d Mr. Strain said.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

On Monday the Supreme Court heard Janus vs. Afscme, a historic case that challenges a four-decade-old precedent that stipulates union members must pay the union in exchange for the union fulfilling its legal responsibility to represent every member, negotiate a contract and fight for pay increases for everyone. The potential consequences of the court\u2019s decision will be real and immediate. If the court rules against Afscme \u2014 the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \u2014 then union members across the country could receive all the benefits of being in a union without having to pay for it.This could be perceived as a win for union members, who would reap the assistance of a union without having to pay dues. But the impact of an anti-union decision would be financially disastrous for public-sector employees. It would give people an option that might seem appealing (getting something for nothing) but that would actually ensure that unions do not have the resources they need to negotiate good contracts, fight for higher wages, defend members and protect pensions.The plaintiff in this case is Mark Janus, a child-support specialist for the state of Illinois. But the real perpetrators of the broader assault on workers are the billionaires and corporations who have spent fortunes over many years to defund unions and consequently make it harder for working people to receive fair wages. The lie at the heart of this effort is the idea of \u201cright to work,\u201d policies that allow workers to avoid paying fees to unions that bargain for them.My union, Local 1000 of the Service Employees International Union, wants to raise awareness among the public about the specific, damaging consequences of these policies, including about who will lose most and who is destined to profit.

We are the nurses who care for our veterans and the people who inspect our bridges and roads.The Janus decision is critical to every community because every community is dependent upon the tireless good work of our educators, medical specialists and civil servants. Please do not be deceived if the Supreme Court, as seems likely, decides against unions.

{"Headline": "Trump Tells Lawmakers He\u2019s Mulling Limits on Imported Steel", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump suggested on Tuesday that the United States was likely to impose restrictions on imported metals, reviving the prospects for a continuing investigation whose future has been called into question amid months of pushback and delays.Meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, the president said such restrictions would help save struggling steel companies from foreign competitors that \u201cdump\u201d low-priced metal on American markets. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is tariffs and/or quotas,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In April, the president began twin investigations into imports of steel and aluminum under the little used Section 232 of a 1962 trade law, which permits sweeping restrictions to protect national security. Supporters of the action say American metal makers badly need the assistance to survive and continue producing planes, armored vehicles and other products for the military.But the measure also has plenty of critics, who fear that such restrictions amount to a protectionist grab by metal makers and will raise prices for steel and aluminum. They argue that because the metals are widely used to make other products, other industries \u2014 including automobile manufacturers and food packagers \u2014 would suffer.That pushback, which has garnered the sympathy of many pro-trade Republicans, appears to have turned a trade action that the White House initially viewed as relatively straightforward into a more extended affair.In speeches in May and June, Trump administration officials implied that action on steel would soon be forthcoming. But in the months that followed, little information emerged about the investigations. In September, the commerce secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr., said that a decision on the steel measure would be delayed until after Congress approved a new tax law, because the administration did not want to \u201cunnecessarily irritate\u201d lawmakers.The Commerce Department formally submitted the results of its investigations into steel and aluminum imports to the White House in January. The president now faces a deadline of April 11 for a decision on the steel case, and a deadline of April 20 for a similar decision on aluminum.Republican and Democratic lawmakers who gathered at the White House on Tuesday are generally split along party lines on the restrictions. Most Democrats voiced support for the president\u2019s action on metals, and Republicans, with the exception of Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, urged caution.Representative Jackie Walorski, Republican of Indiana, warned that price increases could affect the recreational vehicles made in her district. Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, noted that the auto parts industry relied on inexpensive metals. And Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said that past tariffs imposed in 2002 by President George W. Bush on steel had cost jobs for auto parts companies.In a statement after the meeting, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that the Trump administration needed to hold China accountable for unfair trade practices. But he urged the president to \u201cavoid any action\u201d that could reverse what he described as the benefits of lower taxes and lighter regulation under the Trump administration.\u201cI committed to continuing to work with him to identify a narrow and targeted remedy that is balanced, effective, protects national security and economic interests across America, and addresses the root problem of China\u2019s distortive practices,\u201d Mr. Brady said.The president listened to their comments but occasionally offered some pushback, saying he believed foreign steel manufacturers would absorb the cost of the tariff, rather than raising their prices. \u201cYou may have a higher price, but you have jobs,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, suggested that the president focus specifically on countries that have unfair trading practices. \u201cI would urge us to go very, very cautiously here,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump replied, \u201cThat\u2019s all countries.\u201dThe United Steelworkers, the country\u2019s largest industrial union, and companies that forge steel and aluminum have united in pushing for import restrictions. But they have faced opposition from a broad array of industries that argue tariffs could hurt their ability to compete and cost more jobs than they would save.On Monday, a collection of 15 trade associations representing more than 30,000 businesses that use steel to make products warned the White House in a letter that such restrictions could undermine their ability to manufacture goods in the United States.The associations said that their member companies employed more than one million Americans, compared with just 80,000 jobs in basic steel production.\u201cRestrictions on basic steel imports will actually adversely impact national security, the economy and the steel industry itself, because it will undermine our competitiveness and limit our ability to make value-added products here,\u201d the letter read.The president received more support from the Democrats at the meeting. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, thanked Mr. Trump for recent tariffs imposed to protect American manufacturers of washing machines, and urged tough measures on steel imports.Mr. Brown said he was hopeful that the administration\u2019s renegotiation of Nafta would succeed, noting that if it was written in a way that supports workers, \u201cwe can deliver Democrat support.\u201dSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, urged the president to include \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions in his infrastructure plan, and asked the administration to publicly release reports that the Commerce Department had submitted last month to the White House.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a chance to see the analysis done by the secretary in order to make thoughtful recommendations,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s support for the steel measure, he gave no indication of potential timing, Mr. Wyden added. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that a decision had been made.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the party affiliation of Senator Gary Peters.

{"Headline": "The Art of the Scam", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMost American workers this month will see their take-home pay go up, some a little and a few quite a bit, as the new tax act takes effect and less money is withheld for federal income taxes.This messy uncertainty, not abstractions like an increase in the federal deficit, will be the lived experience of Trump economic policy for most American households. It might seem like just a bureaucratic complication, but this episode could point progressives toward a persuasive economic message, one that reflects the economic realities of the middle class and the striving of people in struggling small communities as well as those in tech-driven metropolises.It\u2019s the experience of the scam economy, where nothing is certain and anything gained might disappear without warning. It\u2019s an economy where risk is shifted onto individuals and families, financial predators lurk behind every robocall and pop-up ad, work schedules are changed without notice and Americans have endless choices about savings, education, health care and other needs but very little clear guidance about how to make those choices wisely or safely.Since the 2016 election, Democrats have looked for an economic story and policy that would speak to the frustrations of Trump voters \u2014 even while recognizing that more nuanced analysis shows that \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d wasn\u2019t driving most of Mr. Trump\u2019s well-off supporters \u2014 without losing their own base. While the headline economic statistics like gross domestic product, low unemployment, wages on a slow but steady upward path have been healthy, other indicators like stagnating wages, Gilded Age levels of inequality, and communities and older industries that have been left behind together create an obligation to think ambitiously beyond the assumptions of Clinton- and Obama-era economics.These good ideas don\u2019t directly touch the immediate experience of most Americans in the real economy of 2018. What is near universal and tangible is the daily experience of uncertainty and risk, in a world in which economic choices are complicated, predators and scammers are everywhere, and government policy under Mr. Trump seems to move in the direction of making choices ever more complex and risky, while removing protections for consumers and workers.What government does at its best, from the New Deal forward, has been to provide some certainty and predictability: that what you earned would be yours, that what you saved would be there for you and that you wouldn\u2019t have to bear all the risk on your own.Today, Americans\u2019 private retirement savings are often eroded by unnecessary fees, aggressive stock trading and the need to borrow against those savings for emergencies. Higher education is still a path to security for most, but deceptive programs and heavy loan burdens often leave young adults worse off, burdened by debt and a sense of failure. In between school and retirement, jobs are ever more uncertain, with fewer employers providing pensions or health insurance, work schedules too unpredictable for child care and a shift toward \u201cgig economy\u201d jobs that provide not even day-to-day security.Some families, perhaps the top 20 percent, have some ability to absorb these risks. But for the vast majority, there are major setbacks around every corner.Mr. Trump and Congress have done nothing to alleviate those anxieties and, especially in higher education, the financial industry and health care, have worsened them. By contrast, Social Security and bank deposit insurance, while very different New Deal policies, all served the goal of security. They don\u2019t interfere with the free market \u2014 they just give people a bit of confidence in navigating it. The Affordable Care Act expanded this social contract, enabling people to share risk rather than taking it all on themselves.The policies of the Trump-Ryan coalition weaken that confidence in three ways. The carelessness about policy, exemplified by the frantic process that led to the withholding mess, is the least important of the three. Specific policies also deliberately shift risk toward individuals: Consider the rules in the new tax act that encourage pass-through businesses, which will lead employers to convert employees into independent contractors, costing them protections such as unemployment insurance and health care.Finally, this administration has eagerly taken down the guardrails intended to protect individuals from the worst predators: the \u201cfiduciary rule,\u201d which had required investment advisers to act in the interest of their clients; the hard-fought rules that protect students from worthless for-profit colleges and student loans they can\u2019t repay; and even the recent Labor Department rule requiring that employees receive the tips that are intended for them. Virtually every enforcement action of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been put on hold or canceled \u2014 even the investigation of the Equifax hack that disclosed the financial records of millions of people \u2014 exposing all of us to even more scams and tricks.These rules are particularly vulnerable because they are recent \u2014 newer regulations are easier to reverse. They\u2019re recent because it was only in the third through last years of the Obama administration, once the urgency of the economic crisis of the late 2000s had receded, that the administration seemed to see reining in the scam economy as a defining goal and the new rules of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the powers of the C.F.P.B., were finally put into place. But the problem in political terms was that these pieces were not knitted into a big theme. Each action was in its own policy universe: student loans, investor protection, worker rights.Giving people some security from the scam economy is never going to involve one big program or idea, like universal basic income or single-payer health care. It will always involve dozens of policies, even to replace the dozens that are currently being dismantled.But together they add up to a big theme, ensuring that people who pursue education, work hard and try to save for the future have some assurance that they will be able to navigate a complex and quickly changing economic climate. Progressives should give it a name, because it connects with the experience of every American outside of the very wealthy.Mark Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.Advertisement"}

Things in New York often are.The building\u2019s cavernous empty interior was big enough to allow Tomas Maier, the creative director of Bottega, in collaboration with the set designer Scott Pask (\u201cThe Book of Mormon\u201d), to construct an entire skeletal apartment inside, complete with multiple living spaces filled with vintage Gio Ponti furniture, a chrome-plated sculpture by John Chamberlain, a working fireplace and (of course) Bottega Veneta home goods.So men and women in satin pajamas (the fabric chosen to reflect the glassy shine of the city\u2019s midcentury skyscrapers), under enveloping two-tone outerwear in boiled mohair or suede bonded to satin or velvet, stalked the perimeter.

There were burnt orange trouser suits for both sexes and plush velvet jumpsuits and gowns; and everything, including the bags (elaborate) and the details (many) had the exquisite attention of high craft, mixed with a certain urban realism.Once the show was over, the models draped themselves atop the furniture, and Mr. Maier invited everyone inside to see the clothes, and the context, up close. In both cases, the message was about investment pieces. The bet is on a long-term payoff.It\u2019s a concept that has largely gone out of \u2026 well, fashion.

Federal ownership of these assets can result in sub-optimal investment decisions and create risk for taxpayers.While the Blackstone Group is raising $40 billion for its own infrastructure fund (half of which is coming from Saudi Arabia), it\u2019s hard to see private investors filling in the $1.3 trillion required to fulfill the Trump administration\u2019s vision.To break it down numerically:\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe recent, complacency-shaking declines in stock prices will have forced investors to take more seriously the yardsticks used to assess whether stocks are worth buying. None of the metrics on their own reliably can predict the direction of stocks, but when markets are freaking out and much is a blur, well-chosen indicators can steady the nerves and clarify the mind.The most important indicator right nowIt\u2019s the 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price. A higher yield reflects greater inflation fears among investors \u2014 and a higher likelihood of that interest rates are going up.Stock investors fear higher interest rates for two main reasons:\u2022 Most immediately, they make stock valuations look less attractive\u2022 In the longer term, they can eventually slow economic growth.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has retreated to 2.83 percent Monday, while United States stocks are trading higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all up more than 0.5 percent.Adding to the funThe government inflation figures come out on Wednesday.The valuation questionThe recent volatility in the stock market has stirred up the valuation debate. Put more directly, did the declines take stock prices down to level where they no longer look expensive?Still, history shows why that might not be the case. In 1997, the rule of 20 gave roughly the same answer as we have now, but stocks kept zooming higher. (Of course, that bull run did not end well. By 2001, the stock market was down below 1997 levels.)If you find the debate over valuation unsatisfactory ...There are also technical indicators, which look at how traders react to a wide selection of market measurements. One of the most interesting right now is the 200-day moving average on the S.&P. 500.But at one point Friday, it looked like that was where things were heading. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, or 2539, before recovering and closing the week above 2619, up 1.5% on the day.The 200-day moving average\u2014the continually updated average price of the past 200 days\u2014is considered a strong measure of investor sentiment. If the S&P 500 had continued to fall below the average, it would have conveyed real bearishness. The S&P 500 hasn\u2019t closed below that moving average in 408 trading sessions, going back to around the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, according to LPL Financial.\u2014 Peter EavisIt really is a remarkable achievement by Fuji. Without putting up any cash, they will acquire majority control and ownership of a venerable American icon. In exchange, we \u2013 the existing Xerox shareholders \u2013 will receive (1) an additional, indirect 25% interest in a Fuji subsidiary that just last year disclosed a $360 million accounting scandal caused by a \u201cculture of concealment\u201d and Fuji\u2019s failure to have adequate management systems and (2) a one-time special dividend financed with our own assets.The backstoryAt the end of last year, Mr. Icahn launched a campaign to unseat the Xerox\u2019s board, and late last month, he and Mr. Deason pressured the company to explore a deal \u2014 including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture.Xerox said it \u201cconsidered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the \u2018best path to create value\u2019 for the company.\u201d\u2014 Stephen GrocerHere are some of Mr. Tan\u2019s comments:On concerns the deal won\u2019t win regulatory approval and Broadcom\u2019s offer of an $8 billion breakup fee if it doesn\u2019t:\u201cYou know, I\u2019m kind of a frugal guy.

{"Headline": "The \u2018Manly\u2019 Jobs Problem", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisInsults, groping \u2014 even assault. That kind of sexual harassment came along with being one of the very few women on a construction site, in a mine, or in a shipyard. Those professions remain male-dominated and the harassment can seem, for countless women, to be intractable.But what if the problem isn\u2019t simply how their male co-workers behave? What if the problem is the very way society has come to see the jobs themselves? Some jobs are \u201cmale\u201d \u2014 not just men\u2019s work, but also a core definition of masculinity itself. Threatening that status quo is not just uppity \u2014 it can be dangerous.This dynamic plays out in workplaces of all classes and crosses partisan political lines. But it is particularly stark in the blue-collar jobs that once scored a kind of manly trifecta: They paid a breadwinner\u2019s wage, embodied strength and formed the backbone of the American economy.As Christine Williams, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, pungently put it, women in so-called men\u2019s jobs are labeled either \u201csluts or dykes,\u201d each abused in their own ways. Although statistics are spotty, some studies have concluded that sexual harassment is more regular and severe in traditionally male occupations. And a Times Upshot analysis of blue-collar occupations showed that women\u2019s presence in these jobs stayed static or shrank between 2000 and 2016.Women are so scarce in these trades that some men refuse to see them as women. The only woman in a repair crew at wind-farm sites charged in a lawsuit that her co-workers called her by male nicknames, from common to obscene, because they thought only a man could handle the job. Men suggested she must have a penis or be a lesbian.In interviews with more than 60 women in male-dominated trades like construction, Amy Denissen, an associate professor of sociology at California State University at Northridge and Abigail Saguy, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, found countless similar examples. While lesbians are also harassed, \u201cin some ways women who are lesbian are seen as less threatening,\u201d Professor Saguy said. \u201cThey\u2019re seen as not fully women.\u201dWomen who try to go along with the sexual banter, or who act feminine, are seen as either coming on to men or less competent in a workplace culture where proficiency is defined in masculine terms. \u201cSexual harassment is often a way in which the men reaffirm women\u2019s femininity, say this is who you are, back in your place,\u201d Professor Saguy said. \u201cAt the same time, women will play up their femininity and flirt a little bit, and play along with some of the stereotypes of femininity to be accepted.\u201dPower has been entwined with the evolution of male manufacturing jobs since the industrial revolution, said Alice Kessler-Harris, a professor emerita of history at Columbia University. Although many of the earliest factory jobs in places like textile mills were held by women who could be spared from the farm, men reserved many of the highest-status, highest-paying jobs. \u201cIt isn\u2019t new,\u201d Professor Kessler-Harris said of sexual harassment and male resentment. \u201cIt\u2019s as old as male culture. The men assumed the best jobs, the skilled jobs, were theirs. If a woman dared to enter them, God help her.\u201dJobs took on specifically male or female characteristics \u2014 and society valued them accordingly. Nurses, often men in the early days of the profession, were redefined as nurturers when women swelled their ranks; secretaries, once exclusively men, yielded to the dexterous fingers of women who typed and were recast as \u201cthe sunshine of the office,\u201d Professor Kessler-Harris said.These jobs often paid less, while the ones requiring physical strength paid more. When women were needed during World War II, cutting sheet metal was likened to cutting a pattern through cloth, and welding to opening an orange juice can, she said. Then after the war, men reclaimed these jobs and most women were exiled back to the kitchen.After 1964, as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was gradually used to pry open industries once largely closed to women like construction, mining and shipbuilding, some men\u2019s rage swelled, Professor Kessler-Harris said.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can understand this notion of sexual harassment and men\u2019s anger with women, their willingness to take out on them all this sexual hostility, unless you imagine that sense of entitlement in the job,\u201d she said.Professor Saguy said that employers played on this sense that manliness was intertwined with such jobs. \u201cEven if they have to tolerate bad working conditions, the compensation is they were real men,\u201d she said. \u201cThen women were moving into these occupations, so what does that mean? If women can do the job, maybe it\u2019s not so masculine after all.\u201dAlready, some fear a backlash to the intense focus on sexual harassment. And there are worries that many of the prescribed remedies, from training to promoting women to stiffening penalties, could fall short, generate more resentment or perpetuate stereotypes that women are always victims. Lawsuits abound but seldom force upheavals in entire systems, Professor Williams said.Many scholars I interviewed argued that fundamental changes are necessary, such as restructuring organizations to be less hierarchical and re-examining pay scales for men\u2019s and women\u2019s work. \u201cI would like to think there will be permanent changes that come out of this,\u201d Professor Saguy said. \u201cI don\u2019t see them yet.\u201dBut some who have observed or trained once-recalcitrant men cite small successes in changing perceptions about the nature of \u201cmale\u201d jobs. Ellen Bravo, a director of Family Values at Work, found that male firefighters in Kansas City, Mo., had adapted to changes they once dismissed as unmanly, such as wearing masks to protect against lung cancer or talking about grief after witnessing death and suffering.Jessica Smith, an associate professor at the Colorado School of Mines, studied the successful experience of women in a Wyoming mine in the 2000s during a time of hiring expansion, when women were not perceived as taking jobs from men. \u201cThey redefined what it was to be a good miner away from this very hyperbolic masculine image,\u201d she said. \u201cA good miner was someone who cared for their co-workers. They were responsible. These were issues that women could also embody.\u201dNow that leaders of some organizations are toppling, Professor Kessler-Harris surveyed this moment with a historian\u2019s eye. \u201cAfter 50 years when women swallowed hard and put up with it, or quit, finally women are saying this is not acceptable anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is an attack on male power and the possibility at least of change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retire at 55? In Brazil, It\u2019s the Norm. But Can the Good Times Last?", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 In much of the world, workers would find it hard to imagine being able to retire at 55, earning 70 percent of their final salary for the rest of their lives.But in Brazil, that has been the norm for decades, which helps explain the abundance of silver-haired joggers along Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro at 11 a.m. on a recent weekday.It also accounts for about a third of all government spending in Brazil, and contributed to a record budget deficit in 2016.Analysts and politicians across the political spectrum have long recognized that the pension system is unsustainable and a major factor in the country\u2019s continuing economic struggles.\u201cBrazil has one of the most generous systems in the world,\u201d said Chris Garman, managing director of the Americas for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. But without a pension overhaul, he added, \u201cBrazil is heading for insolvency and debt crisis.\u201dA jarring reminder of that came last month when Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the credit rating of Brazil, Latin America\u2019s largest economy, sending it even further into so-called junk territory, or below investment grade. The downgrade came amid dimming hopes that Brazil\u2019s Congress would reform the country\u2019s social security system during this election year.It turns out the ratings agency was right. President Michel Temer and Congress have now officially given up on trying to pass any pension legislation \u2014 handing off the problem until after the October election.On Friday, Fitch Ratings followed suit, also cutting Brazil\u2019s credit rating.Mr. Temer had vowed that pension reform would be one of his signature achievements when he was sworn in after the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016. But instead of enacting what he had billed as a business-friendly agenda, his presidency has been notable for its turbulence and scandals.The Temer administration worked with Congress to create pension overhaul legislation for both public- and private-sector workers that, among other changes, would set the minimum retirement age at 65 for men and 62 for women. Currently, there is no minimum retirement age.Mr. Temer sought to build support for the proposal with a simple, bleak warning plastered across government websites and promoted in a social media campaign: \u201cEveryone for social security reform so Brazil doesn\u2019t go bankrupt.\u201dMr. Temer initially insisted the pension overhaul could still be voted on by temporarily lifting the security decree. But the dire warning about bankruptcy disappeared from government websites this past week, and both the president of the Senate, Eun\u00edcio Oliveira, and the political affairs minister, Carlos Marun, have since said the bill has been shelved.\u201cAfter debating and consulting with judges from the Supreme Court, the conclusion is that the reform is suspended as a result of the decree for intervention,\u201d Mr. Marun told journalists last week.The court\u2019s opinion was not the only factor. Mr. Marun conceded that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the votes to approve the reform \u2014 I couldn\u2019t guarantee the government that we would have them by the end of February.\u201dEven some of Mr. Temer\u2019s supporters said that the president had issued the security decree, in part, to avoid an embarrassing loss in Congress.\u201cIt was an excuse to avoid the vote \u2014 the nail in the coffin of pension reform,\u201d said Congressman Alex Canziani, a member of the governing coalition.The timing of the pension debate could hardly have been worse for supporters of an overhaul. With elections in the fall, few lawmakers are willing to tell voters they will have to work longer and then get less money in their golden years.Selling that message to the electorate is especially hard given how unpopular the country\u2019s political elite has become amid an avalanche of corruption scandals and growing scrutiny of the high salaries and generous perks that lawmakers and other federal employees enjoy.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fly when voters are angry at politicians,\u201d Mr. Garman, the political consultant, said. Voter reaction, he added, has been one of outrage: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re stealing from us and now you expect us to work more?\u2019\u201dElisabete Lopes Santos, 57 and retired, agrees. \u201cEveryone contributed to the pension system \u2014 how could it be broke? The money was siphoned off,\u201d she said.The longer someone works, the more they earn in retirement. Retirees receive an average of 70 percent of their pre-retirement salary, and the amount is indexed to a constantly climbing minimum wage. When pension recipients die, widows and widowers may inherit the full pension of their spouse and add it to their own.Pension spending in Brazil rose to 8.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 from 4.6 percent in 2014. Brazil\u2019s population is comparatively young compared to the global median, and pension spending could soar to 17 percent of its G.D.P. by 2060 if the rules remain unchanged.The Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress, repeatedly watered down the extent of the proposed changes and delayed a vote in hopes that more political factions would come onboard. But the latest tallies show the government is still at least 40 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for approval.The bill appeared to be gathering momentum until May, when Mr. Temer was implicated in the broadening corruption scandal and charged in two criminal cases. Getting allies in Congress to block the cases from moving forward exhausted much of Mr. Temer\u2019s political capital, significantly setting back his broader agenda.After postponing a pension vote in December, the government switched tactics, with a new campaign focusing on inequities in the system and targeting big earners in the public sector.\u201cPension reform is aimed at combating privileges,\u201d Mr. Temer said, pointing to the benefits politicians and high-level civil servants get. \u201cWhat the reform does is protect the poor who pay for those who earn a lot in the public sector.\u201dMr. Temer was perhaps not the ideal figure to champion that message. The president has been collecting a pension for more than two decades, having retired as a state prosecutor at 58, which has significantly padded his earnings as an elected official.But regardless of the president\u2019s own pension history, the government tried to tap into the widespread anger and frustration over inequality in Brazil, pointing out that the pensions of the well-off have been subsidized largely by the working poor.\u201cI know there won\u2019t be enough money to cover my retirement if the government doesn\u2019t do something,\u201d said Edmilson Santos, a 28-year-old Uber driver. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any faith that they won\u2019t just keep helping the same politicians and public workers that have always benefited.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age at which President Michel Temer retired as a state prosecutor and began collecting a pension. He was 58, not 55.Lis Moriconi contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Pedestrian Deaths Are Up, Is Marijuana to Blame?", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPedestrian deaths in traffic accidents have reached levels not seen in years, and a safety group has sought to explain why. It has identified several possible causes, like digital distractions and an increase in driving. Now it has added another: marijuana.Over the first six months of 2017, pedestrian fatalities rose sharply from a year earlier in states that had legalized recreational marijuana, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association. In the rest of the country, such deaths declined.Pedestrian deaths are far higher than a decade ago, both in sheer numbers and as a share of traffic fatalities. In 2016, the last full year for which the safety association has data, nearly 6,000 pedestrians were killed, 16 percent of the overall traffic toll.Many factors can cause traffic deaths to rise, and safety experts say the increases in recent years are partly a byproduct of recovery from the recession. \u201cPeople are driving more when the economy is growing,\u201d Mr. Retting said. Populations are rising in urban areas where most pedestrian fatalities occur, and cities are more congested.But this year, the group also called attention to the numbers for states that legalized recreational marijuana between 2012 and 2016 \u2014 Alaska, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington \u2014 as well as the District of Columbia, which did likewise.In Alaska and Maine, pedestrian deaths are so few that any changes may not be statistically sufficient to identify a clear connection to the drug. Even in Colorado, a 12 percent jump in pedestrian deaths meant the total rose to 37 in the first half of last year, from 33 in 2016. Massachusetts was the only state in the group where such deaths decreased \u2014 by one.\u201cI\u2019d be cautious about drawing a direct link to any potential cause,\u201d said Jason Levine, executive director at the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly worth trying to figure out why those numbers are what they are.\u201dAmong the unanswered questions is whether and to what extent any link reflects marijuana use by drivers, pedestrians or both.Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said his organization had not studied links between marijuana use and severe crashes that involve deaths. But he said insurance claims from all collisions, including fender benders, were about 3 percent higher in states that have legalized marijuana than in nearby states.Mr. Retting said the data he had examined suggested that increasing smartphone use might also be contributing to the rise in pedestrian fatalities. In 2015 and 2016, the total rose roughly 10 percent each year.\u201cIt\u2019s never increased that much, going all the way back to the 1970s,\u201d he said.The number of miles driven and the number of walking trips that people take have increased, but not enough to account for a 10 percent jump in pedestrian deaths, Mr. Retting said. At the same time, the number of smartphones in use more than tripled from 2010 to 2016, he said.\u201cWhat this tells me is that here is a metric worth keeping an eye on,\u201d he said.The governors\u2019 association, which refers to itself as \u201cthe states\u2019 voice on highway safety,\u201d found that five states \u2014 California, Texas, Florida, New York and Arizona \u2014 accounted for 43 percent of all pedestrian traffic deaths. The states with the most pedestrian fatalities per 100,000 people were Arizona, New Mexico, Delaware, Louisiana and Florida.While the overall number of pedestrian deaths in the first six months of 2017 was lower than in the 2016 period, the group said it projected that the rate for all of 2017 would be \u201cessentially unchanged\u201d from the year before.Advertisement"}

Fight, Delta Finds There Is No Neutral Ground", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 Delta Air Lines, one of Georgia\u2019s largest private-sector employers, is among the glossiest corporate jewels in the state, contributing billions of dollars a year to the economy. Its hundreds of daily flights in and out of Atlanta\u2019s airport are the main reason Georgia\u2019s capital can brag, with justification, that it is a truly international city.But prestige, boosterism and corporate coddling \u2014 all cherished concepts in Georgia \u2014 took a back seat this week to the national debate over gun control. In the wake of the Florida school shooting, the airline announced it was ending a promotional discount with the National Rifle Association, and suddenly found itself in the rare position of being openly dressed down \u2014 and potentially punished \u2014 by Republicans who control the statehouse.The conservative backlash highlighted the challenge confronting corporations around the country that are struggling to cater to both ends of America\u2019s increasingly distant political and cultural poles.As pressure from social media and advocacy groups has intensified, and calls for boycotts mount, more than a dozen companies have severed business ties with the N.R.A. since the massacre in Parkland, Fla. Just as quickly, a counteroffensive arose from gun supporters excoriating the companies for their stance, forcing business leaders to navigate the treacherous ground where social responsibility, ideology and financial impact converge.Delta did not respond on Tuesday to Mr. Cagle\u2019s threat or amplify its stance regarding the N.R.A. In a statement over the weekend, the company said its decision to stop offering discounted fares to the N.R.A. \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.\u201dAs of Tuesday afternoon, the jet-fuel tax break, while opposed by Mr. Cagle and some other conservative Republicans, had not yet been stripped out of a broader Senate tax bill.\u201cWe are very clear that, when we set pricing strategy or look to adjust pricing, it is not based on political positions or points of view,\u201d Patrick Fitzgerald, the company\u2019s senior vice president, integrated marketing and communications, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cBut we do have a very clear corporate position in terms of gun safety and school safety.\u201dIn Georgia, the debate has been surprisingly fiery, even in a state long defined by tensions between the liberal metropolis and conservative countryside, and between the values of global corporate culture and those of Southern Republicans.State Senator Josh McKoon said in an interview Tuesday that he was put off by Delta\u2019s assertion that it was trying to remain neutral on the guns issue, when it had taken positions on other social topics in the past.\u201cIt just came off as very disingenuous,\u201d Mr. McKoon said of Delta\u2019s statement.Referring to Mr. Cagle\u2019s pushback, Mr. McKoon said, \u201cI think he captured the sentiment and the feeling of a lot of Georgians,\u201d who, he said, were frustrated \u201cwith Delta weighing in on an issue that has nothing to do with the topic of transportation, for sure.\u201dBut Mr. Massell, the former mayor who is president of the Buckhead Coalition, an influential Atlanta business and civic group, called the entire debate \u201cembarrassing.\u201d He said that he feared the threat against Delta would scare away Amazon, the online retail giant that has listed Atlanta among the finalists for its second headquarters.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in blackmail, and I\u2019m sorry to use such a dirty word, but that\u2019s almost what it tastes like,\u201d said Mr. Massell, a Democrat who served as mayor from 1970 to 1974. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. That\u2019s not Georgia\u2019s image. That\u2019s backwoods stuff that doesn\u2019t belong at all.\u201dIn subsequent decades, the city, which was founded as a railroad hub, invested heavily in its airport, and pushed a message that it was more socially tolerant than other Southern cities like Birmingham. It was a winning combination. Today, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the busiest in the world, and Delta employs more than 33,000 Georgia residents.When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.Michael Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business and faculty director of the Center for Social Impact, said in an interview that \u201cDelta has every right to tell legislators, \u2018We\u2019re not of a mind to do your bidding.\u2019 They could easily pack their bags and move away from Atlanta and go to Dallas.\u201d\u201cAtlanta and Georgia and the business community usually try to work together and Delta is a huge employer in this state,\u201d said another former Atlanta mayor, Shirley Franklin. \u201cSo the relationship is damaged, if nothing else.\u201dA broader concern, shared by some liberals, conservatives and members of the Georgia business community, is that gun control may now join other hot-button cultural topics that may damage the state\u2019s reputation among national and global corporations that do not adhere to the same conservative Southern values as the state legislature.In the last few years, the legislature has taken up a number of prominent bills that critics say would allow for discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed one of them, a so-called religious liberty bill, in 2016, after some of the state\u2019s most prestigious and powerful companies \u2014 including Delta, Home Depot and Coca-Cola \u2014 openly opposed the measure.Mr. Deal, a Republican, will soon leave office because of term limits. Mr. Cagle, a leading candidate to replace him, is among a number of Republican hopefuls who say they will continue to support the legislation, which would have strengthened legal protection for opponents of same-sex marriage.Mr. McKoon, a Republican who is leaving the upper chamber to run for secretary of state, said that he had long opposed the jet-fuel tax break on the grounds that it seemed like a handout for a politically connected industry.Mr. McKoon was a vocal supporter of the 2016 religious liberty bill that Mr. Deal vetoed. He said that when that legislation failed, he issued a warning, saying that liberals would continue pressuring companies to embrace progressive social positions.He warned, he said, that \u201cthe next logical step would be to attack gun rights. And I think we are seeing the beginning of that.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information provided by a consulting firm working for Delta Air Lines, misstated the airline\u2019s estimate of its economic impact on Georgia. It is $43.5 billion, not $435 billion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ancient Tuscan Village, Like Italy, Is Reshaped by Migration", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCastellina in Chianti JournalCASTELLINA IN CHIANTI, Italy \u2014 The three-story school building hasn\u2019t changed much. The blackboards still hang against the ochre-colored classroom wall. Even the morning ritual is familiar: Two students walk through the rows of tiny desks to collect the exercise books, which are still stacked inside in the same storage closet used during the late 1980s, when I was a primary school student in Castellina in Chianti.What has changed are the students. When I was growing up, only one of my classmates was from somewhere else, a boy who arrived from Grosseto, roughly 60 miles away, to our ancient walled town of 2,800 people. Like me, he was from Tuscany, but he seemed like an exotic stranger.Today, more than half of the 23 second graders have parents from Afghanistan, Albania, Bosnia, Macedonia, Morocco, Pakistan or Tunisia. Five were born in their family\u2019s country of origin or in transit to Europe. This is the new Italy.Initially, I didn\u2019t pay close attention to what was happening in my village. I was part of a different migration: the flood of Italians in their 20s, 30s and 40s who had earned college degrees and then left villages or small towns, where job options are limited. Some had moved to Berlin, Denver, London or Paris, where one of my closest childhood friends now lives. I landed in Rome, among those who moved to Italy\u2019s big cities in search of work.What I hadn\u2019t expected was the way both issues had quietly reshaped my village. My family has lived in Castellina for generations, and I\u2019m the granddaughter of a farmer, in this region famous for its wine. Yet migrants now tend many of the fields or care for many of the elderly, while some of their children and grandchildren have moved away. Today, 17 percent of the population in Castellina arrived as migrants.Nationally, the immigration issue is so toxic politically that, before Christmas, Parliament balked at passing a law to naturalize 800,000 children \u2014 some arrived at a young age with parents who have long-term residence and work permits, while others were born in Italy. That means that many of the second graders in Castellina live in limbo.I had seen migrants working in the fields for a few years, as well as a couple of veiled women walking around Castellina, but I didn\u2019t fully understand how the village was changing until last year, when I spoke with Francesco. He is nine, and my mother has been his babysitter for eight years, making her his honorary grandmother.One night over dinner, Francesco told me how sad he was that his friend Igor, a Ukrainian refugee, had left. Igor had explained that he could return home because bombs were no longer falling and his father had been discharged from the army. I was startled by Igor\u2019s story, but also that Francesco knew so much about global affairs through his friends at school.On a recent morning, I went to the primary school and met the second graders, who insisted on writing their names in my notebook because they said the names are hard for Italians to pronounce, just as it is hard for some immigrant children to master Italian.\u201cOur language is complex,\u201d the teacher, Maria Luisa Roscino, told me. \u201cChildren are fast to learn, but at home they don\u2019t speak Italian \u2014 and that puts them at a disadvantage.\u201dMs. Roscino began teaching in Castellina in 1998. This is her first class in which most students \u2014 51 percent \u2014 were either born abroad or had foreign parents. \u201cIt is challenging, especially in terms of cultural differences,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the rest, children are children.\u201d\u201cHe says you look like his mother,\u201d his father told me through a translator, \u201cwho died under the bombs in Syria.\u201dThe next morning, I visited the boy in one of the centers in Sicily where local governments were housing the migrants. He was chewing a cookie, his mouth full of crumbs as he blew me a kiss. He reminded me that the only difference between his mother and me was that I was born in Tuscany, not in Syria.Many Italians had opened their homes to migrants. Migrant soccer teams were formed. Italy was praised globally for its welcoming, big-hearted embrace. But as migrants kept coming, and were placed in every region of the country, resistance and anger began to bubble up.Castellina now has residents from sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Kosovars, Moroccans, Tunisians, and others. A delegation from the League eventually arrived to protest the latest resettlement, but they failed to stir up much anger \u2014 Tuscany has been a leftist stronghold for decades.I left Castellina in 2005, but am one of the many Italians who crowd trains and buses on Friday evenings to go to their home villages. I often spend my weekends with family and friends, many of whom also live elsewhere but return for visits. One weekend, I heard about a Pakistani woman, Lubna Batool, a doctor, who now lives here. When I visited the school, I met her and her daughter.Ms. Batool had followed her Afghan husband, who was granted a residency permit in Castellina, and she joined him eight years ago, as Italy\u2019s economic crisis had worsened. She worked as a surgeon in southwestern Pakistan, but she has been unable to find a job in Italy. She bought costly textbooks and traveled to Rome to take a complex exam to be credentialed as a doctor.Today, Castellina has only two general practitioners, including my own, Dr. Giuseppe Pacella. One of the thousands of physicians across Italy who is nearing retirement, he is encouraging Ms. Batool\u2019s pursuit of an Italian medical certificate, partly because he worries about who will take his place.\u201cThese people not only have degrees, but are also resilient,\u201d Dr. Pacella told me. \u201cThey went through wars, moves and economic troubles. We need to integrate those who want to work, because we will all benefit from it.\u201dYet coexistence and integration are different. In some ways, Castellina is much as it was when I was living there. The same baker\u2019s shop is there, though the son has now taken over. The jeweler and electronics seller are the same team, a lady and her business partner; they can still fix almost anything, even if their hands are crooked and their eyeglasses thicker.But many of the waiters and dishwashers in restaurants are migrants. So are many farmhands, including Ms. Batool\u2019s husband, Ali Mohammad. I found him one recent morning in the vineyards amid frozen puddles and white frost, tying hooks to the wires that steady the grapevines \u2014 work my grandfather and other ancestors once did.Afterward, some of the farmworkers went to the coffee bar that was my teenage hangout. In the afternoon, our retired postman joined the former tobacco shop vendor and other retirees to play cards in a back room. In the evening, the migrants gathered on the staircase out front, the new face of the town\u2019s social life. The old-timers and the newcomers rarely mix, inhabiting parallel worlds, divided partly by language.Like many of my childhood friends, I have kept my formal residence in Castellina. We pay taxes here. We vote here. But we do not live here. Ours is the generation that left, out of necessity if not happily.Yet my friends are still bound together by our village. When one of our grandparents dies, we all attend the funeral. When someone is married, we all return for the wedding. My heart is at peace when I look out over the vineyards and see the medieval stone tower in the distance.Now, though, Castellina doesn\u2019t belong only to me and my friends. I realized this when I met Bilal El Hartika, 9, who was born in Tuscany to Moroccan parents.I asked if he felt that he belonged here.\u201cI am Moroccan and Italian, from Castellina,\u201d he answered, without hesitation.\u201cThis is my home,\u201d he said, adding in Arabic, \u201cMy \u2018dar.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 There have been far blacker Mondays.\u2022 Kenneth C. Griffin is growing concerned about inflation.\u2022 The Fed\u2019s regulatory action against Wells may have some bite.\u2022 Broadcom puts more pressure on Qualcomm\u2022 How worried should JPMorgan clients be about health care?\u2022 How much more will Wells Fargo have to do?Measured by points, those are steep drops \u2014 the biggest on record for the indexes. The previous largest point declines for each benchmark came in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.But Monday\u2019s plunge was far less impressive on a percentage basis. The Dow\u2019s fall ranked as its 100th biggest, while the S. & P. 500\u2019s slide was the 127th biggest in the index\u2019s history, according to S & P Dow Jones Indices.Here is how Monday\u2019s sell-off stacks up against two other major tumbles.But points are not the best way to compare the magnitude of a stock index\u2019s declines across eras. As the stock market has risen, big point moves have translated into increasingly smaller percentage changes. The Dow and the S. & P. 500 have more than doubled from their closes on Sept. 29, 2008.\u201cBlack Monday\u201d was a petrifying moment \u2014 an even bigger decline in both points and percentage than the stock market crash of 1929. But unlike the 1929 crash, the slide in 1987 did not contribute to a wider economic slump. The stock market recovered its losses by early 1989.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Peter EavisAs the U.S. stock markets look wobbly for the first time in nearly two years, at least one major investor is sounding a bearish tone.In a Jan. 31 letter to investors, Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago hedge-fund firm Citadel, wrote that even though the broader economic backdrop continues to be positive, he sees several warning signs that could turn stock prices downward.The end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy is one factor, Mr. Griffin wrote, that could pressure stocks. But the prospect of inflation, or a rapid rise in the prices of goods and services, is making him especially nervous.\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the nascent signs\u201d of rising inflation in a variety of countries, he wrote. As a result, he added, money managers at Citadel, which runs a variety of hedge funds, are \u201ccarefully positioning\u201d for a surprise, sharp upturn in inflation.Mr. Griffin added that he is also concerned about geopolitical risks, writing that his money managers need to be able to handle negative events if they do occur, \u201cincluding a trade policy misstep or a military conflict.\u201d He did not elaborate.In an interview with CNBC in November, Mr. Griffin said the stock market was in the \u201cseventh inning\u201d of a rally. He said through a spokesman on Monday that he still thinks there are several innings to go before a downturn begins and that he is more bearish on bond prices than stocks at the moment.\u2014 Kate KellyWith 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.The numbers\u202275 percent of companies are reporting earnings above estimates, above the five-year average.\u2022 Companies that are beating estimates are doing so by a 4 percent margin, below the five year average.\u202280 percent of companies have reported revenue above estimates, a record high.\u2022 All 11 sectors are reporting earnings growth.Wells Fargo\u2019s stock is down more than 7 percent Monday, suggesting that investors believe the growth cap will have some bite. With the economy strengthening and interest rates rising, banks can expect to earn higher profits as they make more loans and suffer fewer losses from defaults. Indeed, this optimistic scenario has helped send bank stocks on a tear in recent months. Now, the question is to what degree Wells Fargo will have to sit out the good times.Wells Fargo executives on Friday suggested that the cap would have limited financial impact, saying it would reduce this year\u2019s net profits by $300 million to $400 million, which works out at less than 2 percent of 2017\u2019s earnings. One reason the earnings hit might be small is that the bank can stay within the cap by selling short-term, lower-risk investments that don\u2019t earn much. Another way the bank intends to limit the negative impact is by reducing the amount of deposits on which the bank pays out a relatively high interest rate.Crucially, Wells Fargo said that it hopes to increase the size of its loan book. The hope is that, by shedding the low-risk investments, the bank will create the room to make more mortgages, credit card loans and loans to businesses, while staying within the limit.But it may not turn out to be as straightforward as that.The growth cap comes after a lackluster year for Wells, which reduced its loans 1 percent last year, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent at Bank of America. Investors waiting for catch-up growth at Wells may have to wait still longer. Also, much depends on whether Wells Fargo can now satisfy the Fed\u2019s concerns. Any indication that the bank is struggling to comply with the regulator\u2019s demands could set off more turmoil at the bank. There is also a possibility that the tactic of shedding of low-risk investments while making more loans could increase the overall risk of Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet.Brian Kleinhanzl, a banks analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote on Sunday that the Fed\u2019s action will \u201cmean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,\u201d adding, \u201cWells will also have to maintain the balance sheet while other banks are growing, and we view this as defensive versus peers.\u201d\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 A takeover price of $82 a share, up from its original offer of $70\u2022 A \u201csignificant\u201d breakup fee if a deal were to be halted for antitrust reasons\u2022 A \u201cticking fee\u201d that Broadcom would pay in cash if a deal took more than a year to closeIt said the new \u201cbest and final\u201d offer would be withdrawn if Qualcomm either pushed its annual shareholder meeting back from March 6 (when Broadcom hopes to unseat the entire board) or if it paid more than $110 a share for NXP Semiconductor.Other cryptocurrencies are falling as well. Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin are all down Monday.How far can Bitcoin fall?Simon Tobler, a trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told Bloomberg: \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold the $8,000 level, Bitcoin may fall to $5,000, where the next big support is. The market is lacking big buyers.\u201dMore from Anna Wilde Mathews, Dana Cimilluca and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:In a reflection of the sensitivity of the subject, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon hit the phones Tuesday to assuage clients\u2019 concerns, people familiar with the matter said. So did some of the firm\u2019s health care bankers, who get paid handsomely to help clients with mergers and other deals and worry the move could cost them business.More from Emily Flitter, Binyamin Appelbaum and David Enrich:The settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.From her interview with Judy Woodruff:\u201cI don\u2019t want to label what we\u2019re seeing a bubble \u2014 as a bubble.\u201cBut I would say that asset valuations generally are elevated, and this is a characterization that we have offered up, for example, last summer in our monetary policy report.\u201d\u2022 Getting bigger by merging with another media company doesn\u2019t solve CBS\u2019s problems.

North Korea, hamstrung by sanctions, still relies on exports of coal, clothing and shellfish.In 1988, North Korea did not even participate in the Seoul Olympics, and it mounted a deadly terrorist attack 10 months before the Olympics. On Friday, its delegation will march under a single flag with the South Korean team at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.The display of athletic unity, however, belies the vast gap that has opened between the two countries in the three decades since the Seoul games.Other Communist countries in Asia, including China and Vietnam, saw the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 as a warning, and they quickly reformed their economies and opened their markets. The North remained closed.When the Soviet Union collapsed, the North\u2019s economy soon followed. Floods and drought compounded the situation, leading to a devastating famine. Food in the North is still rationed, with the best goods distributed only to a small group of elites with government connections.By the time of North Korea\u2019s famine, South Korea had become a booming cultural capital, exporting K-pop, its answer to American boy bands, to its former adversaries, China and Japan.Pyongyang, 1996South Korea, 1996South Korea became Asia\u2019s leading exporter of culture \u2014 producing music, movies and television dramas.At one time, both countries could afford to build intricate subways beneath their capitals. But a decade after the Seoul Olympics, only one government could afford to keep its trains running regularly.Pristine and ornate as a national museum, the Pyongyang subway system is little used. Seoul\u2019s subway stations are capitalist showcases plastered with movie posters and makeup ads.Pyongyang, 2005Seoul, 2006Built to showcase North Korean industry and double as atomic bomb shelters, the stations of the Pyongyang metro are decorated with revolutionary propaganda. The train cars, which have not been upgraded in decades, remain mostly empty.Virtually all of North Korea\u2019s early success \u2013 including its subway system \u2013 as well as its later misfortunes can be attributed to the country\u2019s ruling family, the Kims.The same family that ruled North Korea in 1988 rules it today. And the same authoritarianism pioneered by the country\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung, is continued by his grandson, Kim Jong-un.In the North, all public gatherings are organized by the state. In the South, people are free to protest against the government.Pyongyang, 2009Seoul, 2009At the time of the Seoul Games, South Korea had recently emerged from military dictatorship. Just eight years earlier, South Korean military forces massacred students and citizens protesting authoritarian rule.When huge student and labor protests rocked South Korea again in 1987, the government deployed riot police officers and tear gas before eventually agreeing to democratic reforms.Central to the politics of each country in recent years has been the North\u2019s steadfast pursuit of nuclear weapons, which has led to sanctions and isolation.Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s leader, is a veritable recluse who has alienated much of the international community. South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, has pledged to strengthen international alliances.Kim Jong-un, 2017Moon Jae-in with international leaders, 2017With the North participating in this month\u2019s Games, will the two Koreas now begin to converge \u2014 or is it too late?Just a few weeks ago, the idea of the North participating in Games would have been unthinkable. Mr. Kim  spent much of 2017 developing and testing bombs and ballistic missiles in defiance of international  demands.Now, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea says he hopes the Pyeongchang Olympics could end a stalemate and propel the countries to talks.In a sign of the easing tensions, the countries will not only march together during the opening ceremonies but will also compete as a single unified team in women\u2019s ice hockey.Ultimately, two countries that appear so different, even from space \u2014 where the lights of the South far outshine those of the North \u2014 have a shared history much longer than the three decades between Olympics.

{"Headline": "Businesses Look at Washington and Say, \u2018Never Mind, We\u2019ll Do It\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisCan private businesses solve public policy problems better than the government? It\u2019s a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House.There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success \u2014 a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school \u2014 there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be.In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dJoining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care?In announcing they would try, they delivered an implicit rebuke of the complex and costly American health care system, suggesting that the best minds in business could do better.\u201cCompanies are now thinking much more about how to solve larger social problems,\u201d said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. \u201cWhen Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, three leaders in their industries, looked around, they realized that health care is a big issue facing them all.\u201dTheir efforts stem from a feeling that, with partisan bickering and constant campaigning consuming Washington, the onus is on businesses to fill the void left by an ineffective government.The notion that big business might shape government policy is nothing new, of course. Lobbyists have been working to sway lawmakers for decades, and the corporate world was an influential force in the tax overhaul passed last year.Yet for the most part, these efforts were narrowly aligned with a company\u2019s self-interest, usually in the form of lowering taxes and loosening regulations. And rarely have business leaders tried to assume operational control of a government function, let alone something as complex and unwieldy as health care.In recent years, however, more chief executives have begun speaking out on issues that at first glance have little to do with the bottom line, including immigration policy, climate change and gay rights.\u201cThe lack of leadership on the national political level has left this vacuum,\u201d said Kathleen Clark, a professor at the Washington University Law school. \u201cFortunately, there are some business leaders who see that there\u2019s a role for them to play.\u201dThe most vivid expression of this new willingness to speak out came last summer after white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Trump equivocated in his response to the violence.Chief executives may seem like unlikely ethical leaders; Wells Fargo, Equifax, Uber and many more companies have faced questions from Congress about practices that have harmed consumers and in some instances cost taxpayers billions of dollars.But companies have also been wading into moral debates for decades. General Motors and Pepsi pulled out of South Africa during the apartheid era. Apple, Disney and Xerox were early in extending health care benefits to gay and lesbian couples.Similar efforts by chief executives today recall \u201can earlier era of corporate statesmanship,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a fellow at New America, a research and policy institute. \u201cA lot of these business leaders viewed a business as having a somewhat broader public mission.\u201dNow, he said, thanks to \u201cthe rise, over the last 15 years, of the importance of social responsibly and social mission, there is a broad movement in business.\u201dEven Amazon\u2019s much-publicized efforts to select a city for a second headquarters could, in a roundabout way, influence local policymakers. Given that the company is unlikely to set up shop in a state with socially conservative laws that might alienate some employees, \u201cAmazon could have an effect not just on prices but on what legislators pass,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.George Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has been promoting democratic ideals around the globe. And Mr. Zuckerberg, through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, is working on ambitious long-term projects involving science, education and justice.There is a big difference, though, between supporting social causes and research and operating a sprawling public works system. Critics will contend that some of these efforts smack of arrogance, and that businesses ought to stay in their lane and focus on offering excellent products and services, not meddle in public policy.\u201cThere is this hubris, thinking that they can do it better,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.There is also a certain irony to the fact that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan said the new company they had formed would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dThe profit motive, after all, is what leads to efficiency and innovation, according to conventional business school wisdom. Operating as a nonprofit \u201cflies in the face of the logic of the capitalist economy,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.It most likely will take years to determine if the three companies can make good on their promise of building a better health care system. Even if they succeed, the rewards may be limited to their employees \u2014 a large figure, but a small portion of the American work force.Nonetheless, the companies\u2019 push is among the most audacious efforts by the private sector to date, and Mr. Dimon did not shy away from the scope of their ambition.\u201cThe three of our companies have extraordinary resources,\u201d he said on Tuesday when the initiative was announced. \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But just one piece of respectful advice: If your generation and mine want to get serious about a gun control crusade, we all need to get out of Facebook and into someone\u2019s face: the N.R.A.\u2019s.This fight can\u2019t be won on Twitter or Instagram. They do get people into the streets. But social media have created a world of faux activism \u2014 \u201cHey, I tweeted about it\u201d \u2014 that the bad guys take advantage of. The N.R.A. is not just in the chat rooms. It\u2019s in the cloakrooms of Congress and state legislatures. And it\u2019s there with bags of money and votes it uses to reward lawmakers who do its bidding and hurt those who don\u2019t.I loved seeing the 100 students from your high school taking buses Tuesday to Florida\u2019s capital to directly press lawmakers. That\u2019s a great start. I hope every high school follows.But, ultimately, nothing will change unless young and old who oppose the N.R.A. run for office, vote, help someone vote, register someone to vote or help fund someone\u2019s campaign \u2014 so we can threaten the same electoral pain as the National Rifle Association, which, according to PolitiFact, spent $203.2 million between 1998 and 2017 funding its candidates, defeating gun control advocates and lobbying. This is not about persuading people with better ideas. We tried that. It\u2019s about generating raw electoral power and pain.Because most of the G.O.P. members of Congress who do the N.R.A.\u2019s bidding care about only one thing: their jobs. The pay of a typical congressman is $174,000 \u2014 and free parking at Reagan National Airport \u2014 and they will sell themselves to whoever can generate the votes to enable them to keep both.Are some Democratic lawmakers cowards, too? You bet. But I can show you plenty who have bucked their party\u2019s orthodoxies on education and trade and who insisted that their much-admired colleague Senator Al Franken had to resign over sexual harassment allegations. And most of them have long dared to lose elections to oppose the N.R.A. This is primarily a G.O.P. problem today.How do we know that? Read the paper or the web. The G.O.P., which claimed to stand for conservative family values, has prostrated itself before the most indecent person to ever occupy the White House \u2014 a man who lies as he breathes, smears poor, nonwhite nations and reportedly had sex with a porn star shortly after his wife delivered their son. But G.O.P. lawmakers are mute on this because President Trump energizes their base and ensures their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport.This is a party whose evangelicals have been telling us for decades that life is so sacred the G.O.P. must oppose abortion \u2014 even in the case of rape, incest or risk to the mother\u2019s life. But Republicans won\u2019t back common-sense gun laws that would protect fully developed human beings \u2014 because the N.R.A. energizes their base and funds their campaigns and ensures their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport.This is a party whose \u201cFreedom Caucus\u201d was so obsessed with our rising national debt that it tried to prevent Barack Obama from spending a dime to stimulate our economy after it went deep into recession \u2014 but just voted to add $1 trillion to the debt for a corporate tax cut without regard for the burden put on our kids. Republicans did so because Trump energizes their base and ensures that they keep their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport.Trying to embarrass them to act on principle is wasted breath. I suspect they\u2019re already embarrassed. When these G.O.P. lawmakers are alone at home contemplating the pictures of all these kids gunned down in Florida \u2014 thinking about what it\u2019d be like to be one of their parents \u2014 plenty of them probably feel filthy for doing the N.R.A.\u2019s bidding.They know full well that most voters are not asking to scrap the Second Amendment, but for common-sense gun laws that could prevent or reduce more school shootings and would not interfere with any decent Americans\u2019 right to own guns for hunting, sports or self-protection.They know full well that a common-sense banning of all military assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, or mandating universal background checks for gun buyers or to prevent terrorists and the mentally ill from buying guns, would not curb the constitutional right to bear arms.They know full well that they\u2019re in the grip of an N.R.A. cult, whose heart is so frozen, it\u2019s content to watch innocent children and adults get gunned down weekly \u2014 rather than impose common-sense gun limits. They know all of this \u2014 but they suppress it, because they also know if they vote for common-sense gun laws, the N.R.A. will fund their next opponent. Like I said, this is just about raw naked power, and that is what sensible gun control advocates have to generate more of now \u2014 in the form of votes and campaign funding. Otherwise nothing changes.Keep speaking out, Cameron \u2014 but never underestimate what some people will do for a $174,000 job and free parking at Reagan National Airport.Frank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goodbye Castros, Hello Communist Party", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhat are we to make of this succession? One optimistic reading is that this could be the first step toward democracy. A more realistic reading is that Cuba is heading for more of the same: undemocratic one-party rule.If the Cuban Communist Party \u2014 the only party allowed to participate in elections under the one-party regime \u2014 were smart, it would try to get out while the getting is good. By transitioning to democracy on its own terms, the party could reap benefits.Newly configured institutions and laws (for example, electoral laws) could be tailor-made to its advantage. The party could take advantage of this new freedom from the Castros to produce new freedoms for Cubans, thus generating good will that could translate into votes.But the longer the Communists wait, the less viable this exit strategy becomes \u2014 and the more likely that the party will eventually succumb to full-blown regime collapse.Unfortunately for the Cuban people, there are few signs that this option is being considered. Instead, most signs point to a continuation of the status quo \u2014 a succession to a non-Castro, yes, but not a transition to a freer regime. The Cuban regime remains fairly protected from domestic pressures to become more democratic, even if it is ultimately in the Cuban Communist Party\u2019s long-term interests to do so.After the succession, Cuba\u2019s regime will remain cornered by the Castro family, the military and by a regulatory system designed to restrict the growth of business and political organizations, minimizing the pressure to democratize.Perhaps the only possible pressure for greater democracy after the succession could come from a conflict between the party and the military. These are separate entities, each with its own culture, resources and base of support. It is conceivable that an eventual conflict between the party and the military could produce a political earthquake, which could in theory produce a political transition.Mr. Castro understands this better than anyone in Cuba. That is why he may decide to stay in charge of both groups, and as long as that is the case, the potential for a free Cuba will remain limited.Javier Corrales is a professor of political science at Amherst College and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cFixing Democracy: Why Constitutional Change Often Fails to Enhance Democracy in Latin America.\u201d James Loxton is a lecturer in comparative politics at the University of Sydney and the co-editor of the forthcoming \u201cLife after Dictatorship: Authoritarian Successor Parties Worldwide.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Come the Recession, Don\u2019t Count on That Safety Net", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWhat will President Trump\u2019s first recession look like?While the economy is hardly booming, trundling along at an annual growth rate of about 2.5 percent, investors are getting jittery.It is hardly premature to ask, in this light, how the Trump administration might manage the fallout from the economic downturn that everybody knows will happen. Unfortunately, the United States could hardly be less prepared.Not only does the government have precious few tools at its disposal to combat a downturn. By slashing taxes while increasing spending, President Trump and his allies in Congress have further boxed the economy into a corner, reducing the space for emergency government action were it to be needed.Global inequality, after widening for decades, has stabilized. The share of the world\u2019s income captured by the top 1 percent has shrunk since its peak on the eve of the financial crisis.The economists Hilary Hoynes of the University of California, Berkeley, and Marianne Bitler of the University of California, Davis, pointed out in a recent paper that \u201cthe safety net for low-income families with children has transformed from one subsidizing out-of-work families into one subsidizing in-work families.\u201dAnd yet, as many unemployed Americans discovered the last time recession hit, government benefits that require recipients to hold a job become worthless when there is no work to be had.Consider what happened the last time around, when the bursting of the housing bubble pushed millions of workers out of their jobs. The Fed quickly slashed interest rates to zero. Months later it started buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds from financial institutions to lower long-term interest rates and encourage borrowing.The Obama administration hurried to cobble together an economic stimulus package of more than $1 trillion to get money to families that needed it most. It expanded the eligibility for unemployment insurance to its longest duration ever, 99 weeks. It raised the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers. It more than doubled the budget for food stamps \u2014 the poor\u2019s last line of defense.The economy failed to snap back as the administration hoped. Unemployment remained at 9 percent or more for over two years. But the administration\u2019s intervention to bolster the nation\u2019s welfare programs made a decisive difference for millions who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks of the nation\u2019s threadbare safety net.Had food stamps not been available, they estimated, the share of Americans under 65 living below the poverty line would have exceeded 11 percent in 2010, almost 1.5 percentage points more than was the case. The share of Americans in extreme poverty \u2014 with less than half the resources of the simply poor \u2014 would have exceeded 4 percent, about a third more than it turned out to be. Unemployment insurance had a roughly similar impact on poverty levels.What is critical to note is that each of the two programs did more to relieve extreme poverty during the depths of the Great Recession than even the earned-income tax credit, the main source of government support for low-income Americans.This is a problem for vulnerable Americans bracing for the next economic shock, because if Mr. Trump and his colleagues in Congress have their way, the only surviving bit of the social safety net when the next recession hits will probably require beneficiaries to work. The earned-income tax credit is likely to survive unscathed. Food stamps are not.Assiduously looking for places to cut spending to temper a growing budget deficit, the White House seems more than willing to pare the safety net. The budget it unveiled this month called for a 27 percent cut to the food stamp budget and a 20 percent cut to Section 8 housing assistance by 2028.Policy could change in the face of a new economic downturn, to be sure. There are plenty of places where the social safety net could be improved. The Russell Sage proposals include everything from a universal child allowance to a renter\u2019s tax credit; from subsidizing employment to a public works program paying a living wage.Yet somehow I can\u2019t see Mr. Trump and Republican allies like the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, allowing able-bodied Americans off the hook. They may not quite endorse the infamous words attributed by President Herbert Hoover to his Treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon, as the Great Depression bore down on the economy \u2014 \u201cLiquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate\u201d \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if all they have to say when the next recession liquidates work is \u201cGet a job.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As executives tell investors what they intend to do with their tax savings and their spending plans are tabulated into neat charts and graphs, the reports jibe with what most experts said would happen: Companies are rewarding their stockholders.Businesses are buying back shares, which creates demand for the stocks, boosts share prices and benefits investors. Some of the cash is going to increase dividends. And a chunk will go to acquiring other businesses, creating larger corporations that face less competition.Those crumbs, by the way, disappear after a few years. Further, many taxpayers in states like California, New Jersey and New York will be hit with higher tax bills when they file their 2018 tax returns and realize that they can now only deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes.There was a legitimate argument for reforming the tax code in a way that reduced the corporate tax rate, closed loopholes and made the economy fairer and more productive.

{"Headline": "The Virtue of Radical Honesty", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week I asked a group of students at the University of Chicago a question I\u2019m asking students around the country: Who are your heroes? There\u2019s always a long pause after I ask. But eventually one of the students suggested Steven Pinker. Another chimed in Jonathan Haidt. There was general nodding around the table.That was interesting. Both men are psychology professors, at Harvard and N.Y.U., who bravely stand against what can be the smothering orthodoxy that inhibits thought on campus, but not from the familiar conservative position.For example, we\u2019re all aware of the gloomy statistics around wage stagnation and income inequality, but Pinker contends that we should not be nostalgic for the economy of the 1950s, when jobs were plentiful and unions strong. A third of American children lived in poverty. Sixty percent of seniors had incomes below $1,000 a year. Only half the population had any savings in the bank at all.Between 1979 and 2014, meanwhile, the percentage of poor Americans dropped to 20 percent from 24 percent. The percentage of lower-middle-class Americans dropped to 17 from 24. The percentage of Americans who were upper middle class (earning $100,000 to $350,000) shot upward to 30 percent from 13 percent.There\u2019s a fair bit of social mobility. Half of all Americans wind up in the top 10 percent of earners at at least one point in their career. One in nine spend some time in the top 1 percent.America has a pretty big safety net. Our numbers look bad because so much of our health care spending is funneled through employers, but when you add this private social spending to state social spending, America has the second-highest level of such spending of the 35 nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, after France.Pinker has data like this in sphere after sphere, marking the progress we\u2019ve made in health, the environment, safety, knowledge and overall happiness. So is he right, that society is in much better shape than we\u2019re allowing?In part, but not totally. Pinker\u2019s philosophical lens prevents him from seeing where the real problems lie. He calls himself an Enlightenment man, but he\u2019s really a scientific rationalist. He puts tremendous emphasis on the value of individual reason. The key to progress is information \u2014 making ourselves better informed. The key sin in the world is a result either of entropy, the randomness that is built into any system, or faith \u2014 dogma clouding reason.The big problem with his rationalistic worldview is that while he charts the way individuals have benefited over the centuries, he spends barely any time on the quality of the relationships between individuals.That is to say, Pinker doesn\u2019t spend much time on the decline of social trust, the breakdown of family life, the polarization of national life, the spread of tribal mentalities, the rise of narcissism, the decline of social capital, the rising alienation from institutions or the decline of citizenship and neighborliness. It\u2019s simply impossible to tell any good-news story when looking at the data from these moral, social and emotional spheres.Pinker is a paragon of exactly the kind of intellectual honesty and courage we need to restore conversation and community, and the students are right to revere him.But today\u2019s situation reminds us of the weakness of the sort of Cartesian rationalism Pinker champions and represents. Conscious reason can get you only so far when tribal emotions have been aroused, when existential fears rain down, when narcissistic impulses have been given free rein, when spiritual longings have nowhere healthy to go, when social trust has been devastated, when all the unconscious networks that make up 99 percent of our thinking are aflame and disordered.Our problems are relational. I don\u2019t know about yours, but after the CNN Town Hall Wednesday night, my Twitter feed was aflame, with two raging warring camps. If we had an emotionally healthy polity, it would be completely easy to pass eight or 10 sensible restrictions to at least make it harder for lonely attention-seekers to get guns. But our nation is emotionally sick.Pinker\u2019s rationalism is not the total cure. But I have to confess, I really like him. A few years ago the magazine Moment gave genetic tests to a bunch of writers with Jewish heritage. The tests reveal that Pinker and I are third cousins. Learning of this kinship tie, I now feel special affection for him. Why? There\u2019s no rational, scientific reason. I just do.Advertisement"}

And I do some online research through Tor, a browser that masks your online address so sites can\u2019t track your physical location. I also use DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn\u2019t store your search history.My wariness of tracking developed when I was a cub reporter in Moscow. On one of my first stories there, I invited a Russian legislator, who was a democracy advocate, to lunch at a restaurant near the Kremlin. She arrived and immediately started combing through a vase of flowers on the table, checking for government listening devices. After that, I often interviewed Russian democracy activists during walks in local parks and forests.It made an impression on me that even the mere idea of being surveilled can chill people\u2019s behavior.Now I view privacy not so much as the ability to keep your personal details away from prying government agencies or companies. Privacy is the right to choose which entities access information about you, control how those entities use your data, check the fairness of data-based decisions made about you, and correct errors.One tool I use on my laptop is Disconnect, a service that shows you the third parties tracking you on every site. When I was reading articles this morning about the Trump administration, Disconnect counted 78 advertising networks, analytics services and others tracking me on HuffPost; 24 trackers on The New York Times site, and 19 on The Washington Post.What could be better about some of these tools?ProtonMail can be cumbersome. The service encrypts your emails before they reach the ProtonMail server. As a result, you can\u2019t search the texts of your emails for keywords if you use the free service. You can search only the subject lines.It\u2019s a constant reminder that ceding to online surveillance is much more frictionless than trying to limit it.Even small user-interface changes could make a big difference. Imagine if the default setting for streaming video services wasn\u2019t autoplay.On a larger level, we\u2019ve seen over the past year how some Big Tech companies initially refused to take responsibility for the spread of fake news and other side effects of their innovations. In that context, platforms that nudge children and adults to stay online are merely one symptom of a much bigger problem.There\u2019s huge hype around the idea that tech can improve education. Same goes for health.So far, however, there\u2019s not much rigorous evidence that learning apps on their own improve students\u2019 educational results. Likewise, there is little hard evidence that health apps by themselves reduce disease.Still, I\u2019m optimistic about the potential for software in health.That\u2019s partly because a few tech companies are participating in rigorous studies, called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, researchers randomly select some volunteers to try a new intervention. By comparing the results in the treated and untreated groups, researchers could identify apps that do make significant health contributions.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your daily life? Right now, my family is on a bit of a Brit TV binge. We just watched the second season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d the fictional series on Queen Elizabeth II, and \u201cThe Coronation,\u201d a glowing documentary featuring the real QE2.

Should they collapse, which on any given day does not seem a preposterous thought, the city would come treacherously close to having to put up a \u201cgoing out of business\u201d sign. The state might as well then summon the clergy to perform last rites on its own economy. But instead of desperately needed unity, we have two leaders and their surrogates engaged in a fruitless back and forth over who is historically responsible, who owes how much money, and who got us into this mess.Warring between mayors and governors is as natural in New York as jaywalking. But the tough-guy act performed, each in his own way, by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio is singularly corrosive because the welfare of nearly six million daily subway riders is at stake. It is shocking how little progress on bridging differences has been made since the governor declared a state of emergency seven months ago. It feels like \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d only far less entertaining, with the same points made over and over.Each side seeks to bolster its case by hauling out documents so old and long-ignored that they are about as relevant to this emergency as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Each also has a knack for getting under the other\u2019s skin, needlessly so.For his part, Mr. Cuomo has elbows sharper than Freddy Krueger fingers, and he keeps swinging them. He proposed creating special tax districts in neighborhoods where property values go up because of new transit projects like the Second Avenue subway. The goal would be to \u201ccapture\u201d increased property tax revenue to benefit the M.T.A.The concept is not without merit: If real estate is worth more because a subway is nearby, why not peel off some of the wealth to keep the rails in shape?

Naturally, they pushed back.But Mr. de Blasio has an important role to play as well. It is past time for the two of them, governor and mayor, to get it together on transit.

{"Headline": "4 Israelis Hurt by Bomb Set in Flag at Gaza Fence, Igniting Night of Fighting", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Four Israeli soldiers were wounded Saturday, two of them severely, by an explosive device that the Israeli military said had been attached to a Palestinian flag and placed along the Gaza border during protests there on Friday.Israel responded, first, quickly, with tank fire on a Palestinian observation post near the scene of the explosion, and then \u2014 after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the episode \u201csevere\u201d and promised to \u201crespond appropriately\u201d \u2014 with airstrikes on six targets. That led to an exchange of rockets from Gaza, more tank fire from Israel and a second wave of air attacks early Sunday.All told, it was some of the bloodiest fighting between Israel and Gaza since the seven-week war in the summer of 2014 that Israel called Operation Protective Edge.The Popular Resistance Committees, a militant offshoot of Fatah that has specialized in setting roadside bombs and other explosive devices, praised the attack, saying on its website that the \u201cheroic operation\u201d showed a \u201creadiness to defend the Palestinian people\u201d against Israeli attacks.Late Saturday, Israel said it had hit six targets, including an attack tunnel being dug by Hamas toward Israel from Zeitoun, a neighborhood in the south of Gaza City; a Hamas military compound, including a weapons manufacturing facility, in the area of Deir El Balah, in central Gaza; and another military compound near Khan Younis, in the southern end of the strip.\u201cWe, from our perspective, don\u2019t care too much which organization pulled the trigger,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, the spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. \u201cFor us, there\u2019s one address, and that\u2019s Hamas. They are the ones who control access to the fence. Nobody has access to it without Hamas\u2019s approval.\u201dHealth officials in Gaza had confirmed two injuries as of 11 p.m. Hamas said it had fired on Israeli jets, but Israel said its planes all returned to base safely.After the airstrikes, air-raid sirens sounded in southern Israel, and Israel said a rocket fired from Gaza had landed on the roof of the safe room in a home in Sha\u2019ar HaNegev, which girds the northeastern corner of Gaza. But the rocket did not explode on impact, according to Israeli news reports.A second wave of Israeli airstrikes, around 2:30 a.m. Sunday, hit 10 targets in all, eight of them near Deir El Balah, the Israeli military said. False alarms set off sirens in southern Israel during the strikes early Sunday, it said.Already beleaguered by Israel\u2019s decade-old blockade of the strip, Gazans were made to suffer even more last year when the Palestinian Authority, run by Fatah, imposed harsh new restrictions in a power struggle with Hamas, its archrival. An attempt at reconciliation between the two last fall has since bogged down, and a standoff over salaries and revenue has sent the territory\u2019s economy into free-fall, with many expecting a war with Israel as a result.Colonel Conricus said the Israeli soldiers, whose injuries were not life-threatening, were hurt as they inspected a Palestinian flag that had been placed along the Gaza-Israel fence Friday morning amid a chaotic riot of hundreds of protesters, who were throwing rocks and trying to tear down the fence \u2014 and who were also obscured from view by a morning fog.He said the episode showed that Israel was right to treat protests at the Gaza fence as a military threat.\u201cWe\u2019ve been speaking about these staged riots for a long time,\u201d Colonel Conricus said. \u201cWhen Hamas organizes these riots and pushes people towards the fence, what we\u2019re saying is, this isn\u2019t a peaceful demonstration, these people aren\u2019t unarmed, they\u2019re rioters \u2014 and among the rioters are actual terrorist operatives who have other things in mind.\u201dAsked by an Israeli journalist, Ronen Bergman, if it would violate the new law for him to discuss how his Jewish parents had only escaped from Poland because they learned that their neighbors were about to inform on them to the Nazis, Mr. Morawiecki said that \u201cof course\u201d it was \u201cnot going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian,\u201d in addition to Germans.\u201cThe Polish prime minister\u2019s remarks here in Munich are outrageous,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cThere is a problem here of an inability to understand history and a lack of sensitivity to the tragedy of our people. I intend to speak with him forthwith.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the response of the Popular Resistance Committees, a militant offshoot of Fatah, to a bombing that wounded four Israeli soldiers. The group did not claim responsibility for planting the explosive device, but praised the attack as a \u201cheroic operation.\u201dIyad Abuheweila contributed reporting from Gaza City.Advertisement"}

Il Duce, head bald and arms akimbo, advertised \u201cI\u2019m Back,\u201d a satirical film imagining the dictator\u2019s return to modern-day Italy.In many ways, the poster symbolized the debate on Mussolini \u2014 or at least the violent nationalism that fueled his rise \u2014 that has returned with force to the country as critical elections loom on March 4.The re-emergence of extremist violence, harassment and xenophobia has gripped Italy and forced the country to reckon with the hard-right and fascist ideologies fueled by a lingering financial crisis and migration.But it has also spurred a countermovement. Demonstrators marched in Rome on Saturday to stand up to fascism.\u201cWe are here to say no to fascism and racism, which are a danger today for democracy and coexistence,\u201d Carla Nespolo, the president of the National Association of Italian Partisans, said at the national demonstration that brought thousands to the streets under the hash tags #FascismNeverAgain and #RacismNeverAgain.\u201cIt\u2019s said that if you don\u2019t know your history you are doomed to living it again. We don\u2019t want to repeat the tragedies of fascism and Nazism,\u201d Ms. Nespolo said. She added that what frightened her most was the \u201cindifference, superficiality and ignorance\u201d that allowed fascist ideologies to take root.Interior Minister Marco Minniti described the shootings as an \u201cevident display of racial hatred.\u201dForza Nuova, a far-right party that marches with the straight-armed salute of Mussolini, has repeatedly clashed with the police and anti-fascist protesters.This past week, Italy\u2019s intelligence services published an annual report that noted increased activity by left-wing anarchist groups, as well as the growing dynamism and appeal of radical right groups, especially among young people.Presenting the report, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said that Italy\u2019s spies were working to ensure that the \u201crisk of internal radicalization\u201d and \u201cpolitical extremism\u201d could never again spawn the \u201cgerms of subversion\u201d in the country.When he first came to power, in 1994, he governed in a coalition that included the post-fascist Italian Social Movement, or M.S.I., which was founded by Mussolini\u2019s supporters some 50 years earlier. (Brothers of Italy is an offshoot of M.S.I.)Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s current allies promote Italian nationalism and conservatism, seeking to defend against the Islamization of Italy and banning migration from underdeveloped countries.\u201cThere is nothing moderate about the Brothers of Italy or the League,\u201d said Andrea Mammone, a historian at Royal Holloway at the University of London, who writes on nationalism and the far right in Italy. \u201cIf those aren\u2019t extreme-right themes perpetuated by neo-fascist parties, what are?\u201d\u201cI never thought we\u2019d get to this point again,\u201d Patrizia Manfroni, a retired office worker, said of the climate of violence in Italy. \u201cThis intolerance is frightening; it\u2019s as though we\u2019ve forgotten that Italians were among the millions who migrated to other countries with a cardboard suitcase in hand.\u201d\u201cItaly is not Hungary or Poland,\u201d she added in a telephone interview before the march. In the other countries, she said, racist propaganda has become commonplace and a recent rally in Warsaw by far-right nationalists drew 60,000.The National Association of Italian Partisans, known by the initials A.N.P.I. for its Italian name, has been circulating a petition to ban neo-fascist parties like CasaPound \u2014 whose leader, Simone Di Stefano, is running for prime minister \u2014 and Forza Nuova from participating in any future elections.\u201cThey claim they aren\u2019t fascist, they say they are Italians for Italians \u2014 but it\u2019s just camouflage,\u201d Ms. Nespolo said.For some experts, like Marco Tarchi, a professor at the University of Florence who studies the Italian right, the ultraright groups are a \u201cmarginal phenomenon\u201d that won\u2019t pull in many votes.\u201cI doubt that they will get more than 1.5 to 2 percent,\u201d or about one in every 200 voters, Mr. Tarchi wrote in an email. That is not enough to have seats in Parliament, which has a 3 percent threshold.Regardless of the electoral outcome, the message these parties convey should be of concern, analysts say.\u201cLike the fascism of the past, the movements of today put Italians first, and everything that is seen as foreign must be banished,\u201d Mr. Mammone said. \u201cTo bring forward such policies in today\u2019s global scenario is worrisome because we don\u2019t know what the outcome could be.\u201dCompared to the German film, the Italian version \u201cshows a much-less hostile response with respect to our dictator,\u201d the director, Luca Miniero, said in an interview. \u201cHere, people who aren\u2019t necessarily on the right aren\u2019t disturbed by the presence of this Mussolini.\u201dMr. Miniero ascribed the benevolence less to the re-emergence of fascism than to what he called a \u201cconfusion\u201d that prevails in Italy, \u201cwhere intolerance and racism have become part of society, mostly because of social media.\u201dThe film, he added, \u201cis more a warning about populism than fascism,\u201d as well as a reflection on a country that has lost its historical memory.Mussolini\u2019s atrocities are barely mentioned because, Mr. Miniero said, \u201cyou should know what happened.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t know, then I am showing you that you should know.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In fact, we recently deployed more capital as we see a more attractive opportunity set.\u201dWall Street watchers should ask:Goldman\u2019s first-quarter earnings could offer clues.What Blue Apron reported\u2022 For the fourth quarter, the company reported a 13 percent year-on-year drop in revenue, to $187.7 million \u2014 less than analysts had expected.\u2022 It also reported a $39 million loss for the quarter, again a smaller loss than expected.\u2022 Both the cost of goods sold and marketing expenditures were down from the year-ago period.\u2022 The company\u2019s customer rolls dropped 15 percent year-on-year to 746,000, though the company said that was to be expected from the lower marketing spend.\u2022 The average orders per customer and revenue per customer each rose a tiny bit.Blue Apron\u2019s ability to hold the line on marketing expenses was probably the most promising sign, though that was in part because management was also focused on improving operations at the company\u2019s distribution center in Linden, N.J.The HelloFresh perspectiveHere\u2019s what its C.E.O., Dominik Richter, told me last week about why the meal-kit business isn\u2019t doomed, necessarily:\u2022 His company has managed to make its marketing profitable, with every dollar spent turning into $3 in sales.\u2022 Though the company overall has run a loss \u2014 93 million euro, or $115 million, in the 2016 fiscal year \u2014 it has shown profitability in some of its markets. Mr. Richter contended that the company could become profitable this year. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we need to strive for or put a lot of effort into,\u201d he said.\u2022 He added that he doesn\u2019t see supermarkets selling their own meal kits as true competitors, running counter to investor fears that the combined Amazon/Whole Foods portends doom for smaller competitors. \u201cWe have more in common with Chipotle or a fast-casual chain,\u201d he said.The tale of the tapeBlue Apron\u2019s shares are down 66 percent since their debut.

One of my most important responsibilities is succession, and I am blessed to have a spectacular leader and investor like Jon Gray to whom I can hand the reins,\u201d Mr. James said.The Federal Reserve chairman took his position this year facing plenty of economic factors that could stoke inflation, including:\u2022 Resurgent global economies\u2022 Years of cheap and plentiful credit\u2022 Joblessness falling to multiyear lows, making it easier for workers to get a raise or a bonus, which could push up companies\u2019 costsThen the Fed\u2019s job got harder. Congress passed a large tax cut that will add a jolt of stimulus to an economy that no longer needs extra juice. The stock market loved it and kept zooming higher.But turbulence hit. On Feb. 5, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted over 1,100 points, or 4.6 percent.That brought some much-needed caution\u2022 Investors in the stock market, down 7.6 percent from its high, now know the party can\u2019t go on uninterrupted.\u2022 People are having a real debate about inflation.In other words, nose-diving stocks did Mr. Powell a favor: They threw some cold water on the animal spirits that Congress whipped up.The notes of cautionThe best scenario for the Fed is that the rate hikes forecast for this year are enough to also limit the stimulus from the tax overhaul.Meanwhile, to finance the deficit, the Treasury Department now has to sell more billions of dollars of extra bonds. The huge new government demand for credit could push up interest rates in the markets. The Fed may be fine with that, given that it is expected to raise interest rates this year. But if interest rates in the bond market spike higher than investors expect, or the Fed is happy with, Mr. Powell would face his first big challenge as Fed chairman.\u2014 Peter EavisIn its prime, Chipotle Mexican Grill positioned itself as the paragon of clean, casual, cool dining, a darling of Wall Street, a restaurant industry innovator.Basically, nothing like Taco Bell.How the tables have turned.

{"Headline": "Trump Threatens New Trade Penalties, but It Could Be a Hard Bargain", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Monday that the United States would soon announce a \u201creciprocal tax\u201d on countries that take advantage of the United States on trade, including trading partners he described as \u201cso-called allies.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll send in their product, and we won\u2019t charge them anything,\u201d the president said during a meeting with mayors and governors to discuss his proposal for rebuilding American infrastructure. \u201cAnd we send them our product \u2014 same product as they\u2019re sending us \u2014 and they\u2019ll charge us 50 and 75 percent tax, and that\u2019s very unfair.\u201dThough the president said more information would be forthcoming as soon as this week, White House officials quickly played down his comments, with one senior administration official saying that the proposal was \u201cnothing formal right now.\u201d\u201cThe reciprocal tax is, simply, what you do to us, we\u2019ll do to you,\u201d the official said.But when it comes to imposing reciprocal tariffs, trade analysts said the president\u2019s hands were somewhat tied. The relatively low tariffs that the United States charges on many foreign goods were hammered out through decades of bargaining and bartering at the World Trade Organization.Tariffs charged on individual products in various countries can vary widely. Most countries, especially wealthier ones like the United States, have relatively low tariffs on imports but may have negotiated at the W.T.O. to protect some sensitive industries with a higher tariff.The W.T.O. might have the authority to overrule the administration should it enact new tariffs, an action that would then allow other countries to raise their own tariffs on American products as a punishment. To substantially raise its tariffs, the United States would most likely have to leave the W.T.O. \u2014 a prospect that could damage the American economy given how globally integrated many companies have become.On Tuesday, the president will meet with lawmakers, including Ohio\u2019s senators \u2014 Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, and Rob Portman, a Republican \u2014 to discuss an ongoing investigation into whether steel imports pose a national security threat by harming that industry in America. The administration began the investigation last spring, but the results were delayed amid pushback from economic and defense advisers. Senators Brown and Portman both support the tariffs.The administration is also weighing actions to penalize China for what it says is infringement on American intellectual property. That could result in tariffs on high-tech Chinese products, or restrictions on some kinds of Chinese investment in the United States.\u201cWe cannot continue to be taken advantage of by other countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday. \u201cWe cannot continue to let people come into our country and rob us blind, and charge us tremendous tariffs and taxes, and we charge them nothing.\u201dHe added that the United States was losing \u201cvast amounts of money with China and Japan and South Korea and so many other countries.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve gotten away with murder for 25 years,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to be changing policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tillerson\u2019s Attempt to Mend Ties in Latin America", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMEXICO CITY \u2014 Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s five-country trip to Latin America and the Caribbean didn\u2019t start well.In a region that has suffered countless United States interventions in the name of the Monroe Doctrine, invoking it as a legitimate guide for American foreign policy is only slightly better than advocating the \u201cwhite man\u2019s burden.\u201dFor the past year, the Trump administration has consistently offended many of the basic tenets of hemispheric relations. What made the embrace of the Monroe Doctrine so surprising \u2014 though it was intended as a warning of creeping Chinese influence in the region \u2014 was that the unstated purpose of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s six-day swing through Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Jamaica was to repair some of that damage from the past year and attempt to shore up regional support for isolating Venezuela\u2019s autocratic government.While in the end Mr. Tillerson may have achieved his basic goal of securing support for tighter sanctions on the Venezuelan government, it was a narrow victory in a region where the United States has broad, varied interests.The comment was an insult to Washington\u2019s partners in their decades-long war on drugs. All of the countries \u2014 three of which Mr. Tillerson would visit on his trip \u2014 have been solid allies in tackling the narcotics problem. Those governments and their people have borne the brunt of America\u2019s appetite for drugs and its longstanding strategy of focusing on the \u201csupply side\u201d \u2014 until the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama increased the focus on demand.Violence, economic upheaval, corruption, organized crime, civil war and the hollowing out of state authority in Latin America have been the results \u2014 hardly a laughing matter for any of these countries. As President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia said with Mr. Tillerson standing next to him, \u201cWe have lost our best leaders, our best journalists, our best judges, our best policemen in this war against drugs.\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s latest insult and the clumsy curtain raiser in Austin, Mr. Tillerson tried to hit all the right notes on the trip. In Mexico he emphasized Nafta\u2019s importance to the American economy, proudly declaring that the trade deal employed more than three million American workers and that it just needed to be \u201cupdated\u201d (avoiding Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to end it altogether). In Argentina, he and his counterpart, Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie, talked about opening the United States market to Argentine fruits and vegetables \u2014 an important deal for the Argentines.As the trip progressed it appeared as though Mr. Tillerson achieved his narrow goal. The governments that received him appeared willing to declare illegitimate the plan of the Maduro government of Venezuela to hold an early presidential election in April and refuse to recognize any government that resulted from the ballot.And as the secretary hopscotched his way across the region, he also spoke more of the possibility of Washington\u2019s applying sanctions on Venezuelan oil imports and the refinement of Venezuelan crude in the United States, an indication that his various hosts were willing to accept stronger efforts to close off Venezuela\u2019s most important petroleum market. By the end, Mr. Tillerson quietly boasted that this was now on the table and that Mr. Trump would ultimately decide.Was Mr. Tillerson\u2019s trip a success?While a tougher collective response to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s march to autocracy and the looming state collapse is necessary and long overdue, the United States has a diverse range of interests that go beyond mobilizing action against Venezuela. Battling narcotics trafficking with local partner governments, expanding markets for American businesses, promoting broad-based prosperity, and defending democracy and human rights \u2014 not just in Venezuela and Cuba but in other countries like Honduras \u2014 are equally important.But the administration\u2019s rhetoric on immigration, free trade and American allies\u2019 commitment to battling the scourge of narcotics \u2014 not to mention Mr. Tillerson\u2019s embrace of the Monroe Doctrine \u2014 have weakened Washington\u2019s leverage throughout Latin America, as the declining popular approval of the Trump administration demonstrates.Mr. Tillerson may have incrementally improved America\u2019s standing in the region, but with all his baggage, he couldn\u2019t fully restore it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At U.S. Urging, Pakistan to Be Placed on Terrorism-Financing List", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Miftah Ismail, a financial adviser to Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, said he expected Pakistan to be placed on the list in June, after the country and the task force agreed on an action plan.In addition, a former high-level Pakistani official, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize relationships with current negotiators for the government, said that members of the task force had decided to place Pakistan on the list as of June.Pakistan had been on the list from 2012 to 2015.It has counted on allies like China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey to block the United States-led effort to put the country back on the so-called gray list of nations that are not doing enough to counter terrorism financing.Pakistan fears that the move will widen the country\u2019s international isolation, damage its already emaciated economy, hurt its banking sector and hinder its access to international markets as it prepares to repay about $3 billion in debt this summer.When China \u2014 along with the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2014 backed out of the effort to block the move, Pakistani officials appeared resigned. Shireen Mazari, an opposition politician, said in a Twitter post that the country\u2019s reappearance on the list was a \u201cmajor disaster for foreign policy and diplomacy.\u201dA spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Mohammad Faisal, said at a news briefing on Friday that the country would await an official statement from the task force. \u201cOnce things get clearer, we will be able to comment,\u201d Mr. Faisal said.Alexandra Wijmenga-Daniel, a spokeswoman for the task force, known as F.A.T.F., would not comment on the news reports, saying only that \u201cPakistan was subject to F.A.T.F. monitoring in the past,\u201d and \u201cexited this process in 2015.\u201dThe task force was created in 1989 to fight money laundering before its mandate extended to fight terrorism financing. While the group does not issue binding requirements or sanctions, countries placed on its list face intense international scrutiny and financial pressure.The United States led the effort to nominate Pakistan as part of a broader strategy to pressure the country to cut alleged links to Islamist militants causing chaos in Afghanistan.\u201cPakistan has had a full-speed locomotive train coming its way since 2005, and despite dozens of meetings and warnings, Pakistan has failed to grasp the situation,\u201d Mosharraf Zaidi, a foreign-policy commentator and newspaper columnist, said in an interview on Friday.He was referring to the year that Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant group accused of carrying out the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, India, was put on a United Nations list of global terrorist groups. The United States, India and other Western countries have repeatedly called for Pakistan to take stronger action against a charity that acts as a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba.But Pakistan said most of the concerns had been addressed since 2015. The State Bank of Pakistan introduced a comprehensive set of new rules against money laundering and terror financing, officials said. Parliament approved legislation to tackle money laundering. And an independent financial monitoring unit was established with the sole mandate of receiving, analyzing and disseminating suspicious currency transaction reports.Lashkar-e-Taiba, however, has continued fund-raising even as officials have seized its properties. The group\u2019s founder, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, remains free despite an American bounty of $10 million. Last year, Mr. Saeed started a political party, the Milli Muslim League, raising concerns that the group was trying to gain legitimacy.On Jan. 20, the United States and Britain jointly submitted a letter to the global task force nominating Pakistan for the list. France and Germany subsequently backed the move.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, and Sewell Chan from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The G.O.P. Is Flirting With Fiscal Disaster", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn August 2015, the leading Washington budget watchdog predicted that the federal deficit would total about $600 billion the next year.Now, just about two and a half years later, the projected gap for 2019 has grown to $1.2 trillion, in large part because of a boisterous round of tax cuts and spending increases. And if history is any guide, when the books close, the final number will be higher.That amounts to a shortfall that will rival the deficits of a decade ago, when the economy was struggling to recover from the financial crisis and ensuing recession.But while fiscal stimulus to restore economic growth has merit, staggering deficits in the ninth year of a recovery, with unemployment down to 4.1 percent, make no sense.In addition to piling more debt onto the current $20 trillion of outstanding obligations, today\u2019s mounting gap between revenues and expenses is already contributing to higher interest rates and the shakiness in the stock market.Leading the charge into rising amounts of red ink have been the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.Yes, blame for what is likely to be $15 trillion of added debt over the next 10 years should be placed squarely on the self-proclaimed party of fiscal responsibility.\u201cThe level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable,\u201d the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said in 2016. Referring to President Obama\u2019s stimulus program, he added, \u201cWe borrowed $1 trillion and nobody could find that it did much of anything.\u201dThat was then and this is now.On top of insisting that the nation needed tax cuts that could total $2.1 trillion over the next decade, the Republicans clamored for large increases in military spending. As the price for their cooperation, the Democrats won an equal increase in domestic spending.Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, but that\u2019s just not responsible governing. While I\u2019m all for meeting pressing needs, as part of doing so, both the White House and the Congress have an obligation to find other savings or sources of revenues. Just like every household and business must.I recognize that those of us who have warned of the ominous consequences of deficit and debt have yet to be proven right by a market crisis or the like. And the current gyrations in both stocks and bonds may not turn out to constitute that proof.However, never in the 35 years since Ronald Reagan managed to eradicate fear of deficits from the national psyche have we flirted so aggressively with potential fiscal disaster.For one thing, on present course and speed, deficits of more than $1 trillion will persist indefinitely. Indeed, if current policies are maintained, the gap would exceed $2 trillion by 2027, according to calculations by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.That would mean that the amount of debt relative to the size of our economy (the ratio of debt to gross domestic product) could reach a record 109 percent by 2027, exceeding even post-World War II levels.For another, for the first time since at least the 1960s, we have thrown a deficit log onto a fire that was already burning briskly. That Vietnam War era decision \u2014 that we could have both guns and butter \u2014 contributed meaningfully to the raging inflation that erupted a few years later.Although inflation has been quiescent so far in this recovery, potential pressure from rising wages has begun to appear, particularly in last week\u2019s unemployment report.While we all want to see pay go up, particularly for working-class Americans, excessive wage increases can become excessive price increases, which would in turn force the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates faster than it would otherwise.The bond market, which can serve as a kind of early warning signal of overheating, has been signaling concerns for several weeks. The yield on 10 year Treasury notes, which had been loitering around 2.35 percent, has jumped to 2.8 percent.That may not sound like much, but in the world of bonds, rates generally don\u2019t move that far that fast. Importantly, higher interest rates are the enemy of stock prices. As yields rise, investors begin to shift money from equities to debt, depressing valuations of the former. That may well be a part of what is now occurring.Having lived for nearly 15 years with high deficits and low inflation, Americans may have become inured to the risks of bad budget policy.As unattractive as the policy options are (essentially, raising taxes or finding spending that we are willing to cut), we would all be well advised to take on the challenge before it is too late.Steven Rattner, who was a counselor in the Obama Treasury Department, is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Gaza in Financial Crisis, Fears That \u2018an Explosion\u2019s Coming\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGAZA CITY \u2014 The payday line at a downtown A.T.M. here in Gaza City was dozens deep with government clerks and pensioners, waiting to get what cash they could.Muhammad Abu Shaaban, 45, forced into retirement two months ago, stood six hours to withdraw a $285 monthly check \u2014 a steep reduction from his $1,320 salary as a member of the Palestinian Authority\u2019s presidential guard.\u201cLife has become completely different,\u201d Mr. Abu Shaaban said, his eyes welling up. He has stopped paying a son\u2019s college tuition. He buys his wife vegetables to cook for their six children, not meat.And the pay he had just collected was almost entirely spoken for to pay off last month\u2019s grocery bills. \u201cAt most, I\u2019ll have no money left in five days,\u201d he said.Across Gaza, the densely populated enclave of two million Palestinians sandwiched between Israel and Egypt, daily life, long a struggle, is unraveling before people\u2019s eyes.At the heart of the crisis \u2014 and its most immediate cause \u2014 is a crushing financial squeeze, the result of a tense standoff between Hamas, the militant Islamist group that rules Gaza, and Fatah, the secular party entrenched on the West Bank. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority but was driven out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007.At grocery stores, beggars jostle with middle-class shoppers, who sheepishly ask to put their purchases on credit. The newly destitute scrounge for spoiled produce they can get for little or nothing.\u201cWe are dead, but we have breath,\u201d said Zakia Abu Ajwa, 57, who now cooks greens normally fed to donkeys for her three small grandchildren.The jails are filling with shopkeepers arrested for unpaid debts; the talk on the streets is of homes being burglarized. The boys who skip school to hawk fresh mint or wipe car windshields face brutal competition. At open-air markets, shelves remain mostly full, but vendors sit around reading the Quran.There are no buyers, the sellers say. There is no money.United Nations officials warn that Gaza is nearing total collapse, with medical supplies dwindling, clinics closing and 12-hour power failures threatening hospitals. The water is almost entirely undrinkable, and raw sewage is befouling beaches and fishing grounds. Israeli officials and aid workers are bracing for a cholera outbreak any day.Israel has blockaded Gaza for more than a decade, with severe restrictions on the flow of goods into the territory and people out of it, hoping to contain Hamas and also, perhaps, to pressure Gazans to eventually oust the group from power.For years, Hamas sidestepped the Israeli siege and generated revenue by taxing goods smuggled in through tunnels from Sinai. But President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, after taking power in 2013, choked off Hamas \u2014 an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Mr. Sisi sees as a threat \u2014 by shutting the main border crossing at Rafah for long stretches. Egypt, which has no interest in becoming Gaza\u2019s de facto administrator, used that pressure to force Hamas to close the Sinai tunnels.For Hamas, the deteriorating situation is leaving it with few options. The one it has resorted to three times \u2014 going to war with Israel, in hopes of generating international sympathy and relief in the aftermath \u2014 suddenly seems least attractive.Hamas can count on little aid now from the Arab world, let alone beyond. And Israel, in an underground-barrier project with a nearly $1 billion price tag, is steadily sealing its border to the attack tunnels into Israel that Gaza militants spent years digging.The collapsing tunnel enterprise, in a way, neatly captures where Hamas finds itself: with no good way out.Hamas, eager to rid itself of the burdens of governing \u2014 though unwilling to disarm its military wing \u2014 showed flexibility at the talks, quickly ceding control over border crossings like the one with Israel at Kerem Shalom, and the tax collections there that had provided it with some $20 million a month.But a series of missed deadlines for handing over governance to the Palestinian Authority, and the removal last month of the Egyptian intelligence chief who had brokered the reconciliation talks, have dashed hopes and left the two factions squabbling, the rapprochement slowly bleeding out.Hamas now refuses to relinquish its collection of taxes inside Gaza until the Palestinian Authority starts paying the salaries of public employees. But the authority is refusing to do that until Hamas hands over the internal revenue stream.\u201cThe most hard-line people in the P.A. believe they need full capitulation from Hamas, including the dismantling of its military,\u201d said Nathan Thrall, an analyst for International Crisis Group who closely monitors Gaza. \u201cThe vast majority of Palestinians see that as wholly unrealistic. But the P.A. thinks that strategy is working. So they think the pressure should continue, and they\u2019ll get even more.\u201dThe longer the stalemate lasts, the more Hamas hemorrhages funds and Gaza\u2019s economy suffocates. While thousands of Palestinian Authority workers in Gaza like Mr. Abu Shaaban were forced into early retirement, and those who remained saw their pay cut 40 percent, some 40,000 Hamas workers \u2014 many of them police officers \u2014 have not been paid in months, officials say.As Gaza\u2019s buying power plummets, imports through Kerem Shalom are falling \u2014 from a monthly average of 9,720 truckloads last year to just 7,855 in January \u2014 which will only cut Hamas\u2019s revenue more.\u201cAbu Mazen has punished all of us, not only Hamas,\u201d Fawzi Barhoum, the chief Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said in an interview, using Mr. Abbas\u2019s nickname.Such a conflicted view has characterized Israeli policy ever since the blockade was imposed, analysts say, as the country sought to protect itself by cordoning off the strip.But that meant keeping an enormous degree of control over the flow of people, cargo, energy and international aid across the border \u2014 and as it clamps down, the resulting social harm in Gaza can blow back against Israel.Nowhere is that more palpable than just across the border in Israel, where soldiers patrol close enough to wave at the Hamas militants eyeing them from watchtowers, and commanders talk of Gaza\u2019s unemployment and poverty rates as fluently as of their battle preparations.Brig. Gen. Yehuda Fox, who leads the army\u2019s Gaza division, recently showed Hamas and Islamic Jihad tunnels discovered and destroyed in the past few months. The tunnels were supplied with air, electricity and water, and dug by an estimated 100 men working in shifts.The showpiece of the army tour, though, was not the tunnels, but the construction of a concrete-and-electronic barrier, dug deep into the earth, that General Fox said will eventually detect other tunnels and stop more from being built.About three miles of the barrier is finished, with about 38 miles to go. It is an impressive display of ingenuity, but comes at an enormous cost: Five concrete plants have been set up, supplying 20 digging sites, at a cost of nearly $1 billion. Enough concrete is being poured into the desert sand, the general said, to \u201cbuild Manhattan.\u201dBut he also acknowledged that the underground-barrier project had increased the pressure on Hamas to use its existing tunnels soon, or risk losing them forever \u2014 heightening their dangers to Israel.As moribund as the reconciliation process has become, General Fox said, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority were keeping it alive because \u201cno one wants to be blamed for destroying it.\u201d If it does fail, Hamas will likely deflect Gazans\u2019 anger: \u201cThey\u2019ll say Israel is the problem \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s go to jihad and start a war.\u2019\u201dClimbing back into an armored vehicle, the general drove past an Iron Dome antimissile battery to a park where hundreds of picnickers and mountain bikers \u2014 Jews and Arabs alike \u2014 had flocked to see meadows blooming with scarlet anemones. Israel calls this February festival \u201cRed South.\u201dIt was well within mortar range of the border.\u201cIt\u2019s their decision what to do,\u201d the general said of Hamas. \u201cThree times in the past 10 years they\u2019ve chosen war. They wasted many lives and a lot of money and destroyed Gaza. And they can try to do it a fourth time.\u201dThen again, he said, \u201cEverybody learns.\u201dThe United States has done the opposite, withholding $65 million from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which supports Palestinian refugees, including some 1.2 million in Gaza, many of whom rely on its regular handouts of flour, cooking oil and other staples.Hamas itself has few ways to alleviate the crisis, according to Mr. Thrall and other Gaza experts.For the moment, those with money in Gaza are trying to help those without. A few merchants have forgiven customers\u2019 debts. The Gaza Chamber of Commerce paid $35,000 to get 107 indebted merchants temporarily released from jail. A donor gave 1,000 liters of fuel to a hospital for its generator.But the fuel quickly ran out. Gestures only help so much. And Gaza residents invariably say that war is coming.Hamas is under no illusions that it would fare better in the next fight than it did after its 2014 battle with Israel, Mr. Thrall said.\u201cHamas sees how isolated they are in the region, and how isolated the Palestinians are at large,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, in wars, they could hope to light up the Arab street and pressure Arab leaders. But in 2014, there was barely a peep, and now it\u2019s even more so.\u201dStill, whether out of bluster or desperation, Gazans both in and out of power have begun talking openly about confronting Israel over its blockade in the kind of mass action that could easily lead to casualties and escalation.One way or the other, \u201can explosion\u2019s coming,\u201d said Mr. Abu Shaaban, the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority pensioner. \u201cWe have only Israel to explode against. Should we explode against each other?\u201dIyad Abuheweila contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts in Hand, Companies Spend More on Themselves Than on Wages", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump promised that his tax cut would encourage companies to invest in factories, workers and wages, setting off a spending spree that would reinvigorate the American economy.Companies have announced plans for some of those investments. But so far, companies are using much of the money for something with a more narrow benefit: buying their own shares.Those so-called buybacks are good for shareholders, including the senior executives who tend to be big owners of their companies\u2019 stock. A company purchasing its own shares is a time-tested way to bolster its stock price.But the purchases can come at the expense of investments in things like hiring, research and development and building new plants \u2014 the sort of investments that directly help the overall economy. The buybacks are also most likely to worsen economic inequality because the benefits of stocks purchases flow disproportionately to the richest Americans.What companies do with the trillions of dollars they\u2019re bringing back to the United States, and the money they will save each year on their tax bills, will in large part determine whether the plan is a success or a failure.As the tax cuts kick in, companies have laid out a variety of uses for the money. Some are paying out one-time bonuses to employees. Others are raising salaries. Others plan to open new factories.In the fourth quarter, American companies\u2019 investments in things like factories and business equipment grew by 6.8 percent. That was the fastest growth rate since 2014, but far from the giant surge in capital spending that was promised ahead of the tax overhaul.But the buying back of shares is also at record levels.Almost 100 American corporations have trumpeted such plans in the past month. American companies have announced more than $178 billion in planned buybacks \u2014 the largest amount unveiled in a single quarter, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm.Such purchases reduce a company\u2019s total number of outstanding shares, giving each remaining share a slightly bigger piece of the profit pie.On Monday, Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire might be open to buy some of its shares. The remarks helped send Berkshire\u2019s stock \u2014 and the broader market \u2014 higher.\u201cI\u2019m expecting buybacks to get to a record for 2018,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m disappointed, there\u2019s a lot of people with me.\u201dThe flurry of planned buybacks has been good for the stock market. Early this month, stocks were down more than 10 percent from their January peak. The prospect of companies flooding markets with \u201cbuy\u201d orders helped the market recoup some of its losses.The broader impact on the economy is less clear. Economists believe a rising stock market benefits the economy, helping support consumer and business confidence. But the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of American households, who own 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40 percent of all stocks.Ultimately, the effect of the rising stock market depends on how those wealthy investors use their windfall. It helps the economy more, for example, if they put the money toward productive new companies than if they invest in government bonds.Companies typically decide to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories based on whether they will make the company more profitable \u2014 not merely because the companies are sitting on a pile of money that they otherwise would have paid in taxes.At a news conference Thursday, the head of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, acknowledged that many companies were spending their money on buying their own shares.\u201cRight now we\u2019re going to have an adjustment where you see probably more dividends and share buybacks than wage increases,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cBut going forward we\u2019re going to see a lot of capital formation and wage growth.\u201dThat is not what happened in 2005, when a one-time tax holiday allowed companies to repatriate money on the cheap. That plan, championed by President George W. Bush, was sold as a way to get American companies to invest more in the domestic economy.Studies have shown that the tax change lifted companies\u2019 stock prices but did not expand their American work forces.Until the early 1980s, the practice of buying shares with corporate money was considered borderline illegal because it was thought to potentially open the company up to charges of manipulating share prices.But in 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that gave the green light to most share repurchases, as long as they followed certain rules.Historically, American companies had paid out profits with a quarterly check, known as a dividend. But after the S.E.C.\u2019s rule change, companies started using more of their profits to buy their own shares, in the process giving their shareholders a bigger piece of the company.Buybacks soon soared. By 2016, the most recent year for which there is complete data, companies spent $536 billion on purchasing their own shares, according to data from S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.That was about 5 percent less than those companies spent on new plants, research and development and other investments. By contrast, 20 years ago, companies spent four times as much on such investments as they did on buybacks.\u201cWe have some causal evidence that because of short-termism companies are doing some stock repurchases that maybe they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Heitor Almeida, a professor of corporate finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s causing them to reduce investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Hospitals Becoming Obsolete?", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe reputation of hospitals has had its ups and downs. Benjamin Rush, a surgeon general of the Continental Army, called the hospitals of his day the \u201csinks of human life.\u201d Through the 19th century, most Americans were treated in their homes. Hospitals were a last resort, places only the very poor or those with no family went. And they went mainly to die.Then several innovations made hospitals more attractive. Anesthesia and sterile techniques made surgery less risky and traumatic, while the discovery of X-rays in 1895 enhanced the diagnostic powers of physicians. And the understanding of germ theory reduced the spread of infectious diseases.Middle- and upper-class Americans increasingly turned to hospitals for treatment. Americans also strongly supported the expansion of hospitals through philanthropy and legislation.And yet this enormous sector of the economy has actually been in decline for some time.Consider this: What year saw the maximum number of hospitalizations in the United States? The answer is 1981.The number of hospitals is also declining because more complex care can safely and effectively be provided elsewhere, and that\u2019s good news.When I was training to become an oncologist, most chemotherapy was administered in the hospital. Now much better anti-nausea medications and more tolerable oral instead of intravenous treatments have made a hospital admission for chemotherapy unusual. Similarly, hip and knee replacements once required days in the hospital; many can now be done overnight in ambulatory surgical centers. Births outside of hospitals are also increasing, as more women have babies at home or at birthing centers.As these trends accelerate, many of today\u2019s hospitals will downsize, merge or close. Others will convert to doctors\u2019 offices or outpatient clinics. Those that remain will be devoted to emergency rooms, high-tech services for premature babies, patients requiring brain surgery and organ transplants, and the like. Meanwhile, the nearly one billion annual visits to physicians\u2019 offices, imaging facilities, surgical centers, urgent-care centers and \u201cdoc in the box\u201d clinics will grow.Special interests in the hospital business aren\u2019t going to like this. They will lobby for higher hospital payments from the government and insurers and for other preferential treatment, often arguing that we need to retain the \u201cgood\u201d jobs hospitals offer. But this is disingenuous; the shift of medical services out of hospitals will create other good jobs \u2014 for home nurses, community health care workers and staff at outpatient centers.Hospitals will also continue consolidating into huge, multihospital systems. They say that this will generate cost savings that can be passed along to patients, but in fact, the opposite happens. The mergers create local monopolies that raise prices to counter the decreased revenue from fewer occupied beds. Federal antitrust regulators must be more vigorous in opposing such mergers.Instead of trying to forestall the inevitable, we should welcome the advances that are making hospitals less important. Any change in the health care system that saves money and makes patients healthier deserves to be celebrated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Have Forgotten They Hate Deficits", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Since the 2008 financial crisis, conservative economists and Republican politicians have claimed several policy errors were holding back economic growth and contributing to a painfully slow recovery, including lackluster wage growth. The government was spending too much, it was borrowing too much and it was sowing \u201cuncertainty\u201d in the business world with expiring tax cuts and other bitter policy battles, they said.If Republican leaders still believe that, they\u2019re not acting like it.In a year of controlling power in Washington, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have run up federal spending, approved deficit-swelling tax cuts and presided over a marked increase in \u201cpolicy uncertainty\u201d in the economy. They still talk about the importance of fiscal discipline, but they have yet to enforce it.Instead, it projects that deficits will grow $7 trillion over the next decade as the United States continues borrowing huge sums of money \u2014 a number that could double if the administration turns out to be overestimating economic growth and if the $3 trillion in spending cuts the White House has floated do not materialize in Congress.The promised $3 trillion in nonmilitary spending cuts do not appear to be high priorities for the president or Republican leaders. A key proposal for self-imposed fiscal restraint, the so-called \u201ctwo penny plan\u201d that would reduce nondefense discretionary spending by 2 percent a year, is a holdover from last year\u2019s budget proposal. Americans have heard almost nothing about it from the White House in the intervening year. Mr. Trump has talked a bit more about his \u201cwelfare reform\u201d ambitions to help cut federal costs but, again, has not mounted a serious pressure campaign to urge Congress to enact them.Congressional Republicans appear unlikely to even attempt to pass a budget resolution that could allow them to push cuts of that sort through the Senate without any Democratic votes, having reserved that move last year not for spending cuts, but for tax cuts that the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates will add more than $1 trillion to the national debt, even after accounting for increased economic growth.The most energy the party put last year into actually reducing spending and deficits was its attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which failed after three Republicans defected. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget assumes that effort will now succeed, somehow. Party leaders have downplayed suggestions floated by Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, among others, that Congress could move this year to reduce future spending on safety net programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\u201cRepublicans will still tell you that runaway spending hurts the economy,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute who is a former chief economist for Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. But the party, he said, \u201cisn\u2019t even talking about Social Security and Medicare reform anymore. And that to me is the sea change. There\u2019s no constituency for it, and Republicans have essentially given up.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump has pushed to freeze or roll back regulations in Washington, his election \u2014 and the unpredictability of his administration \u2014 has coincided with a resurgence of uncertainty in the United States.Democrats look at that evolution and see Republicans revealing a new set of economic preferences for the Trump era: lower taxes, less regulation, more federal spending \u2014 including an infrastructure proposal that could further swell the deficit \u2014 and mounting piles of federal debt.\u201cOn certainty, smaller deficits and less government spending, I do see shifts,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think those shifts are as significant as many are making them out to be. George W. Bush inherited a budget surplus and left large deficits. He expanded Medicare without paying for it. Dick Cheney said \u2018deficits don\u2019t matter.\u2019 Reagan said that the deficit is big enough to take care of itself. The G.O.P. has not restrained federal spending when it has held the White House.\u201dThe two-year budget agreement reached by Senate leaders would contribute hundreds of billions of dollars to federal deficits.\u201cI think their view all along has been that spending and debt are not immediate threats to growth,\u201d said John H. Cochrane, an economist who is a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution. \u201cThey know that right now, a fundamental reform of entitlements won\u2019t happen. So, they have avoided weekly chaos and gotten needed military spending through by opening the spending bill, and they got an important reduction in growth-distorting marginal corporate rates through by accepting a bit more deficits. They know that can\u2019t be the end of the story.\u201dMr. Cochrane likened the economic threat of rising spending and debt to living on an earthquake fault, poised to rumble at any moment. He said those risks may be making markets \u201cjittery\u201d, and that Republicans may be running out of time to follow through on their convictions, but he expressed hope that Republicans and Democrats might find a way to work together to reduce future spending growth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Distinctive About the Mess Jacob Zuma Has Made", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter a mighty battle, the A.N.C. turned against Mr. Zuma and he resigned from office. His successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, has announced that a period of darkness is coming to an end.South Africa is a country saturated in the politics of race. A measure of the impact Mr. Zuma\u2019s tenure had on relationships between black and white South Africans is necessary. The white minority lost political power nearly a quarter-century ago, but its influence in the economy, in the professions and in the culture of the country\u2019s institutions is immense. White political power is gone, but the white gaze remains pervasive.But South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.To shrug and say that we are all equally capable of stealing public money is to miss what is distinctive about the mess Mr. Zuma has made. For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.When Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.In a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.His genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.I am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.An earlier version of this article misstated the order of events in the resignation of Jacob Zuma, former president of South Africa. Mr. Zuma resigned before Parliament could convene to recall him. Parliament did not recall him from office.Jonny Steinberg is a professor of African studies at Oxford.

{"Headline": "The Reinvention of Consent", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "Young people are radically changing how we think about violence, consent and gender.Supported byYELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio \u2014 When Soleil R. Sykes took an internship in Washington during her first year as a student at Antioch College, she experienced a bit of culture shock.She was working at a German think tank and noticed that both in the office and at social events, friends and colleagues were far more casual about touching one another. \u201cAt a mixer before a speech, someone would tap you on the shoulder or I would tap someone on the shoulder,\u201d said Ms. Sykes, 22, now a fourth-year student majoring in political economy. \u201cAt Antioch, people would have asked permission first.\u201dNow, the current crop of pioneers at Antioch are moving the conversation beyond sex to discussions of consent in platonic touch.When Alyssa Navarrette, a third-year student who is studying anthropology and art, came home for her first visit after starting college, she was taken by surprise when her mother hugged her.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be touched and your mom wants to hug you, you should be allowed to say no,\u201d Ms. Navarrette said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having autonomy over your own body.\u201dWhen people get hurt, the community springs into action. Students say that what they and their predecessors have built here isn\u2019t perfect, but that the culture is as close to an ideal as they\u2019ve seen.In a lot of ways, Antioch College exists in a bubble. With a current enrollment of 135 students, it is situated in a small liberal town that is a bluish dot in a largely Republican area of Southwest Ohio. Its first president was the education reformer and politician Horace Mann; Coretta Scott King is among the famous graduates.But students regularly venture outside this cocoon. Antioch\u2019s \u201ccooperative educational experiences\u201d are a cornerstone of the curriculum here, and they compel students, at least four times before graduating, to go on \u201cco-op,\u201d taking on 10-week jobs and internships, usually in places far from Yellow Springs, often arranged or provided by Antioch alumni.If you choose to permeate the bubble yourself and visit Antioch, you will be asked to sign a \u201cstatement of understanding\u201d that you will abide by a policy that requires enthusiastic verbal consent during every stage of every sexual interaction. (Reporters are also required to sign the statement.)Students including Marcell Vanarsdale, 22 and now a fourth-year student, arrived at Antioch mostly unaware of the college\u2019s consent policy. \u201cI think my parents raised me pretty well and taught me respect for people and respect for women, but learning about the S.O.P.P. is definitely the first formal education about consent I ever got,\u201d said Mr. Vanarsdale, who grew up just outside of Chicago and is studying history and performance.He attended several sessions at orientation devoted to the policy, including one led by Planned Parenthood educators, another about the history of sexual relations. \u201cIt was different, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest pull was moving away from the idea that \u2018no means no\u2019 and toward \u2018yes means yes.\u2019\u201dIn its most updated form, the S.O.P.P. is an eight-page document that spells out the tenets of \u201caffirmative consent.\u201d In each stage of a sexual interaction, consent must be verbally requested and verbally given, the policy says \u2014 and \u201csilence conveys a lack of affirmative consent.\u201dIt prohibits the sending of unsolicited sexual text messages and requires partners to disclose sexually transmitted infections. It also dictates that people under the influence of drugs and alcohol cannot give consent. So, strictly speaking, any drunk hookup would be found to be in violation of the policy if one of the parties filed a complaint.\u201cThe S.O.P.P. is Antioch College\u2019s formal attempt at ending sexual violence and sexual harassment while fostering a campus culture of positive, consensual sexuality,\u201d it reads.Before a national audience, the school and the women who created the policy were portrayed as endemic of a politically correct culture run amok that was trying to desexualize sex.During them, programming has included screenings of ethical pornography, a \u201cKiss and Tell\u201d story-sharing event, \u201cDildo Bingo,\u201d a ropes-and-bondage workshop and an Antioch traditional event that students attend dressed to express themselves along the gender continuum.A \u201csex positive\u201d culture has everything to do with the S.O.P.P., Mx. Olson said. \u201cBeing able to talk to a partner or multiple partners about what you like, what you would like to experiment with \u2014 to have a negotiation whether it\u2019s about B.D.S.M. or extra cuddling, whatever gets you going \u2014 those discussions are what make sex wonderful. You have more control of the situation.\u201dThe college\u2019s administration sees this all as a big selling point for the school. \u201cOur students and our alumni have always been very involved with activism, and social justice is in our DNA,\u201d said Mila Cooper, Antioch\u2019s vice president for diversity and inclusion and the director of the Coretta Scott King Center. \u201cThere\u2019s a heightened awareness of sexual violence and sexual assault right now with the MeToo movement, but I do think Antioch has been involved in these conversations long before. It\u2019s not just a policy, you know, it\u2019s part of the education and the culture here.\u201dThe discussions connect back, sometimes directly, to the policy. \u201cThe S.O.P.P. is a reminder of who we are and what we\u2019re here to do,\u201d said Michelle De Le\u00f3n, 23, a second-year student. \u201cIt lets us say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re in a community and you\u2019re in a space with other people and be mindful of the space you\u2019re taking up.\u2019 Women, nonbinary people, queer people, people of color \u2014 we\u2019re not living in a culture that gives them space. We live in a culture where so many are penetrated physically, emotionally and verbally by anyone at any moment.\u201dIn the media, it\u2019s been misunderstood, many Antiochians say. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s a harsh policy,\u201d Ms. Nalubega said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not. It\u2019s saying that when you do touch a person, your touch is exciting and welcoming to that person.\u201dStill, there is a learning curve. Ms. Navarrette, for one, was not used to having honest conversations about sex. \u201cIt can be especially difficult for people of color who are from cultures where women and girls are not supposed to talk about sex,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means you\u2019re a \u2018bad girl.\u2019\u201dMany students have come to embrace it as a good thing. \u201cAt first, it feels almost unnatural and abrupt to say, \u2018Hey, can I do this? Can I proceed with this?\u2019\u201d Mr. Vanarsdale said. \u201cBut then, you see, at least for me, it\u2019s not just what you say but how you say it, getting more comfortable with the language. And I think it takes out a lot of the pressure on both parties when asking is involved and clarity is confirmed.\u201dEnforcement controls how effective a policy can be. The tiny size of the student body is one impediment to ideal outcomes, students say. News of an S.O.P.P. violation being reported to a student community representative or a member of the staff or faculty spreads very quickly. It\u2019s pretty much guaranteed that the person reporting the violation will share mutual friends with the person they\u2019re citing. This can create a real strain on student social dynamics.But the reality is sometimes more complicated. Roger D. Stoppa, the director of public safety at Antioch, said that because a reported violation of the S.O.P.P. is, by definition, an unwanted act in the context of a sexual interaction, it must also be considered a violation of Title IX, the federal law that forbids sex discrimination within any entity that receives federal funding.And federal guidelines prohibit officials from revealing private details of an investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re sworn to confidentiality. We can\u2019t say that we found somebody responsible, and this is the consequence that they got,\u201d said Mr. Stoppa, who is also the school\u2019s deputy Title IX coordinator. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t see anything tangible happen, they just think, \u2018Oh my God, I reported and nobody did anything about it.\u2019 Well, we go through a very thorough process.\u201dSo the student community may ultimately take matters of enforcement into its own hands.In the summer of 2017, a student group organized a concert featuring several local bands, that would take place at the on-campus amphitheater. Nonstudents from beyond Yellow Springs attended. They were asked to sign the document stating that they understood and would respect the S.O.P.P. Several of the men refused to sign; they were approached by students who asked them to sign the document or to leave. They left.\u201cThere is a stigma to not signing,\u201d Ms. Berro said.The dean read a list of complaints, Mx. Sanders said. Some of them came as a surprise, but not all. Mx. Sanders said they and the dean decided they should leave school.Mx. Sanders left Yellow Springs for a while but then returned, moved into an apartment in town and got a job at a restaurant. At another meeting, the dean told Mx. Sanders that they were banned from campus, Mx. Sanders said. The rules were not always closely observed. \u201cI remember once I was walking with a few people, we stopped right at the edge of campus, and someone saw me and got really mad at me,\u201d they said.Word of Mx. Sanders\u2019s behavior had spread around campus. At first, some students weren\u2019t sure how to react because Mx. Sanders was well regarded as an activist.\u201cAt Antioch, we focus so much on inclusion and creating space for marginalized people on campus that I think what has formed is a hierarchy based off of marginalization,\u201d Mr. Vanarsdale said. \u201cIt gives people who have this marginalization attached to their identity some form of power. Todd wasn\u2019t the archetype of what we think toxic masculinity would look like. He wasn\u2019t a heterosexual cis male.\u201dAntiochians take their culture of consent seriously, and students were disturbed to know someone living in their midst was not living by the S.O.P.P. Students began to approach Mx. Sanders, asking for apologies or acknowledgments that the consent rules were being flouted. Mx. Sanders didn\u2019t seem to be chastened.In a manner that perhaps can only take place when an entire community buys into a culture of consent, the community took action.\u201cThere was a meeting of people who have been friends with this person or who had sex with this person or who are the victims, and we all got together and decided we had to do something about it,\u201d Ms. Nalubega said. \u201cSo when we would see him at Birch or at the Emporium or at a party, we would say to him, \u2018You can\u2019t be in this space.\u2019\u201dBy the spring of 2015, it had become more difficult to live in Yellow Springs, Mx. Sanders said. \u201cThere was a posting on a student Facebook page saying I was a rapist and people should avoid me. That was a difficult thing to read. Within a month, I left. I felt like I had been run out of town on a rail.\u201dContemporaries of Mx. Sanders said they tried to compel Mx. Sanders to acknowledge their missteps. \u201cThis is someone who was repeatedly confronted and didn\u2019t change their behavior and then was ultimately not tolerated in the community,\u201d said someone who knew Mx. Sanders but did not want to speak publicly about the matter.Mx. Sanders is now committed to seeking affirmative consent in sexual interactions. \u201cI don\u2019t blame anyone else,\u201d Mx. Sanders said. \u201cI need to be accountable.\u201dIn the fall of 1990, an Antioch student reported a date rape to the dean\u2019s office. The administration promised her that the male student would be removed from the dorm in which they both lived. When he was not removed, a group came together at the Womyn\u2019s Center to plot for change.One of the women activists was April Wolford, now in information technology services at the University of California, Berkeley. She was an elected representative to a community council. She thought it was important to codify the demands \u2014 to create a policy for the administration to formally adopt.\u201cThe first version we wrote was very punitive,\u201d Ms. Wolford said. It was called the \u201cAntioch College Sexual Offense Policy,\u201d and it began: \u201cA sexual offense, as defined herein, committed by a community member will not be tolerated by the Antioch community. If there is reasonable cause to believe that any person has committed such an offense and that person is considered a threat to the community, that individual must be promptly removed from the campus.\u201dSexual offenses were defined as forced physical penetration, \u201cany non-consensual physical contact found to be sexually threatening or offensive\u201d and other incidents of \u201cpersistent sexual harassment.\u201d\u201cBut what we learned from that is that wasn\u2019t the focus of what the community wanted,\u201d Ms. Wolford said. \u201cWe wanted to prevent these assaults. As young people, we didn\u2019t have the tools.\u201dSo they began to discuss consent. \u201cThe challenge was, \u2018How do you get consent in a situation where everyone is so nervous?\u2019\u201d Ms. Wolford said.So the students created not just a policy but an educational curriculum of lectures, discussion groups, presentations from Planned Parenthood and skits in which actors would work through different scenarios where consent should be taught. \u201cIt was so owned by students, it was created by students, and students created education around it,\u201d Ms. Wolford said. The school administration adopted the policy with enthusiasm in the winter of 1991.But over the years \u2014 including a stint as dean of community life in 2011, during which she worked with students to remove S.O.P.P. language about \u201crape culture\u201d in favor of \u201csexual violence,\u201d which she hoped would be less alienating and accusatory toward men \u2014 she has changed her mind.\u201cI have very little patience with the notion that something like this isn\u2019t needed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the policy was meant to stop us from shaking hands without consent. What it does do is sort of say, \u2018Your body is your body and if you don\u2019t want something to happen to it or with it, it shouldn\u2019t.\u2019 And then that can be applied into every social interaction.\u201dAndy Janecko, 19 and a second-year student, wants to create another policy. \u201cI\u2019m really wanting to write a separate policy, that brings consciousness about consent a little bit further,\u201d said Mx. Janecko, who uses they/them/their pronouns. \u201cWe\u2019re missing this whole component of consent in general, teaching people not to touch people at all if you don\u2019t have their verbal consent,\u201d they said, suggesting that it could be called the Nonconsensual Contact Prevention Policy.One reason for the policy, they said, is to protect against people casually touching people who don\u2019t like to be touched or who have disabilities that make unexpected touch painful or unsettling.\u201cI\u2019m also looking for it to help people get justice or get acknowledgments at least for microaggression,\u201d said Mx. Janecko, currently on co-op in San Francisco, working at a mime theater. They hope to get to work on this next evolution when they return to campus this spring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making a Crypto Utopia in Puerto Rico", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 They call what they are building Puertopia. But then someone told them, apparently in all seriousness, that it translates to \u201ceternal boy playground\u201d in Latin. So they are changing the name: They will call it Sol.And these men \u2014 because they are almost exclusively men \u2014 have a plan for what to do with the wealth: They want to build a crypto utopia, a new city where the money is virtual and the contracts are all public, to show the rest of the world what a crypto future could look like. Blockchain, a digital ledger that forms the basis of virtual currencies, has the potential to reinvent society \u2014 and the Puertopians want to prove it.So this crypto community flocked here to create its paradise. Now the investors are spending their days hunting for property where they could have their own airports and docks. They are taking over hotels and a museum in the capital\u2019s historic section, called Old San Juan. They say they are close to getting the local government to allow them to have the first cryptocurrency bank.The territory\u2019s go-to blockchain tax lawyer is Giovanni Mendez, 30. He expected the tax expatriates to disappear after Hurricane Maria, but the population has instead boomed.\u201cIt\u2019s increased monumentally,\u201d said Mr. Mendez, who has about two dozen crypto clients. \u201cAnd they all came together.\u201dThe movement is alarming an earlier generation of Puerto Rico tax expats like the hedge fund manager Robb Rill, who runs a social group for those taking advantage of the tax incentives.\u201cThey call me up saying they\u2019re going to buy 250,000 acres so they can incorporate their own city, literally start a city in Puerto Rico to have their own crypto world,\u201d said Mr. Rill, who moved to the island in 2013. \u201cI can\u2019t engage in that.\u201dThe newcomers are still debating the exact shape that Puertopia should take. Some think they need to make a city; others think it\u2019s enough to move into Old San Juan. Puertopians said, however, that they hoped to move very fast.\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen an industry catalyze a place like you\u2019re going to see here,\u201d Mr. Minor said.Until the Puertopians find land, they have descended on the Monastery, a 20,000-square-foot hotel they rented as their base and that was largely unscathed by the hurricane.Matt Clemenson and Stephen Morris were drinking beer on the Monastery\u2019s roof one recent evening. Mr. Clemenson had an easygoing affect and wore two-tone aviators; Mr. Morris, a loquacious British man, was in cargo shorts and lace-up steel-toed combat boots, with a smartphone on a necklace. They wanted to make two things clear: They chose Puerto Rico because of the hurricane, and they come in peace.\u201cIt\u2019s only when everything\u2019s been swept away that you can make a case for rebuilding from the ground up,\u201d Mr. Morris, 53, said.\u201cWe\u2019re benevolent capitalists, building a benevolent economy,\u201d said Mr. Clemenson, 34, a co-founder of Lottery.com, which is using the blockchain in lotteries. \u201cPuerto Rico has been this hidden gem, this enchanted island that\u2019s been consistently overlooked and mistreated. Maybe 500 years later we can make it right.\u201d\u201cCompassion, respect, financial transparency,\u201d Mr. Pierce said when asked what was guiding them here.Mr. Pierce, the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, is a major figure in the crypto boom. He co-founded a blockchain-for-business start-up, Block.One, which has sold around $200 million of a custom virtual currency, EOS, in a so-called initial coin offering. The value of all the outstanding EOS tokens is around $6.5 billion.Downstairs, in the Monastery penthouse, a dozen or so other expats were hanging out. The water was out that night, so the toilets and faucets were dry. Mr. Minor lounged on an alcove chaise.\u201cThe U.S. doesn\u2019t want us. It\u2019s trying to choke off this economy,\u201d Mr. Minor said, referring to the difficulties that crypto investors have with American banks. \u201cThere needs to be a place where people are free to invent.\u201dMr. Pierce paced the room with his hands in fists. A few times a day, he played a video for the group on his phone and a portable speaker: Charlie Chaplin\u2019s 1940 \u201cThe Great Dictator,\u201d in which Chaplin parodies Hitler rallying his forces. He finds inspiration in lines like \u201cMore than machinery, we need humanity.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried people are going to misinterpret our actions,\u201d Mr. Pierce said. \u201cThat we\u2019re just coming to Puerto Rico to dodge taxes.\u201dHe said he was aiming to create a charitable token called ONE with $1 billion of his own money. \u201cIf you take the MY out of money, you\u2019re left with ONE,\u201d Mr. Pierce said.\u201cHe\u2019s tuned in to a higher calling,\u201d said Kai Nygard, scion of the Canadian clothing company Nygard and a crypto investor. \u201cHe\u2019s beyond money.\u201dThe force of Mr. Pierce\u2019s personality and his spiritual presence are important to the group, whose members are otherwise largely agnostic. Mr. Pierce regularly performs rituals. Earlier that day while scoping out property, they had stopped at a historic Ceiba tree, known as the Tree of Life.\u201cBrock nestled into the bosom of it and was there for 10 minutes,\u201d Mr. Nygard said.Mr. Pierce walked around the tree and said prayers for Puertopia, holding a rusted wrench he had picked up in the territory. He kissed an old man\u2019s feet. He blessed a crystal in the water, as they all watched. He played the Chaplin speech to everyone and to the tree, Mr. Nygard said.That wrench is now in the penthouse, heavy and greasy.Mr. Pierce had fallen asleep by then, his hat tilted down and arms crossed. He gets two hours of sleep many nights, often on a firm grounding mat to stay in contact with the earth\u2019s electric energy. Josh Boles, a tall, athletic man who is another crypto expat, picked him up, and the group headed back to the Monastery.They walked past a big pink building in an old town square, the start of their vision for Puertopia\u2019s downtown. Once a children\u2019s museum, they plan on making it a crypto clubhouse and outreach center that will have the mission \u201cto bring together Puerto Ricans with Puertopians.\u201dWorkdays are casual in Puertopia. One morning, Bryan Larkin, 39, and Reeve Collins, 42, were working at another old hotel, the Condado Vanderbilt, where they had their laptops on a pool bar with frozen pi\u00f1a coladas on tap.\u201cWe\u2019re going to make this crypto land,\u201d Mr. Larkin said.Mr. Larkin has mined about $2 billion in Bitcoin and is the chief technology officer of Blockchain Industries, a publicly traded company based in Puerto Rico.\u201cSo, no. No, I don\u2019t want to pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cThis is the first time in human history anyone other than kings or governments or gods can create their own money.\u201dHe had moved from Santa Monica, Calif., with just a few bags and was now starting a local cryptocurrency incubator called Vatom Factory.\u201cWhen Brock said, \u2018We\u2019re moving to Puerto Rico for the taxes and to create this new town,\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m in,\u2019\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cSight unseen.\u201dThey soon went back to work, checking out Coinmarketcap.com, a site that shows the price of cryptocurrencies.\u201cOur market cap\u2019s gone up $100 million in a week,\u201d Mr. Collins said.\u201cCongrats, man,\u201d Mr. Larkin said.All across San Juan, many locals are trying to figure out what to do with the crypto arrivals.Some are open to the new wave as a welcome infusion of investment and ideas.\u201cWe\u2019re open for crypto business,\u201d said Erika Medina-Vecchini, the chief business development officer for the Department of Economic Development and Commerce, in an interview at her office. She said her office was starting an ad campaign aimed at the new crypto expat boom, with the tagline \u201cParadise Performs.\u201dOthers worry about the island\u2019s being used for an experiment and talk about \u201ccrypto colonialism.\u201d At a house party in San Juan, Richard Lopez, 32, who runs a pizza restaurant, Estella, in the town of Arecibo, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s great. Lure them in with taxes, and they\u2019ll spend money.\u201dAndria Satz, 33, who grew up in Old San Juan and works for the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico, disagreed.\u201cWe\u2019re the tax playground for the rich,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re the test case for anyone who wants to experiment. Outsiders get tax exemptions, and locals can\u2019t get permits.\u201dMr. Lopez said the territory needed something to jump-start the economy. \u201cWe have to find a new way,\u201d he said.\u201cSure then, Bitcoin, why not,\u201d Ms. Satz said, throwing up her hands.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Luxury Buyers Ditch the Imports and Pick Up a Truck", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWhen Lee Victorian was looking for an upscale car to complement his wife\u2019s BMW last year, he was leaning toward an Audi A6 \u2014 a sedan whose acceleration, refinement and dazzling array of advanced technologies, like automatic braking and radar-based cruise control, he found alluring.But what he drove off the lot was an entirely different kind of premium vehicle, and one more luxury buyers are choosing: a pickup truck.Mr. Victorian, a retired Michigan state trooper, bought a Raptor version of the Ford F-150. The Raptor is a truck with the soul of a racecar: It has a 450-horsepower engine, a 10-speed transmission, electronic ride settings for seven different road surfaces, big chrome wheels, a power tailgate, cameras at all four corners and an adaptive cruise control system similar to the Audi\u2019s. With all those options, the sticker price came to about $80,000.\u201cMan, this truck is so slick,\u201d Mr. Victorian said. \u201cI stop at a light and people give me the thumbs up and take pictures of it. The truck is the celebrity.\u201dFor the last few years, the auto industry has been roiled by a significant shift in consumer tastes. In droves, Americans are turning their backs on family sedans and small cars and flocking to bigger, roomier models like sport utility vehicles and trucks. In January, two of every three new vehicles sold were classified as trucks, including S.U.V.s, pickups, minivans and the lighter cousins of S.U.V.s known as crossovers.Now a new dimension to this trend is emerging: Even upscale buyers who long favored Lexus, Cadillac, Jaguar and the German luxury brands are gravitating to trucks and S.U.V.s. What they are buying are often special-edition, fully loaded models, like Mr. Victorian\u2019s Raptor, that sell for as much as or more than BMW\u2019s flagship 7 Series sedan.\u201cWe are seeing it,\u201d said Tom Libby, an auto industry analyst at the research firm IHS Markit. \u201cThere is movement from luxury cars to luxury trucks.\u201dGeneral Motors\u2019 GMC brand \u2014 which sells only trucks and S.U.V.s \u2014 accounted for 11.3 percent of domestic sales of models with an average price of $60,000 or more in 2017, according to data from Edmunds.com. Five years earlier, the brand made up a mere 0.1 percent of those sales.Ford and Chevrolet saw similar but smaller jumps, driven by increasing high-end truck and S.U.V. sales. At the same time, the portion of over-$60,000 sales for luxury brands including Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Jaguar and Cadillac shrank.That is providing a tailwind for the Detroit automakers when overall new-vehicle sales in the United States are slowing. General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, with its Jeep brand, dominate in trucks and S.U.V.s, and now they\u2019re scrambling to roll out more high-end versions.It\u2019s a competitive \u2014 and crucial \u2014 segment. With demand for cars shriveling, the Detroit three and even some foreign manufacturers acknowledge they are now losing money on many of the cars they sell. But a $60,000 truck can generate tens of thousands of dollars in operating profit.At a recent investor conference, G.M. outlined a plan to produce more of the pricey Denali versions of GMC S.U.V.s and trucks. The company showed data indicating that the Denali line had an average sale price of $56,000 \u2014 more than the average price of a BMW, a Mercedes-Benz or an Audi.\u201cThis thing,\u201d G.M.\u2019s president, Dan Ammann, said of the Denali line, \u201cis a money machine.\u201dThe other Detroit carmakers are heading in the same direction.In October, Ford began making new versions of its eight-passenger Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator full-size S.U.V.s, and already has decided to make 25 percent more this year than it originally planned. In January, Navigators sold for an average of $77,000, thanks to strong sales of the top-of-the-line Black Label edition.Fiat Chrysler is preparing to add more Jeep models, including a pickup and a full-size Grand Wagoneer.In 2017, S.U.V.s and crossovers made up 41 percent of the market in the United States, up from 30 percent in 2013, according to Autodata. Luxury cars have gone in the opposite direction: They made up 5.4 percent of the market last year, down from 7.5 percent four years earlier.And the priciest S.U.V.s and trucks are selling fastest. The high-end Lariat, King Ranch and Raptor models make up more than half of all F-150 sales, up from one-third a few years ago. Denali editions account for 29 percent of GMC\u2019s sales, up from 21 percent.Low gasoline prices are one reason that sales of high-end trucks are rising. Years ago, pickups and big S.U.V.s often traveled only 11 or 12 miles on a gallon of gas. Today, their fuel economy is often double that.\u201cThe complaint that S.U.V.s are horrible on gas is not such a roadblock anymore,\u201d said Mark Scarpelli, owner of two Chevrolet dealerships and a Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep franchise in Illinois.At the same time, automakers have appointed special-edition S.U.V.s and trucks with the same kinds of advanced technologies and comfort features that consumers once found only in luxury cars. Want an interior trimmed in African mahogany? You can get it in the Black Label Navigator. Want an S.U.V. that accelerates like a Porsche (and isn\u2019t a Porsche)? Try the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk and its 707-horsepower V8.Chuck Ducher, a retired school psychologist in Onsted, Mich., just bought an F-150 Lariat with a bevy of options, including heated rear seats. \u201cI can put my mother back there, and she\u2019s in heaven,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind this is a luxury vehicle.\u201dWes Lutz, owner of a Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep dealership in Jackson, Mich., said he was surprised at the way customers were snapping up the most expensive models on his lot. This month, he had two Trackhawks this month, each with a sticker price of $93,000.\u201cThey won\u2019t be here more than a few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. We never used to play in that price range.\u201dIncreasing competition from upmarket S.U.V.s and trucks is adding to the struggles of the luxury makers. Most have long relied on cars for the bulk of their sales, and are suffering now that bigger vehicles are in favor. In 2017, for example, BMW\u2019s sales to individual customers at dealerships in the United States fell more than 5 percent, according data shared among automakers. The decline in BMW\u2019s total sales was less because of a big jump in sales to rental car fleets, a type of customer that luxury brands tended to shun in the past.Out in Tacoma, Wash., Gary Gilchrist sees the trend just about every week at his GMC dealership.\u201cWe\u2019ve been taking in Lexuses on trade-ins, BMWs,\u201d he said. This month, he said, a customer turned in a 2012 BMW 550i and bought a $71,000 GMC Sierra Denali pickup.\u201cPeople used to want German cars for the image factor,\u201d Mr. Gilchrist said. \u201cNow, if you have a Denali, you get that. People turn their heads to look.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chris Hughes Made Millions at Facebook. Now He Has a Plan to End Poverty.", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Chris Hughes, as he will be the first to tell you, has too much money. As he relates in his new book, \u201cFair Shot,\u201d he co-founded Facebook, asked his roommate Mark Zuckerberg for 10 percent of the company, received 2 percent instead and became dynastically wealthy as a result.Hughes is acutely aware of how unfair this is. \u201cMost Americans cannot find $400 in the case of an emergency,\u201d he writes, \u201cyet I was able to make half a billion dollars for three years of work.\u201d He\u2019s also aware that the flip side of people like himself having too much money is that tens of millions of Americans have too little. Over 40 million Americans live below the poverty line, including one in five children under the age of 6.There is a simple solution to the problem of people having too little money: giving them some. As Hughes efficiently and compellingly recounts, the proven and far-reaching effects of cash grants include more work; higher incomes; better performance in school and college; less tobacco and alcohol use; and fewer hospitalizations, illnesses and untimely deaths. In short, grants strengthen and empower the poor, making them much more economically and socially productive.\u201cFair Shot\u201d is a short, easily digestible elaboration of this argument, with a very specific proposal for taking from the rich and giving to the poor. At the top end, Hughes wants to raise the marginal tax rate for those earning more than $250,000 per year to 50 percent, both for earned income and for capital gains. At the bottom end, he wants to give a monthly $500 check to (nearly) all adults living in one of the 42 million households making less than $50,000 per year. The resulting America wouldn\u2019t just be healthier and better educated; it would be richer, too, with the economy growing as much as a full percentage point faster than it would without such an intervention. The plan would also, by Hughes\u2019s calculations, \u201clift 20 million people out of poverty overnight.\u201dTo make his case, Hughes weaves together two stories. The first is a straightforward and accessible autobiography. Hughes grew up in bucolic, God-fearing North Carolina, with little money but a strong sense of community. He talked administrators at Andover into giving him more financial aid than they\u2019d originally offered, moved on to Harvard, had a brief but lucrative career at Facebook and became director of online organizing for Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. Then, fatefully, he decided first to buy and then to sell The New Republic, the storied political magazine.Hughes presents the decision to sell his magazine in a few sentences: After spending four years and $25 million trying to \u201cturn the numbers in our financial statements from red to black,\u201d he finally came to the realization that the loss-making publication he bought in 2012 was, well, a loss-making publication. \u201cUnless I had a political agenda to promote or an ax to grind,\u201d he writes, \u201cthere was no future in my ownership.\u201dIn parallel to his autobiography, Hughes tells a wonkier tale of the education of a young philanthropist. Flush with his Facebook millions, he travels to Kenya twice to observe two very different attempts at relieving extreme poverty. The first is a trip with the famed Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs to see for himself the Millennium Villages Project \u2014 an ambitious attempt to give some of the poorest people in the world everything from clean water to cellular connectivity. Then, on his second Africa trip, Hughes joins another economist, Michael Faye, the co-founder of GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that has a much simpler strategy of supplying cash grants to people living on less than a dollar a day.After comparing Faye\u2019s approach with Sachs\u2019s, Hughes concludes that giving poor people unrestricted cash is generally more effective than trying to second-guess their needs by building them schoolhouses or handing them computers. This insight prompts him to get involved in the nascent campaign for a universal basic income in America. Hughes ends up founding the Economic Security Project, a nonprofit devoted to using cash transfers to end poverty.The book\u2019s trickiest maneuver comes when Hughes attempts to synthesize his two stories by explaining how his turbulent tenure at The New Republic colored his approach to the ideal of a universal income. He still believes in a universal cash-transfer policy, it seems, but no longer has the courage of his convictions: \u201cWhat went wrong at The New Republic,\u201d he says, is \u201cthe driving reason why I favor a more modest guaranteed income\u201d instead. But he never convincingly explains why his failure at the magazine plays such an outsize role in his worldview, especially compared with his successes at Facebook and in Obama\u2019s presidential campaign.Hughes\u2019s proposal \u2014 which he himself describes as a \u201cprosaic and incremental\u201d expansion of the earned-income tax credit \u2014 is emphatically not a universal basic income. For one thing, it targets only the bottom 35 percent or so of earners in the country. Worse, it doesn\u2019t even reach all of them. The Hughes plan is restricted to working Americans: people who made more than $6,000 last year, who are looking after dependents under the age of 6 or over the age of 70, or who are enrolled in an accredited college. If you earned less than $6,000, you\u2019ll receive only your previous year\u2019s earnings \u2014 and if those earnings were zero, you\u2019ll receive zero. Those who live at the very bottom of the income spectrum would have to continue to rely on America\u2019s overstretched social safety net, which, in all too many cases, pays them little or nothing.By creating a hard ceiling at $50,000 a year, Hughes also creates a nasty marriage penalty: He\u2019s effectively telling couples where each partner earns less than $50,000 that they shouldn\u2019t get married and form a household. That\u2019s because, if they do so, thereby bringing their joint earnings above $50,000, they\u2019ll lose a combined $12,000 a year in guaranteed income.Hughes quotes Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the architect of a previous attempt at a national guaranteed income, as saying that it failed because it was \u201cboth too much and too little; too radical, too reactionary; too comprehensive, not comprehensive enough.\u201d Yet his plan seems to make exactly the same mistake. Opponents of no-strings cash handouts will not be particularly mollified by the fact that this plan targets merely 42 million households rather than all 120 million households in the country. Proponents of a universal basic income, meanwhile, especially those who see it as insurance for a time when robots drive us all out of work, will be exasperated at the way the plan explicitly excludes the jobless and the neediest.Hughes is attracted to boldness, and played an important part in the achievements of both Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama. But ultimately he\u2019s a better follower than a leader. Fired up by his new cause, he could have published a rallying cry, an inspirational manifesto. Instead, he has delivered a book with more footnotes than passion \u2014 and, for the very poorest, a proposal that seems deeply unfair.Felix Salmon is a financial writer, editor and podcaster.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "10 Things We Learned About Teenagers and the News: The Results of Our Student \u2018News Diet\u2019 Challenge", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContests1. Do a personal 24- to 48-hour news audit in which you record all the news you get now, where it comes from and how well it meets your needs and interests.2. Change your \u201cnews diet\u201d to make it better meet your needs. Tinker with sources, content and platforms to address what you discovered in your news audit.3. In a personal essay (500 words or fewer) or video (one minute or shorter), reflect on your experiences before and after you experimented with your news diet, and sum up how you see the role of news in your life now.We heard from 358 teenagers, most clustered in high schools where their teachers obviously took days, if not a week or more, to guide the process. (Teachers, we can\u2019t thank you enough. In fact, since the challenge was a new one for us, we\u2019d love to hear how it felt on your end, and if you are seeing any continuing effects on your students. Please feel free to post a comment here, or write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com.)Below we list our winners, runners-up and honorable mentions, and showcase the essays of our top students. Throughout, we\u2019ve also embedded the five videos we liked best.But as we wrote when we introduced the challenge, navigating information in a connected world is a problem not just for students, but for all of us \u2014 which is why we want to detail some of what we learned. Though these are lessons from teenagers, we\u2019re pretty sure anyone of any age who takes our three-step challenge in 2018 will discover very much the same._________For many, the 24-hour news audit revealed that though \u201cnews\u201d came to them constantly, it was mostly in the form of headlines they\u2019d breeze over and not really understand, or updates about sports or celebrities.Every day my routine was the same: sink into my bed and pull out my phone to catch up on what\u2019s happening in the world. Khloe Kardashian pregnant with Tristan Thompson\u2019s baby, Rapper Lil Peep died from a powerful drug overdose, Melanie Martinez, former \u2018Voice\u2019 contestant, accused of rape. It was an endless stream of celebrity news that I briefly examined but never read in depth. Still, I felt confident that I was caught up on all the news.My generation is the future and that leaves me genuinely terrified. This feeling came over me in class when my classmates and I shared the results of our initial news audit for The New York Times Media Challenge. Who cares that CVS is buying Aetna, or that the Republicans are moving a new tax bill through Congress? We thought the real news was that there is an ugly sweater party on Friday, or that Lululemon is having a Black Friday sale.My peers and I were essentially saying, \u201cI will worry about that when I am an adult.\u201dStudent after student talked about how \u201cdumb\u201d they felt in conversations in class, at the dinner table, and among friends when they couldn\u2019t contribute.In my journalism class, we read articles and discuss current news. In order to write, you need to read, and I realized that I never paid attention. Last year during the election cycle, I told myself that because I had no interest in politics, I didn\u2019t need to bother myself by reading articles about the presidential candidates and what was happening in the White House. At school, that was what everyone was talking about. I was lost and could not participate in any discussions, due to my lack of knowledge. Students and teachers were invested in the news, while I was sitting to the side, unable to contribute anything in conversations.Again and again we heard that the process of getting started was daunting.Obviously this transition was not smooth and simple. It is hard to go from reading an immature 250-word tweet to reading a well-written, somewhat boring professional article, and there were still problems with these platforms: Could I trust them after watching and reading about the president of the United States, the man that the Electoral College elected, publicly denounce CNN, NBC, and The New York Times?Another teenage participant wrote that after following the news for a week, I \u201cstarted to feel like a citizen of the world.\u201d____________________This came through loud and clear as our participants\u2019 primary excuse for not being more informed.I found that there is a horrific famine in Saudi Arabia and many innocent people and children are dying because the Saudi government is not letting any help in. I learned more about the Iraq wars and how the U.S. is sending soldiers overseas to fight and fix Iraq\u2019s problems with their corrupt government and invading terrorist groups. If we pull out our troops we can save our money and lives.I felt helpless and upset since it felt like I was worlds away from the problems and couldn\u2019t do anything about them.The news scares me; it makes me feel unsafe, uncertain, bored, sad, and most of all, anxious.\u2026 I have read, watched and listened to news about fires, Donald Trump, technology business that I still do not understand even after reading an article about it, sexual harassment, celebrity news, North Korea, pollution, and everything in between since I started this project, and the effect all of this has had on me is literally sickening. I have felt nauseous after finding out wordly information on more than one occasion, in addition to either an anxious feeling or pure sadness. These feelings that I\u2019ve been experiencing lately have made me wonder \u2014 Is my anxiety is normal? The other people in my class, along with my teacher, seem to have such an easy time discussing issue after issue, while I am silently hiding my scared thoughts.I heard about the Rohingya people, refugees trying to escape violence in Myanmar for a safer Bangladesh. I had never heard of them before, but, afterward, I researched everything I could about their plight. Luckily the media was shedding light on their stories, which the Myanmar\u2019s government was desperately trying to hide \u2026 Ignorance is not bliss, it just means more suffering for people who need us.Suddenly, like a gust of wind, it hit me. News was connected to me. This little boy was no longer a stranger tome, but someone close. His death suddenly became personal because my mom had reacted to his original story. The story inspired her to take action, and do something kind, which made an impact on his life. This completely changed my view on the media. When we read and respond to news, as my mom did, we experience a deep connection to humanity.Via their 24-hour news audit, many students realized that their sources leaned heavily in one political direction or another, and set out to fix that by adding new ones.But once they began comparing the treatment of the same story across publications, some felt angry or defeated.A Fox News headline states, \u201cRoy Moore, battered by the media and the establishment, loses in huge Alabama upset\u201d while a headline from CNN stated, \u201cMeasuring the \u2018Alabama earthquake\u2019: How Doug Jones won\u201d Comparing the two titles, the first, by Fox News seems to victimize Roy Moore, an accused pedophile, by using hyperbolic language, while the second headline is more of a factual statement, by CNN.In A.P. Government and Politics I\u2019ve been learning about parts of government, public participation, and the inside and out of political parties. This information gives me a false sense of confidence in my knowledge about the American government. Through reading I\u2019ve discovered that each little action that the politicians make is scrutinized and bashed by one side and praised by the other. Because of this pattern it\u2019s very difficult to understand what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.This exercise leaves me wondering if this mix-up would benefit our country and if it would help the states become more unified, like a country should be. As previously stated, it does help me understand people who are on the opposite side of the political spectrum. If everyone tried the mix-up, we would have a better understanding of one another and even though we would disagree with each other, we might comprehend each others POV\u2019s more clearly.Just starting to understand the world of news, and exposing themselves to a wide range of sources, seemed to open students\u2019 eyes.I Googled \u201cunbiased news\u201d, and came across www.allsides.com. This website offers a liberal, conservative, and centrist point of view for every article. I read all three points of view for most articles and I got to see why liberals feel the way they do about things, and why conservatives disagree and their feelings. I really enjoyed seeing their reasoning and arguments. What really stood out to me was that sometimes the two sides would make emphasis of some evidence that proved their claim, while the other side wouldn\u2019t make as big of a deal out of it because it wasn\u2019t useful to their cause.Why did I never consider what the liberal news outlets had to say? I realized that I rejected liberal news because I didn\u2019t want to know their narrative. I was grounded in my own views, and stubbornly rejected whatever the left- wing had to say.When I took I step back and looked at the news a really consume, I was dismayed. I was being flooded by Twitter news, CNN, and Syracuse.com. Twitter was the worse. Most of the people I follow on Twitter are very, very, very liberal. I think the only non liberal person I follow is President Trump. Actually \u2026 I don\u2019t even follow President Trump; Twitter just floods my phone with his tweets.On an average day, I\u2019ll spend 45 minutes scrolling through my seemingly endless Twitter feed about the day\u2019s current uproar. I paradoxically felt inundated by the constant flood of news updates, yet still oblivious to the world\u2019s affairs. The tweets, though expansive in quantity, lacked breadth in the details. Twitter is great in that news outlets can send updates out to users instantaneously, but the platform\u2019s tragic flaw renders it useless. Tweets all seems to dumb down our news into an easy-to-read, 140 character blurb. But the problem is that our news just isn\u2019t that simple. The GOP tax plan and the Trump-Russia probe are highly complex issues. And watering the facts down into a quick tweet does a disservice to Americans, who have the right to be informed.I decided to have a \u201cjuice cleanse.\u201d For a full 24 hours, I ignored every article sent my way on social media; instead, I pored through the headlines of the day on traditional news sites such as The New York Times and BBC. For a full day, I was irrevocably freed from the endless wars on social media comment sections, and the nagging need to constantly fact-check my sources.Though this experience was certainly refreshing, I realized something important: to have a well-balanced news diet doesn\u2019t necessarily entail removing social media completely. In fact, social media offers various unique advantages to consumers. For instance, we can actively engage in conversations about current affairs with people from all over the world.I found that the news provided by Snapchat was aimed toward my age demographic. Rather than sharing news about the serious problems in the world (poverty, global warming, world hunger, etc.), I was reading about why Walmart was changing its name from \u201cWal-Mart Stores Inc.\u201d to just \u201cWalmart Inc.\u201d. I also noticed that I wasn\u2019t actually reading the articles. I would see the heading and then quickly skim over it. To my surprise, I wasn\u2019t actually learning the news with as much depth as I thought I was.__________________I\u2019ve been noticing myself going to CNN 10 first instead of The New York Times. I really did not understand at first but then I realize that I would rather watch a 10 minute video with Carl Azuz talking about trivial events rather than read a gigantic essay that goes back and forth, using rhetorical devices, counterarguments, analysis, etc. That is the beauty of having a news outlet that promotes videos, the information comes quick and is easily gathered turning a chore of reading into a fast paced interesting session of knowledge.When I learned about the Pulse Nightclub shooting or Roy Moore\u2019s beliefs from traditional news, I felt vulnerable. When seeing the same stories on social media, I don\u2019t feel alone.I sat with my Uncle John, the whole time. Usually I talk to him for a minute about politics and I\u2019m bored out of my mind, but this time I felt something different. This conversation that, at one time, would put me to sleep, was appealing to me now. I knew this was a product of the news diet.I talked with Uncle John about things I didn\u2019t know about. One of which as was his career as a NYPD Police Officer. I connected with his stories now after listening to countless stories about his experiences. One such story caught my attention. It was 1974 and my uncle was working with the 7th Precinct. He was on a burglary call and he found the suspect going out the fire escape. He chased him across the roof, and while running it gave way and he fell off the building. He told me how he was feeling as he felt the roof give out from under his feet and how he felt while falling to the ground. It gave me a more in depth look at how an officer thinks and a different perspective to all the news stories concerning police officers, and a chance to see how they feel in a situation that the media makes them out to be the bad guys.Now, we invite you to read the essays of our seven top winners._________Katie Golden, 14, River Dell Regional High School:Shocking stories change us. Almost six years ago, my grandpa first introduced me to the horrors of the Holocaust and World War II. Drafted at the age of 17, a warrior in the famous Battle of the Bulge where he suffered frost bite in his toes to this day from interminable days without shoes, he was one of the last American soldiers to be stationed in Germany when war concluded. Why did he tell me these gruesome stories I knew hewished to forget?So that I wouldn\u2019t forget. So that it would never happen again.I\u2019m sure my grandfather wanted me to be informed about the world \u2026 and I thought I was. I knew all about the teen world: Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber\u2019s on-and-off romance, what fashion was especially trending in November, and what color dress matches my personality (thank you, People magazine!) I even read the sports section of the Daily News, and usually directed the basketball conversations in my friend group.The deficiencies in my media diet became clear when I was at a Global Connections Club meeting. We were discussing ways to help the Rohingya Refugees, a group of people being targeted for \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d The presenter said they were the \u201cleast wanted group in the world.\u201d She shared news stories about villages being burned and women being raped. I was shocked when the presenter compared the events in Myanmar to the Holocaust. Their situation sure sounded like the people my grandfather once told me about. Hadn\u2019t we all sworn it would never happen again? At this moment, I experienced a new revelation about myself: my eyes were on all the wrong stories. Terror was continuing to dominate our world, even in today\u2019s world.As part of the New York Times Media Challenge, I needed to alter my media intake, and as a result of my club meeting, I decided to look for news about the forgotten people of the world: poor people affected by new tax laws, immigrants facing deportation, women silenced by sexual harassment, and Beijing workers forced out of their homes. Like my grandpa, these reporters were exposing atrocities. They were telling stories of human suffering that they would probably like to forget too.News is the microphone for the forgotten, powerless voices of the world. The media is the shield in the current war our world wages on Human Rights. It speaks for victims of persecution, harassment, deportation, and ethnic cleansing. We can\u2019t limit ourselves to the fun news, but consider the heavy and sometimes gruesome stories the news may cover. The news exists simplistically to help and investigate when anyone is suffering. If we don\u2019t acknowledge the media, these barbarities will happen, again, and again, and again.Helen, 14, River Dell Regional High School:The day had just started and I was sitting in a classroom with two uneven pigtails, one untied lace, half of my best friend necklace, and zero English skills. Already, I felt lost. Having just moved from Germany, I was attempting to participate in a geography game. As my classmates kept putting up correct answers, I didn\u2019t have even one. Unless I could master the new language, I would have no power.I had a flashback to those times six years ago when my teacher asked me to participate in the New York Time Media Challenge. My writing class was talking about the news, and a wave of opinions drowned me. Like my former self, I was lost again. It wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the news, but none of it was about the government. I read about Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s $400 million dollar painting and Europe\u2019s first underwater restaurant, but I didn\u2019t know how the tax bill was going to affect my family or how the Russian investigation tainted our election. I realized I had no idea what was going on in politics.It appeared I had a new language to master. Because I am a busy high school student, I didn\u2019t have much extra time, so I decided I would watch ABC Nightly News and hope for some better results. I began following the Congressional tax bill, Michael Flynn\u2019s guilty plea, and even the Alabama senate race. I began to form so many different opinions. Politics is a topic no family wants to talk about over Thanksgiving dinner, but after this experiment, I had couldn\u2019t wait to share my thoughts. (Surprisingly, I still have relatives talking to me.)There are many people who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening in politics and rather than reading the news they decide to tune it out. Not paying attention to the news isn\u2019t going to make you understand it. The more you immerse yourself in the news, like a language, the more you will understand it. For those out there who believe that following the tax bill is too complicated, they are becoming submissive. They are willing to sit back and accept whatever the government is handing them. If you engage yourself in the media and follow that tax bill, you can write letters, fight for what you believe, and possibly change the direction of laws. Rather than believing the government will do the right thing, you will know, and can hold them accountable.Knowledge is power.Isabella Jimenez, 17, Canterbury School:It\u2019s overwhelming, really. My phone chimes at least 100 times a day, my push notifications filled with news headlines. Facts, opinions, controversies, and current events are constantly hurled at me a million miles an hour, and in the of age of technology, it\u2019s impossible to hide. It all becomes white noise, and it is hard to differentiate what is fact from fiction. Although I routinely read the news and stay up-to-date on what\u2019s going on in the world, I sometimes feel trapped. The news, despite its ability to empower, inspire, and educate many, has also acted as the carrier of anger, burden, and tragedy.My father had just picked up my sister and I from school. The second he turned on the car, he immediately shut off the radio, afraid of what my sister and I might overhear. I wasn\u2019t na\u00efve: my whole school had been in lockdown for the last five hours. I asked my dad what was wrong and he answered with silence, leaving me with an empty feeling in my stomach. On our way home, we stopped by Dunkin\u2019 Donuts/Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, because even at 13 years old, I already was a coffee dependent life-form. I remember walking in, hand and hand with my younger sister, and seeing \u201cBreaking News: Mass Shooting in Newtown Connecticut at local elementary school. \u201d flashing in big red letters on the screen and people on the floor helplessly crying. That whole afternoon, my eyes were glued to the TV as the number began to rise, finally stopping at 26. For the next couple of weeks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to go to school, turn on the TV, or even leave my house to go have breakfast at the local diner as information hungry news reporters infiltrated my town. I was trapped. Everywhere I went, the news followed.Living in Connecticut, the news is my means to escape to the world beyond my small high school and rural hometown. It has brought me face to face with President Trump, climate change, the refugee crisis, and with the victims of other mass shootings. Before experimenting with my news diet, I regularly pressured myself to read the news, reminding myself the importance of a globalized perspective and having this information as \u201csocial currency.\u201d I never took into consideration the toll it would all have on me and never realized the power I had to chose the news I wanted to consume. Participating in the news audit and reading almost every article that popped up into my notification feed and watching the TV, left me tired and frustrated. It made me feel as I did in the following weeks after the Sandy Hook tragedy: trapped. I realized through this project the importance of having a balanced news diet: an ideal combination of all perspectives from all news realms. Butmost of all, I recognized that sometimes, you need to take a step back in order to process, reflect, and breathe.While a teen sits and plays Call of Duty, a North Korean missile sails toward our country. The teen is oblivious as he strives to reach level 3 on the game. This seems like a scene out of Ray Bradbury\u2019s Fahrenheit 451. In thatnovel, citizens watch their full wall TVs, unaware of the warplanes flying above them.Participating in the New York Times Media Challenge, I found that I might be the teen described above and could star in a modern-day version of this book.Step one of this experiment required completing a review of my news diet. After monitoring my main sources of news, I discovered a blatant flaw in my news intake: I only read the headlines. Not only was it just the headlines, but I would only look at the five recommended articles that were displayed as widgets on my phone.If I found an article that was interesting, I might read some of it, or tell someone else about it. But if they asked me a question about a specific detail, I would answer, \u201cI don\u2019t know; I only read the headline.\u201dEmbarrassed by my lack of depth, I challenged myself to dive into entire articles, as opposed to the five ones displayed in a preview. What I got from this experience was a deeper understanding of the content. I took away more information than I would have from just reading the headlines, and I felt more content with myself after this experience. One article that stood out to me was from BuzzFeed. The headline stated that immigration officers continued to arrest illegal immigrants in Florida during Irma, even though they promised not to. The headline made the officers seem like villains, but when I read the whole article I saw both sides of the accusation. Headlines can show one-sided arguments, while reading the article in detail gives you all the information needed to comprehend a topic.Ray Bradbury warned us back in 1953 about what our society was becoming. Captain Beatty is one of the men in charge of keeping books out of peoples\u2019 hands. He describes why the world came to be the way that it is, and we are quickly becoming that society. Beatty says that all people want are, \u201csnap endings.\u201d I think this describes our world today perfectly. People don\u2019t read the whole book; they skip to the last page. They don\u2019t want to take the time to digest what they\u2019ve been given. I realized this after my experiment. I am becoming what Bradbury feared. We all are. It\u2019s time for our society to get out of the express lane.Wynn Maloney, 18, Canterbury School:Unconsciously, as it must be for many other eighteen year olds, my news diet was bland, lazy, and lacking effort. The only time I would ever discover news would be when I was tapping through my snap stories on Snapchat until I reached the discover section of the screen, or scrolling through my Instagram feed when I would come across a Barstool sports post. Occasionally, I would click on an alert from the news app on my iPhone when I was trying to clear my notifications, but I would find myself lost in the article I had just entered.I was absent and blind to what was going on around me in the world, I admit it.Once I realized the isolation I had put myself through that had prevented me from not only becoming an educated citizen of society, but also becoming aware of my surroundings, I decided it was time to change up my news diet. My first step was to turn on my brain and open my eyes in order to become more aware whenever I would come across a piece of news so I didn\u2019t just scroll or tap away to something more interesting to my tastes. Slowly, I noticed myself wanting to read the whole article or post whenever I would come across news, no matter the topic. Then, my second step was to turn on all my notifications in my news app in order to spark more news action in my day to day life. Once the news started to come to me, I would click on every notification and read up on the article. If I found myself lost, I would simply search the background of the topic through other news sources. The chase through my news app to catch the next update on particular stories I was following had become like gambling at a casino, every time I won, or found an amazing or interesting news piece, I was left hungry for more.Ever since I have implemented these two simple steps into my life I have found that I feel like I can contribute to society through participating in intriguing conversations pertaining to up-to-date news. I also feel as if I am able to make personal connections to many day to day issues through the feelings that arise within me once I read many articles that address national and even international issues. I was once an 18-year-old girl who unhealthily and lazily consumed my news, but now I am still that eighteen year old girl who now looks forward to educating myself and consuming every ounce of knowledge I can obtain through news, and for that I am grateful for my news diet project.Olivia McCormack, 14, The Franklin School Of Innovation:This project was an eye-opener, revealing several things including the substantial amount of news I got daily. The latter part of the project inspired me to learn what I could about our current world. I started with a 24 hour period where I recorded all the news taken in. I found the news I got was mainly background noise with no focused time, and with news taken in all at once, so for my news diet mix up, I chose to change this. My planwas to do two things: listen to NPR news podcasts and read CNN articles on my phone. The first week I quickly found that the mornings were not the time for focused news, so I changed my intake time to in the car or ondeck before swim practice.During this experience, I found myself inspired and powerless with many issues. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing about all the sexual harassment allegations and denials. People denying these brave women who are speaking out while knowing they will be pushed around. For a month I listen to coverage of people giving brave testimonies, while men in power were denying and bashing on these women. I was left heartbroken and questioning; what kind of world is this where there is no equality? I don\u2019t mean just in this matter, I see it everywhere, people not making something as simple as a cake for the lone reason the clients were gay, it\u2019s just so unconstitutional. I found that another time I had to stop listening to the news was during coverage of the terrorist attack in Egypt. I just couldn\u2019t bear to hear any more about the horrific things people do to each other.Still, there were times the news I heard excited me, these were times where things like advancements in Muller\u2019s investigation where people were finally paying for their crimes, or when the transgender woman was elected in Virginia an example of how we are coming closer to true equality.This project left me knowing that the news is a very valuable part of life in this country. I also realized that without the news, I would be as innocent as a kindergartner, so I the news is needed in order to be a valuable member of society. Throughout my experience in the new diet mix up, I know that if I ever want to be a valuable member of society I will need to be as informed as I can be. I hope to do so by finding the right news diet and to be able to find places where I can speak up and stand out. One needs a healthy amount of news in life to a point that you are informed but not overwhelmed. Overall, I learned that there are multiple issues that we as a society need to fix and that our news intake should be enough that we are informed, but not to the point that we\u2018re overwhelmed.Jocelyn Savard, 16, Hoggard High School:Each day, I attend a swim practice for about three hours. As soon as it ends, us, being teenagers go straight to our phones. My friends phones are filled with text messages, Snapchats, and missed calls. Of course, mine has all those things too but thrown in are news article headlines. If I have time, I will immediately read the articles.If I don\u2019t have time then, I make sure I get to them relatively soon. Many people in my community are not receiving any sources of news. Physical deliver-to-your-doorstep newspapers are rare in households now because of the internet. But how many of the people not receiving newspapers read them online daily? If the generation above us is not informed, how can we be expected to be? Most teenagers\u2019s only source of news are the gossip articles at the grocery store checkout lines. What sort of condition will our country be in twenty years when it\u2019s run by a generation who only knows about their individual lives performed until that point?Possibly more concerning than the lack of knowledge is the lack of consistency. I read everything from the \u00fcber conservative Washington Times to the extremely liberal New York Times. Each article the story changes; in one I\u2019m reading about the bill President Trump passed that will save the country\u2019s economy by saving x amount of money each year. Then, I go to the next article on my list and I\u2019m reading about the bill President Trump passed that is dooming the country\u2019s economy by losing x amount of money each year. As I\u2019m more left leaning, I tend to believe the more liberal sources which would be great except I have right leaning friends who believe the conservative sources. We are truly a divided country. If I weren\u2019t reading a wide range of news sources would I realize the biases? And despite reading several news sources, some such as USA Today (notoriously neutral), often times I don\u2019t know what the full truth is. Again, how can we be expected to lead a country where we only know a biased history of it, if any? During my audit, possibly the only new thing I realized was how negative all the news intake I was receiving constantly was. I read about poisonous cities, Trump\u2019s mistakes, and falling stocks. I didn\u2019t have articles on people beating cancer, communities coming together or good political choices. It seems that news has always been this way but it can still be linked to the lack of consumption of news from everyone of all ages in our country.Someday, I hope to leave swim practice with articles written by opposite political affiliations having consistent facts and possibly one story that would make anyone smile. I have hope that we can change the way we perceive the news, possibly by changing the news first, so that my generation will be able to grow to our full potential and lead well in coming years._________Shreya Aggarwal, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolAlexis, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolChristopher Burmaster, 15, River Dell Regional High SchoolMelissa Canales, 17, TERRA Environmental Research InstituteOlivia Chislett, 16, the American School in EnglandEllyn Fritz, 17, Canterbury SchoolMlawson19, 17, Exeter High SchoolOlivia, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolSpencer Schultz, 17, Jamesville-DeWitt High SchoolJulia Bialek, 17, Horace Greeley High SchoolAndrew Caslin, 14, River Dell High SchoolLeah Fishman, 14, River Dell High SchoolGabriel, 13, Franklin School of InnovationQuinn Hagerman, 16, Merced High Schooljhamburger, 16Isabella Kahn, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolAlex Main, 17, Landstown High SchoolMary, 16, Merced High SchoolOlivia, 18, Cresskill High SchoolSamantha, 17, Merced High SchoolClara Tomann, 17, Canterbury SchoolMegan Tracy, 17, Canterbury SchoolJosh Wiesenfeld, 14, River Dell Regional High SchoolMichelle Yu, 17, Cresskill High SchoolJoanne Yang, 14, Seoul International SchoolSherry Zhu, 14, River Dell Regional High School_________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Plunge as Market Enters \u2018Correction\u2019 Territory", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter watching stocks march higher for nearly nine years, investors are suddenly confronting a new reality: The long, smooth ride is over. And it doesn\u2019t feel good.Major stock indexes suffered a steep drop in late trading on Thursday, the second-straight day that stocks dived shortly before the markets closed. The 3.75 percent decline pushed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down more than 10 percent from its peak in late January. That means the market is technically in correction territory \u2014 a term used to indicate that a downward trend is more severe than simply a few days of bearish trading.\u201cWe\u2019ve been trained that the market does nothing but go up,\u201d Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said of investors. \u201cAnd then suddenly, they\u2019re anxious, they\u2019re sitting nervously on the sidelines, and then they can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dTrying to pinpoint the exact reasons for the last week\u2019s tumble is a fool\u2019s errand. But the most likely culprit appears to be fear that central banks will increase interest rates in an effort to fend off inflation and ensure that fast-growing economies don\u2019t overheat. Those fears were stoked Thursday when the Bank of England warned that it might raise interest rates faster than investors had expected.The past week has offered a vivid illustration of how, in a market dominated by fast-moving, computerized trading strategies, things can go from good to bad in the blink of an eye. Last Thursday, markets were on an epic winning streak. But a bad day last Friday was followed by more selling, which begot more and more selling.In addition to the S.&P. 500\u2019s drop on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.15 percent. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index \u2014 a measure of the choppiness of markets \u2014 surged by 21 percent.The S.&P. 500 crested at 2,872.87 on Jan. 26. Since then, it has fallen almost 10.2 percent, or 292 points, to close at 2,581 Thursday.The sell-off continued in Asia on Friday. Shanghai\u2019s stock market was down about 4 percent midday, while shares in Hong Kong and Tokyo had fallen more than 3 percent. Futures contracts that track stocks in the United States traded erratically, suggesting that the markets on Friday could be in for another day of uncertainty.The market correction does not mean that the bull market in stocks \u2014 which have been roaring since March 2009 \u2014 is over. Markets also experienced a correction in early 2016 before shaking off their jitters and continuing to climb.Indeed, such ups and downs are routine in most market environments. What makes the past week feel different is that an eerie calm had blanketed markets for the previous year.Noah Weisberger, a managing director at AB Bernstein, said that over the past few decades, a 10 percent drop would normally happen every 18 months or so.\u201cIt\u2019s disquieting, it feels terrible, it\u2019s eye-popping when you look at the screen, but it doesn\u2019t yet tell you that something is broken,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a change in behavior relative to 2017, but then again, 2017 is an anomalous period with incredibly low volatility in the market, a very smooth glide-path higher.\u201dVolatility is back \u2014 with a vengeance. Among the reasons for that is the rise of computer-driven trading, which can accelerate the pace of upward or downward price movements. When algorithms pick up \u201csell\u201d signals, they can instantly shift trading strategies and move billions of dollars.\u201cThat\u2019s probably partly why you\u2019re seeing these big swings in the market,\u201d said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush, an investment firm. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s being driven by human hands.\u201dThe long bull market \u2014 stocks were up more than 300 percent at their peak in late January \u2014 has been underpinned, in part, by the extraordinary efforts of the world\u2019s central bankers to re-energize growth in the aftermath of the American financial crisis and the deep global recession that followed.Those efforts helped push interest rates to the lowest levels since World War II, making the safest investments unappetizing and prodding investors toward the stock market.In the face of broad global growth, some think the central banks will raise interest rates faster than previously expected, eroding a crucial source of confidence that the stock market climb would continue.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.Earlier Thursday, the Bank of England said as much, strengthening its forecasts for economic growth and stating that it may have to raise interest rates \u201csomewhat earlier and to a somewhat greater extent than we thought in November.\u201dThat statement sent up interest rates \u2014 or yields \u2014 on British government bonds, known as gilts.Yields on Treasuries followed suit, rising as high as 2.88 percent before retreating slightly. The sight of yields on United States government bonds approaching 3 percent seemed to give the markets pause.Higher government bond yields can make it more expensive for individuals, companies and governments to borrow money. They serve, for example, as the foundation for the interest rates that banks charge on fixed-rate mortgages.Investors are trying to figure out whether the global economy can keep growing at its current pace if rates rise \u2014 a concern that is contributing to the recent swings in stock prices.But there\u2019s reason to be optimistic about the economy\u2019s resilience.Government data released on Thursday showed that claims for unemployment insurance in the United States remained low, near levels not seen since the early 1970s. That suggests unemployment \u2014 which was 4.1 percent in January \u2014 is likely to remain low in the near future.Corporate profits also appear solid.But some of the biggest losers in Thursday\u2019s rout were stocks that had done well this year. Canada Goose, for example, which had been up more than 20 percent this year, sank 16.6 percent. Tesla, which had climbed 10.8 percent this year, fell 8.6 percent.Other hard-hit stocks belonged to companies that could be vulnerable to inflation because rising prices could pinch their profits.On Thursday, the underwear and sock behemoth Hanesbrands saw its shares tumble nearly 11 percent, making it the worst-performing stock in the S.&P. 500. Early in the day, the company offered a weaker than expected forecast for the year because of rising prices for commodities \u2014 although the company\u2019s chief executive noted that Hanesbrands would try to pass on some of those costs to customers.Even the most successful companies could not dodge Thursday\u2019s carnage. Shares of Apple fell 2.75 percent, knocking more than $22 billion off its market value.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Compulsory Veils? Half of Iranians Say \u2018No\u2019 to Pillar of Revolution", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe office of Iran\u2019s president on Sunday charged into the middle of one of the most contentious debates over the character of the Islamic Republic, suddenly releasing a three-year-old report showing that nearly half of Iranians wanted an end to the requirement that women cover their heads in public.At least as striking as the report\u2019s findings was the timing of its release. The study is from 2014, and publishing it now suggests that the president saw this as a moment to challenge the hard-liners, who hold ultimate power, about such a symbolically potent issue.\u201cThe government wants to show that any crackdown against the veil is illegal and not democratic,\u201d said Fazel Meybodi, a reformist cleric from the city of Qom. \u201cAnyway, crackdowns and punishment are not a part of Islam.\u201dMr. Rouhani, a moderate compared to Iran\u2019s hard-liners, decades ago prided himself on having been the one responsible for introducing the law on the compulsory Islamic veil. But since his election as president in 2013, and continuing after his re-election last year, he has called for more freedoms for Iranians.\u201cMr. President wants to be popular, and his team knows that an increasing number of women do not like the Islamic code of dress,\u201d said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to the government. \u201cThey want to woo the women and make sure the popularity of the president does not diminish even further.\u201dMr. Rouhani\u2019s adviser who released the report, Hesameddin Ashna, heads the Center for Strategic Studies, a government research group that in 2014 conducted a nationwide survey of public opinion about the compulsory Islamic veil.One of the women who protested on the street last week by taking off her scarf, and who requested anonymity out of fear of being arrested, said that the report was helpful, but that it did not go far enough. Women are demanding full freedom, the 28-year-old woman said, adding that the report showed that many people agreed with that view.The protests, while small in number, are nevertheless significant as a rare public sign that dissatisfaction with certain Islamic laws governing personal conduct may have reached a tipping point in Iran.The Islamic head scarf, or hijab, is seen by Iranian ideologues as a pillar of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The law regarding the scarf has been enforced since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and a head scarf is obligatory for every woman in the country, even tourists and visiting foreign dignitaries.Although women are subject to broader laws on matters like divorce and inheritance, the hijab is a highly public symbol of the rules imposed by Iran\u2019s clerical leaders. Rules are also imposed on men, who are not allowed to wear shorts in public.Many Iranians now resent such restrictions as the country has grown more secular, and are increasingly flouting them.The weeklong demonstrations across Iran, centered in religiously conservative, working-class towns and cities rather than Tehran, were the broadest display of discontent since the Green Movement protests in 2009 after a disputed presidential election.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Geothermal Energy Grows in Kenya", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHELL\u2019S GATE NATIONAL PARK, Kenya \u2014 Verdant hills stretch into the distance at Hell\u2019s Gate National Park, where zebras, buffalos, antelopes, baboons and other wildlife roam an idyllic landscape of forests, gorges and grassy volcanoes near the shores of Lake Naivasha.Snaking over the same landscape are pipes. Miles and miles of pipes \u2014 some high enough off the ground that trucks can pass underneath and giraffes won\u2019t hit their heads \u2014 carry steam from beneath this volcanic valley to big power plants inside the park.The valley\u2019s animal herders have long known the unusual properties of the ground under their feet. On chilly days, they warmed themselves near vents that emit plumes of hot steam. Now, Kenya is increasingly harnessing that steam to turn generators that can allow it to expand electrical service and power its rapidly growing economy.Kenya has pushed hard to harness its geothermal capabilities. It generated 45 megawatts of power with geothermal energy in 1985 and now generates about 630 megawatts; nearly 400 megawatts of that production has come online since 2014.\u201cNo matter how you cut it, that is a significant amount of generation in the geothermal world,\u201d said Gene Suemnicht, chief executive of EGS, a California-based geothermal consultancy that has worked in Kenya.Reliable energy is a vital driver of economic growth. At Oserian, one of Kenya\u2019s largest flower exporters based near Lake Naivasha, geothermal steam warms greenhouses and generates electricity at its two power plants.Geothermal heating allows the company to sell 380 million flower stems each year and also grow \u201cvarieties of roses that would not be economically viable without 24-hour heating,\u201d said Neil Hellings, managing director of Oserian. Savings from using geothermal energy versus conventional electricity lets Oserian pay its employees more than double that of many competitors, Mr. Hellings added.Another geothermal field already under development north of Hell\u2019s Gate was expected to bring power to 500,000 households and 300,000 small and medium-size businesses, according to the African Development Bank Group.Other countries have used geothermal power to drive their economies. In the 1970s, geothermal development helped propel Iceland from poverty to a wealthy island nation.Electrical transmission and distribution \u2014 and connecting customers who can pay for service \u2014 is crucial to a viable power business. In Kenya \u201cthe grid to transport the generated power to citizens also needs substantial investment,\u201d said Victoria Cuming, head of policy at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Big efforts to expand Kenya\u2019s grid are underway, with about 1,500 miles of new electrical lines under construction and 3,600 miles in the works by Kenya Electricity Transmission Company, or Ketraco. The main hurdle for grid expansion will be financing. \u201cKenya has typically relied on concessional investors or government funding,\u201d Ms. Cuming said.Sanjay Chandra, director of new energy development at ICF, a consultancy in the United States, noted that connecting homes or smaller businesses in the \u201clast mile is always challenging.\u201d This is especially so in poor areas where people may not be able to afford electricity or don\u2019t use much, therefore making it relatively expensive \u2014 and financially unviable \u2014 for companies to connect them.In western Kenya \u201cthe electrification rate is hovering around 5 percent even though 84 percent of unconnected households are within 200 meters of a connection point,\u201d Mr. Chandra said.Last year, Kenya\u2019s demand for electricity exceeded 1,600 megawatts for the first time. Under ideal circumstances, the country has the potential to generate more than 10,000 megawatts of geothermal energy, according to Kenya Electricity Generating Company, or KenGen, which generates the majority of the country\u2019s electricity.Across all of East Africa, there\u2019s potential for some 20,000 megawatts of geothermal energy, according to a report from agencies including the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa and the United Nations Environment Program.But Kenya and the surrounding region face many challenges to harnessing its full geothermal potential. Lack of funding and technical expertise, poor governance, and corruption often hobble big infrastructure projects in developing countries.And though geothermal is considered renewable energy, it does have pitfalls. While the Earth will most likely supply heat for millions of years, the underground water necessary to produce steam can be depleted if not recharged.Yet from a geological perspective, Kenya\u2019s geothermal conditions are ideal.\u201cThe amount of volcanism is amazing,\u201d Mr. Suemnicht said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the center of the action.\u201dThe East African Rift is one of the world\u2019s largest rift valleys, about 3,700 miles in length and 30 to 40 miles across. It is slowly splitting the African continent apart at the rate of several millimeters each year.\u201cRift settings have very high potential for geothermal,\u201d Mr. Suemnicht said. \u201cMost geothermal development occurs in tectonically active areas on Earth.\u201dKenya is by far Africa\u2019s geothermal leader, but nations such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Djibouti, Eritrea and Comoros have done preliminary exploration and Ethiopia generates about 7 megawatts of geothermal power.Tapping geothermal energy is a long and expensive process that requires special expertise. From start to finish, it can take years from site-scouting to construction to connection to actually generating electricity \u2014 and revenue.To find suitable spots for drilling steam wells, scientists do geological, geochemical and geophysical surveillance, a process that can take three months, said Xavier Musouye, a geologist with KenGen. When suitable spots are found and assessed, drilling begins using the kind of tall rigs commonly seen at oil wells. Except for periodic maintenance breaks, these drills pound into the earth 24 hours a day for nearly two months.At a new well site in Hell\u2019s Gate, the noise was deafening as gargantuan machinery pummeled the ground. The well will eventually reach a depth of almost two miles, joining the nearly 300 others already in place in the park.It can cost about $6 million for a single well, and even with all the planning and testing there is still a risk of drilling an empty well. Two geothermal wells were explored in neighboring Rwanda but were unsuccessful, noted Dr. Meseret Zemedkun, energy program manager for the United Nations Environment Program.Kenya, the first African country to tap geothermal power, began its programs in the late 1970s and early 1980s through funding primarily from the World Bank and guidance from the United Nations Development Program. But funders pulled out in the early 1990s amid government instability before returning toward the end of that decade.Although geothermal power has led to rapid expansion of electrical service here, there are environmental trade-offs. There is the conundrum of drilling in Hell\u2019s Gate, a 26-square-mile area that is one of the country\u2019s smaller parks but has been designated a Unesco world heritage site. Some environmentalists are critical of extracting geothermal energy here. They complain that pipes and power plants are environmentally disruptive and an eyesore.Elizabeth Mwangi-Gachau, chief environmental officer for KenGen, said the company conducts environmental assessments and tries to mitigate impact. It considers wildlife migration and behavior in its development plans. Ms. Mwangi-Gachau added that KenGen has refrained from drilling in parts of Hell\u2019s Gate that would compromise the flora and fauna, even where there is major geothermal potential.Ms. Zemedkun of U.N.E.P. pointed out that environmentally friendly geothermal projects have been developed around the world \u2014 even within national park areas, including in the United States, Italy, Iceland, New Zealand and Japan.On a sunny afternoon, groups of Kenyans basked in the spa\u2019s azure water. They weren\u2019t fazed by the sight of steel pipes at a nearby geothermal wellhead. Overhead, odorless white steam floated into the air to mingle with the clouds streaking the Kenyan sky.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moments Large and Small in a Memorable Olympics", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMembers of The New York Times Olympic staff share their favorite moments from the Pyeongchang Games.At the Pyeongchang Games, it appeared all might go wrong again. After one leg of the women\u2019s relay, Norway was third, and after two it was fourth, 30 seconds back.But Norway still had two aces to play. The first was Ragnhild Haga, the gold medalist in the 10-kilometer event. She stormed through the course and pulled within three seconds of the leaders.Then she turned the race over to Marit Bjoergen, one of the century\u2019s greatest athletes in any sport. Already a six-time gold medalist before these Games, Bjoergen had defied her 37 years by picking up a silver and a bronze in individual events in Pyeongchang. (She added an individual gold later.)And the relay? She won it for Norway. Of course. And it certainly made the victory sweeter that the runner-up was Norway\u2019s old rival, Sweden.For good measure, Norway won the men\u2019s race the next day, coming from behind again. Rippon, who competed in the men\u2019s and team figure skating events, had a dozen memorable quips and comebacks. After his free skate in the men\u2019s singles, Rippon, one of two openly gay men on the United States Olympic team, was asked about the people back home who don\u2019t embrace him.\u201cHaters are just fans in denial,\u201d Rippon said, providing an answer, but more important, a mantra, for all of us who regularly put our work out there for public consumption.One cannot see the skiers approach, which focuses one\u2019s attention. A speaker announces, \u201cathlete on course,\u201d and one listens attentively as the smooth sound of skis on snow becomes stronger and then, suddenly, the athletes are flying overhead.As they take off, their skis carry a residue of snow from the ramps that disperses all around. Sometimes there is a lot of snow, giving the sense of skiers flying in a snowstorm. Sometimes there are just specks which, at night, dot the blackness like stars. As the skiers rotate, one can photograph them upside down or in some obtuse position that is both unfamiliar and wondrous to our eyes or, in this case, seeming to circle the earth like a satellite in the cosmos.But you did not have to be in the arena to understand what short track means to the host country. During the last night of competition, I was on a high-speed train from Seoul to the Olympic city of Gangneung. My reserved seat in economy was behind a man traveling alone and next to a woman traveling with her child. I bemoaned my bad timing: I would not only miss being in the short-track arena but also would be nowhere near a television. Then I caught a glimpse of the man\u2019s smartphone. He was watching the live broadcast. I turned to the woman. She was doing the same thing on her phone, her daughter leaning in to see, too.But they rallied with a stunning performance in the long program. Afterward, having poured everything into the routine, Savchenko, who was competing in her fifth Olympics, collapsed to the ice. Massot went to his knees and hugged her. And they won the gold medal.Until November, Massot\u2019s eligibility to compete for Germany had been in doubt. He is a native of France who needed three tries to pass a written test to gain German citizenship. Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, visited the skaters during the Games. Massot later confessed to a friend, \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand everything he said.\u201dThis was the first Olympics where skaters could perform to music with words, and Toth\u2019s choice was classic \u2014 classic rock, that is.Toth finished 23rd out of 30 skaters, but recorded her personal best score.When Toth came out for her free skate two days later, though, and the first few notes started playing, it was clear that she had left her hard edge at home this time. She went with \u201cCarmen.\u201dDoug snapped the famous photograph of President George W. Bush being told about the attacks on the World Trade Center in a Florida classroom. The multitudes of people who admire Mills\u2019s photographs don\u2019t also get to experience his generosity and humor. Some days, more than others, you realize you\u2019re lucky to be doing what you\u2019re doing.In the men\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event, he lined up, crouched as he readied for the start gun and then sprang into a sprint. It lasted for two seconds. Nogal slipped and fell to the ice, his face of rictus of agony as he spun on his rear end.If records were kept for \u201cshortest amount of time in the Games when you were in contention,\u201d this guy would be hard to beat.He didn\u2019t stay on the ground for long. While the athlete he was supposed to race flew around the track, Nogal got up and slowly started to skate again. Then something happened that was either amazing or inevitable. Either way, it was stirring and spoke to the deep empathy of the crowd, which recognized immediately that it had witnessed an athlete\u2019s nightmare.The audience applauded. It sounded nothing like the applause for Cha Min Kyu, a South Korean who ultimately won the silver and was rapturously cheered when he delivered the best time of the night, at least until a Norwegian bested him by a hundredth of a second. Instead this was the ovation of a crowd expressing its heartfelt condolences, or just saluting Nogal for years of training, and for having the grace and nerve to finish a race he had lost in an instant.The stadium was so quiet for this last and deciding jump, I sensed everyone could hear the rapid fire of my camera as Gasser flew past me, flipping twice and spinning three times on her cab double cork 1080. After she disappeared out of view, the exploding roar of the crowd told me that something special had just happened. Gasser had won the first gold medal in Olympic big air competition, and more important, this entire field of athletes had finally been able to reveal the progress and depth of women\u2019s snowboarding. It was a stark contrast to the slopestyle final, in which the women had to scale back their runs because of dangerously high winds.Who knew short-track speedskating could deliver so much in one night?It was a chance visit to the event, motivated by the simple urge to get out of the windowless office where I helped edit our coverage and to go see something. The other events I attended or covered could not match this one for its athletic and geopolitical resonance. So the first Olympic event I have ever attended will probably stay with me the longest.I would not have been allowed to show the reader the behind-the-scenes images without the support of the wonderful photo managers at that venue. It\u2019s hard to describe how far up the start house is, but I know one thing: There is no way I could do what these Olympic athletes do.I gawked for a moment before asking if I could take their picture.\u201cOf course!\u201d they said in unison, beaming and posing.I snapped a photo and asked if they were in Pyeongchang to cheer for anyone in particular. In the station, I had met a Swede who had come to support his daughter, an Alpine skier.\u201cNo, we are just fans,\u201d one said. He gestured at his friend\u2019s get-up. \u201cWe came here for fun. As long as we can make people smile, we are happy.\u201dDiggins and the other American women had a real shot at winning a medal in cross-country skiing \u2014 the first for the United States since Bill Koch took home a silver in 1976.On Wednesday morning, the day of the team sprint relay, my editor sent me a message: \u201cWant to chase cross country one more time?\u201dRight then, Lee Sang-hwa of South Korea was inching toward the starting line in the women\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event. Lee charged around the ice, only to finish 0.39 seconds behind the eventual gold medalist, Nao Kodaira of Japan. As Lee broke down in tears, the driver tapped the steering wheel, let out a disappointed grunt and started the bus again.Bus drivers were among the countless workers here doing thankless jobs to keep the Olympics running. But every so often, when a Korean athlete was about to perform, patriotism (or perhaps mere curiosity) compelled them to pause for a few moments. The passengers never seemed to mind.\u201cWow, they really are good,\u201d he said to no one in particular. Then he yanked the bus back into busy traffic.Gisin was charming and humble. We traded pins, and I wished her luck. A week later she stormed to a gold medal in the Alpine combined. At my hotel, I ran into 17 relatives of the snowboarder Jamie Anderson a few hours before she won the gold medal in the slopestyle competition. \u201cYou know Jamie?\u201d her father asked, almost surprised at how famous his daughter had become.As a student at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., I spent the better part of my junior and senior years sharing a rundown house with a great friend named Jason Albert. We called him \u201cJ-bert\u201d back then. A lover of the outdoors, he was the guy who, on a clear night, would take his sleeping bag and crash in the middle of the softball field because, well, why not?On graduation day, we bro-hugged and said something like, \u201cSee you soon.\u201dWe didn\u2019t. That was nearly 27 years ago. There is no good explanation other than life, which carried him to Bend, Ore., and me to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.The day before the Olympics started, as I was looking at my phone and hurrying to attend to a story, I nearly walked head-on into a correspondent for the great Nordic sports website fasterskier.com \u2014 my old friend and housemate Jason.In that moment, and then at a couple cross country races where we leaned on a fence and watched the competition, we were right back on those couches \u2014 thankfully, without very much to complain about.It\u2019s so hard to find a new way to illustrate many Olympic sports, especially bobsled.One day as I walked down from the top of the sledding hill, I could barely see anything. There were spots where I could see some parts of the track, with the Olympic Village in the background or flags nearby, but they didn\u2019t make for very good pictures. Then, there we go. I made the best picture of sliding sports I have ever seen, even without a bobsled.Three fans made all the noise in the grandstand next to the finish line. Just three fans. You could not help but hear their cheering, because just about everyone else in the area was stunned silent.Ledecka was sure it was a mistake. Much of the crowd thought the same thing, and a confused quiet enveloped the finish area.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lowest Ever Black Jobless Rate Is Still Twice That of Whites", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "The unemployment rate for black workers hit its lowest point on record recently. But even a strong labor market has limits in spreading opportunity widely.Supported byPresident Trump celebrated the milestone on Twitter and in his State of the Union address. The unemployment rate for black Americans had hit its lowest point on record, a sign that the recovery was at last reaching groups that had been left behind.But the achievement was bittersweet: Black joblessness was still roughly twice the rate for whites.Even at the low of 6.8 percent recorded in December \u2014 it climbed back to 7.7 percent in January \u2014 the unemployment level for black Americans would qualify as a near crisis for whites. And the relative gains have not erased disparities in opportunity and pay.A tight labor market alone can\u2019t undo a legacy of unequal school funding, residential segregation or the disproportionate rate of incarceration for black Americans. Nor can it reverse the gradual shift of well-paying jobs from inner cities to mostly white suburbs. Studies have found that discrimination in hiring and pay persists even in good economic times, making parity an elusive goal.\u201cIt\u2019s not microwaveable,\u201d said Louis King, who runs a training program in Minnesota that aims to put minority workers into construction and health care careers. \u201cYou don\u2019t press a button and it suddenly changes.\u201dOn paper, the state\u2019s economy gave Mr. King a good chance at success. Minnesota\u2019s jobless rate is far lower than the national average, making employers particularly hungry for workers they may once have shut out.\u201cThis is not time for celebration,\u201d said Andre Perry of the Brookings Institution, whose research has examined race and structural inequality. \u201cYes, the strong economy is exciting high-growth areas, but blacks are still filling temporary positions or low-wage jobs that result in a flat level of income.\u201dNationwide, the typical annual pay for a black person working full time was just under $40,000 in 2016, compared with $52,000 for a white worker.No amount of education alters the imbalance. Black workers with a high school diploma take home 22 percent less than whites with the same credential. Those with graduate degrees fall nearly as far behind their white peers.Mr. King has been working to alter that dynamic \u2014 ever since he arrived in Minneapolis in 1989. He found that the black people who had jobs were mostly flipping burgers or minding cash registers at convenience stores.There weren\u2019t \u201creal soul-food restaurants,\u201d he said, or many prominent black businesses of any kind. It was hard for him to see how black children would climb economically without knowing whether people who looked like them ever landed on top.So Mr. King, a former Army commander who trained soldiers, founded Summit Academy, a vocational school. He spent years trying to persuade people to actually hire his graduates.In 2009, as the nation was trying to climb out of the recession and Minnesota\u2019s legislature was debating how to spend federal stimulus money, Mr. King sent busloads of his students to legislative hearings. They arrived early, filling out rows of seats normally occupied by lobbyists.They showed up on construction sites in lab coats, carrying magnifying glasses, looking diligently for the black workers. They submitted a \u201cmissing-persons report\u201d to local officials to highlight the lack of black workers on public projects.The timing couldn\u2019t have been better for Carmen Richardson. She had just quit her job plating metal for a pittance when she saw an ad for Summit. After she graduated from the program five months later, the biggest names in the construction business were competing for her.\u201cI was getting recruited like I was a basketball player,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. \u201cI was in shape, I was a female and I was black, so that was the golden ticket.\u201dShe started out earning $24 an hour in 2011, and became a part of the carpenter\u2019s union. She got a pension and full medical coverage. She bought a Suzuki motorcycle and, last year, a Dodge Charger.\u201cGot my first speeding ticket in that sucker,\u201d Ms. Richardson said.Now she earns $37 at Mortenson, a construction giant that played a critical role in opening doors for people like her.\u201cWe knew that demographic shift was happening,\u201d said David Mortenson, the company\u2019s chairman. White Minnesotans, who sent generations of young men into the trades, were suddenly seeking a higher purpose \u2014 college degrees, office jobs.Economic theory suggests that a strong labor market like Minnesota\u2019s \u2014 and, increasingly, the country\u2019s as a whole \u2014 makes outright discrimination expensive. Companies can hardly afford to turn away qualified people when there are so many jobs to fill.Racial gaps do seem to narrow during better economic times. In mid-2010, just 67 percent of African-Americans ages 25 to 54 were employed. Among whites, the figure was 77 percent \u2014 a 10-point difference. Today, that chasm has shrunk to about six points, the smallest it has been since 2000.Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said that when he took the job two years ago, he was surprised that the bank\u2019s economists couldn\u2019t conclusively say what caused the divide.\u201cIf we can\u2019t even answer the \u2018why,\u2019 we can\u2019t hope to design policy solutions to close those gaps,\u201d Mr. Kashkari said.Still, Mr. Kashkari said, companies do behave differently when workers are scarcer. That is certainly true in Minneapolis, where Mr. Mortenson helped force the city\u2019s builders into action.The company pushed trade unions to diversify their ranks and told its subcontractors \u201cthey weren\u2019t going to get our business if they didn\u2019t pull their weight,\u201d Mr. Mortenson said.It also hired diversity trainers to consult with almost every foreman and supervisor at all of its work sites, and brought in \u201ccultural competency coaches\u201d to work with high-level executives on implicit bias.\u201cYou had a white-owned company with white leadership saying to people we are doing the right thing,\u201d said Mr. King, the Summit Academy leader. \u201cIt became a condition of business.\u201dBut integrating the old boys\u2019 club is not always particularly fun for the newcomers, as Marvin Parrish Jr. learned on his first day on the job after graduating from Summit. Mr. Parrish, a former convict from Detroit, was the only black person working at the site.A white carpenter once asked him why, \u201cif we are equal,\u201d there was a need for affirmative action.Mr. Parrish, 33, kept his head down, rushing through his grunt work so that he\u2019d have time to watch the old hands perform more complex maneuvers, recording their moves to mimic them later.\u201cI was working twice as hard as the next guy by me, and thinking five times faster than him just to stay afloat,\u201d Mr. Parrish said. He became a lead carpenter.Still, he noticed that when it came time to solve a problem or analyze a blueprint, his manager would bring over a white person to handle it. \u201cI was pushed aside,\u201d Mr. Parrish said.He eventually got a job as a foreman at Thor Construction, a black-owned builder, where he needs more than two hands to count the number of black tradespeople on site. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just a quota or a goal,\u201d Mr. Parrish said. \u201cThey are actually just hiring good workers.\u201dMr. Parrish is working on buying a house with his wife in the suburbs, where he lives with his two children now. He sometimes drives them into the city to see the stadiums he\u2019s laid hands on, to show them what their father built.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Moves to Let Xi Stay in Power by Abolishing Term Limit", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s Communist Party has cleared the way for President Xi Jinping to stay in power indefinitely, by announcing Sunday that it intends to abolish term limits on the presidency, a momentous break with decades-old rules meant to prevent the country from returning to the days when Mao was shown cultish obedience.The surprise move, revealed in a dryly worded proposal to amend the Constitution, is the boldest yet by Mr. Xi as he seeks to strengthen the party\u2019s control over a modernizing society and restore China to what he considers its rightful place as a global power \u2014 an agenda that his allies have suggested requires his personal leadership.The timing of the announcement startled even experienced observers of Chinese politics: Mr. Xi completes his first term as president next month and could have waited until late in his second term to act. He also could have stepped down after his second term and run the country from behind the scenes, as some of his predecessors have.By moving so early in his tenure, Mr. Xi, 64, is in effect proclaiming that he intends to stay in office well past 2023, overturning rules of succession in Chinese politics that evolved as the party sought stability following the power struggles to replace first Mao, and then Deng Xiaoping.\u201cXi Jinping will certainly continue,\u201d said Zhang Ming, a retired historian at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cIn China, he can do what he wants to do, and this is just sending a clearer signal of that.\u201dMr. Xi already serves as the party\u2019s general secretary and the military chief, positions with no term limits.\u201cWhat are the risks of these shifts?\u201d Professor Minzner said. \u201cIn the short term, all the traditional dangers that arise from the excessive centralization of power in the hands of one person. But in the long term, the real question is how far the breakdown in political norms could go.\u201dJiang Zemin, the leader who succeeded Deng, was installed during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 and served two terms as president from 1993 to 2003. But he lingered in power until 2004 by retaining control of the committee that runs China\u2019s military.His successor, Hu Jintao, stepped down from all his positions after his two terms \u2014 an example that some experts had expected Mr. Xi to follow.But as Mr. Xi\u2019s first term comes to an end, few in China see much likelihood of his power being subdued anytime soon by rivals in the leadership elite.During his first term, Mr. Xi pressed an aggressive campaign against corruption and dissent, a crackdown that has silenced potential rivals in the leadership. At the same time, many party elders, who once held intimidating influence, have died or are too old for political intrigue. Mr. Jiang is 91, and Mr. Hu, 75, has shown no appetite for taking on Mr. Xi.On the Chinese internet, some people eluded the party\u2019s censors and mocked Mr. Xi\u2019s ambitions by sharing images like that of Winnie the Pooh \u2014 portly like Mr. Xi, and used by critics to represent him \u2014 hugging a huge jar of honey.But many people in China have applauded his campaign against official corruption. And harsh security measures make mass protests against a central leader nearly impossible. So any major public backlash against Mr. Xi\u2019s move appears unlikely.\u201cI don\u2019t see any reasonable challenges for him,\u201d Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing who formerly taught at Tsinghua University, said of Mr. Xi. \u201cHe has removed any potential political competitors. So far, there is no organized political competition for him.\u201dThe proposed constitutional changes were released in the name of the Central Committee, a council of hundreds of senior party officials, who will meet starting on Monday for three days.Mr. Xi had already built expectations that he would stay in office past two terms, and some analysts said he must have decided to move while at peak political strength. Usually, authority begins to ebb from Chinese leaders as retirement nears.In another victory for Mr. Xi, the draft amendments to the Constitution would add his trademark expression for his main ideas \u2014 \u201cXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d \u2014 into the preamble of the Constitution, as well as adding a nod to the ideological contributions of his predecessor, Mr. Hu.The proposed amendments would also authorize a new anticorruption commission that Mr. Xi has pushed. The commission would expand the reach of corruption investigations, which up to now have mostly been conducted by a Communist Party agency acting largely beyond the law.The amendments are almost certain to be passed into law by the party-controlled legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, which holds its annual full session starting on March 5. The congress has never voted down a proposal from party leaders.In what would be another break with tradition, Wang Qishan, a close ally of Mr. Xi in his campaign against corruption and disloyalty in the party, appears set to return to power as vice president. Mr. Wang, 69, stepped down from a party position last year because of his age.At the Communist Party national congress in October, Mr. Xi conspicuously broke with precedent by choosing not to name a pair of much younger officials to the Politburo\u2019s ruling inner circle, the seven-member standing committee, to serve as his potential heirs. Instead, Mr. Xi chose men \u2014 no women \u2014 who were closer to his own age or older.Mr. Xi\u2019s strongman style has been compared to that of the Russian president. But even Mr. Putin did not try to erase his country\u2019s constitutional limit on serving more than two consecutive terms as president when he approached that limit in 2008.With Mr. Xi\u2019s hold on power now seems unquestioned for the foreseeable future, the biggest question will be how he chooses to wield it.\u201cXi Jinping is susceptible to making big mistakes because there are now almost no checks or balances,\u201d said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who is the author of a 2015 biography of Mr. Xi. \u201cEssentially, he has become emperor for life.\u201dJavier C.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Twin Deficits (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany years ago, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and some Republicans still talked sense, the Reagan administration pursued a policy of tax cuts and military buildup even as the Fed was tightening monetary policy to fight inflation. This policy mix bore some obvious resemblance to Trumponomics. And two things happened at more or less the same time: for the first time ever, the U.S. began running large peacetime full-employment budget deficits, and we began running large, sustained trade deficits.At the time, Martin Feldstein famously linked the two, calling them \u201ctwin deficits.\u201d While this oversimplified matters \u2013 in the late 1990s we ran both budget surpluses and trade deficits, thanks to booming investment \u2013 the logic made sense. Fiscal stimulus directly raised trade deficits by boosting overall spending, and the fiscal-monetary collision raised interest rates, pushing up the dollar and shifting spending from U.S. to foreign goods.One is simply to note that so far we\u2019ve seen only modest increases in interest rates and no rise at all in the dollar. So this doesn\u2019t look much like Reaganomics yet. Maybe it\u2019s still something that will happen; or maybe the Trump tax cuts won\u2019t deliver much fiscal stimulus, just pile up in retained earnings or get used for stock buybacks that don\u2019t do much for consumer spending. Or maybe, as Setser implicitly suggests, we need to do a \u201cbut for\u201d: but for the tax cut other factors, like the very real strengthening in the European economy, would be driving the dollar sharply lower.Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to make sense of Setser\u2019s remarks on investment income. He writes:The U.S. now has a large stock of external debt, so a higher nominal interest rate in the U.S. mechanically leads to higher interest payments on that external debt (interest payments are big part of the income balance in the current account, along with the dividend income on foreign direct investment). The United States\u2019 external debt has quietly increased to about 50 percent of GDP, so a 1 percentage point increase in the nominal interest rate translates into half a percentage point of GDP increase in the amount of interest the U.S. will need to pay to the world.And there are two more points.First, while foreigners now have a lot of equity in the U.S., we\u2019re still something of a hedge fund among nations: we owe debt in dollars, and hold assets that are effectively in foreign currencies. This has the peculiar consequence that, unlike what happens with most debtor nations, any rise in the dollar worsens our net investment position: liabilities rise along with our currency, assets don\u2019t. This also means that a rising dollar tends to have a negative effect on our investment income balance, quite aside from interest rates, because the income of U.S. corporations overseas becomes worth less in dollars.So are we looking at an era of Trumpian twin deficits? Yes, probably. But the channels will be a bit different from those of the Reagan era.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Launches Virtual Currency, Hoping to Resuscitate Economy", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 With Venezuela suffering one of the most severe economic collapses of modern times, the beleaguered administration of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced on Tuesday that it had begun a presale of virtual currency backed by the nation\u2019s vast petroleum reserves.The government, which had announced plans for the new digital currency late last year, said the initiative was a response to a financial crisis marked by a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bol\u00edvar, and quadruple-digit inflation.The country is suffering desperate scarcities of food and medicine, soaring crime rates and the collapse of public services and the health system. The crisis has driven hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee the country seeking a better life.The Maduro administration hopes that sales of the digital currency, known as the petro, will help its treasury pay off debt and increase imports of vitally needed goods, as well as raw materials for manufacturing.Venezuelan officials also asserted that the new digital currency \u2014 the first to be issued by a nation \u2014 would allow investors to do an end run around sanctions imposed against their country by the Trump administration. These sanctions ban the purchase in American markets of new securities issued by the Venezuelan government, and outlaw business dealings with Mr. Maduro and several top administration officials.\u201cFor big problems, big solutions,\u201d Mr. Maduro said Tuesday night at a ceremony in Caracas. \u201cWe Venezuelans are indomitable.\u201dHe called it a \u201ccryptocurrency to take on Superman.\u201dBut many analysts and critics of the government did not give the digital currency much hope of success.\u201cI just think it\u2019s a desperate move by a regime that is increasingly isolated and has an economy that has spiraled out of its control,\u201d said Cynthia J. Arnson, director of the Latin American Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.The Venezuelan government has said the value of the petro will be tied in some way to the value of a barrel of Venezuelan oil. But the Maduro administration has not given many details on how this pricing would work, and many investors have said they would not trust the government to faithfully maintain the link between the petro and the price of oil.\u201cThe petro will most likely suffer all of the same ills as Venezuelan debt,\u201d predicted David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has researched Venezuela for more than two decades.A spokesman for the United States Treasury Department warned American investors last month that the petro might still run afoul of the sanctions, telling Reuters that the currency \u201cwould appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government\u201d and could \u201cexpose U.S. persons to legal risk.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democratic, wrote to the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, in January, asking him to monitor the situation closely.\u201cWe have serious doubts about whether Venezuela has the capacity to launch a cryptocurrency,\u201d the letter said. \u201cBut regardless, it is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular.\u201dCritics of the Maduro administration, including many in the international community, attribute the nation\u2019s economic problems to government mismanagement. Mr. Maduro blames a conspiracy involving the political opposition working in concert with foreign governments, especially the United States.\u201c@RealDonaldTrump campaigned promoting noninterference in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs, \u201c he said. \u201cThe time has come to fulfill it and change your agenda of aggression for one of dialogue.\u201dMr. Maduro added: \u201cDialogue in Caracas or in Washington, D.C.?\u201dThe Trump administration has sought to justify its sanctions against Venezuelan officials by accusing them of political repression and public corruption.Last month, while adding four more names to the growing list of Venezuelan officials placed in the sanctions list, the Treasury Department criticized the nation\u2019s all-powerful Constituent Assembly for prohibiting three major opposition parties from participating in the presidential election.Mr. Maduro will be running for re-election in the April race, and with his government in control of the electoral machinery and the highest court, he is expected to win. But the United States, Colombia and other countries have already declared that they will not recognize the results.Ms. Arnson said the introduction of the currency could provide a political lift to Mr. Maduro\u2019s re-election ambitions.\u201cLooking like you\u2019re doing something to save the economy, that goes beyond paying off your foreign creditors, is an important part of the electoral strategy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think this is fantasy-land in terms of being an economic life jacket.\u201dThe Venezuelan government\u2019s petro initiative is one of the wildest outgrowths of an explosion in activity around virtual currencies over the last year. Inspired by the skyrocketing price of Bitcoin in 2017, many entrepreneurs raised money by creating and selling their own virtual currencies in so-called initial coin offerings.Russian government officials have also discussed issuing some sort of crypto-ruble, to evade American sanctions.But no government has moved ahead more swiftly, and with more abandon, than Venezuela.The documents that have been put out by the Venezuelan government suggest that the petro\u2019s release will be similar to the offerings done by private companies.Coin offerings have been attractive to entrepreneurs because investors can send their money using Bitcoin or other existing virtual currencies, which do not go through banks or other institutions that could decline the transactions.The same structure could be beneficial to Venezuela, given that it is facing American sanctions that have made it hard to raise money through established channels.For investors, though, the petro may be a hard sell, given that the system will be designed and controlled by the Venezuelan government, which has not been the most reliable financial player.The design of the petro, while clearly inspired by Bitcoin, would, in some ways, be the opposite of most virtual currencies like Bitcoin, which are designed to operate without any central government or authority in charge.Bitcoin has largely won over investors because there is no central authority that could suddenly change the number of Bitcoins to be released, or the rules of the network.With the petro, on the other hand, the confidence of investors is likely to be only as strong as their confidence in the Maduro government.Advertisement"}

Bacow, a former president of Tufts University and a top academic officer at M.I.T., who was chosen for his diplomatic and leadership skills at a time when higher education is under fire, the university announced on Sunday.The departure of Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard\u2019s first female president, who is stepping down after 11 years, created an opportunity for Harvard to choose a leader who would reflect the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements that have shaped campus dialogue in recent years.Instead, it chose Mr. Bacow, 66, who is better known as a manager and institutional leader than as a scholar. His selection reflects Harvard\u2019s need for a steady hand at a time when the university must navigate the difficulties of dealing with the Trump administration\u2019s antagonism toward elite universities that have large endowments.That was clear at the news conference on Sunday to announce the appointment. William F. Lee, senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation and the chairman of the search committee, described Mr. Bacow as the right leader \u201cat a moment when the value of higher education is being questioned, at a moment when the fundamental truth of fact-based inquiry is being questioned and called into doubt.\u201dSpeaking to reporters, Mr. Bacow described growing up in Pontiac, Mich., as the son of immigrants. His mother was 19 when she reached the United States on the second Liberty ship carrying refugees from Europe after the war, and was the only member of her family to survive Auschwitz, he said. His father, born in Minsk, was brought to America as a child to escape pogroms.\u201cWhere else can one go in one generation from off the boat, with literally nothing, to enjoy the kind of life and opportunity that I and my family have been fortunate to enjoy?\u201d Mr. Bacow said. \u201cIt was higher education that made this all possible.\u201dNow, for the first time in his life, he said, people are questioning the value of going to college, and some of the criticism is fair.\u201cI think academic institutions, including Harvard, need to pay more attention to those in this country who\u2019ve been left behind in this economy,\u201d he said.The university is facing a number of immediate challenges. Like others in its league, it is facing a new 1.4 percent excise tax on the investment returns of endowments for schools with at least 500 students that amount to more than $500,000 per student. Harvard administrators have said the tax could cost the university around $43 million a year, and would weaken Harvard\u2019s ability to support students and research.Harvard is also facing an investigation by the Justice Department into its affirmative action policies and whether they discriminate against Asian-American applicants, as well as a lawsuit making the same claims in federal court in Boston.Mr. Bacow will take over on July 1, becoming the 29th president of Harvard. He is now the Hauser leader in residence at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government\u2019s Center for Public Leadership.He was president of Tufts University for 10 years, until July 2011. The Harvard announcement said he was known there for increasing collaboration across schools and disciplines. Before that, he was on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 24 years, where he served as chancellor, chairman of the faculty and a professor of environmental studies.Although his undergraduate degree is from M.I.T., he has three Harvard postgraduate degrees: a law degree, and a master\u2019s and a doctorate in public policy.Mr. Bacow was originally part of the university\u2019s presidential search committee, which considered more than 700 candidates, Mr. Lee said, before deciding that the right leader was in plain sight.Stephanie Saul and Patrick Healy contributed.Advertisement"}

The issue really is that straightforward.So forget for a minute about what President Trump keeps saying about the Dreamers \u2014 that he cares about them \u2014 and focus on his actions: First, he went out of his way to cancel their legal protection from deportation, a cancellation scheduled to take effect in March. Then Trump rejected an emerging bipartisan deal to restore those protections. And this week he announced that he wouldn\u2019t restore the protections unless Congress passed a long list of other fairly radical immigration changes, like a border wall and sharply reduced legal immigration.In the end, the choice is Trump\u2019s. Democrats and Dreamer advocates can lobby him and other Republicans, hoping to put political pressure on them, as happened on health care last year. But Trump will ultimately have a decision to make.

{"Headline": "Ecuador Votes to Bring Back Presidential Term Limits", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQUITO, Ecuador \u2014 Ecuadoreans on Sunday voted to overturn a 2015 constitutional amendment that eliminated presidential term limits, a result widely seen as strengthening the power of President Len\u00edn Moreno while dealing a potentially fatal political blow to former President Rafael Correa.The vote nullifies an amendment put in place by Congress after intense prodding by Mr. Correa, who was president at the time, and who persuaded lawmakers to adopt the measure based on his promise not to run for office in 2017 \u2014 though he left the door open to running in 2021.The official Ecuador electoral agency announced the referendum\u2019s passage on Sunday evening, declaring the results with \u201c99 percent certainty.\u201dThe steps taken by Mr. Correa, who was in power from 2007 to 2017, in hopes of allowing himself a potential fourth term were a stark contrast to the decade preceding his election to the top office, when the country had cycled through seven presidents in a period of political turmoil.Mr. Moreno can still seek a second term, because the Constitution allows one re-election.As he toured the country during the campaign, voters threw tomatoes and eggs at him on several occasions. In the western city of Quinind\u00e9, he had to be evacuated by helicopter after rocks and trash were thrown at his car \u2014 violence that Paola Pab\u00f3n, a former senior official under Mr. Correa, charged was part of an effort led by Mr. Moreno to undermine his rival.Some voters said that was precisely their intention, and that they hoped to undo what they consider the failures of his government.Jhonath\u00e1n Usama, 26, who voted in favor of term limits, said he had been studying medicine at Universidad Cristiana Latinoamericana until Mr. Correa\u2019s government shut it down along with 14 other schools, arguing that they were of poor quality.\u201cWe have to lay Correa to rest and not let him return, not just to the presidency but to the country,\u201d Mr. Usama said after casting his vote in a school in Quito. \u201cThey closed my university without an adequate contingency plan, so I had to leave my family to go study somewhere else and start from scratch.\u201dThe referendum \u2014 which included six other questions on matters like the environment and the penal code \u2014 was also seen as a move by Mr. Moreno to bolster his administration after he won the 2017 election by a narrow margin.\u201cThis referendum is necessary so that we enact changes and in a way legitimize the current administration,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor Cevallos, a businessman who voted in the same school as Mr. Usama. \u201cTo do that we need to show they have public support.\u201dMr. Cevallos said he had voted in favor of most issues on the ballot, but not those that would restrict mining and oil industries to protect the environment, which is part of Mr. Moreno\u2019s agenda.\u201cThe country needs economic resources to move forward and solve the problems of an economy that is currently in crisis,\u201d Mr. Cevallos said.Maggy Ayala reported from Quito, and Marcelo Rochabr\u00fan from Lima, Peru.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Wants to Give Half a Billion People Free Health Care", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 India announced on Thursday a sweeping plan to give half a billion poor Indians free access to health care, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to address rising demands for greater economic and social protections before national elections next year.The move is sure to be popular in a country where most people have no health insurance and the per capita income is a few dollars a day. Although India\u2019s overall economy is growing, Mr. Modi and his governing Bharatiya Janata Party have been trying to find ways to court the population left behind.The health care plan, part of the government\u2019s 2018-19 budget presented on Thursday, would offer 100 million families up to 500,000 rupees, or about $7,860, of coverage each year. That sum, while small by Western standards, would be enough to cover the equivalent of five heart surgeries in India. Officials did not outline eligibility requirements, and many details of the program have yet to be finalized.India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said in a speech to Parliament that the plan would cover more people than any other government-funded health care program in the world. In addition to the direct health benefits, he said, the program would create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\u201cThis is huge. It\u2019s the biggest step the government has taken in 20 years in health care,\u201d said Dr. Ajay Bakshi, the former chief executive of Manipal Hospitals, a chain of 16 private hospitals based in the southern city of Bangalore.The average Indian\u2019s life expectancy is about 68 years, significantly lower than other large developing countries like China or Brazil. In large part, that\u2019s because of poor health care.\u201cThe biggest disease burden sits on the bottom 500 million people. They don\u2019t have access to diagnosis. If they get diagnosed, they don\u2019t have a way to get treatment,\u201d Dr. Bakshi said.\u201cWhat are the poor people dying from? Diarrhea, pneumonia, under-nutrition, malaria, tuberculosis,\u201d said Rama Baru, a professor at the Center of Social Medicine and Community Health at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. \u201cPrevention and curative services need to go together.\u201dThe government offered no details on how it would pay for the health care program. The Finance Ministry said it had allocated $314 million for the proposal, but the program could easily cost billions of dollars per year.A prior plan announced by the Modi government in 2016 to provide 100,000 rupees of health coverage per family was never funded. But Dr. Bakshi said funding was more likely this time because the economy is stronger \u2014 and, more important, elections are looming.\u201cThey will make sure this will be implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cIndian voters have favored governments that have given them wide-scale health coverage.\u201dAs part of the budget proposal, Mr. Jaitley said the government would levy a surtax that would raise about $1.7 billion a year specifically for health care programs.The government is also proposing a new tax on capital gains to capture some of the wealth being created as India\u2019s stock market rises to new highs.Investors in Indian medical stocks clearly expected a windfall from the insurance program: Shares rose in Thursday\u2019s trading.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Corbyn, Backing a \u2018Soft\u2019 Brexit, Takes Aim at Conservatives", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The leader of Britain\u2019s opposition party, Jeremy Corbyn, tried on Monday to position Labour as the standard-bearer of a \u201csoft\u201d exit from the European Union, narrowing the maneuvering room for Theresa May, the country\u2019s already weakened prime minister.In a much-anticipated speech, Mr. Corbyn proposed that Britain remain in a customs union with European Union member states when it leaves the bloc, to soften the economic shock of an abrupt exit.He made that position conditional on Britain being able to take part with the European Union in negotiating trade deals with other countries, a notion Brussels has so far steadfastly resisted.The group said that Mr. Corbyn\u2019s plan would \u201cput jobs and living standards first by remaining in a close economic relationship with the E.U.\u201dThe Labour leader came under attack from people in both parties who support Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, who said he had abandoned his long-held principles for political advantage. A terse statement from Mrs. May\u2019s office said that she stood by her rejection of any form of customs union after Brexit.Mr. Corbyn stopped short of recommending that Britain remain in the single market, which would allow for the continued free movement of people, services and goods among member states, as advocated by his party\u2019s strong anti-Brexit faction. But there, too, he left open plenty of room for interpretation, saying he backed a \u201cnew and strong relationship with the single market\u201d that would include tariff-free access.\u201cLabour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said, \u201cwith no new impediments to trade and no reduction in rights, standards and protections.\u201dHe also said it made \u201cno sense\u201d for Britain to abandon the European Union\u2019s rule-making agencies for things like food safety and chemicals.Mr. Corbyn, a longtime euroskeptic, has been moving slowly toward a softer view on Britain\u2019s exit from the union, dragged there by his chief Brexit strategist, Keir Starmer, and others in the party. But his shift also has a strategic component, seemingly timed to inflict maximum damage to the political fortunes of Mrs. May, whose Conservative Party is deeply divided over the process.By claiming the moderate space in the Brexit debate, Mr. Corbyn could draw rebels in Mrs. May\u2019s party into a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d voting bloc capable of defeating Mrs. May\u2019s legislation in Parliament. That could happen sometime after Easter.The Labour leader has announced the shift amid signs that public support on the issue may be softening.Mrs. May has seemed eager to steer a middle path, but she is under pressure from hard-liners in her party who advocate severing ties with the single market and customs union, and steering the country toward a low-regulation, low-tax economy.Mr. Corbyn mocked Tory infighting over the terms of the deal on Monday, joking that \u201canything agreed at breakfast is being briefed against at lunch and abandoned at teatime,\u201d and tried to present himself as a voice of sanity.\u201cThe European Union is not the root of all our problems, and leaving it will not solve all our problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be some who will tell you that Brexit is a disaster for our country, and some who will tell you that Brexit will create a land of milk and honey. The truth is more down to earth, and it\u2019s in our hands.\u201dConservatives had attacked Mr. Corbyn in advance of the speech, describing his promise of renegotiated trade deals as unrealistic. Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservatives, also warned potential defectors in the party against being swayed by Mr. Corbyn.\u201cBe very careful on this one, because you\u2019re being invited into a Labour Party tactical game, which will actually end up in real damage to the United Kingdom,\u201d he told the BBC.Keir Starmer, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s chief adviser on Brexit, predicted that Mrs. May would face a rebellion.\u201cCrunchtime is now coming for the prime minister, because the majority in Parliament does not back her approach to a customs union\u201d and \u201cwill be heard sooner or later,\u201d he said.Reactions to the speech divided neatly along positions on Brexit.George Osborne, a Conservative opponent of leaving the European Union who served as chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016, wrote in The Evening Standard that Mrs. May had made a fatal mistake by appeasing hard-core Brexiteers, and that Mr. Corbyn had \u201copened up the looming prospect of suffering a huge defeat in the Commons.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case Against Google", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "FeatureCritics say the search giant is squelching competition before it begins. Should the government step in?Supported byIn the years that followed, those overlapping enthusiasms led to cohabitation, a raucous wedding and parallel careers at big technology firms. The thing is, though, when you\u2019re young and geeky and fall in love with someone else young and geeky, all your nerdy friends want you to set them up on dates as well. So Adam and Shivaun, who took Adam\u2019s last name after marriage, approached the problem like two good programmers: They designed a dating app.The app was known as MatchMate, and the idea was simple: Rather than just pairing people with similar interests, their software would put together potential mates according to an array of parameters, such as which pub they were currently standing in, and whether they had friends in common, and what movies they liked or candidates they voted for, and dozens of other factors that might be important in finding a life partner (or at least a tonight partner). The magic of MatchMate was that it could allow a user to mix variables and search for pairings within a specific group, a trick that computer scientists call parameterization. \u201cIt was like asking your best friend to set you up,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cSomeone who says, \u2018Well, you probably think you\u2019d like this guy because he\u2019s handsome, but actually you\u2019d like this other guy because he\u2019s not as good-looking, but he\u2019s really funny.\u2019\u2009\u201dWithin computer science, this kind of algorithmic alchemy is sometimes known as vertical search, and it\u2019s notoriously hard to master. Even Google, with its thousands of Ph.D.s, gets spooked by vertical-search problems. \u201cGoogle\u2019s built around horizontal search, which means if you type in \u2018What\u2019s the population of Myanmar,\u2019 then Google finds websites that include the words \u2018Myanmar\u2019 and \u2018population,\u2019 and figures out which ones are most likely to answer your question,\u201d says Neha Narula, who was a software engineer at Google before joining the M.I.T. Media Lab. You don\u2019t really care if Google sends you to Wikipedia or a news article or some other site, as long as its results are accurate and trustworthy. But, Narula says, \u201cwhen you start asking questions with only one correct answer, like, Which site has the cheapest vacuum cleaner? \u2014 that\u2019s much, much harder.\u201dFor search engines like Google, finding that one correct answer becomes particularly difficult when people have numerous parameters they want satisfied: Which vacuum cleaner is cheapest but also energy-efficient and good on thick carpets and won\u2019t scare the dog? To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.Soon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?As far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.Froogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201dAdam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.The Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.In a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.At the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.In its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201dStandard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201dIn 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201dThe Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.For decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.Consider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.What eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.The Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.\u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201dGoogle executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.One way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201dLeft unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.Shivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.As the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.But they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.Then there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201dThe more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201dTradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)Shivaun and Adam filled notepads with the names of companies that had complained about Google\u2019s tactics \u2014 eJustice, a vertical-search engine for legal information; NexTag, the fellow price-comparison site; BDZV, a group of German newspapers. They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.\u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.Google responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201dThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.Along the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.Even when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.By the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201dReback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201dIn public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.In the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.And most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201dMicrosoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.Or consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201dIt was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.The implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.\u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201dSome legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201dThose are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.Rather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.Put differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.For the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201dOne of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Trump Nationalize a 5G Network?", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House proposal, which at the moment is just an idea, appears driven by concerns about security threats related to China\u2019s development of 5G networks. But the strongest case for building a national network is different. Done right, a national 5G network could save a lot of Americans a lot of money and revive competition in what has become an entrenched oligopoly. Done wrong, on the other hand, it could look like something out of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s disastrous economic playbook.Americans spend an extraordinary amount of money on bandwidth. The cable industry is the worst offender: Since cable providers have little effective competition, cable bills have grown at many times the rate of inflation and can easily reach thousands of dollars per year. Mobile phone service is not exactly a bargain, either. And with plans to connect cars, toasters and pets to the internet, broadband bills may continue to soar.These bills, collectively, function like a private tax on the whole economy. Could a public 5G network cut that tax?A national 5G network would be a kind of 21st-century Tennessee Valley Authority. The government would build or lease towers across the country, prioritizing underserved areas, and set up a public utility that sold bandwidth at cost. This cheap bandwidth would be made available for resale by anyone who wanted to provide home broadband or wireless, thus creating a new business model for small local resellers.The new competition might save people money in a few ways. First, it could create price competition for the four national carriers (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint). More important, it could do the same for cable broadband, whose providers face minimal competition in most areas. And it might give small telecom businesses a new lease on life. As a result, prices could be cheaper and jobs could be created.As with any public infrastructure, the case for it is strongest if private industry won\u2019t build it and the public benefit is considerable. The case for public roads rests on the assumption that private industry won\u2019t build roads that reach the whole country. In telecom, we see a similar pattern: Companies like Verizon have been happy to build fiber-optic or 4G service in cities like Boston and New York but are less excited about doing so in poor and rural America.But the case for a national 5G network comes with two major caveats. First, it has to be done right: A strongman approach \u2014 nationalizing AT&T\u2019s and Verizon\u2019s nascent networks instead of building new ones \u2014 is too Ch\u00e1vez-esque. Seizing private assets in peacetime without good reason sets a dangerous precedent. And you don\u2019t need to be paranoid to fear the combination of the world\u2019s largest government and largest telecommunication companies. Any federally owned 5G network would need to have privacy protections and be as separate from the political branches as possible.The second caveat is that while the government can be good at building things, its management record is less inspiring. Any national network it builds should be government-owned for its first decade or so, and then sold off to the highest bidder.The idea of \u201cTrump 5G\u201d has come as an unwelcome shock to the major telecommunications firms and their allies. Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, warned that \u201cany federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction\u201d from winning \u201cthe 5G war.\u201d Presumably, he doesn\u2019t mean that competition is bad, but that a plan for nationalization will cause private industry to stop investing in its networks. Fair enough. But the economy has countless other areas in which private and public programs compete, and the key question is how considerable the loss of private incentives would really be, and whether the public benefits compensate for it.That\u2019s a tough call. But if winning the 5G war is the F.C.C.\u2019s priority, a federal network might be how we get 5G to more citizens more quickly. It is surely a crazy idea, but we live in crazy times, and if done right, it merits serious consideration.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Turmoil From Washington to Wall Street, a Surprisingly Passive President", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThere are times when it serves a president\u2019s interests to step back and let events play out around him, but it goes against the grain for Mr. Trump, who has always styled himself as the master of his universe.

His often impulsive Twitter blasts can upend negotiations and shift the focus of events, sometimes at odds with the official position of his own White House. And so his relatively low profile in recent days has been striking.\u201cThe other players in Washington, whether it\u2019s Congress or the Senate leadership, really have come to the conclusion: Let\u2019s ignore him, because we have things to do,\u201d said Maria Echaveste, a former deputy White House chief of staff under Mr. Clinton. \u201cThe budget deal is a perfect example of that. He\u2019s not constructive so they\u2019re ignoring him.\u201dSpeaking after reaching the budget deal with his Republican counterpart, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said he had learned to proceed without bothering with the president. \u201cOften times we can get a lot more done working with one another and let the White House just sit on the sidelines, because you don\u2019t know what their positions are,\u201d he said.The president\u2019s hands-off approach on the budget deal worked for him to the extent that it included the boost in military spending that he has been demanding, but it also included a large increase in domestic spending as well.As a result, the federal deficit will balloon to nearly $1.2 trillion by 2019, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to get the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order. At one point during the campaign, Mr. Trump even promised to eliminate not just the annual deficit but the entire national debt accumulated over decades and now totaling more than $20 trillion. Instead, at this rate, he will pile up trillions of dollars of additional borrowing.Conservatives complained that he should have played a more active role in the negotiations to avoid that. \u201cI think it would have made a big difference if Trump had pushed hard for lower spending numbers, particularly if he had pushed a consistent message,\u201d said Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. He noted that Democrats backed down during the last government shutdown. \u201cThat would have given Trump power,\u201d he said.The White House was, again, not engaging on Friday. It held no news briefing and a spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the president\u2019s approach. But on Twitter, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for the spending increases in the budget deal. Even though Republicans control both chambers, they need Democratic votes to end filibusters in the Senate.Still, some Republicans said Mr. Trump may be most successful by setting the larger goals and then backing off. \u201cDifferent presidents have different interest levels in being in the weeds on policy details,\u201d said J. Scott Jennings, who was a special assistant to Mr. Bush and is now a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. \u201cThis one, it seems to me, works best when he lays out broad priorities \u2014 more defense spending, cut taxes \u2014 and then allows the tacticians to engage and make it so.\u201dAfter a fractious first year between Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, Mr. Jennings said the president seemed to have finally found traction in the relationship, trusting the leader to manage legislative strategy. \u201cOnce they found their groove, things started working,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump\u2019s job approval has gone up, the numbers on the economy have improved and the generic ballot has begun to shrink.\u201dStill, there is the danger of looking as if he is too removed. He did not sound particularly aggressive about domestic violence after his staff secretary, Rob Porter, was accused of physically abusing two former wives and resigned. Instead, his only public comment was to praise Mr. Porter and express sadness for him. In private, advisers said Mr. Trump was angry both that he had not been informed earlier about the allegations and that he had not been consulted on the initial White House response.He likewise remained generally quiet about the tumble of the stock market, which has now reached an official correction, after lauding its increases for a year. Critics said he could not have it both ways, claiming credit when share prices rise while avoiding blame when they fall.Democrats and some Republicans said Congress is dysfunctional enough without Mr. Trump getting involved. \u201cI am absolutely convinced that at this point in time the best thing for everyone involved is for this president to stay as far away as possible,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top Democratic aide in the Senate. \u201cThe last thing this chaotic institution needs is for him to wreak more havoc by getting involved.\u201dThe one exception, he added, would be immigration, where Mr. Trump should play more of a role. \u201cThe issue is so toxic,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they\u2019re never going to get anything done unless he leans in and gives some cover to the Republicans.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Doesn\u2019t Give a Dam", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump doesn\u2019t give a dam. Or a bridge. Or a road. Or a sewer system. Or any of the other things we talk about when we talk about infrastructure.That\u2019s not to say that the plan is completely vacuous. One section says that it would \u201cauthorize federal divestiture of assets that would be better managed by state, local or private entities.\u201d Translation: We\u2019re going to privatize whatever we can. It\u2019s conceivable that this would be done only in cases where the private sector really would do better, and contracts would be handed out fairly, without a hint of cronyism. And if you believe that, I have a degree from Trump University you might want to buy.Yet there is something puzzling about Trump\u2019s failure to come up with a remotely plausible infrastructure plan. After all, there would be major economic and political advantages to such a program.First, the economics: America desperately needs to repair and upgrade its deteriorating roads, water systems, power grid and more. True, we\u2019re no longer a depressed economy that needs public investment to put the unemployed back to work; massive infrastructure spending would have been an even better idea five years ago. But it\u2019s still something that needs doing.And as I said, there would be political advantages, too. If Trump just pushed ahead with a straightforward, conventional public investment plan, he could trumpet the number of workers employed on new projects. Furthermore, he could surely find a way to stick his name on many of those projects. Historically, many politicians have had what\u2019s known in the trade as an edifice complex \u2014 an urge to build big stuff to promote their personal brand and feed their vanity. Certainly Trump of all people would find that prospect appealing.By the way, some Democrats feared that Trump really would go big on infrastructure, which might drive a wedge into their party and be highly popular besides.Oh, and another point: Public spending can yield a lot of private profit. An infrastructure program involving real money could be very lucrative for Trump cronies, or for that matter Trump himself. Yes, there are rules that are supposed to prevent that kind of profiteering, but does anyone think those rules would be enforced under current management?So why isn\u2019t Trump proposing something real? Why this dog\u2019s breakfast of a proposal that everyone knows won\u2019t go anywhere?Part of the answer is that in practice Trump always defers to Republican orthodoxy, and the modern G.O.P. hates any program that might show people that government can work and help people.But I also suspect that Trump is afraid to try anything substantive. To do public investment successfully, you need leadership and advice from experts. And this administration doesn\u2019t do expertise, in any field. Not only do experts have a nasty habit of telling you things you don\u2019t want to hear, their loyalty is suspect: You never know when their professional ethics might kick in.So the Trump administration probably couldn\u2019t put together a real infrastructure plan even if it wanted to. And that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Are the Start-Ups? Loss of Dynamism Is Impeding Growth", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCan the market economy still deliver prosperity?And yet a broad sweep of statistics reveals a peculiar weariness spreading through the economy. Belying breathless headlines about the fabulous opportunities that technology is about to bestow on society, it suggests that many rich market democracies have lost much of their dynamism. Their companies are getting old, and their labor markets are getting stuck. Productivity growth has slumped. And many workers in their prime are peeling off from the labor force.Most notably, the economy\u2019s ability to generate and support new businesses \u2014 agents of creative destruction that bring new products and methods into the marketplace \u2014 appears to be faltering across the world. In the United States, the rate of company formation is half what it was four decades ago. And it is slowing in many industrialized countries.One might blame this on the recession that crippled the world almost a decade ago, in the wake of the global financial crisis set off by the implosion of home values in the United States. But the weariness extends beyond the latest turns of the economic cycle.Clear though the pattern may be, the researchers acknowledge that we haven\u2019t yet figured out what is holding the economy\u2019s dynamism back. \u201cThis is one of those big, economywide trends,\u201d Mr. Shambaugh told me. \u201cThere is room for a lot of stories.\u201dCan the corporate landscape become more dynamic again? \u201cNone of the potential policy explanations have been conclusively shown to account for the bulk of the decline in dynamism,\u201d Mr. Shambaugh and his colleagues note. The critical question that remains is whether there is a set of policies that might restore the economy\u2019s vitality.This isn\u2019t just about demographic and social change. Sure, we are aging. Older workers will be less likely to move to a new job across state lines. Families with two earners will have a harder time relocating when one gets a new job offer. Stratospheric rents will make it tough to migrate to some of the most vibrant labor markets, like New York or San Francisco.But this alone cannot explain away stagnation. Explaining stagnation requires explaining not only why there are so few well-paying jobs but also why there are so few emergent companies ready to employ productive workers. Well into the information age, in a business ecosystem with low barriers to entry, where venture capital stands ready to throw itself at the next good idea, the economy has somehow forgotten how to create companies.This is not the only possible diagnosis, I understand. Many economists will reject my proposition that the nation\u2019s economy has been given to oligopolies; that antitrust law has proved no match for the ferocious concentration of market power in the hands of a few businesses that have been allowed to impose their will on the economy as a whole.It fits, however. An economy controlled by big, entrenched companies will have little place for the kind of disruption that could push productivity onto a higher plane. That description looks very much like the economy that many American workers are coping with today.Advertisement"}

Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations.Citi\u2019s underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years.The message from Citi\u2019s board seems to be that, since the bank\u2019s performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbat\u2019s pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street.But on other yardsticks, the awards can seem highCiti may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bank\u2019s return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of America\u2019s was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan.And the makeup of the compensation mattersC.E.O.s\u2019 compensation is made up of different types of pay:\u2022 Cash salaries and cash bonuses\u2022 Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future.The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is.Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 The decision starts a maximum 75-day clock for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to decide whether to approve or oppose the deal, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Chinese investors have faced heightened scrutiny from Cfius.

Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.Hence the new plan.The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems. It would allow both sides leeway to strike their own rules once they\u2019ve agreed on their main objectives. And it suggests that a monitoring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set up.Will the E.U. agree to the plan?The bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation. Certain politicians in the E.U. may argue Britain is trying to retain the privileges of the single market while discarding the duties that come with it. Still, some of Europe\u2019s leaders, banks and businesses may support the plan, in the belief that it will minimize disruption and allow the City of London to continue to play a big role in financing the strong economic expansion taking place in Europe.\u2014Peter EavisPeter Thiel.Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Thiel Macro, which invests Mr. Thiel\u2019s fortune, held put options on 1.9 million shares of ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures as of Dec. 31.

But if it had, he would have reaped a big windfall.Investors piled into bets that volatility would continue to decline last year.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMotherhood is the biggest cause of the gender pay gap. It might take fathers to change that.But it is not as egalitarian as the fantasy suggests. Despite generous social policies, women who work full-time there are still paid 15 percent to 20 percent less than men, new research shows \u2014 a gender pay gap similar to that in the United States. The main reason for this pay gap seems to be the same in both places: Children hurt mothers\u2019 careers. This is, in large part, because women spend more time on child rearing than men do, whether by choice or not. But policy alone would not be enough to overcome gender inequality. It would require changes in behavior \u2014 including by men. There is evidence that the gap would shrink if fathers acted more the way mothers do after having children, by spending more time on parenting and the related responsibilities. \u201cAt the very least, men have to take a larger role,\u201d said Francine Blau, an economist at Cornell who has studied the gender pay gap and family-friendly policies in the United States and Europe. \u201cIt does become a distinction in the eyes of employers between potential male and female workers, and it may reinforce traditional gender roles.\u201d Most studies of the pay gap analyze equal pay for equal work. But in this paper, researchers examined how women changed their work in response to having children, and how that affected their lifelong pay. Mothers were paid less partly because they worked fewer hours, took longer breaks from employment and were more likely to move into lower-paying, family-friendly jobs, the paper found. Their probability of becoming a manager also declined. \u201cEqual work is in practice not an option for most women, because they have to take care of the children and therefore have different kinds of jobs and different kinds of hours,\u201d said Henrik Kleven, an economist at Princeton, who wrote the paper with Jakob Egholt Sogaard, an economist at the University of Copenhagen, and Camille Landais, an economist at the London School of Economics. There are different explanations for this, researchers say. Women may have intrinsic preferences to do more of this work, or couples could decide it\u2019s most efficient to divide the labor this way. It could also be that social norms about traditional gender roles influence men and women to behave this way. But as long as mothers, and not fathers, are the ones using policies like paid leave and taking on the additional work at home after having children, the lifetime pay inequity seems certain to remain. \u201cIf you know that both men and women will go off and take care of children, not just women, what that does is remove the motherhood penalty,\u201d said Heejung Chung, a sociologist at the University of Kent.

{"Headline": "Trump Says \u2018No President Has Ever Cut So Many Regulations.\u2019 Not Quite.", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact CheckWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump boasted again on Friday that he has unleashed a roaring American economy by cutting more red tape in the federal bureaucracy than any previous president, the latest attempt to prove he is making good on his campaign pledge to slash industry regulations.\u201cNo president has ever cut so many regulations in their entire term, O.K., as we have cut in less than a year,\u201d Mr. Trump told the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. \u201cAnd it is my opinion that the regulations had as big an impact as these massive tax cuts that we have given.\u201dBefore taking office, Mr. Trump promised to eliminate at least two federal regulations for each new one that is issued during his administration. In dozens of speeches since, the president largely has stuck to two specific claims about his deregulation record.Neither is true, according to analysts who study regulations and former federal workers who have administered them.The Trump administration has engaged in a sleight of hand to create the 22-1 ratio. And while Mr. Trump has made progress in his deregulatory agenda, his claims of achieving more success in one year than throughout the entire presidencies of any of his predecessors is hyperbole, not fact.But the chart \u2014 which the federal Regulatory Information Service Center says has never been compiled during earlier presidencies \u2014 raises more questions than it answers. For example:\u25a0 Of the 65 other \u201cderegulatory actions\u201d on the chart, 60 percent were either routine, administrative or otherwise not significant. About one-third of those efforts to roll back regulations began under President Barack Obama. And 10 do not appear to be rules \u2014 they are advisory notices or guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget.Mr. Trump later compared the deregulatory actions in his first year in office to all of those taken during the full \u201cfour years, eight years, or, in one instance, 16 years\u201d in all previous presidential administrations.No American president has served for 16 years; Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to four presidential terms but only served for 12 years before dying in office.Beyond that, comparing regulatory activity across administrations is an imperfect exercise. Standards for making and revoking rules are frequently changing, and courts and Congress can tweak and review them as well. But available metrics indicate that Mr. Trump is wrong to claim he has already stopped or eliminated more federal rules than any other president.Experts said that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to cut through the bureaucracy fall far short of the structural changes made under Ronald Reagan, who abolished entire regulatory agencies and eliminated some economic regulations in the transportation, telecommunications and energy industries. \u201cNothing Trump has done to date compares to that in terms of impact on Americans,\u201d Ms. Dudley said.Mr. Trump\u2019s hyperbole not withstanding, he can claim some deregulatory successes.Dan Goldbeck of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit conservative group that promotes smaller government, said he sees a more concerted effort to streamline and trim back regulations under Mr. Trump than under many previous administrations.The pace of consideration for significant regulations also has slowed. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reviewed 60 rules that were described as economically significant between Jan. 21, 2017, to Jan. 20, 2018. The last time so few federal rules were reviewed in one-year was 1984, under Mr. Reagan.The federal regulatory system will continue to evolve throughout \u2014 and beyond \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s time in office. So will his own approach, experts said.Additionally, there is no guarantee that regulations that have been waived will survive legal challenges, nor that they will remain in place in future presidential administrations. Once agencies complete the rule-making process, Ms. Dudley said, \u201cthey will likely have to defend their deregulatory action in court, where they may or may not succeed.\u201d Congress also could later decide to reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\u201cRegulatory change is not forever. They\u2019re not like diamonds,\u201d Mr. Coglianese said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jacob Zuma\u2019s Legacy Is a Weakened South Africa", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the end, though, his party turned against him, asking him to step down a full year and a half before the end of his second term. Cyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president and A.N.C. leader, is now acting president.Under Mr. Zuma\u2019s leadership, South Africa\u2019s image tumbled. The country that had inspired the world with Nelson Mandela\u2019s idea of peaceful reconciliation, and the continent with Thabo Mbeki\u2019s vision of an \u201cAfrican renaissance,\u201d became known for corrupt leadership and a wide range of thorny problems.Neighbors in the region often asked visitors from South Africa the same question: What went wrong?\u201cIt was a period when South Africa, which was thought to be a shining example of the African continent, an economic powerhouse and also a vibrant democracy, was tested to the limit,\u201d said Somadoda Fikeni, an independent political analyst and a former professor at the University of South Africa.With no formal schooling, Mr. Zuma, the son of a widowed maid, connected strongly with the country\u2019s dispossessed, and was imprisoned for a decade on Robben Island along with Mr. Mandela.Most South Africans will remember Mr. Zuma for his personal ethical problems, especially those related to his homestead, Nkandla. His stubborn reluctance to pay what amounted to a relatively modest sum of about $650,000 for personal upgrades to his home led to outsize consequences: court judgments, invigorated opposition parties and the erosion of public trust.Among voters, Mr. Zuma helped precipitate the decline of the A.N.C., a party that, thanks to its heroic liberation past, had seemed invincible at the polls just a few years earlier.As he steps down, Mr. Zuma may be regarded as the weakest leader in South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid history. His tenure lacked lasting policy successes. His words, actions and appointments repelled investors and often sent the local currency, the rand, spiraling lower.At the same time, he reflected the problems of a party that has struggled to transform itself from a liberation movement to a modern political party, and that has led, mostly unchallenged, for a quarter of a century.The A.N.C. unfailingly stood behind Mr. Zuma until the end of his second term as party leader in December and the election as party leader of Mr. Ramaphosa, an anti-apartheid leader who went on to become one of the nation\u2019s most successful businessmen.Even after that, a sizable faction fought fiercely for Mr. Zuma to complete his full term.\u201cSouth Africa\u2019s downward trajectory cannot be blamed on Zuma alone,\u201d Ralph Mathekga, the author of \u201cWhen Zuma Goes,\u201d wrote. \u201cHe is, after all, just one man and part of a much bigger system.\u201dAn economic populist, Mr. Zuma spoke often of a \u201cradical economic transformation\u201d to make South Africa work better for the vast impoverished black underclass that had been left behind during the rapid years of growth under his archrival, Mr. Mbeki. But under Mr. Zuma, the country\u2019s economy stagnated.Government debt was downgraded to junk status because of poor governing. Unemployment topped 25 percent, and the nation remained one of the world\u2019s most unequal societies.The police massacre of 34 miners involved in a wildcat strike in Marikana in 2012, the worst act of official violence since the end of apartheid, intensified the widespread belief that the A.N.C. had betrayed the people it claimed to be representing.While Mr. Zuma remained popular in many areas that were economically dependent on the party and public works, he was deeply unpopular in Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, where the black middle class is concentrated.Still, though mocked by the country\u2019s black elite, Mr. Zuma was the most gifted politician in townships and rural areas, where he tapped into the resentment of those left behind. He excited crowds by dancing, delivering speeches in English and Zulu, and often performing a song by the A.N.C.\u2019s former military wing, \u201cBring Me My Machine Gun.\u201dA polygamist under Zulu tradition, Mr. Zuma has more than 20 children, some of whom have been involved in questionable business deals.Throughout his time in office, corruption flourished, especially at the state enterprises where access was given to family, friends and business associates, including the Guptas, a wealthy family with widespread business interests.He appointed loyalists \u2014 sometimes with little experience \u2014 to his cabinet and to top positions at state companies like Eskom, the power utility, and South African Airways, the national carrier.Mr. Zuma spent his adult life in Africa\u2019s oldest and most famous liberation party, serving as the party\u2019s intelligence chief during the anti-apartheid struggle. He succeeded in becoming president despite a string of problems that would have ended the careers of less skilled politicians.He faced charges of corruption in an arms deal in the 1990s when he was a senior party leader. He has avoided prosecution in the case, but state prosecutors are expected to decide this month whether to indict him on corruption charges.\u201cTheft and corruption in the private sector is as bad as that in government,\u201d he said.Mr. Zuma said that the upgrades, including a swimming pool and chicken coop, were necessary to ensure his safety and that the costs should therefore be borne by taxpayers. In Parliament, he mocked opposition lawmakers\u2019 pronunciation of Nkandla and cackled openly, secure in his party\u2019s overwhelming majority.Mr. Zuma eventually paid the government the $650,000 \u2014 about 7.8 million rand \u2014 but his intransigence led to further legal problems.The court ordered lawmakers to create rules to regulate a president\u2019s impeachment, raising the possibility that a sitting Mr. Zuma would have faced proceedings this year.Even with their rural strongholds, A.N.C. leaders worried that the party might garner less than half the vote in national elections in 2019, forcing it to take on a coalition partner to govern, or lose power outright.Mr. Mantashe is an ally of Mr. Ramaphosa, who is backed by business and whose core supporters include educated, middle-class black South Africans.It took less than two months for Mr. Ramaphosa and his allies to win over fence-sitters and recalcitrant members of the Zuma camp. For all of Mr. Zuma\u2019s skills as a strategist, he was a lame-duck leader battling the future as embodied in Mr. Ramaphosa and the new leader\u2019s power over appointments and patronage.In pressing Mr. Zuma to step down, Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s allies argued that the new leader should take over the government as soon as possible to rebuild the A.N.C.\u2019s reputation and brand before the 2019 elections. The longer Mr. Zuma remained in power, they said, the greater the risk of performing poorly next year.The party that had always shielded Mr. Zuma agreed.Advertisement"}

The cache of cheaper peanut butter, canned goods, pasta, cereal, \u201cshelf stable\u201d milk and other products would now be selected by the federal government, not by the people actually eating it.The proposal seemed like a radical overhaul of the country\u2019s core food assistance program \u2014 once called food stamps but now commonly known as SNAP. The idea was to shave about $21 billion a year from the federal deficit over the next 10 years. But the reaction was immediate, and largely negative.Democrats claimed the plan shackled the poor while business groups, led by big food retailers, would stand to lose billions of dollars in lost SNAP business. The head of one trade association typically supportive of President Trump\u2019s economic policies accused the administration of reneging on its pledge to cut \u201cred tape and regulations.\u201dIn reality, administration officials on Tuesday admitted that the food-box plan \u2014 which the president\u2019s budget director Mick Mulvaney compared to the Blue Apron grocery delivery service \u2014 had virtually no chance of being implemented anytime soon.Instead, the idea, according to two administration officials who worked on the proposal, was a political gambit by fiscal hawks in the administration aimed at outraging liberals and stirring up members of the president\u2019s own party working on the latest version of the farm bill. The move, they said, was intended to lay down a marker that the administration is serious about pressing for about $85 billion in other cuts to food assistance programs that will be achieved, in part, by imposing strict new work requirements on recipients.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any support for their box plan. And, I worry that it\u2019s a distraction from the budget\u2019s proposal to cut SNAP by some 30 percent. That\u2019s the real battle,\u201d said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive Washington think tank. \u201cThe dangers are these other proposals to cut benefits. But all anyone is talking about today are the boxes.\u201dSenator Debbie Stabenow, the ranking Democrat on the agriculture committee, doubted the motives behind the plan.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a serious proposal and is clearly meant to be a distraction,\u201d Ms. Stabenow said.Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stealthily pitched the idea over the last few weeks to the White House\u2019s Domestic Policy Council as a novel way to reach the administration\u2019s self-imposed goal of slashing federal food assistance programs by $214 billion over the next decade. It was quickly embraced by Mr. Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk who is seeking to steer a debate increasingly dominated by free-spending Republicans and Mr. Trump, who has insisted on major budget increases for the Pentagon and Homeland Security.Neither man had any illusions that the plan would be immediately embraced by congressional Republicans, who were not given advance notice of the proposal, the officials said.That the food-box approach has been tried only in small demonstration projects and never been seriously discussed during dozens of congressional hearings on the SNAP program in recent years did not stop administration officials from putting the force of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency behind it.The budget documents released on Monday omitted other important details, including the real costs of creating a nationwide distribution network for the boxes, especially in rural areas hard hit by the economic downturn and the opioid crisis.\u201cWe have had like 25 hearings on SNAP. The witness list was controlled by Republicans and this idea was never, ever broached,\u201d said Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, ranking Democrat on the House subcommittee that oversees federal food assistance programs. \u201cI think it\u2019s dead on arrival \u2014 I hope it is \u2014 but either way it\u2019s a cruel joke. My God, these people are awful. In addition to being totally misinformed on policy, they are really just not nice people.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Perdue defended the proposal as humane and cost effective, saying his plan offered the \u201csame level of food value\u201d provided by the SNAP program, which replaced the food stamp program in the late 1990s.He described the boxes as \u201ca bold, innovative approach to providing nutritious food to people who need assistance feeding themselves and their families \u2014 and all of it is grown by American farmers and producers.\u201dStill, the idea landed with a thud. It was quickly dismissed by two Republican committee chairmen, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, who leads the Senate agriculture committee, and his counterpart in the House, Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas.Mr. Conaway is drafting a farm bill that is expected to slash billions in spending in the SNAP program through the tightening of some eligibility requirements. Mr. Roberts is overseeing an effort to craft a version of the bill that is expected to include fewer cuts in hopes of gaining the bipartisan support needed to push the measure through the Senate.SNAP, like many other safety net programs, is designed to expand during hard economic times and contract when the economy improves. Nonetheless, the program\u2019s rolls have remained at historically elevated levels, reaching a peak of 47.8 million recipients in 2012 before edging down to 45.6 million last year, according to federal estimates.Mr. Perdue, in particular, has been outspoken in his call to reduce its rolls, criticizing what he calls a culture of dependency among SNAP recipients.But Mr. McGovern said the administration was painting \u201ca distorted picture\u201d of the poor and ignoring the fact that most SNAP recipients are employed and more than a quarter are disabled and unable to seek work.\u201cThey have to stop playing to the cheap seats,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of people in the program are children and seniors and people working in jobs that pay too little to feed their families.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Key Witness in Corruption Trial Tells a Tale of Cuomo", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was early 2014, and Todd R. Howe was on the verge of a major victory. Mr. Howe, a veteran lobbyist and longtime Albany insider, had been trying to arrange a meeting between one of his clients, Steven Aiello, and top state officials, and he had just learned that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo himself might drop in.\u201cThat would be great!\u201d Mr. Howe emailed a friend.His excitement soon turned to anguish.\u201cIt\u2019s a day that will be forever etched in my head,\u201d Mr. Howe replied.In his seven days on the witness stand in Federal District Court in Manhattan, which ended late Thursday afternoon, Mr. Howe described a medley of back-room schemes and deals that have long been a stereotype of New York state politics. And in doing so, he has also \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 come to embody a sort of one-man public relations fiasco for Mr. Cuomo, whose name has been omnipresent throughout the trial.Mr. Howe claims to have facilitated bribes between Joseph Percoco, a former confidante of and top aide to Mr. Cuomo, and three executives with business before the state, including Mr. Aiello, a Syracuse-area developer. Republicans have said the testimony illustrates the unsavory Albany culture they say Mr. Cuomo has indulged and even abetted.While the governor has not been accused of any wrongdoing, his presence has loomed large in the testimony, with witnesses frequently dropping his name and documents showing the defendants\u2019 eagerness to curry his favor.Still, Mr. Howe\u2019s testimony on Thursday \u2014 and in particular, his account of that 2014 meeting with Mr. Cuomo and the circumstances that preceded it \u2014 was one of the first times that the governor has emerged as a major character in one of Mr. Howe\u2019s many anecdotes of how he tried to pull Albany\u2019s unseen levers. And it thrust back into the limelight a host of issues that have dogged Mr. Cuomo in recent years, from his unwavering attempts to revive the stuttering upstate economy, to his longstanding political feuds, to rumors of his temper.The occasion for the governor\u2019s anger in 2014, according to Mr. Howe, was the dissipation of a major construction project in Syracuse that he said Mr. Cuomo had supported.\u201cHe blamed you for what had happened in Syracuse, correct?\u201d the lawyer, Stephen Coffey, asked.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t think that was fair?\u201d\u201cI know the governor well enough to know what\u2019s fair and unfair doesn\u2019t really matter in a situation like this,\u201d Mr. Howe replied.Mr. Howe had previously spoken glowingly of both Mr. Cuomo and his father, Mario M. Cuomo, having worked as an aide to both men. But on Thursday, he seemed to indicate that his admiration of the current governor was tempered by a fearful respect. At one point, he acknowledged Mr. Cuomo\u2019s reputation as a \u201cbully.\u201dThe Syracuse project was a proposed new basketball stadium that would replace the famed Carrier Dome, home of Syracuse University\u2019s basketball team.But Syracuse\u2019s mayor, Stephanie Miner, was not informed of the governor\u2019s plans to move ahead with the stadium project until December, and she was not pleased, The Post-Standard reported. She declined to endorse it. By January 2014, the deal had fallen apart.\u201cIt blew up, and the governor was pretty upset,\u201d Mr. Howe said on Thursday.In an interview on Thursday, Ms. Miner confirmed Mr. Howe\u2019s account of the governor\u2019s displeasure after the stadium deal collapsed. \u201cTodd came to me and apologized and said to me that the governor was angry with him,\u201d Ms. Miner said. \u201cAnd I knew that the governor and his people were extraordinarily angry with me.\u201dWhen the last question was finally asked and Mr. Howe\u2019s testimony ended, the judge, Valerie E. Caproni, addressed the prosecution\u2019s star witness.\u201cMr. Howe, go back to Idaho!\u201d she said. Then she reconsidered his circumstance. \u201cNo!

But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval.However, Fox\u2019s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast\u2019s opportunity.Whom to thank for the Comcast bidCritics\u2019 cornerMarket reactionComcast investors don\u2019t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky\u2019s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast\u2019s offer.When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval.Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit.A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump.\u201cIn gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.\u201d(F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.)Update from the hearingIn this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond.He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: \u201cFiscal policy changes can have an effect.\u201d He also said: \u201cWe really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. \u201cWe don\u2019t do fiscal policy at the Fed,\u201d he said.\u2014 Peter EavisThe details\u2022 \u201cRing has raised $209 million so far and was last valued at $760 million, according to Pitchbook.\u201d\u2022 Amazon\u2019s Alexa Fund, which invests in startups that make Alexa compatible devices, was an investor.\u2022 Amazon plans to have Ring operate as a separate business, much as Zappos and Twitch do.Ms. Bartiromo, then, followed up with:Mr. Schultz is one of a number of business executives and celebrities long speculated to be considering a run for president in 2020.

(Broadcom\u2019s C.E.O., Hock Tan, said the redomiciling would happen even if the deal didn\u2019t go through.)More from Diane Bartz of Reuters:Part of the CFIUS\u2019 current concern, which is echoed in Cornyn\u2019s letter, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.That\u2019s what Larry Hutcher, a corporate lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said of the last-minute turmoil that sank an investor group\u2019s bid for The Weinstein Company and led the embattled studio to plan a corporate bankruptcy filing.Beijing\u2019s takeover of the troubled Anbang Insurance Group is another sign that deal making by that country\u2019s moguls is slowing to a halt. It\u2019s not just the Chinese government\u2019s fears of overspending by homegrown businesses, but also growing skepticism from officials in the United States and elsewhere.\u201cRegulators will naturally be somewhat concerned by the reality that often there is an asymmetry of information about the Chinese firms operating internationally,\u201d said Jeremy Stevens, an economist for Standard Bank Group in Beijing. \u201cThis event further underlines this truth,\u201d he added.The China flyaroundTakeaway: the SEC did indeed informally indicate to Circle that regulators would \u201cnot pursue any enforcement action for prior activity\u201d at Poloniex as long as Circle cleans up Poloniex and turns it into a regulated exchange.The SEC seems to be saying here that it\u2019s okay if you broke the rules, as long as you get acquired by a legitimate player before we crack down on you.The virtual currency flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hoping for $100 Billion to Rebuild, Iraq Got Less Than a Third", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKUWAIT \u2014 At the close of a donor conference on Wednesday, Iraq secured only a fraction of the funds urgently needed to rebuild towns and cities demolished during battles against the Islamic State. But American and regional officials nevertheless praised a last-minute rush of pledged investments, loans and guarantees, mostly by neighboring countries.The conference was hosted by the Kuwaiti government and attended by dozens of foreign ministers and the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Turkey, one of Iraq\u2019s largest trading partners, stepped up with a promise of $5 billion in investment loans in expectation that some of its large-scale construction, transportation and infrastructure companies would jump back into northern Iraq, where they had long dominated the economy.Another surprise came from Kuwait, which has had frosty relations with Iraq, its larger neighbor, since 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded. The Kuwaiti ruler, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, announced $1 billion in investment and $1 billion in loans. Other Arab Gulf countries followed, with the Saudi, Emirati and Qatari foreign ministers announcing investment and loan deals.All told, the conference participants pledged a total of $30 billion in loans and investments, Kuwait officials said, a figure Mr. Guterres described as an \u201cenormous success.\u201dIraq\u2019s foreign minister, Ibrahim al-Jafari, was more measured in his assessment, telling reporters that the amounts offered fell far short of what Iraq had hoped to attract for the rebuilding effort.The total amount Iraqi officials were seeking also varied. In December Iraq estimated it would need $100 billion, but when the conference began on Monday, the figure was lowered to $88 billion. On Wednesday some Iraqi officials were using $100 billion.The last-minute burst was a welcome development, in that Iraq had been struggling to raise even $5 billion in pledges. But the creative math about the promises masks deeper challenges.Iraq is facing around $22 billion in urgent reconstruction needs after three years of bloody and destructive battles to oust Islamic State fighters from the northern third of its territory. That includes Mosul, once a thriving commercial center of 2 million residents where now more than 20,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed.Because the vast majority of the pledges came as investment loans and guarantees, not direct aid, many of the headline-grabbing amounts are contingent on investment deals or contracts coming to fruition.No business deals were signed at the three-day conference in Kuwait. While hundreds of businessmen and women attended receptions on the sidelines of the event, many expressed misgivings about the political and security risks of doing business in Iraq, considered one of the most corrupt countries.Given years of estranged relations between Iraq and its Gulf Arab neighbors, few companies have tried to penetrate the Iraqi economy, and it is unclear what sort of risks they would be willing to assume, even with government loan guarantees.In comparison, the Turks\u2019 surprise pledge of $5 billion in investment loans and guarantees, announced by Foreign Minister Mevlut Mevlut Cavusoglu, promises a more certain outcome.Unlike the Sunni Arab nations, which have largely shunned the Shiite-led governments that have run Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein, Turkey saw an opening.Turkish businesses jumped into Iraq in multiple sectors after the American-led invasion in 2003, from infrastructure to construction, transportation and consumer goods, becoming the largest direct investor in the Iraqi Kurdistan region and one of Baghdad\u2019s largest trading partners.In turn, Iraq, a leading oil exporter, transports a significant amount of crude to world markets through a pipeline over northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s why these stories appeal to adults today \u2014 they were meant for them. What happened, I think, is that they have been adapted for children. Walt Disney totally went in that direction, with all that implies in terms of simplification and sweetening. So we\u2019ve come to think of those stories as too simple, lacking in powerful, authentic emotions.\u201dWhile Mr. Pommerat made \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d accessible, so the younger set could follow it, he did not try to prettify the picture. \u201cThere are scary bits,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to traumatize kids, of course, but I also didn\u2019t want to water down the emotions. I wanted to take the situations at face value: the encounter with animal ferocity, with danger, with fear, with monstrous things \u2014 two people get eaten after all, that\u2019s quite violent! But that violence is symbolic. That\u2019s the virtue of art, of theater: You can experience particular emotions while being protected by the fiction of performance. You come to the theater to see something that\u2019s simultaneously fake and a description of reality.\u201d\u201cThis is the first time Issue Project Room is holding a show for kids,\u201d Ms. Chopra said, \u201cand it was just great to have preparatory conversations there. We maintain the same artistic requirements but we open up to an audience that may not otherwise have gone to Issue Project Room.

A little over a decade ago, Mr. Hughes was brought in to rescue a children\u2019s museum and had to line up donors to help pay off its debt. \u201cThe first people I went to were Joan and Irwin Jacobs,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Jacobs and his wife.Qualcomm, by contrast, prides itself on an inventive corporate culture in which employees who\u2019ve been granted patents are given special business cards with the word \u201cinventor\u201d in the lower right corner.\u201cBroadcom is not rewarding people for going out and making speculative bets,\u201d Mr. Rasgon said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather wait and buy the winner, so these are fundamentally different cultures.\u201dOn a recent morning, as short-sleeved employees had periodic meetings in an outdoor courtyard, the security desk at Qualcomm headquarters was playing a reel of commercials promoting the company\u2019s hidden role behind the smartphone revolution. (\u201cInvention comes first.\u201d \u201cWe make the technology that makes every smartphone awesome.\u201d)That message is reinforced at a winding company museum that starts with exhibits on early technologies like briefcase phones and progresses to flip phones, smartphones, tablets and GoPro cameras. The displays chart how Qualcomm chips have enabled companies from Silicon Valley and elsewhere to cram ever more pictures, videos, songs and tweets into our pockets.Qualcomm\u2019s takeover battle is coming at a sensitive time for the San Diego ego. While the city is one of America\u2019s innovation powerhouses and a hive of start-up activity and venture capital investment, it has had less success in attracting big companies \u2014 or, for that matter, keeping the growing companies it creates.\u201cWe think of ourselves as a very innovative community that does a lot of start-ups and creates the companies of tomorrow,\u201d said Jerry Sanders, mayor of San Diego from 2005 to 2012 and now chief executive of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe have a pretty good idea that once they get a certain size, they may be gone.\u201dQualcomm was the exception. Mr. Jacobs, the original chief executive, moved to San Diego in 1966 to join the faculty of the University of California, San Diego. Two years later, he founded his first company, Linkabit, a consulting firm that did contract research to help clients like NASA solve deep-space telecommunications problems and later started designing and building circuit boards, chips and other components.As Linkabit grew, it attracted engineers from powerhouse institutions like M.I.T. and Stanford to the San Diego area. And as the university grew, Linkabit started finding more of its engineers locally. One built off the other, and suddenly there were the embers of a telecommunications cluster that today drives a little under a quarter of San Diego\u2019s economic output, said Mr. Cunningham of the research institute.And just as Silicon Valley\u2019s ecosystem can be traced to a chain of events that saw employees leave one company to form another, so can Qualcomm\u2019s. Linkabit engineers moved on to seed new companies in the area. Mr. Jacobs departed in 1985 and soon got together with a group of former colleagues to create a company centered on quality communications, or Qualcomm for short.Despite the anxiety here, it helps to remember that industrial development is more alchemy than science. Aside from a few basic ingredients \u2014 an educated populace, a good university and a reputation as a nice place to live \u2014 economists have almost no idea why industries coalesce around some cities instead of others, at least until they have done so.But more than any one big company, economists say, a location\u2019s greatest asset is its ability to maintain whatever dynamics keep new companies forming. And Qualcomm has helped to create a critical mass of engineers and investment that is now baked into the region.\u201cCities are incubators for new ideas, but when the idea gets sufficiently mature, it moves on,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who studies cities. \u201cThe important thing is that San Diego keeps on churning out new success stories and never becomes too dependent on any one company.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted the name of one agency involved in a report estimating the indirect economic effects of Qualcomm employment on San Diego. In addition to the San Diego Workforce Partnership, the study was by the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation.Advertisement"}

By the end of a week I had danced in the streets so much I\u2019d worn holes through the bottoms of each of them, straight through to my socks. That, more than Mardi Gras or Jazz Fest or oak trees or gumbo, is my indelible image of the city: The only place in the world where I\u2019ve had such a good time that the shoes melted right off my feet. My view of the city is in no way a comprehensive one, but it was molded by my tastes (and by the Anne Rice-loving friend from Brooklyn who introduced me to the city). That\u2019s something that the obsessive reporter in me is going to have to come to terms with, as does any traveler to some degree: Try to do everything and you\u2019ll wind up missing the most magical parts of being far from home.\u201cTrue dat!\u201d Mr. Wesley said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been knowing me 35 years. Serious!\u201d Another day, I went to the historically black neighborhood of Trem\u00e9 and came upon Marion Colbert sitting on a bench by her door. Known as Miss Mary, she turns 90 in July and told me that every year the neighborhood throws her a birthday party in the street. \u201cI can\u2019t walk like I did no more. I got diabetes, arthritis and glaucoma, but I\u2019m happy,\u201d she said. \u201cI can still see and talk to people. I don\u2019t need millions.\u201d Every once in a while, she would call out, \u201cYou have a nice day, honey,\u201d to whomever happened to be passing by. \u201cThank you, have a beautiful day,\u201d one woman replied. \u201cOh, it is,\u201d Ms. Colbert replied. The night of Krewe du Vieux, I got to take one of my Lyft drivers, Michael J. Hill, to an after-party at The Pearl, a kitschy underground event space in the Marigny district filled with all manner of odd objects, including a sculpture of a full-size ostrich. Mr. Hill, who \u201cjust made 50,\u201d as he put it, is a traveling barber when he\u2019s not driving share rides, and wanted to pick me up on his tandem bicycle, until it got two flats on the way to the parade. He walked into the party and made quick friends with a woman wearing nothing but a clear shower curtain and a thong, plus other costumed folk, almost all of whom were white. \u201cYou\u2019re learning about New Orleans,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m learning about this for the first time!\u201d Then he had to go home, because the next day was Sunday and he\u2019s a church elder. I won\u2019t be bringing those sneakers, though. I threw them out. An earlier version of this article misspelled a street in New Orleans. It is Frenchmen Street, not Frenchman Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Was a Pioneer in Outsourcing Services. Now, the Model Is \u2018Broken.\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWIDNES, England \u2014 The residents of the Millbrow Care Home were already frail with old age and illness when they started losing weight at alarming speed.The reason: They were being neglected, an investigation revealed. For over a year, they had been deprived of food and drink for hours on end. They were not being given the medication they had been prescribed. There were outbreaks of vomiting and diarrhea, and outdated food in the kitchen. No one was in charge of preventing the spread of infections, and managers rarely made an appearance.Under Labour and Tory governments alike, Britain has been a pioneer in outsourcing public services to private contractors, seeing it as a way to reduce public expenditures, create more jobs in the private sector and, presumably, deliver services more efficiently.For years, outsourcing seemed to accomplish those goals by and large, making Britain the second-largest market for outsourcing in the world, after the United States.But recently, relying on private contractors to deliver public services has come under fire, not only from the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, but from parts of the British government itself.Nearly a decade of austerity budgets and declining funding for local governments, which pay for many outsourced services, has badly strained the system.Nowhere are the problems more glaring than in the care of the elderly and those with disabilities. A third of Britain\u2019s 5,500 care providers are at risk of failure, Mr. Hood said, a rate well above other sectors of the economy.Governments have become good enough at driving down the prices of contracts, he added, that companies struggle to make a profit. Carillion collapsed in part because it had underbid for contracts that became unsustainable when it ran into delays and cost overruns.That pattern seems to have played out at Millbrow, which has been taken over by the local council while the company restructures.Clients in the British system fall into two broad categories: those who are self-financed, and those whose care is paid by the local council. But providers and health care experts said that local governments typically fund little more than half the actual cost, forcing providers to charge higher rates to self-funded residents.Four Seasons, the provider, says it had trouble recruiting and retaining staff, forcing it to rely on temporary workers. \u201cThe home had not been financially sustainable and had been making a loss for some time,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cSo we were effectively paying to provide care.\u201dAs conditions deteriorated, both care givers and the relatives of residents said in interviews, a revolving door of managers led to frequent breakdowns in communication, to the point that no one was aware the home was nearing collapse.Staffing levels on a floor caring for residents with dementia were \u201chorrendous,\u201d said Lisa Riley, a 39-year-old care giver. At one point, she said, there were only four employees to look after 35 people. This meant some could not be supervised around the clock and would wander, sometimes tripping and falling. \u201cWe tried, that\u2019s all we can say,\u201d she said.Public inspectors found residents at risk of choking because they were not made to sit upright when they ate. Staff members were seen handling soiled laundry without wearing gloves, the inspectors added in the government report, and cushions and other material were \u201cheavily contaminated, and had a strong malodor.\u201dIn the last year, at least 13 nursing homes run by Four Seasons have either closed or, like Millbrow, been taken over by local councils.One home in South Hampshire that closed had to transfer its elderly residents. Within a month, five had died, according to a former employee.\u201cSome of these people should not be moved because they\u2019re not going to last,\u201d said the employee, Lynne Wells. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t. A lot of these people are in their 90s. It\u2019s just so sad really.\u201dSaddled with $700 million in debt, Four Seasons is in restructuring talks with an American hedge fund, H/2 Capital Partners, which holds most of the debt. Adult care experts worry about the ramifications if a major company like Four Seasons, which cares for about 17,000 elderly people, should collapse like Carillion.According to experts, care homes in Britain do not make close to the 15 percent returns that private-equity companies typically look for.The \u201cpernicious pincer movement on profits,\u201d said Mr. Hood, the insolvency specialist, has prompted some providers to end contracts with local governments or refuse services to publicly funded residents \u201cbecause it\u2019s cheaper to leave the beds empty.\u201dEventually, said Mr. Hood, \u201cthe government will have to take the care home market in some form of public partnership. It will have to.\u201dAt Millbrow, local officials say they are able to provide better care than Four Seasons had, even on the same budget, because they do not have to squeeze out a profit and be accountable to shareholders.On a recent visit, electricians were seen installing wiring for a new fire alarm system. Schedules for \u201cinfection control training\u201d and \u201cmoving and handling refreshers\u201d were posted on a whiteboard nearby. Staff were being trained how to deal with patients with dementia. In the back garden, builders were looking at fixing what had been open sewers.\u201cEverything revolves around money,\u201d said Ms. Riley, the care giver, as she gave a resident her noon meal. \u201cBut at the end of the day it\u2019s about vulnerable people. We need to take care of them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of debt held by Four Seasons. It is $700 million, not $700 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Netanyahu\u2019s Israel, the Divisiveness Is Now All About Him", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews Analysis\u201cImagine if, in the next few weeks, there is a justified case for Israel to go to war,\u201d said Shlomo Avineri, a professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cHalf of this country would think Netanyahu\u2019s position was impacted by his legal situation. That is unacceptable. Political decisions are sometimes existential in Israel. If we had to go to war, the decision would be contaminated for a lot of people.\u201dThe next several months, as the nation awaits Mr. Mandelblit\u2019s decision on an indictment, are likely to be raucous, with zero-sum politics taken to a new level. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s foes will portray him as a felon-in-all-but-fact, while his allies paint him as the persecuted victim of a left-wing conspiracy that extends all the way up to the commissioner of police.But it has been all politics, all the time, in Israel for years.Israel has always been a noisily contentious land of debates with the volume on 11. Beyond the left-right divide lies an unruly and acrimonious diversity, with fault lines between secular Jews and religious Jews, ultra-Orthodox Jews who will serve in the military and those who will not, Arabs and Jews, settlers and everyone else. Its parliamentary system, designed to give a voice to minorities, ends up playing a part, giving disproportionate power to small parties.But Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s style has done much to influence the tone and rules for political warfare since he first became prime minister in 1996. He has championed a populism not seen since Menachem Begin was prime minister in the early 1980s, and he has perfected it, critics say, by invoking external enemies and identifying a parade of internal scapegoats to stoke fear.\u201cHe thrives on dividing people \u2014 exactly like Trump,\u201d Mr. Avineri said.The result has increasingly been to turn adversaries into enemies.For many Israelis, the ugliness hit a new low last year when, at an emotional Knesset committee hearing on the 2014 Gaza war, two members of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party got into a shouting match with two bereaved parents, calling one of them a \u201cliar.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu, who attended the hearing, sat silently. Only afterward did his office rebuke the lawmakers.In fairness to Mr. Netanyahu, Israel faces very real external enemies. While its strategic situation has improved dramatically since its more vulnerable early days, Mr. Netanyahu has also been steering the country through a turbulent period in the Middle East, with Iranian-backed proxies approaching Israel\u2019s borders, neighboring Syria disintegrating into chaos, and the beleaguered Gaza Strip unraveling under Israel\u2019s own pressure and Hamas\u2019s control.\u201cEveryone thought their son or grandson wouldn\u2019t have to go in the army,\u201d said Moshe Arens, a former Likud defense and foreign minister. \u201cNow it seems like my great-grandson or daughter will have to go in the army. This is the reason why so many people are supportive of Netanyahu,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think he\u2019s doing a good job on security, which most people in Israel worry about. Everything else is secondary.\u201dThe red-meat, anything-goes language of Israeli politics today also springs from changes in its electoral system that took time to reveal their more damaging effects. The advent of party primaries in the 1990s, meant to replace smoke-filled rooms with a more open and democratic way of choosing leaders, created incentives for lawmakers to play to their core audiences rather than seek common ground \u2014 a phenomenon with which Americans are well acquainted.Yet Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Israel also lacks the sense of a unifying national mission that characterized the country\u2019s first 50 years, when it was building itself up from the sand, absorbing waves of diaspora immigrants and defending itself in a series of existential wars, days when its prime ministers wore frumpy clothes and lived modestly, as if they wouldn\u2019t know a payoff if it landed in their palms.Even his detractors credit Mr. Netanyahu with presiding over the beefing up of Israel\u2019s now-muscular economy, avoiding risky military adventures, and putting his warnings against a potentially nuclear Iran on the international agenda. But he has managed to take peacemaking with the Palestinians off his own agenda, with the help of a weak and internally divided Palestinian leadership.To younger voters on the Israeli left, eager for a turn at power for the first time since 2001, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s demurrals have left peacemaking the most urgent unfinished business of the Zionist project.\u201cOur generation still has an important mission, and that\u2019s that Israeli society and democracy can have a real future,\u201d said Stav Shaffir of the Labor Party, who in 2013, at age 27, became the youngest woman elected to the Knesset. \u201cOur democracy depends on our security, on a Jewish majority, so we need a separation from the Palestinians and a two-state solution.\u201dMs. Shaffir said that while the Israeli right wing included \u201cradical extremist voices, with a very strong lobby in the government, who want annexation\u201d of West Bank territory, by and large, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition seemed unable to articulate an overriding vision.\u201cI think their only mission today is to stay in government,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want the power but that\u2019s about it.\u201dIdeologically, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government has been pulling further to the right like a lopsided team of horses. The moderates are mostly gone from Likud. Mr. Netanyahu, a savvy politician and a pragmatist, is usually the one to put the brakes on the rightward acceleration, such as staving off demands to annex parts of the West Bank. Yet the perennial competition for votes with the far-right Jewish Home party prevents him from resisting with greater gusto.At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu seems mindful of the need to appeal to the large centrist constituency that is now gaining at the right\u2019s expense.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Israel has seen less partisan moments, like the social protests of 2011 that cut across party lines and were a fleeting reminder of what it could mean for the country to come together in peacetime. Tel Aviv liberals and the ultra-Orthodox stood shoulder to shoulder, demanding answers for the soaring cost of living.But its energy quickly dissipated. Protest leaders like Ms. Shaffir entered politics; a centrist politician, Yair Lapid, effectively adopted the movement\u2019s agenda. Ordinary people went back to their corners, screaming on Twitter, but mostly to the like-minded.Now, Mr. Netanyahu has at least unified Israelis around a topic. For the next few months, they can argue about what should become of him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Latin America\u2019s Female Leadership Void", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 After President Michelle Bachelet of Chile leaves office in March, Latin America will have no female presidents.There was a time in 2014 when the region had four: Laura Chinchilla in Costa Rica, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in Argentina, Dilma Rousseff in Brazil and Ms. Bachelet. Now, Latin America is left with few prospects for female presidents in the near future.More than most regions, Latin America has used affirmative-action laws to close the gender gap in political leadership. But to hold these gains, and to help ensure that women continue to rise to top political positions, Latin America needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up.Quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics, but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead a country.Women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas. Argentina passed the world\u2019s first quota law for female candidates for Congress in 1991, requiring political parties to nominate women for at least 30 percent of the open positions. It was recently updated so that half of parties\u2019 congressional slates must be women. Today, all but two Latin American countries have a quota or parity law for legislative candidates.Women hold more than 35 percent of legislative seats in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Nicaragua. Bolivia has a majority-female legislature. In the United States, by comparison, women make up just 19 percent of the House of Representatives and 22 percent of the Senate.Many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates. Many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders.But while affirmative-action laws help women get ahead, they do not save them from political crises.Ms. Bachelet, Mrs. Kirchner, Ms. Rousseff and Ms. Chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president, in a region already accustomed to female leaders. The three presidents on the left \u2014 Ms. Bachelet, Mrs. Kirchner and Ms. Rousseff \u2014 also benefited from the \u201cpink tide,\u201d a wave of leftist leadership that swept Latin America from 1998 to 2016.In this period, the region was buoyed by a commodities boom. Flush with resources, countries expanded social protections for workers, the poor, indigenous peoples, L.G.B.T. people and women.Then the party ended: Economies declined and security concerns increased. Citizens became disillusioned, and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart. Voters decided to throw most incumbents out, men and women alike.But the women fell harder than the men, making clear that there is still a double standard for male and female leaders.More women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment. The glass ceiling remains.But ending the sexism and hostility that drives women from power requires changing cultural attitudes and ending impunity toward violence against women.Costa Rica has tackled traditional notions about who should lead by applying quotas to the civil-society sector. By law, nonprofit organizations must have gender parity in their top leadership positions. This includes charitable, humanitarian and social-service organizations, bringing men into positions from which they\u2019ve historically been absent.After all, if more women take power in politics and business, men will need something else to do.Jennifer M. Piscopo (@Jennpiscopo) is an assistant professor of politics at Occidental College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S.-China Trade Deficit Hits Record, Fueling Trade Fight", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States trade deficit with China climbed to its highest level on record in 2017, a trend that could prompt the Trump administration toward tougher trade actions in the coming months.The overall United States trade deficit in goods and services with the world widened 12.1 percent to $566 billion last year, the largest gap since 2008.Economists said the growing trade deficit stemmed largely from the strength of the United States economy, which helped American consumers afford more imported electronics, clothes and appliances. The declining value of the dollar last year, which makes American products cheaper to buy overseas, also helped to lift exports, but not enough to prevent the gap from widening.The Trump administration has long promised to eliminate the trade gap, citing it as evidence of the decline of American manufacturing and a troubling reliance on foreign goods.\u201cStrenuous effort is underway, but it is not practical to set an exact deadline,\u201d Mr. Ross said of closing the trade gap.The trade deficit figures could strengthen the resolve of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade advisers, including Mr. Navarro and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who want the United States to take a more aggressive stance on trade and are urging tougher action on trading partners that export more to the United States than they import, like China, Mexico and South Korea.Some left-leaning groups that support the president\u2019s promises to end offshoring embraced the view that the administration\u2019s trade policies simply haven\u2019t gone far enough.\u201cThe same trade policy that Trump attacks ferociously and promised to speedily replace is still in place,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that the deficit is up because in year one there has been a wide gulf between Trump\u2019s fiery trade rhetoric and action.\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent promises to reduce the trade deficit, many economists believe that his trade policies will be largely powerless to reverse the trend. That\u2019s because the overall trade deficit is governed by macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. So while changes in trade policy can shift imports and exports from one country to another, for example, reducing the American trade deficit with China while increasing its trade deficit with Thailand, they are unlikely to reduce the American trade deficit overall.Bryan Riley, director of the Free Trade Initiative at the National Taxpayers Union, said that an increase in the trade deficit from the prior year \u201cshould not be viewed as a problem to be fixed, but as a predictable result of a growing economy that enables people to afford more imports.\u201dEswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, cautioned against Mr. Trump\u2019s interpretation of the bilateral trade deficit as a scorecard for an economic relationship.Mr. Prasad said that some persistent deficits, like the one that the United States runs with many countries including China, could be a sign of structural imbalances, like China\u2019s historic tendency to undervalue its currency. But bilateral trade balances can increase for many reasons, both bad and good \u2014 for example, if wealthier American consumers want to buy more stuff \u2014 making it a problematic metric for measuring fair trade.\u201cThe problem is that even if China were to provide greater access to its markets today, if the U.S. economy were to do well, and China were to slow down, the deficit might actually increase,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cIt would certainly be problematic to view the size of that deficit as an indicator of whether trade is fair.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Context Matters. The Stock Market Drop Is Less Scary Than It Seems. ", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt can be easy to be misled by big point swings after a long period of quiet in global markets.If measured by news headlines, you might assume these are dire times in the financial markets.There is an important idea to keep in mind at a time like this: Take the long view.This market decline so far has returned the market roughly to its level in mid-December, less than two months ago. The 7.8 percent drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 over the last six trading days is similar in scale and speed to drops in January 2016 and August 2015, neither of which left lasting scars, and is short of the 10 percent drop that would qualify as a market correction.But some common cognitive errors are making this sell-off seem more dramatic than it is. And the reasons behind it may be more benign than it seems at first glance.Media coverage frequently emphasizes moves in the Dow Jones industrial average. But you probably developed your intuition for how to interpret those numbers at a time when the index was much lower.The Dow fell by 1,175 points Monday, which represents a quite large 4.6 percent decline. But while it was the biggest single-day point decline, there were steeper percentage declines on several occasions during the global financial crisis and its aftermath, not to mention the 508- point drop in the Dow in 1987 that represented a 22.6 percent market crash.At a minimum, update your mental calculus of what constitutes a \u201cbig\u201d market swing. Even better, focus on percent changes rather than point swings in an arbitrarily constructed index.The S.&P. 500 did not decline by more than 2 percent on a single trading day in all of 2017, which helps explain why Friday\u2019s 2.1 percent drop seemed so startling. (The percentage drop on Monday was a much rarer event, one that last occurred in 2011.)But 2017 was weird. There were five such days in 2016, six in 2015 and four in 2014. In 2011, there were 21 trading days in which the S.&P. fell by more than 2 percent, nearly two per month. A bit of overreaction is as natural as people in normally dry Los Angeles having trouble driving in the rain.There\u2019s no doubt that the 7.8 percent drop since Jan. 26 is substantial; it represents nearly $2 trillion of paper wealth. But you find some better news underneath that unpleasant fact when you look at what has happened in the bond market while stocks have been falling.Frequently when investors become more pessimistic about the economy, stocks fall and the yield on bonds falls as well. That pattern happens because a weaker economy implies not just lower corporate profits (hence the falling stock indexes) but lower inflation and continued low interest rates from the Federal Reserve (which implies bonds are more valuable and their yield should fall).But that hasn\u2019t been the pattern in this downturn. During the stock market swoon on Friday, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds rose sharply. Bond market measures of future inflation rose. Even after that trend reversed during the Monday sell-off, interest rates are still higher after this drop in markets (2.7 percent at Monday\u2019s close) than they were before (2.66 percent on Jan. 26).Instead of reflecting economic pessimism, this stock market sell-off seems rooted in a form of optimism \u2014 that employers will have to pay higher wages, cutting into profits, and that higher inflation will cause the Fed to raise rates faster than had been assumed. Throw in some worry that markets were getting a little overheated and you have a recipe for the downturn we\u2019ve just witnessed.In other words, this bad news for stock investors seems to be driven in part by good news for workers. And since most people earn more money from their jobs than from their investment portfolios, that\u2019s a trade a lot of people would be happy to take.This downward swing in markets may be the kind of occasional stumble that every bull market experiences, or could be the beginning of the end of a market rally that has been going on for an awful long time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inflation and Stocks Are Both Up, and That\u2019s Stirring Some Worries", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseTwo weeks ago, fears of higher-than-expected inflation and interest rates sent stocks into a historic and nerve-rattling plunge. This week, those fears were borne out: Consumer prices rose more than expected in January, and interest rates jumped.The stock market rallied.It\u2019s long been a truism that higher inflation and its close cousin, higher interest rates, are deadly for stock prices. But in the wake of this month\u2019s correction, and the ensuing recovery in stock prices, some market experts are saying that stocks can continue to rally even if interest rates and inflation rise, as they did Wednesday.The bulls are backed by data showing that, during the six periods of rising 10-year Treasury rates since 1988, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has gained an average of 23 percent. Stocks declined in only one of those periods, and then only modestly.\u201cFor the past 20 years, we\u2019ve had a period of strong correlation between stocks and interest rates,\u201d said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist for Nuveen, a TIAA subsidiary.But \u201cthat wasn\u2019t the case for the 30 years before that,\u201d he added. And looking only at the start and end points of periods of rising rates masks considerable volatility in between, not to mention what lies just outside those periods. As rates were rising from 1998 into 2000, for instance, stocks were in one of the biggest bull markets ever, only to plunge after the technology bubble burst.Nearly all mainstream economists agree that at some point, higher interest rates and inflation hurt stock prices. \u201cInvestors are right to be concerned,\u201d said Alan Blinder, professor of economics at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.Nuveen\u2019s Mr. Nick said it\u2019s important for investors to look beyond the headlines about rising interest rates to ask why they\u2019re going up. Rising rates can be a sign of a healthy, growing economy, and if the Fed can keep it from overheating, it may well be good for stocks. But if the Fed is forced to raise rates to ward off inflation, the risks of a recession \u2014 and lower earnings and stock prices \u2014 are much greater.Mr. Nick said the current situation \u201clooks like a little bit of both,\u201d which leaves him cautiously optimistic, but in no rush to add to stock positions. He hasn\u2019t made any changes to Nuveen\u2019s model portfolio allocations.\u201cUnlike the last few corrections, we don\u2019t see this as a V-shape recovery, where investors might blink and miss it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think stocks can rise by the end of the year, but it will be a slower grind back.\u201dEven after the recent pullback, he expects more declines. \u201cWhen interest rates rise back to normal levels, share prices are also likely to revert to previous norms,\u201d Mr. Feldstein told me this week.That could be a long decline. Even after the recent 10 percent correction, stocks remain richly valued by historical norms. James Stack, a market historian and president of InvesTech Research, pointed out that a common valuation measure \u2014 the price-to-earnings multiple for the S.&P. 500 \u2014 recently went from 26 times earnings to 23.4 after the correction, which is a level reached less than 10 percent of the time since 1928. (The long-term average price-to-earnings ratio for the stock market, excluding extreme periods, is about 14.) \u201cThis is a very richly priced market no matter how you slice it,\u201d he said.Mr. Stack recently lowered the stock portion of his model portfolio to 72 percent from 82 percent out of concern over high valuations and rising rates. He noted that during 11 periods since 1955 when the Federal Reserve was tightening credit, a so-called soft landing was achieved only twice \u2014 in the mid-1960s and mid-1990s \u2014 and that a recession followed in every other instance.\u201cOnce the Fed starts a tightening cycle, it is very difficult to avoid a recession before it is over,\u201d he said. He hasn\u2019t increased the allocation since the sell-off.Mr. Blinder told me that stock valuations reached such extreme levels that he started reducing his equity holdings several months ago. \u201cI sold too early,\u201d he said with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cI missed the last 15 percent gain, and I missed the 7 percent drop.\u201d He hasn\u2019t resumed buying at current levels.The Fed is now two full years into its current cycle of rate increases, which is already longer than most tightening periods. But the benchmark interest rate for 10-year Treasuries, which has recently risen to just over 2.9 percent, still has a long way to go before reaching its long-term average of 6.24 percent. The Fed has forecast three more quarter-point rate increases this year, but that would bring the Federal funds rate only to 2.25 percent.\u201cHistorically it\u2019s impossible to name any threshold at which rising rates might trigger a rush for the exit or a bear market,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cIn most cases, stock prices can weather rising interest rates until they reach 5 to 6 percent, which was the case in 2000 and 2007.\u201dBut after years of such low interest rates, and with stock valuations extremely high, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re dealing with what might be the most interest rate-sensitive stock market in our lifetime.\u201dIf this is, indeed, the last stage of the long-running bull market, and interest rates continue to rise, as the Fed has suggested, some sectors typically perform better than others. According to InvesTech, the best performing sectors during periods of rising rates since 1972 have been health care, energy, consumer staples and telecommunications. During the last year of a bull market, the best performing sectors have been energy, health care and technology. Health care and energy show up in both categories.Of course no one knows for sure when the bull market will end \u2014 or whether it already has. But investors are clearly on edge, and the last few weeks may be a preview of what the end looks like.\u201cThere are a lot of very bright people on Wall Street who are all counting on being the first out the door when the party ends,\u201d Mr. Stack said. The recent plunge, added, \u201cshowed just how small that door may get.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Malaysia\u2019s Leader Stirs Up a Tempest in a Quinoa Bowl", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo when Prime Minister Najib Razak said this past week that he preferred quinoa because it was \u201cbetter than rice,\u201d he stirred up a tempest in a lunch bowl.Though he has been blamed for a higher cost of living since a goods and services tax began in 2015, Mr. Najib is widely expected to win a third term, thanks to a divided opposition, an upbeat economy, rural support and the redrawing of electoral boundaries that critics say favors the government.But now the prime minister has been labeled out of touch with ordinary Malaysians because of his quinoa remarks, made while he was visiting a hospital on Thursday.Opponents pounced and other Malaysians took to social media to fret and fume when Mr. Najib was caught saying: \u201cI don\u2019t eat rice. I eat quinoa. My son introduced me to it.\u201d\u201cI only eat local rice,\u201d Mr. Mahathir tweeted.Another opposition leader, Lim Kit Siang, said he had never even heard of quinoa.\u201cI had to ask around whether anyone knew anything about quinoa,\u201d he said, according to the news agency Malaysiakini.He noted that quinoa \u201cis about 23 times more expensive than rice, eaten by 30 million Malaysians.\u201dMr. Lim added, according to Reuters, \u201cThe 14th general election will be quinoa vs. rice; clean government vs. kleptocracy; and Najib vs. people of Malaysia.\u201dRice \u2014 the second-most important crop in the world after wheat \u2014 was subsidized by the government until 2015.After social media users took exception to the quinoa remarks, Mr. Najib\u2019s office said on Friday that \u201ccertain quarters\u201d had manipulated his comments. Quinoa, his office said, was part of Mr. Najib\u2019s healthful diet and had been recommended by a doctor.\u201cI like to eat,\u201d he said. \u201cMy problem is I love food \u2014 like most Malaysians.\u201d\u201cIt is better than rice,\u201d he declared.Mr. Najib said he was thinking about whether quinoa could be cultivated in Malaysia. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find out whether we can grow quinoa or its equivalent in Malaysia.\u201dMr. Najib also said that Malaysians had to live within their means if they wanted to improve their lives. \u201cIf you live within your means,\u201d he said, \u201cGod willing, you will be all right.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first time Mr. Najib has caused outrage with his culinary comments. He was jeered in 2014 after responding to complaints about the rising cost of living by pointing out that prices had fallen for some popular foods, like water spinach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leading Private Equity Firm Accused of Misusing Funds", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow some of those investors are claiming that the Abraaj Group and its founder, Arif Naqvi, misused funds, according to people who are familiar with the allegations but not authorized to speak publicly.The investors \u2014 including the World Bank and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 want to know why more than $200 million that they and others had provided was not spent. They fear that Abraaj may have used the money for its own purposes, according to the people briefed on the issue.Not all of the 24 investors in the fund have complained, people close to Abraaj said.In discussions with their investors, Abraaj and Mr. Naqvi have said that they did not misuse the money and that there was a misunderstanding about how the fund operates. They said delays in getting approval from regulators to build hospitals in Nigeria and Pakistan prevented Abraaj from deploying funds more rapidly.In the past, governments and foundations led the way, via direct loans and grants. But over the past year, Mr. Kim and Mr. Gates have argued that it is possible for large pools of capital \u2014 such as private equity funds, insurance companies and pension funds \u2014 to score big profits by, for example, investing in hospitals in Pakistan and Nigeria. Mr. Kim recently has singled out Abraaj and Mr. Naqvi for praise.Abraaj, which manages $13.6 billion, is the largest private equity firm dedicated to developing economies. Mr. Naqvi\u2019s fund-raising mantra is: If you want to do good and reap rich, private-equity style returns, invest in Abraaj funds.More than any of Abraaj\u2019s other offerings, the $1 billion health care fund embodies this ideal. Starting in late 2016, it drew down $545 million from investors to buy hospitals in Nigeria, Pakistan and India. The goal is to improve productivity at the hospitals, allowing them to see more patients \u2014 and make more money.At a meeting in London in September, the investors saw financial statements indicating that over $200 million in cash was sitting with the fund. They didn\u2019t know why the money had not been invested, and they asked the fund\u2019s manager, Khawar Mann, and Mr. Naqvi to see bank statements showing how the money was deployed. They claimed that Abraaj was required to return the money to investors in 60 days if it was not used during that time.Mr. Naqvi told the angry investors that he saw the company as a vehicle to buy hospitals around the world, and that was why the fund needed the cash on hand. He also cited the regulatory delays. But the investors were not convinced, and he sent more than $100 million back to investors in December.The investors asked that an auditor with no ties to Abraaj be hired to figure out what had happened. Separately, Abraaj hired KPMG to perform its own audit.Since September, the investors \u2014 which include Proparco, a French development institution, and the CDC Group, a similar body in Britain \u2014 have been requesting forensic proof that Abraaj did not use the money to fund its own operations.The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an arm of the United States government that provides incentives for American firms to invest in developing markets, is exposed to Abraaj via a $150 million loan to the group.Abraaj and its investors are restricted from publicly discussing matters related to the fund because of nondisclosure agreements signed by all parties.The World Bank has invested $300 million with Abraaj over the years, including $100 million in the health care fund. The investments were made through the World Bank\u2019s private-sector investing arm, the International Finance Corporation.The Gates Foundation has invested $100 million in the fund.When the allegations surfaced, the unit within the World Bank that looks into cases of corruption began an investigation, according to an email exchange between one of its investigators and an outside party that was reviewed by The New York Times. That review closed without finding evidence of wrongdoing, according a person briefed on the review.Mr. Kim, in his campaign to persuade the private sector to invest more in these types of markets, has often cited Mr. Naqvi and Abraaj as a model.Just as Abraaj\u2019s fight with investors was heating up in November, Mr. Kim held a video conference with prominent investors from the Middle East at World Bank headquarters. Mr. Naqvi tuned in from Dubai, and as Mr. Kim made his case that the private sector should step up, he repeatedly praised the Abraaj founder.\u201cArif has been saying this in so many settings \u2014 we are on the same side, screaming this stuff,\u201d Mr. Kim said.Mr. Naqvi responded in kind.\u201cJim, I applaud your leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been partners with the I.F.C. for 10 years, and we are proud that we are one of your larger relationships around the world.\u201dEven before this controversy, Abraaj\u2019s health care fund was struggling.The fund has invested about half of the $1 billion it raised from investors. Its largest bet was a $145 million purchase of CARE, a network of private hospitals in Hyderabad, India, and the investment has not met Abraaj\u2019s expectations, according to letters the firm sent to investors last year.The hospital has been struggling to adapt to an onslaught of regulations from the government. When Abraaj bought the company, it was earning $14 million a year, according to the letters. Now it earns $8 million before taxes and other items. Abraaj has not marked down its value to reflect the lower profits.The weak performance of the CARE deal has prompted pointed questions on Abraaj\u2019s quarterly conference calls with investors, according to people who have been briefed on the calls.A Pakistan native, Mr. Naqvi founded Abraaj in 2002, after striking it rich in a private equity deal involving a marketing company in the Middle East. With those profits, he went from being a small regional investor to one of the larger investors in the developing world. He has hired experts in Turkey, in Africa and throughout the Middle East and told them to hunt for deals.The firm grew rapidly, employing hundreds of people around the world, thanks largely to Mr. Naqvi\u2019s relentless salesmanship. He became a fixture at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and has said he spends 250 days a year on the road pitching pension funds, development institutions and others on his vision of buying companies that benefit society in the world\u2019s poorest countries.In his most ambitious fund-raising effort yet, he is currently trying to start a $6 billion Abraaj fund focusing on society-improving investments in 30 developing countries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corporate America Is Suppressing Wages for Many Workers", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsEven after eight years of economic recovery and steady private-sector job growth, wages for most Americans have hardly budged. It is tempting to think that wage stagnation is intractable, a result of long-term trends, like automation and globalization, that government is powerless to do anything about.In fact, a growing body of evidence pins much of the blame on a specific culprit, one for which proven legal weapons already exist. But they are not being used.The culprit is \u201cmonopsony power.\u201d This term is used by economists to refer to the ability of an employer to suppress wages below the efficient or perfectly competitive level of compensation. In the more familiar case of monopoly, a large seller \u2014 like a cable company \u2014 is able to demand high prices for poor service because consumers have no other choice. It turns out that many corporations possess bargaining power over their workers, not just over their consumers. Their workers accept low wages and substandard working conditions because few alternative job opportunities exist for them or because switching jobs is costly. In other words, in the labor market, effectively a small number of employers are competing for their labor.The studies show that common features of the labor market give enormous bargaining advantages to employers. Because most people sink roots in their communities, they are reluctant to quit their job and move to a job that is far away. Because workplaces differ in terms of their location and conditions, people have trouble comparing them, which means that one cannot easily \u201ccomparison shop\u201d for jobs. And thanks to a wave of consolidation, industries are increasingly dominated by a small number of huge companies, which means that workers have fewer choices among employers in their area.When employers exercise monopsonistic power, wages are suppressed, jobs are left unfilled, and economic growth suffers. Unions used to offset employer monopsony power, but unions now represent only 7 percent of private sector workers, down from a peak of 35 percent in the 1950s. Combating the practices that employers use to monopsonize the labor market can lead to higher wages, more jobs and faster economic growth.While the movement against no-poaching agreements is a good first step, much more can be done to counter monopsonistic practices. First, the Justice Department and the courts need to make clear that no-poaching agreements are illegal even when they take place within franchises. Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker are preparing to propose such a bill next week.Second, Congress should bar employers from subjecting low-income workers to noncompete clauses. These clauses serve no lawful business purpose when workers do not receive substantial training, while they cause significant hardship. A few states ban or significantly restrict noncompetes, but the federal government must step in.Antitrust reform to address labor market abuses is one of those rare issues that could secure bipartisan agreement. Democrats should support reform because it would help workers and lower-income families. Antitrust violations are also counter to the free-market ideals that Republicans claim to hold.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s review the week\u2019s tech news.All this got me wondering: What\u2019s the point of cable TV anymore?For a time, cutting the cord was one of those hipster affectations that came with sacrifices. A kind of asceticism was implied in the name. The cord, the familiar cable bundle of yore, required paying a whole lot for a bunch of bad TV you\u2019d never watch, just so you could have very convenient access to the handful of shows you sometimes did watch.Then along came DVDs and the internet, and now you could unbundle \u2014 you\u2019d pay a lot less for just the things you really wanted to see, provided you were O.K. hazarding some minor inconveniences.But as Netflix keeps driving trucks of money to TV\u2019s top producers \u2014 it plans to spend $8 billion on new content this year \u2014 the script has flipped. More and more, it\u2019s the people who haven\u2019t cut the cord who are missing out. Today, if you subscribe just to regular TV and don\u2019t bother with Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other online services, you\u2019re missing some of TV\u2019s biggest and most acclaimed shows. Plus, you\u2019re paying more.Cable subscriptions have been declining for years, and last year the decline accelerated. But the YouTube expansion shows that cutting the cord keeps getting easier, and the Netflix deal shows how non-cable services keep getting more attractive. This suggests an even faster pace of decline for cable. The bottom is going to fall out of the market, probably very soon.Chrome, Google\u2019s popular web browser, can now block ads. This seems weird because Google is the internet\u2019s largest advertising company. So how does an advertising company design ad-blocking software? Very, very carefully, it turns out, in a process rife with conflicts.So Google\u2019s new ad blocker is designed to block some ads, not all of them. The software will eliminate a dozen types of ads that the company deems intrusive or disruptive. But most ads, including most from Google, would skate through just fine.It\u2019s an interesting fight, but it may also be an irrelevant one. What\u2019s unclear is whether Google\u2019s limited ad blocker will stem the rising popularity of more restrictive ad blockers. For many people who hate online ads, it could already be too late for half measures.The New York Times\u2019s tech reporting team is gathering in San Francisco this week for a team-building offsite. I\u2019m looking forward to forgetting to catch Mike Isaac in a trust fall. We\u2019ll also be talking about some of the major themes we\u2019re aiming to cover in the tech world this year \u2014 artificial intelligence, crypto and the responsibility of tech companies, for example.But enough about us.

{"Headline": "President Xi\u2019s Strongman Rule Raises New Fears of Hostility and Repression", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s efforts to indefinitely extend his rule as China\u2019s leader, announced on Sunday, raised fresh fears in China of a resurgence of strongman politics \u2014 and fears abroad of a new era of hostility and gridlock.Mr. Xi, who has been president since 2013, has tried to cultivate an image as a benevolent father figure who is working to promote China\u2019s peaceful rise.Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing who is critical of Mr. Xi, said the change to the Constitution would turn Mr. Xi into a \u201csuper-president.\u201d\u201cHe will have no limits on his power,\u201d he said.Government censors rushed to block criticism of the decision. Internet memes depicted Mr. Xi as an emperor with no regard for the rule of law and showed a portrait of Mr. Xi replacing Mao\u2019s hallowed image in Tiananmen Square. Another repurposed an ad for Durex condoms, adding a tag line \u2014 \u201cTwice is not enough\u201d \u2014 to poke fun at the idea of Mr. Xi angling for a third term.The party\u2019s move comes as Mr. Xi has proclaimed an era of China\u2019s greatness, when the country, he says, will take what he sees as its rightful place as a top global power. Already, it is establishing military bases in the Western Pacific and Africa, building infrastructure across Asia, parts of Europe and Africa, and running what Mr. Xi hopes will be the world\u2019s No. 1 economy within two decades or sooner.\u201cChina feels it is on the road to great power status and they want to perpetuate the trajectory they are on,\u201d said David Finkelstein, director of China Studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va.Some analysts outside China said they worried that allowing Mr. Xi one-man rule might worsen an increasingly tense relationship between the United States and China.After years of efforts by the United States to engage China on issues from market reform to climate change to human rights, the Trump administration turned on Beijing last December and called China a strategic competitor in its first national security document.Washington policy makers are preparing plans to impose tariffs on some Chinese imports, limit Chinese investments in the United States, particularly in technology, and spend more on the United States military to sustain its big advantage over the People\u2019s Liberation Army.In congressional testimony earlier this month, the director of the F.B.I., Christopher Wray, described China as \u201cnot just a whole of government threat but a whole of society threat.\u201dMr. Trump may well see Mr. Xi\u2019s consolidation of power as part of a global trend toward increasingly influential leaders, in which he might include himself along with Mr. Xi and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian leader, said James Mann, the author of \u201cThe China Fantasy,\u201d which contradicted the popular view that increasing prosperity would lead to political liberalization in China.\u201cI\u2019m guessing he will not deplore the lack of democracy in China, because that\u2019s the sort of thing he rarely if ever does,\u201d Mr. Mann said of Mr. Trump.Mr. Mann also said Mr. Trump might not have much problem with what Mr. Xi had accomplished.\u201cOver the past 14 months in office, Trump has almost never voiced the sort of support for our constitutional system that has been a staple in the statements of past presidents,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cHe does not respect the dignity or integrity of political opponents. He does not express support for the independence of the courts or the freedom of the press.\u201dSo if anything, he said, \u201cI think Trump is probably jealous.\u201dFrom Clinton to Bush to Obama, the prevailing belief was engagement with China would make China more like the West.Instead, as Mr. Mann predicted, China has gone in the opposite direction.Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said Mr. Xi most likely did not care how the world would interpret his designation as a potential ruler in perpetuity.With an unlimited term in office, Mr. Xi would almost certainly be in office beyond 2024, the year Mr. Trump would leave the White House if he won a second term.\u201cThis objectively makes him stronger than Trump, who has no reason to like the change,\u201d Mr. Shi said.At home, Mr. Xi will probably have considerable support for a third term, the result of a yearslong campaign to sideline political rivals and limit dissent. And nationalists cheered the decision, describing Mr. Xi as a singular force who could restore the glory of the nation.But as the news spread, readings of Hannah Arendt, who wrote about the evils of totalitarian rule, and passages from George Washington, who retired after two terms as president, were discussed on social media in Chinese legal circles.Douglas H. Paal, a China expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the sudden move, before Mr. Xi even starts his second term next month, suggested that things were not \u201cnormal\u201d within the Communist Party.\u201cThis looks like forced marching, not normal order, so something is going on,\u201d Mr. Paal said. \u201cXi is winning, but it will take sleuthing to find out what. These are not ordinary times.\u201dA series of visits by senior Chinese officials to Washington in the past month to try and persuade the Trump administration to slow down plans to introduce punitive measures that could result in a trade war had failed, Mr. Paal said.\u201cThis could get complicated when controversial U.S. initiatives meet unconventional times in China,\u201d he said.\u201cWith a population amazed at the incompetent mess in much of the rest of the world, and intoxicated by nationalism, for Xi to effect this change will be seen as reasonable,\u201d said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King\u2019s College, London.But Mr. Xi\u2019s assumption of unfettered power may not work out the way he thinks, said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and a former senior Australian defense official.\u201cThe risks to his personal fortunes are huge,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if the People\u2019s Liberation Army decides he should be cut loose?\u201d And, he added, \u201cWhat if growth slows more than expected?\u201dIf Mr. Xi comes under pressure at home or abroad, he could become unpredictable, and even dangerous, Mr. Jennings said. The reach for more personal power could be the start of his downfall.\u201cThe West can take no comfort in that because Xi\u2019s situation means he may take more risks in the South China Sea or over Taiwan,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has nothing to lose and everything to gain by engaging in more Putin-like brinkmanship.\u201dMoreover, he added, \u201cWhere does one ever see the \u2018president for life\u2019 model end well?\u201dJane Perlez reported from Hong Kong, and Javier C.

{"Headline": "Stocks Fall to End a Bad Week, and a Boom Begins to Look Shaky", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe optimism helped lift stock markets ever higher, extending the boom into its ninth year.Now, investors are suddenly skittish.On Friday, stocks tumbled by more than 2 percent, propelling the market to its worst week in two years.In recent weeks, the shift in sentiment has played out across the world\u2019s largest financial markets. As stocks have sold off, Treasury yields have surged. The dollar has slumped.\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate concern, when inflation spikes up a little bit, that people should evaluate how is this going to affect profits and how is this going to affect the Fed,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe market is becoming more vigilant around these concerns, and that\u2019s good and that\u2019s healthy.\u201dSince stocks began climbing during the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, their rise has been supported by some of the lowest global interest rates seen since World War II. To jump-start growth, central bankers around the world slashed interest rates and took other steps to push down yields on safe government bonds.Their goal was to incentivize investors to put their cash to work in the economy \u2014 for example, by buying corporate stocks and bonds \u2014 rather than stashing it in the relative safety of government bonds. The theory is that the fresh flood of capital would make it easier for companies to raise money, invest in their businesses and hire workers. Central banks wanted to heal their economies.They have healed.For the first time since the financial crisis of 2008, the world\u2019s largest economies are growing in unison. The United States and China led the way, but the expansion now includes Europe, long mired in a debt crisis, and perennially laggard Japan.Given the strength of the global economy, central banks, led by the United States Federal Reserve, have started to remove some of the supports that helped supercharge stock and bond prices over the last decade. The Fed started raising rates two years ago. And with the robust jobs report on Friday showing the fastest wage growth in years, some think the pace of rate increases could quicken.Average hourly earnings for United States workers were 2.9 percent higher in January than the previous year, the fastest annual increase in years. Although a welcome development for workers, economists often view rising wages as an early indication of inflationary pressure. If faster price increases do begin to emerge, the Fed could try to head them off with more aggressive rate action.Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve\u2019s departing chairwoman who had her last working day on Friday, was viewed by some as being more concerned about measures of weakness in the job market than by the risk of rising inflation, and therefore more willing to keep rates low. Her successor, Jerome H. Powell, will face different challenges as the Fed charts a new course in raising interest rates.Interest rates that are set every day in the global bond markets are already leaping higher, in anticipation of central bank rate increases later this year. On Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 a widely used gauge for overall interest rates \u2014 rose to more than 2.8 percent, the highest level since early 2014.Rising rates have myriad consequences, including making it more expensive for companies and individuals to borrow money, like for buying a home or a car. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.2 percent, up from less than 4 percent at the end of 2017.The stock markets this week have reflected the jitters.The energy sector was especially hard hit, with energy giants ExxonMobil dropping 5.1 percent and Chevron falling 5.6 percent on Friday after reporting lackluster earnings. The energy sector of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 6.4 percent during the week, the biggest drop of all industrial sectors in the benchmark.Health care stocks did not fare much better. Express Scripts, Cigna and UnitedHealth Group, among others, were battered Tuesday after Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway announced they were teaming up to create a health care company for their employees.Tech stocks, which have been a crucial driver of the broader market rise, also slipped. Apple reported record-breaking profit late Thursday, but the company disappointed investors with a weaker-than-expected sales forecast. Its shares sank roughly 4.3 percent on Friday, worse than the broader market.That is not to say the market is collapsing. The S.&P. 500 fell 3.9 percent this week. Still, it remains close to historic highs and 21 percent above where it stood a year ago, after another year of solid economic growth.The United States economy expanded by a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2017. That is below the pace of some past expansions \u2014 the economy grew at around 4 percent annually in the late 1990s. But it is enough to keep creating significant numbers of jobs, including 200,000 in January.The economic expansion should be a comfort to investors. Higher revenue allows companies to offset rising costs, such as workers\u2019 pay, if inflation picks up. The tax cuts are also expected to help bolster growth.\u201cIf we start to see growth slowing and inflation acceleration, that\u2019s when I get concerned,\u201d said Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. \u201cAs long as growth continues to improve, a little bit more inflation that we\u2019re seeing now is fine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A building boom the Games triggered in Seoul, which not so long ago had been a war-torn capital, would continue in the years that followed. And in the lead-up to the Olympics, the generals who ruled the South relaxed their iron-fisted rule, hoping to soften the country\u2019s image.The Summer Games were a success, the first since 1976 not boycotted by the Americans (as in 1980) or the Soviet Union and its allies (in 1984). Not only did the Soviets and China ignore North Korea\u2019s call to boycott them, but they opened diplomatic ties with Seoul in the years that followed.Unsurprisingly, the Olympics were not broadcast in the North. But they had their effects. Two young North Koreans studying in East Germany, who fled to South Korea after the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, later said they had decided to defect after watching the Seoul Games on television.There was no doubt that the North would try to outdo the Olympics, said Ra Jong-yil, a South Korean political scientist and former deputy director of the country\u2019s National Intelligence Service.\u201cSince their division, South and North Korea have been interlocked with an invisible rope, with one side\u2019s victory meaning the other\u2019s failure,\u201d Mr. Ra said. \u201cThe South\u2019s Olympics were a major challenge to the North Korean government\u2019s legitimacy. The North had to react. It had to host the World Festival at whatever cost.\u201dThe World Festival of Youth and Students \u2014 dedicated to \u201canti-imperialist solidarity, peace and friendship\u201d \u2014 had been held sporadically since 1947, usually hosted by a Communist country. Besides athletic contests, it featured movies, exhibitions, seminars and traditional folk performances. Participants came to Pyongyang from 177 countries, a record for the event (and, the North noted, more than the 160 that sent delegations to the Seoul Games).But facing engineering problems and dwindling resources, construction on the hotel was never finished, though it did reach its full height. It still dominates Pyongyang\u2019s skyline, the tallest unoccupied building on the planet.Still, the stadium and the festival\u2019s other attractions could only distract from the North\u2019s dire economic state, which would soon get much worse. Sung Hae-ryang, a sister-in-law of Kim Jong-il who fled the North in 1996, said there had been serious doubt among North Korea\u2019s elite about hosting the World Festival in a city that \u201cdidn\u2019t even have a coffee shop.\u201d\u201cTo hide the country\u2019s poverty, citizens were made to wear their most colorful clothes and loiter in front of the places where the participants in the festival stayed,\u201d Ms. Sung wrote in a memoir.But Ms. Lim\u2019s visit may not have been the clear-cut propaganda victory for the North that it seemed at the time. Lee Min-bok, a North Korean defector, said it was an eye-opening experience for many young people in the totalitarian state.Ms. Lim\u2019s casual style made such an impression that dressing like her, in loose pants, a T-shirt and white sneakers, became fashionable, Mr. Lee said. And North Koreans who had been taught to regard the South as a repressive country got a very different image of it from Ms. Lim, who gave impromptu speeches in Pyongyang boldly calling for Korean unification and taking aim at her own government for allowing nuclear weapons and foreign troops on its soil.\u201cWhen North Koreans were sending her off, we were sure she would be executed,\u201d Mr. Lee said.\u201cWe were shocked when we heard that she was fighting for her beliefs in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wondered, \u2018How can that be possible?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone X shows.\u2014 Peter EavisWith the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation.They may want to keep fretting, though.Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday. Stocks moved higher. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index closed up 1.2 percent and is now just 3.2 percent off the high it reached just before its plunge at the start of this month.\u2014 Peter EavisBut the two remain far apart on price.From the statement accompanying the letter:The Qualcomm Board believes the meeting led to further progress toward a possible negotiated transaction on key issues other than price.

{"Headline": "3 Books to Help You Understand Millennials and Beyond", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistWhen will someone stick up for millennials? We have been sheltered by our parents, swindled by our universities, deadened by our therapists, and for all this our reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press. Rising to our defense is Harris (our peer, born 1988, as the book\u2019s cover notes), a familiar provocateur from the internet\u2019s left flank. Harris contends that America has stiffed our generation, filling childhoods with homework and extracurricular activities. All of this ostensibly served to prepare us for college and fruitful careers, when really all it resulted in was the \u201calmost inevitable heartbreak\u201d of falling short of our parents\u2019 expectations and ours.Harris spins a recognizable story of a hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages. He uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork. And for what? \u201cEvery authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we could, and we did, but the market hasn\u2019t held up its end of the bargain.\u201dHe brings a fresh, contrarian eye to some of the usual data points. He sees in the Obama-era nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but \u201ca goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand.\u201d For rising tuition costs at America\u2019s public universities, he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures. He argues that millennials\u2019 deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors, who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers. He also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and YouTube stars. And he makes a surprising case that sexting isn\u2019t as harmful as it\u2019s cracked up to be.As generational advocates go, we could do worse than Harris. But he ends his book with a fatalism nearly as flippant as the generational critiques he loathes. Despite this moment of political fellowship among millennials, he writes off the possibility of meaningful change coming from government or social movements once we take over. I\u2019m not optimistic myself, no, but what is our generation if not rich in skills we may yet put to good use?Eler, who is the visual arts critic for The Star Tribune in Minnesota and also a millennial, has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy, self-expression and sex. In the selfie she finds \u201can aspirational image\u201d essential to \u201cbeing seen by others online.\u201d She sees the selfie as a lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem; she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes. And not all selfie-takers, she proves, are as oblivious as imagined.Unfortunately, Eler\u2019s book would have benefited from a more careful edit. Her discursive style is sometimes whimsical, but mostly distracting. She dwells on a topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie-related stories. Fake news in the 2016 election gets at least seven pages; the macaque who took a selfie and then saw PETA sue for his copyright gets just two. She provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad Tinder conversations but glosses over the July 2016 Facebook Live stream by Diamond Reynolds after her husband, Philando Castile, was shot by the police. And while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well, a section on social-media surveillance at Standing Rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting a meeting she had over coffee with a protester.In spite of its flaws, though, Eler\u2019s book alights on the source of the selfie\u2019s power: It is the easiest way to assert one\u2019s humanity in our hyper-networked world. Perhaps our much-fussed-over narcissism is not a flaw but a survival tactic.Her new \u201ciGen\u201d pities rather than disdains those born after 1995, arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled a new generation with profound psychological problems, including sleep deprivation, depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear. They drink less and have less sex; they socialize less without their parents present; they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall; they eschew church and even spirituality; they kill themselves more (but others less); they wait longer to get drivers\u2019 licenses and give birth. Twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students, which she supplements with first-person accounts from members of iGen. She concludes by offering this advice: \u201cDo not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of yourself. It is not your lover. Do not continuously turn your attention to it when you are talking with someone in person. It is not your best friend.\u201dTwenge is right to highlight smartphones\u2019 contributions to our malaise. In one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from a text sent without an immediate response, and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less in-person socializing, which breeds loneliness.She could stand to incorporate some of Harris\u2019s alarm about the economy. She duly recognizes income inequality as a prime source of iGen\u2019s anxiety about its future. But while she discusses how smartphones do their harm, she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market. Instead she tells marketers how to exploit iGen\u2019s diminished expectations, which struck me as tacky and not particularly useful, besides. The kids may spend too much time on their phones, but they know better than to trust brands.Jack Dickey, a 27-year-old millennial, is a staff writer for Sports Illustrated.Advertisement"}

Most Italians Are Too Depressed to Care.", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTARANTO, Italy \u2014 Like millions of young Italians, Elio Vagali confronts career options that range from minimal to nonexistent. At 29, he has cleaned homes, picked tangerines and lifted rocks \u2014 nearly always off the books, without the protections of a full-time contract.In a measure of his desperation, his dream employer is the dilapidated steel mill that dominates life in this fading city on the Ionian Sea. The complex has been blamed for a cancer cluster in the surrounding community. Yet to Mr. Vagali, it beckons like a portal to another life, one that means moving out of his parents\u2019 apartment.Except the plant isn\u2019t hiring. \u201cYou either know somebody, or you don\u2019t get in,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here for me.\u201dAll of which helps explain why Mr. Vagali and much of the Italian electorate is either indifferent or contemptuous of the national election campaign that, on March 4, will determine who runs Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy.The country\u2019s bleak prospects have improved in recent years, but not enough to meaningfully lift its citizens\u2019 fortunes. Many companies are growing without hiring. What jobs have been created are largely temporary and part time.Nearly 30 percent of voters are undecided, according to polls. The unpredictability of the outcome amid economic unhappiness has enhanced the chances that the result could generate financial tumult in Italy and threaten a fresh shock for Europe.Anti-establishment parties are drawing support from the economically distressed \u2014 especially the populist Five Star movement, which is leading in many polls. Given that Five Star has previously called for Italy to ditch the euro currency, if it were to triumph it would present European leaders with a fresh challenge to the continent\u2019s cohesion.\u201cIt would increase uncertainty,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the London-based managing director for Europe at the risk consultancy Eurasia Group. \u201cThe markets could be spooked.\u201dStill, more than 32 percent of Italians under 25 remain unemployed, while the overall jobless rate is 11 percent. Even after three years of modest growth, the Italian economy remains slightly smaller than it was in early 2004, after accounting for rising prices.\u201cThe general perception is actually very gloomy,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss, a university in Rome. \u201cThe recession was particularly bad. A lot of people lost their jobs. A lot of people lost their savings.\u201dYoung Italians see the political class as having failed to refashion an ossified economy in which the elite maintain beach houses, fancy cars and extravagant wardrobes, while everyone else grapples with stagnation. They denounce the still-cozy world of banking in which insiders steer money to politically connected firms while would-be entrepreneurs struggle to secure capital.They also resent paying taxes to finance comfortable pensions, certain that such funds will be exhausted when they reach their senior years given Italy\u2019s monumental public debt.\u201cVoting is useless,\u201d Mr. Vagali said as he stood outside the gates of the steel mill. \u201cNothing changes.\u201dHere in the south of Italy, the hardship is especially intense, reflecting a decisive geographic divide.Northern Italy has Milan, with its financial center and high fashion, and industrial enclaves that make cars. The rugged beauty of the south, where vineyards and olive groves spread across verdant land, has seen scant material gains. Industry is minimal, and livelihoods are challenging.There has been some progress. Here in Puglia, the region that forms Italy\u2019s heel, fortunes have improved in recent years. The regional unemployment rate has dropped below 18 percent, from nearly 20 percent in 2016. Exports from Puglia grew nearly 9 percent last year, with pharmaceuticals, agricultural machinery and food leading the charge.The trouble for Italy \u2014 as for much of the world \u2014 is that rising company fortunes no longer produce many jobs.In a vast rectangular plant outside Bari, Puglia\u2019s capital, Francesco Divella, 70, presides over the pasta-making business that bears his family name.Started by his grandfather in 1895, the business today fills six plants, exporting roughly one-third of its wares to 120 countries, including Germany, the United States and Japan.Since the 1980s, the plant has roughly quadrupled its production, while its work force has less than doubled, reaching 320.\u201cWe are technology oriented,\u201d said Mr. Divella, the chief executive. \u201cWe are able to increase production without adding people.\u201dInside the factory, enormous machines clatter at high decibels, turning flour and water into sheets of pasta, slicing it into spaghetti, and carrying it into ovens for drying. Sensors looking for trouble along the line provide real-time alerts to computers tucked inside a control room.The control room was empty on a recent morning, the machinery running itself. Outside, a lone worker patrolled the cavernous plant.Only in the back of the operation, where pasta is packaged and hoisted into a warehouse, are humans found in numbers. Those tasks are the target for the next phase of automation. Divella just bought a German robotic system that will run self-driving forklifts in its warehouse at night.Even within its professional ranks, Italy is full of economic insecurity, undermining enthusiasm for the elections.Less than five years after she graduated from university, Emanuela Muolo, 28, has already given up her dreams of a career in the field she studied, financial law. She first worked an unpaid job at a local law firm, hoping to gain experience. She never secured a paid position, so she shifted her focus to banking, searching throughout Italy for a job while she worked as a restaurant hostess.Recently, she settled into a full-time position at a job center in Bari, helping unemployed people with their quests for a paycheck. She earns about 1,100 euros a month (about $1,360).She and her boyfriend have been together for five years. They contemplate marriage and starting a family, but they both live with their parents.The professional roadblocks she has encountered have left Ms. Muolo confused about the election. Her boyfriend plans to vote for Five Star. She plans to skip the polls.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel real,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, we feel far away from Rome.\u201dIn Taranto, Rome\u2019s influence is a visceral force as the Ilva steel mill \u2014 one of the largest in Europe \u2014 spews toxic dust that blackens the windows of surrounding neighborhoods.The plant began production in 1964 as a state-owned enterprise, its very existence the result of Rome\u2019s designs on developing the south to create jobs.In 2012, a local magistrate cited health issues in ordering the shutdown of major parts of the plant, by then in private hands. But the central government in Rome used an emergency decree to override that decision to preserve some 20,000 jobs.Meanwhile, the mill remains in operation.In the Tamburi neighborhood, a grid of crumbling concrete block apartments with laundry billowing from their balconies, residents have grown accustomed to watching young people move away.\u201cThere\u2019s no more jobs around here,\u201d said Ignazio D\u2019Andria, proprietor of a local cafe.Mr. D\u2019Andria does not plan to vote. \u201cI\u2019ve tried the left,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried the right. Our lives haven\u2019t changed.\u201dStanding next to the bar, Alessio Peretto grimaces at that attitude. He works at the Ilva plant, and he favors Five Star, given the party\u2019s talk of building a new economy centered on green energy.\u201cGive them a chance,\u201d he said.The rest of the crowd inside the cafe was not buying it. They have seen this stretch of southern Italy fester for decades before Rome constructed a catastrophe in the name of jobs. The land is poisoned, people are sick, and now even the jobs are imperiled. To them, the politicians seem like flies landing on a corpse.Two older men leaned against the wall, hoisting bottles of beer after a day spent cutting slabs of marble in a nearby graveyard.\u201cIn the cemetery, that\u2019s where we find work,\u201d said Antonio Caniello, 69. \u201cDeath is the only sure thing.\u201dGiulia Alagna contributed reporting from Bari, Italy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Sense of the Jobs Report: It\u2019s Not Always Easy", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe monthly employment report is almost certainly the single most-watched of the government\u2019s economic indicators. It\u2019s where we learn how many jobs employers added the previous month, as well as what happened to the unemployment rate, hourly earnings and dozens of other measures of the labor market\u2019s health. The report can move markets, influence monetary policy and set off political ripples \u2014 especially if President Trump, as he often does, weighs in on Twitter.Jobs day has also become something of a monthly club meeting for economics nerds, complete with its own clubhouse (Twitter) and secret language: \u201cbeats\u201d and \u201cmisses,\u201d U-3 and U-6 (two different measures of unemployment), and an alphabet soup of obscure acronyms and abbreviations. Reporters, economists and policy wonks race to post charts; call out interesting tidbits; and, inevitably, argue about how to interpret the latest batch of data.No matter the venue, the mission is the same: to distill the data to its essential themes as quickly as possible. The trouble is, the report doesn\u2019t always make that easy.To understand why, it helps to know a bit about the jobs report. For one thing, it\u2019s really two reports stitched together. One, based on a survey of employers, provides information on jobs: how many were created (or eliminated) the previous month and how much those jobs pay. The other, based on a survey of households, focuses on individuals: how many are working or not working, along with information on their age, race, education and other characteristics.Over the long run, the two surveys tend to tell pretty much the same story. Both, for example, show that the labor market has experienced a slow but remarkably long-lasting recovery over the past eight years. But in any given month, the two sources can diverge, sometimes significantly.So why bother covering the jobs report at all? Because, for all its flaws, the report contains valuable, timely insights into the aspects of the economy that matter most to many readers. It\u2019s how we know that the economy has added jobs for a record-breaking 87 straight months but that wage growth remains anemic. It\u2019s how we know that the unemployment rate for African-Americans is the lowest on record but remains nearly double that of whites. It\u2019s how we know that job growth was strong in Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office but that it was even stronger under former President Barack Obama.When my colleagues and I cover the jobs report, we tend to focus mostly on these kinds of medium- and longer-run trends. Sure, we report the latest figures, with the appropriate caveats, and comb through the report for signs of what may lie ahead \u2014 an acceleration in wage growth, for example, or a slowdown in construction hiring. But we\u2019re always mindful that what looks like a shift in direction could turn out to be a one-month blip. Only over time do the most significant trends become clear.There is no single right answer to any of those questions. But the good news is that we\u2019ll get to grapple with them anew first thing on Friday \u2014 and every jobs day thereafter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "South Africa\u2019s New President Names Allies and Rivals to Cabinet", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE TOWN \u2014 President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa announced the makeup of his first cabinet on Monday night, appointing well-respected officials to key positions but naming as his deputy a provincial power broker with a history of poor management.In forming his cabinet 11 days after being sworn in as president, Mr. Ramaphosa also retained some allies of his scandal-plagued predecessor, Jacob Zuma, apparently trying to balance the competing factions inside the African National Congress, the governing party. Mr. Ramaphosa has pledged to make clean government a priority.Although Mr. Ramaphosa succeeded in forcing Mr. Zuma to step down as president, the composition of his first cabinet underscored the enduring influence of Mr. Zuma and his supporters, experts said.\u201cIn recent weeks, a lot of people seem to have forgotten that there are many in the leadership that are not enthusiastic about the new direction taken by Ramaphosa,\u201d said Steven Friedman, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg. \u201cThere is a substantial number of people in the cabinet who supported Zuma, though, in the key ministries, Ramaphosa got the people he wanted to get in.\u201d\u201cIn making these changes, I have been conscious of the need to balance continuity and stability with the need for renewal, economic recovery and accelerated transformation,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said in a televised address.But Mr. Ramaphosa also reappointed a handful of familiar figures from Mr. Zuma\u2019s past cabinets, including some linked to cases of corruption and poor administration.In addition, Mr. Ramaphosa chose as the nation\u2019s deputy president \u2014 the post that he himself occupied under Mr. Zuma \u2014 the premier of Mpumalanga Province, David Mabuza. A longtime ally of Mr. Zuma, Mr. Mabuza switched sides in the A.N.C.\u2019s election in December, handing Mr. Ramaphosa a narrow victory.\u201cRamaphosa wouldn\u2019t have been elected without Mabuza,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.But Mr. Mabuza, he said, was known for ruling with \u201can iron fist\u201d and for \u201cconsistent allegations of corruption.\u201d His province was also for many years the \u201cepicenter of political killings,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.The appointment of Mr. Mabuza to the second-highest position in the government \u2014 one that has served as a springboard to the presidency in South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid history \u2014 could undermine Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s pledge to root out corruption, experts said.\u201cHow can Ramaphosa claim to be anti-corruption when he is standing next to such a morally compromised figure as David Mabuza?\u201d said Ralph Mathekga, a political analyst and author. \u201cWhen he talks about being anti-corruption, he\u2019ll just have to sing to the birds, because no one else will listen.\u201dEarlier this month, Mr. Ramaphosa pushed Mr. Zuma to resign as the nation\u2019s leader, though his term did not expire until mid-2019. Mr. Ramaphosa persuaded the party\u2019s top leaders that getting rid of the unpopular, scandal-plagued Mr. Zuma as soon as possible would help the party rebuild itself before national elections next year.In December, Mr. Ramaphosa, who had served as Mr. Zuma\u2019s deputy for nearly four years, was elected leader of the A.N.C., defeating Mr. Zuma\u2019s preferred candidate. In a country where the president is chosen by Parliament, the A.N.C.\u2019s top leaders effectively select the nation\u2019s leader.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fierce but Frail, Malaysia\u2019s Mahathir, 92, Aims to Topple Prot\u00e9g\u00e9", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPERAI, Malaysia \u2014 Mahathir Mohamad, who led Malaysia for decades with dagger-sharp rhetoric and increasingly autocratic ways, is 92 and in frail health. But he wants his old job back.To do it, Mr. Mahathir, already one of the world\u2019s most durable political survivors, has engaged in yet another act of reinvention. This time, he is allying himself with opposition figures he once repressed in the name of beating his own former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Najib Razak, whom he helped make prime minister in 2009.The man who defined much of Malaysia\u2019s political history is, in effect, standing before both the country as a whole and the new opposition allies he once persecuted and asking them to ignore the past. But he is certainly not apologizing.\u201cWhen it comes to the election, forget about everything and think only of winning,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said at a recent campaign rally in Penang.\u201cI know I\u2019m not popular with all the people,\u201d he said, continuing with a hint of sarcastic edge. \u201cRemember, I am \u2018cruel\u2019 or a \u2018pharaoh.\u2019 That\u2019s all right. In politics, you get called all types of names.\u201dMr. Mahathir is campaigning as the leader of the opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan, and if he does rise to power again in parliamentary elections this year, he will become the oldest head of government in the world.Mr. Najib heads the governing United Malays National Organization, Mr. Mahathir\u2019s former party, which has held power since independence in 1957.\u201cMahathir\u2019s candidacy is a kind of Hail Mary pass from the opposition that has spent the past three years beset by infighting,\u201d said Ibrahim Suffian, the director of the Merdeka Center, an independent polling agency.Running with him for deputy prime minister is Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, whose husband, the opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, was imprisoned under Mr. Mahathir for five years on corruption and sodomy charges.Now, Mr. Mahathir is urging members of the opposition to put aside their past enmity and unite behind his leadership.\u201cThis time, we are together to replace the government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has been there for more than 60 years. It is time it goes.\u201dA doctor before entering politics, Mr. Mahathir remains sharp, and his memory of people and events is exceptional.But he has a history of heart problems, and his aides carefully limit his daily schedule to conserve his strength.At a rally in the industrial town of Perai, he took the podium just before 11 p.m. and spoke for nearly 30 minutes without notes to a standing-room-only crowd of about 2,500 supporters. He was clear and forceful, despite coughing at times.But soon after his appearance, a planned interview with The New York Times was canceled because of a lingering respiratory ailment. On Feb. 9, he was admitted to the National Heart Institute in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s capital, for six days for treatment of a chest infection.The willingness of his onetime foes to line up behind Mr. Mahathir\u2019s candidacy illustrates the weakness of an opposition that has never held power and is fragmented by ethnic divisions and personal rivalries.Without Mr. Mahathir, analysts say, the four-party opposition coalition has no leader who can unify its factions and appeal to rural, ethnically Malay voters, who make up a decisive voting bloc.\u201cThe reason Mahathir was named as the candidate for prime minister is quite straightforward: There is nobody else,\u201d said Wan Saiful Wan Jan, chief executive of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur.Mr. Najib, 64, who last faced voters in 2013, must call an election by August. Some predict that the vote could come as early as April because it would ensure the absence of Mr. Anwar, 70, who was imprisoned three years ago under Mr. Najib after a second sodomy conviction.A skilled orator who nearly defeated Mr. Najib in 2013, Mr. Anwar is scheduled to be released from prison in June. His supporters say all the charges against him have been politically motivated.As prime minister from 1981 to 2003, Mr. Mahathir modernized the country\u2019s economy and built landmark projects, including the Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur, which at one point were the world\u2019s tallest buildings.When he stepped down in 2003, Mr. Mahathir chose Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to succeed him as prime minister and Mr. Najib as his deputy. But by 2009, he was unhappy with Mr. Abdullah\u2019s performance and pushed him out, paving the way for Mr. Najib to take over.\u201cYes, I picked him,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said in a 2016 interview with The Times. \u201cI encouraged Badawi to pick Najib as his deputy, which means he would become the next prime minister. I was instrumental in the fall of Badawi also.\u201dMr. Mahathir broke with the governing United Malays National Organization two years ago because of his unhappiness with Mr. Najib.\u201cThis particular prime minister believes he can buy support,\u201d Mr. Mahathir told The Times in September. \u201cWith money he can buy everybody. He needs to have money. So how does he get the money? He steals the money.\u201dUnder Mr. Najib, he said, Malaysia is no longer a democracy.\u201cFor us it is a dictatorship,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rule of law is no longer enforced now.\u201dMr. Mahathir will turn 93 in July, and there is little expectation that he would serve out a full five-year term. In effect, he is serving as a stand-in for a future leader, but for whom is not entirely clear.\u201cHis role is to win the election and hold the position until someone else comes,\u201d Mr. Wan Saiful said.Some in the opposition hope it would be Mr. Anwar.In the 1990s, he was Mr. Mahathir\u2019s deputy prime minister and likely successor. But the two had a falling out, and Mr. Anwar was sent to prison by a court widely seen as carrying out Mr. Mahathir\u2019s wishes.Because of Mr. Anwar\u2019s most recent conviction, he is barred from holding elective office for five years after his release. The ban could be reversed with a royal pardon or a successful appeal.This month Mr. Anwar appeared in court on his latest appeal. In a brief interview as he stood surrounded by more than a dozen guards, he said he accepted Mr. Mahathir\u2019s candidacy because the former prime minister had embraced the goals of the opposition.\u201cWe are not supporting Mahathir as a person,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are supporting the reform agenda he has committed to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beijing Takes Over Anbang, Insurer That Owns Waldorf Astoria", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese government said on Friday that it had seized control of Anbang Insurance Group, the troubled Chinese company that owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel and other marquee properties around the world, and it had charged the company\u2019s former chairman with economic crimes.The move is Beijing\u2019s biggest effort yet to rein in a new kind of globally ambitious Chinese company. Anbang and others like it spent billions of dollars around the world buying up hotels and other high-profile properties. The deals illustrated China\u2019s growing economic might but fed into concerns that rising debt levels could slow growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, behind the United States.China\u2019s insurance regulator said in a notice dated Friday that Anbang would be overseen for a year by a group that included China\u2019s central bank, its securities and banking regulators, the country\u2019s foreign exchange regulator and other government agencies. It said Anbang had violated regulations, putting into question its ability to pay insurance claims.\u201cThe takeover management team will take effective measures to keep the company operating as usual,\u201d the insurance regulator said, adding that it would protect consumers and \u201cthe legitimate rights and interest of all stakeholders.\u201dThe regulator said that the takeover could extend a second year if the company failed to complete an equity restructuring and resume operations. It said the takeover would be capped at two years.The Shanghai Procuratorate, which handles prosecutions in the city, announced in a statement on Friday morning that Mr. Wu, Anbang\u2019s former chairman, had been indicted in the city\u2019s First Intermediate People\u2019s Court for fraudulent fund-raising and for improperly taking company assets.Mr. Wu was founder and chairman, but his name did not appear in Anbang\u2019s corporate ownership records. Instead, it is owned on paper by a succession of shell companies controlled by a handful of obscure names. Such ownership arrangements are common in China, where the wealthy and politically connected often own properties under the names of others.The takeover of Anbang will put the Waldorf Astoria, for decades a symbol of New York elegance, under the control of the Chinese government. In addition to hosting celebrities like Frank Sinatra and Elizabeth Taylor, for years it had been the lodging of choice for presidents and other world leaders.The Waldorf Astoria purchase ushered in the rise of a new breed of Chinese deal makers. The companies, which also included Dalian Wanda Group, HNA Group and Fosun International, bought up everything from hotels to banks to movie production companies. Though the companies are privately owned, their leaders often benefited from their political connections, and they were often backed by cheap debt provided by China\u2019s state-run banks.The deals made the companies truly global players. For example, in a financial disclosure last spring, shortly before the police detention of its chairman, Anbang said that nearly three-fifths of the assets of its main business, life insurance, were overseas.Anbang also offered more than $13 billion for Starwood Hotels and Resorts before abandoning its bid in 2016, without explanation. By then, the Chinese deal makers had hit a wall.Chinese regulators also began casting a critical eye over big spending in areas like real estate. Many of the companies, like Dalian Wanda and HNA, have since been selling assets to pay down debt.Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Ryan Murphy Heads to Netflix in Deal Said to Be Worth Up to $300 Million", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe streaming giant Netflix has won yet another battle against old Hollywood.On Tuesday night, Netflix announced that it had poached the hit-making producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox.The five-year deal is worth as much as $300 million, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. That would be one of the biggest deals ever made for a television producer.While the agreement will come as a disappointment to the studio where Mr. Murphy has spent most of his career, it also delivers a serious blow to the Walt Disney Company, which reached a deal in December to acquire most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion.Mr. Murphy\u2019s contract with Fox expires in the summer, and he will make the move to Netflix in July.The prolific producer behind \u201cGlee,\u201d \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d and the anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d Mr. Murphy would have been a key piece in the expanded Disney empire, and Fox executives made several attempts to keep him in the corporate family. Amazon also courted him seriously, which played a role in driving up the price for the 52-year-old writer, director and producer from Indianapolis.\u201cThe history of this moment is not lost on me,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in a statement. \u201cI am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me.\u201dThe moment was certainly right for someone like Mr. Murphy to find himself in the final months of a contract. The Hollywood economy is buzzing, with fast-moving digital disrupters taking on the studios that have been dependable providers of mass entertainment since the silent-movie era.The upshot is that proven show runners and big stars are in an enviable bargaining position.A factor in Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to join Netflix was the uncertainty brought on by the agreement between Disney and Fox. He had close working relationships with Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox; Dana Walden, the chairwoman of Fox\u2019s TV group (and the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children); and John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX network, a cable channel under the Fox banner.If the Disney-Fox deal wins governmental approval, as expected, it is not a sure thing that those executives will stay in their roles. Mr. Rice said at the Code Media conference on Tuesday that he didn\u2019t know whether he would remain with the company after the planned merger went through.The exclusive, five-year deal for the high-profile producer is yet another coup for Netflix. In addition to signing Ms. Rhimes last summer, the company has brought aboard Dave Chappelle, David Letterman, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler with lucrative deals.Mr. Murphy did not have his hands tied at Fox, which allowed him to push boundaries. And he did not lack for respect: The first season of the FX anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson,\u201d for which Mr. Murphy served as an executive producer, was a huge hit with critics and won nine Emmys. The Netflix deal, though, will allow him potentially bigger budgets and gives him the latitude to try movies, television or even documentaries.In his statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Murphy expressed his gratitude toward Netflix\u2019s chief executive officer, Reed Hastings; its chief content officer, Ted Sarandos; and its vice president for original content, Cindy Holland.\u201cI am awash in genuine appreciation for Ted Sarandos, Reed Hastings and Cindy Holland at Netflix for believing in me and the future of my company, which will continue to champion women, minorities and L.G.B.T.Q. heroes and heroines,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am honored and grateful to continue my partnership with my friends and peers at Fox on my existing shows.\u201dIn his own statement, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cRyan Murphy\u2019s series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history. His unfaltering dedication to excellence and to give voice to the underrepresented, to showcase a unique perspective or just to shock the hell out of us, permeates his genre-shattering work.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s vast slate at Fox will not disappear overnight. All future seasons of \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFeud\u201d will continue to air on FX. His procedural drama, \u201c9-1-1,\u201d which is only six weeks old and is becoming something of a sleeper hit, will continue on Fox. And his new drama about the 1980s New York vogue scene, \u201cPose,\u201d with a largely transgender cast, will proceed at FX.Mr. Murphy began his career as a journalist before moving into television script writing. His first show, \u201cPopular,\u201d on the WB, didn\u2019t last long but has become the source of cult fascination. \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d one of the earliest successes for FX, gave Mr. Murphy his first hit and transformed FX from a crusty basic cable outpost into a premier entertainment destination. In 2009, when Mr. Murphy brought some Broadway pizazz \u2014 along with an affection for misfit adolescents \u2014 to Fox\u2019s prime-time lineup with \u201cGlee,\u201d he entered the top ranks of show runners.Throughout his career, he has shown a penchant for taking the stuff of camp and making it popular. No one expected an eight-hour limited series about the rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis \u2014 \u201cFeud,\u201d on FX \u2014 to be a hit, but it was.Mr. Murphy signaled his restlessness last month, at the Television Critics Association media event in Los Angeles, when he expressed angst over his future.

{"Headline": "5 Tips to Weather a Turbulent Stock Market", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersThe stock market has been shaken by turbulence in the last few weeks, something it hasn\u2019t experienced in a few years.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index plunged more than 10 percent from Jan. 26 to Feb. 8, a sell-off that pushed the market into a correction. The S.&P. has since rebounded, regaining much of those losses. That type of volatility is a normal occurrence, but theories abound to explain what caused it.Adam I. Taback, deputy chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank, said the volatility was the result of the economic expansion\u2019s being in the seventh or eighth inning of a baseball game.\u201cWe may have extra innings in this cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people are more cognizant that the equity markets have more risk in them. They\u2019re happy that their portfolios are diversified but worried where they are in the economic cycle.\u201dSome try to take a more historical view. Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, said volatility typically arose for three reasons: a technical correction where stocks pause but continue rising because company fundamentals are sound; a correction that reflects a change in the business cycle; or a systemic correction, like the 1929 stock market crash or 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThe one we experienced last week was the mildest,\u201d Mr. Ablin said. In other words, just a technical correction.Others think it was a return to the normal function of a stock market: Some days, investors sell more stock than they buy.\u201cWhen the Dow drops 1,000 points, that\u2019s more a testament to the growth of the Dow,\u201d said Francis M. Kinniry, head of portfolio construction at Vanguard. \u201cThat\u2019s still just a 4 percent move, because the Dow is at 25,000. Dropping 100 points on the S.&P. 500 doesn\u2019t get people upset, but it\u2019s the same thing.\u201dDon\u2019t fret. Here are five tips from professionals that could help ensure that a volatile ride doesn\u2019t derail your financial planning.They argue that stocks are going to begin to show differences and that their skills at stock selection will keep investors\u2019 portfolios from being dragged down with an entire index. In other words, in a market where everything isn\u2019t going up, selecting the best individual companies makes more sense.Francisco Bido, the head of quantitative research and a portfolio manager at Cognios Capital, said he had reduced the number of stocks he invested in after the recent volatility. The move came out of conviction, not fear, he said.\u201cA lot of those big passive vehicles out there buy so many stocks because they have a mandate to track an index,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it helps to be a bit more concentrated. It allows investors to find a different avenue.\u201dHis strategy is also an argument to know what you own. That\u2019s good advice in any market.But an indexing behemoth like Vanguard says that is an overused argument. Nearly 90 percent of active managers have underperformed the indexes they track, Mr. Kinniry said.\u201cIt\u2019s not an active versus index story,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s high cost versus low cost. They underperform because they\u2019re charging too much for the \u2018alpha\u2019 they generate,\u201d he added, referring to the return in excess of the market return.Mr. Kinniry is correct that fees eat into any return, regardless of how volatile the market is.But rising interest rates could eat away returns for individual investors. Driving this worry is a new chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, who took charge on Feb. 5, as the stock market dipped.An alternative to bonds for affluent investors is private debt, which provides loans to small and medium-size companies. The loans are generally just a few years in duration and pay an annual yield of about 10 percent. The risk is in the credit quality of the borrower.Mr. Taback of Wells Fargo Private Bank said that although there was credit risk in the loans, private debt does not feel the same impact that bond portfolios do when interest rates rise. \u201cNow that you\u2019re seeing losses in bond portfolios, clients are more receptive to this,\u201d he said.Hedge funds, in particular, earned a bad reputation for the high fees they charge to manage money on top of taking a share of any profits. Some sophisticated institutional managers, like the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, announced in 2014 that it was getting out of hedge funds because they were too expense and complex.But financial advisers and money managers are arguing that in a volatile investing environment, investors should reconsider hedge funds and other alternative assets like private equity, private debt and real estate. Their returns, they say, are less correlated to the fluctuations of the stock and bond markets and thus provide a steadying force.\u201cLast year, you could ignore risk and focus on return,\u201d said Jae Yoon, chief investment officer of New York Life Investment Management. \u201cThis year, we\u2019re getting more normal volatility, and most clients will find they don\u2019t have enough alternative strategies.\u201dHe said the strong rally in the United States markets had many investors with overweight investments in American stocks, a phenomenon known as home-country bias.But since last year, many developed and emerging markets have begun to perform strongly. \u201cThe more explosive growth is happening in the younger economies around the world,\u201d said Rick Pitcairn, chief investment officer of Pitcairn, an investment adviser to wealthy families.\u201cThere\u2019s persistence in volatility,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said.But volatility is not necessary a bad thing when you have a plan. Mr. Cronk pointed out that even big corrections were a normal part of an economic cycle.The last two economic recovery cycles, in the 1990s and the 2000s, had three corrections apiece toward the end, he said. Investors who bailed after the first correction in each recovery missed out because the markets rose 20 percent afterward.\u201cCorrections are normal and healthy,\u201d Mr. Cronk said. \u201cInvestors should look at them opportunistically more so than be afraid of them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President or Luxury Towers: Either Way, Trump Is the Rage in India", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGURGAON, India \u2014 When the Trump family jet lands in India this week, the family member taking a tour of the world\u2019s largest democracy \u2014 with a Secret Service detail in tow \u2014 won\u2019t be the president on a diplomatic mission. It will be his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., on a sales trip.But Indians might be forgiven for not making much of the distinction.The visit by the younger Mr. Trump, intended to help sell more than $1 billion in luxury residential units being built by the Trumps and their local partners, has been promoted with newspaper advertisements that read: \u201cTrump has arrived. Have you?\u201dThe younger Mr. Trump\u2019s weeklong itinerary of cocktail parties, dinners and events with real estate brokers, business leaders and prospective buyers comes as President Trump is working to strengthen ties between the two countries.The overlap in India between father and son creates a spectacle with few parallels in business and diplomacy.The younger Mr. Trump is scheduled to arrive on Monday on a Boeing 757 nicknamed Trump Force One, because the president crisscrossed the United States on the plane during the campaign.There are no formal federal rules that prohibit the younger Mr. Trump from pursuing his business interests; he is a private citizen. And even though President Trump is still a beneficial owner of the family business, he is not subject to conflict of interest laws, as the president is exempt. The White House, asked if Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s trip gave even an appearance of a conflict of interest, declined to comment on the matter.The luxury apartment buildings near the Trump development in Gurgaon have names like Palm Springs and Central Park, even as they overlook pothole-ridden highways. The Trumps and their partners are offering buyers the opportunity to become \u201cmembers of the Trump family,\u201d with the promise of exclusive amenities such as an infinity swimming pool, a billiards room and valet services. The marketing materials, however, don\u2019t mention the president \u2014 his name and image, as well as that of his daughter Ivanka, who joined his administration, were removed from brochures, websites and billboards from projects in India and elsewhere in the world.Still, confusion among Indians is evident.\u201cI had no idea that Trump built property around the world before this development was launched,\u201d said Hitesh Khanna, who is helping sell units at the Trump towers in Gurgaon through a local real estate brokerage firm. \u201cI just thought he was president.\u201dMr. Khanna\u2019s boss, Rajiv Bansal, predicted the presidential connection would create enough buzz to entice buyers. Mr. Khanna was working out of a roadside tent near the construction site, with a tattered emerald green felt carpet at its entrance.\u201cEveryone in India knows who the U.S. president is,\u201d Mr. Bansal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a status symbol. This is a big brand, the president of the United States\u2019 name will be on it.\u201dDonald Trump Jr., in an interview in New York last week, said that he had spent nearly a decade \u201ccultivating relationships in India\u201d and that the company was \u201cnow seeing the response of that effort.\u201d To that point, the newspaper advertisements in India featured large photographs of him, arms crossed and staring into the camera.The younger Mr. Trump said his itinerary did not include interactions with government officials in an intentional effort to steer clear of politics.\u201cWe certainly won\u2019t get involved in that,\u201d he said, when asked if the company would seek concessions or incentives for the developments from Indian officials. \u201cNot at all.\u201dThe Trump Organization has not put up capital for its Indian projects, instead relying on Indian-based partners whose investors include Morgan Stanley and a Singapore investment fund. The Trump Organization gets a cut of the sales, with payments increasing if the units sell above market rates.So far, according to business partners in India, many units are selling about 30 percent per square foot higher than market rates. The younger Mr. Trump\u2019s visit this week is expected to reinforce that trend, they said, even as many other luxury housing towers have hundreds of empty units. In addition to an oversupply, a recent Indian government crackdown on the so-called black money economy has hurt sales at competing developments, but the Trump name remains a draw.Buyers who put down a deposit this week, according to an advertisement wrapped around the front page of The Hindustan Times this weekend, are promised a seat at a dinner with the younger Mr. Trump.Madhav Das Nalapat, an academic and prominent newspaper columnist who is close to senior members of India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said the excitement around the Trump towers was an extension of the country\u2019s complicated caste system and the Trump administration\u2019s tough stance on its rival Pakistan.\u201cIndia is a hierarchical society,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is now leading the No. 1 country in the world, so his brand has higher value. That counts. It\u2019s not who he is. It\u2019s what he is.\u201dUnder voluntary ethics rules governing the Trump Organization\u2019s activities during the Trump presidency, international projects in the works before the 2016 election \u2014 which include all of the India properties now being marketed \u2014 can proceed as planned. President Trump handed over daily operations of the company to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, but he remains the owner.Still, some ethics lawyers say the mere presence of the Trump Organization in India is problematic.The Trump family\u2019s financial interests in India could also call into question the president\u2019s objectivity in dealing with the country, Ms. Teachout said.\u201cIt looks bad, it smells bad, and it leaves an uncertainty in the faith of the American public about the diplomatic choices that the Trump administration makes regarding India,\u201d she said.The biggest difference from the Obama administration, they said, was the apparent warmth between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi.Maria Abi-Habib reported from Gurgaon, India, and Eric Lipton from New York.

{"Headline": "When Early Retirement Turns Into a Total Bore", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA reader sold his business and, at 55, no longer needs to work. But now he feels adrift and wonders whether to get back into the work force. And if so, how? I\u2019m a 55-year-old male. I recently sold my business, which was very profitable. Financially, I am pretty well set. But while the idea of an early retirement was always appealing, I\u2019m finding that I am bored out of my mind. I miss the activity and satisfaction that came from building and running a company. I don\u2019t feel I can talk to any of my friends about this, as they are hard at work and can\u2019t really identify with my boredom. I feel I am too old to go back into the work force, which seems so focused on millennials. Moreover, I have enjoyed 25-plus years plus of calling my own shots, so I wonder about reporting to someone else. Is this just something I need to get over and enjoy the fruits of my labor? Or should I try to re-enter the work force in some limited capacity?ASHEVILLE, N.C.Congratulations on submitting the most enviable \u201cworkplace dilemma\u201d that I can recall. And as if the rest of us weren\u2019t jealous enough already, you likely have better options than you realize. No need to head back to some mailroom to be bossed around by twentysomethings 40 hours a week. You can dabble \u2014 consulting, taking on short-term gigs, freelancing. To be sure, plenty are doing so because they need to: Maybe they were thrown out of work against their will, or discovered retirement is more expensive than anticipated. But some, Mr. Kasriel observes, simply found full-time leisure unsatisfying.There are a couple of paths you might follow. You could look for freelance gigs that leverage your specific skills (related to whatever field you worked in), but on a temporary or project basis. Or, Mr. Kasriel says, you could hire yourself out as more of a coach, offering \u201cthe wisdom acquired\u201d from building a business. \u201cPeople that have been 20 or 30 years in the work force have a lot of transferable experience,\u201d he adds.It\u2019s true, Mr. Harris concedes, that you\u2019ll have to \u201cget used to advising and supporting and recommending, as opposed to bossing and telling and directing.\u201d But plenty of companies are looking for experience and know-how without a full-time commitment. You can experiment. Sound out your own social network; consider charitable or volunteer options. Mr. Kasriel, the Upwork C.E.O., mentions a user of the site who retired from investment banking, and now writes children\u2019s stories. \u201cIt keeps him busy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd apparently he\u2019s pretty good at it.\u201d In the immediate term, Mr. Kasriel notes, a tight labor market makes experienced talent more valuable. In the longer term, structural shifts in that market are for better or worse tilting toward more demand for freelancers. And Mr. Harris suggests that you are part of a broader phenomenon. Since founding Patina Solutions nine years ago, well before the \u201cgig economy\u201d notion took hold, he wrote a book called \u201cCareer 180s.\u201d It is about experienced workers living longer, getting bored \u2014 and starting whole new professional lives. \u201cWe hear a lot of these stories,\u201d he says.Did this employee try to resolve the underlying issues with management \u2014 perhaps negotiating for changes that would make the job palatable again? Concern for the boss and co-workers is laudable. But to treat quitting as inevitable is to shoot oneself in the foot. Cutting and running \u2014 no matter what the time frame \u2014 isn\u2019t proactively managing a career. I am loath to question someone else\u2019s sense that it is time to quit. But you make a reasonable point, and maybe I should examine that instinct more closely. Advertisement"}

The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge. But that\u2019s OK \u2013 persuading customers to pay more arguably requires as much genius as getting people to adopt the technology in the first place.\u201dAmazonCritics cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:Amazon.com is going gangbusters.

Over time, that could sully the company\u2019s image.AlphabetCritics cornerJennifer Saba of Breakingviews:Alphabet is stuck at the letter G. The holding company of Google was created to safeguard against conventionality and let moonshot ideas, like self-driving cars, flourish. Almost three years in, it\u2019s basically still just Google. Which means, in turn, that the A in Alphabet stands mainly for advertising.It wouldn\u2019t hurt Alphabet to put more energy into revenue sources that don\u2019t start with a G.Why now\u2022 Walt Disney\u2019s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.Critics cornerTara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly:\u201cCBS isn\u2019t safe from the industry\u2019s broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom won\u2019t provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities. Those synergies may amount to some $500 million based on what past deals have yielded, according to Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.

And don\u2019t expect the company to go public this year.Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company\u2019s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis.Between the linesThe context The company lineHere\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson:\u201cShe takes critical functions that might be seen as constraints in other companies, and clears a path so they can become competitive advantages and facilitate the growth of the business.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies:\u201cHaving worked with Belinda over the years and at Airbnb, I have been consistently impressed by her ability to anticipate issues and leverage strategic opportunities. She combines technical expertise with great care for her colleagues.\u201dAnd here\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi:\u201cHe helped Airbnb establish a rigorous financial discipline, aided our expansion into new businesses including into luxury rentals, which is now one of our core businesses, and helped us develop new and innovative ways to grow Airbnb and our businesses.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSome of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook.Facebook\u2019s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe.The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook\u2019s future growth. The company\u2019s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe\u2019s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States\u2019, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.That\u2019s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin\u2019s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg.The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday.More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex.\u201cThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,\u201d said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. \u201cIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.\u201dThe digital money flyaroundDetails, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point.The contextWhile a potential joint venture between Alphabet and Aramco isn\u2019t necessarily connected to the latter company\u2019s IPO, if a deal is struck before the offering, advisers to the company could pitch the pact as a way for investors to bake in technology valuations.It isn\u2019t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company \u2014 and therefore command a higher multiple \u2014 but it\u2019d be interesting to see bankers make that argument.\u2014 Stephen GrocerFrom the release:\u201cI am excited to join NEA because they understand how to work with visionary entrepreneurs to build successful technology and health care enterprises,\u201d Immelt said. \u201cI have a passion for these sectors and I am eager to work with NEA and its partners to develop great businesses, nurture talented leaders and grow diverse teams.\u201dand:\u201cJeff is deeply knowledgeable about the complex global innovation landscape we\u2019re operating in today and he understands how businesses must evolve to compete and win in that environment, particularly across industrial and medical technologies,\u201d said Scott Sandell, Managing General Partner, NEA.(Worth noting: Mr. Immelt\u2019s successor at G.E. is struggling to turn that company around. See below.)\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s where our colleague Peter Eavis says investors should focus:Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Today\u2019s a big day for tech earningsThe Treasury secretary argued that the cuts would eventually pay for themselves, but conceded that it wouldn\u2019t happen this year.The policy flyaroundAnalysts\u2019 takes:\u2022 Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch write, \u201cThis shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.\u201d\u2022 Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \u201cIn short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell\u2019s first press conference.\u201d\u2022 Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton said, \u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation.\u201dAnalysts over at Deutsche Bank think so.

The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9 percent.Another uptick in interest rates also seemed to dampen what had started out as a relatively decent day for stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.84 percent after lackluster demand in an auction of $24 billion worth of the benchmark government bonds. Yields on 10-year Treasuries, which serve as the foundation for a range of consumer borrowing rates, are near their highest levels since January 2014.The steady climb in interest rates has gained pace in 2018. And it has become a concern for investors who believe the low interest rates since the financial crisis have been a cornerstone of the long bull market for stocks. Interest rates on shorter-term Treasury bonds, such as the two-year note, have also risen sharply.Those shorter-term bond yields tend to be sensitive to changing expectations surrounding monetary policy, another source of worry in recent days.Those developments, on their face, should not be bad signs for the consumption-heavy American economy. But some economists consider wage growth an indication that inflation could rise. And investors took the wage data as a reason to worry that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than policymakers had previously suggested.Stocks fell sharply when the January jobs report was issued on Friday. The sell-off gathered force on Monday when the S.&P. 500 fell 4.1 percent, its biggest single-day drop since August 2011. The sell-off briefly spread through global markets. But a solid performance by markets in the United States on Tuesday seemed to cool the fire.\u201cWe have so much good (great) news about the economy!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.The American economy does indeed appear to have significant momentum. At 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate is low. And the gross domestic product grew at an annual clip of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter. Recent corporate earnings reports have been solid, with several companies outlining plans to increase investment, in part because of the tax code overhaul that became law in December.Industrial companies are also piggybacking on that economic strength both in the United States and abroad.Ball Corporation, a maker of metal packaging like beer cans, was one of the best-performing stocks in the S.&P. 500 on Wednesday. Shares in Ball, which has plants around the world, rose sharply after the company reported favorable earnings results and cited momentum in its business supplying the aerospace industry. Other large industrial companies, such as Boeing, also rose, helping to lift indexes.\u201cAs we look forward, the market drivers of better economic prospects and higher profits have not changed at all,\u201d Steven M. Duryee, a portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley\u2019s Bergman Continuum Group, a wealth management firm, said in an email to clients.An earlier version of this article misstated when stock markets on Wall Street recovered following recent sell-offs. The markets rose on Tuesday, not Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican Fiscal Stimulus Could Be Bigger Than Obama\u2019s", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are pouring government stimulus into a steadily strengthening economy, adding economic fuel at a moment when unemployment is at a 16-year low and wages are beginning to rise, a combination that is stoking fears of higher inflation and ballooning budget deficits.The question is how much added fuel is good for the economy.The added stimulus is drawing some quiet cheers from liberal economists, who say a fiscal shot at a time of low unemployment could boost typical workers\u2019 wages in ways unseen for two decades. But it is raising alarms among fiscal hawks.\u201cThis is exactly the wrong fiscal policy at the wrong time,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cWe should be bringing down the debt and ensuring we have room for stimulus during downturns. Instead we are overheating the economy and selling out the future. It\u2019s shortsighted and foolhardy.\u201dThe threat of rate increases is a major reason some economists, including those at the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, project only a modest boost in economic growth from the tax law over the next decade.The tax cuts and spending increases could add up to more than $800 billion in additional federal deficits over the course of 2018 and 2019. Analysts project they will hasten the return of trillion-dollar annual budget deficits, and set the United States apart from other industrialized economies, which have reined in their fiscal expansions as growth picks up.\u201cIn a world of deficit discipline,\u201d Ethan S. Harris, the head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research note on Tuesday, \u201cthe U.S. stands out in terms of its deteriorating deficit.\u201dThe Republican tax law\u2019s $1.5 trillion deficit-financed price tag over the next decade is front-loaded. It will reduce federal revenue by $416 billion over this year and next, before accounting for additional economic growth, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. Many corporations are showing evidence of that in their quarterly earnings releases, as companies like JPMorgan Chase & Company and Verizon project billions of dollars in tax savings in 2018.Administration officials say the law will spark enough growth to pay for itself, a claim that no rigorous outside analysis supports. They also say the cuts will not stoke inflation, because they will increase the supply of capital in the economy and boost productivity.The likely spending increases include money for the military, domestic programs and disaster aid, along with a plan to shore up faltering multiemployer pension plans. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that those increases will cost more than $500 billion, and that congressional negotiators are mulling roughly $100 billion in revenue increases to offset them, yielding a deficit increase of $400 billion.Those figures do not include any potential deficit spending from an infrastructure bill, which the White House hopes to push Congress to approve this year.The 2009 stimulus package was passed when the unemployment rate was almost twice as high as it is today, and the national debt was half what it is now. At that time, Republicans called it a dangerous borrowing spree. \u201cThis bill sends us on a worldwide borrowing binge,\u201d Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, now the House speaker, said in a floor debate in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go out and borrow four times as much money this year than we ever have in the history of this country in a single year. This is not just a road to stagnation, it is a road to stagflation.\u201dFiscal hawks say that assessment is more applicable to the economy today.\u201cWe have a growing economy, the labor market\u2019s tight, we don\u2019t have a lot of idle resources,\u201d said Matthew Mitchell, the director of the Project for the Study of American Capitalism at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \u201cBasically, the very best argument for Keynesian economics doesn\u2019t apply now. So it really is the time to be austere.\u201dWhile divided government in the last six years of Mr. Obama\u2019s term produced constraints on spending, Mr. Mitchell noted, Republican control under Mr. Trump appears to be ripping them up. Democrats are helping to do that on the spending side. The spending agreements pending in Congress appear to be so large, in part, because Democrats have demanded domestic discretionary spending increases alongside large increases in military spending pushed by Republican defense hawks.Democrats largely denounce Republicans for playing down deficit concerns now, after years of warning that government borrowing was holding the economy back. \u201cThere was a far greater need for economic stimulus in 2011 than today,\u201d said Neera Tanden, a former Obama adviser who is the president and chief executive of the Center for American Progress think tank.But some liberals welcome the extra fiscal juice and its potential to help workers who struggled in the slow-growth years after the recession.Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was one of the Obama administration\u2019s stimulus architects in 2009, opposed the Trump tax bill but supports efforts to stimulate the economy when unemployment is low, in hopes of boosting wage growth.\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of recklessness of Team Trump that could kind of rebound to the benefit of people,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said in an interview, before alluding to the possibility that there are still workers outside the labor force who could be drawn back to work by a hotter economy.\u201cAs long as there is still slack in corners of the labor market,\u201d he said, \u201cthen this kind of fiscal stimulus of the economy near full employment is a kind of test I support.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The White House Is Very Optimistic on Growth. It Shouldn\u2019t Be.", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaking its forecast come true would require productivity improvements not seen in decades and an atypical policy on interest rates.President Trump has been nothing if not bold in his promises to generate supercharged economic growth.Even if you treat those musings as presidential bombast, his administration is making detailed projections that the economy will expand much faster in the decade ahead than it has in recent years \u2014 a forecast that underpins the Trump policy agenda.The administration forecasts growth in the neighborhood of 3 percent through the next decade, compared with around 2 percent projected by private forecasters and the economists at the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve. If the administration\u2019s forecast comes true, it will imply an economy 12 percent bigger in 2028 than that projected by the more cautious forecasts \u2014 an extra $2.8 trillion in economic activity that year, in today\u2019s dollars.To understand some of the Trump administration\u2019s buoyant assumptions and the apparent contradictions buried within them, it helps to go step by step on where economic growth comes from and how it relates to interest rates, employment and inflation.Think of the simplest arithmetic on how a single company can produce more goods and services. There are three ways:Workers can put in more hours of labor. If the company hires more people, or has current workers do longer shifts, it can increase production.The business can invest in more capital to make workers more effective. The latest equipment or software can mean each hour of labor creates more stuff.The business can adjust its management techniques and how it operates to try to get more productivity out of the same workers and equipment.The same idea applies to the economy as a whole. Growth comes from either more hours being worked, or more capital for each worker, or the third, which is called \u201ctotal factor productivity.\u201dThe Trump administration leans heavily on the second of these \u2014 more capital \u2014 as justification for its optimism. With lower taxes on business, as well as regulatory policies that are more favorable to capital, the budget statement says, it will unleash \u201cgrowth-enhancing policies\u201d in terms of more capital in the economy per worker.It is indeed plausible that these policies will encourage more capital investment in the next few years, said Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, with higher productivity growth as a consequence.But that should be a one-time adjustment, after businesses increase their capital stock in response to more favorable policies. Once that process is complete and has resulted in higher productivity, there\u2019s no reason to think that capital investment would keep rising as a share of the economy.In other words, the benefits in terms of productivity growth and economic growth should fade over time, which the administration acknowledges. Some private economists are not persuaded these effects are powerful enough to account for continued strong growth a decade from now. \u201cI try to fit these numbers into a mainstream paradigm and I can\u2019t make them fit,\u201d Mr. Prakken said.But even if higher capital investment can\u2019t do all the lifting of generating 3 percent growth, there remain those other two possibilities, of hours worked or total factor productivity, that could help achieve the 3 percent growth forecast even after the lift from tax cuts and capital investment fades.But demographic trends are putting a lid on potential growth from more hours of work. The retirement of the baby boomers and stabilization of the proportion of women in the work force mean that potential hours worked will rise only 0.4 percent a year in the coming decade, according to the C.B.O.\u2019s forecast (compared with 1.3 percent a year from 1950 to 2016).Moreover, the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, if anything, would tilt that number in a negative direction, as deportations, tighter border security and more restrictive issuance of work visas reduces the potential supply of labor.Ms. Nordquist argued that Trump administration policies would help increase the labor force, and hence growth potential.\u201cWe think that labor force participation has dropped in the past decade in part because of government policies that discourage work,\u201d said Ms. Nordquist, including growth in Social Security disability insurance and the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere is much room for the Trump administration to improve on those policies, for example through marginal individual income tax rate cuts,\u201d citing evidence that older, near-retirement workers may be more likely to work when taxes are lower.Then there\u2019s total factor productivity, the black-box driver of growth. Economists don\u2019t really understand it, and calculate it only as a residual \u2014 it is the number left over after calculating how much a rise in output comes from more hours worked or more capital.Suppose the Trump administration\u2019s growth forecast really does materialize: Tax cuts and deregulation fuel productivity-enhancing capital spending; some good fortune arises in terms of the labor force and total factor productivity; and economic growth returns to its pre-2000 norm of around 3 percent. That would be positive news for the economy. But it also would be likely to have other effects, particularly on interest rates.Over time, interest rates tend to move in tandem with the nominal growth rate. Part of the reason interest rates have fallen sharply in the last decade is that low growth has translated into what economists call a low \u201cnatural rate\u201d of interest and low inflation levels.But the Trump administration projects similar interest rates to those envisioned by more cautious forecasters, despite projecting higher growth. It implies something of an immaculate expansion: returning to pre-2000 growth rates without also returning to pre-2000 interest rates.In the 1990s, for example, G.D.P. growth averaged 3.3 percent per year, and the 10-year Treasury bond yield averaged 6.7 percent. The administration projects economic growth nearly that strong, but rates peaking at 3.7 percent.But in addition to that, he argues, the economy will be at risk of overheating. He sees inflation rising to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent by late 2019, which could send long-term Treasury bond yields up to 5 percent, well above the 2.9 percent today and the 3.1 percent the administration forecasts for 2019.\u201cAt some point inflation gets high enough, and the market takes interest rates up,\u201d said Mr. Sinai, the chief economist at Decision Economics. And higher rates, it\u2019s worth adding, would raise the cost for the government to service the national debt, in turn making deficits higher.Ms. Nordquist notes that the forecasts published Monday were developed in November, when interest rates were lower than they are now. \u201cIf we were to redo the interest rate forecast today, we would project higher rates,\u201d she said.Have some sympathy for those who build these forecasts. Predicting anything 10 years in advance is inherently hard, and no forecast is ever perfectly correct. As the last 10 years show, there is a lot that is just unknowable about the forces that will buffet the economy.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the gender of DJ Nordquist, the chief of staff of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

{"Headline": "Why Markets Have Gotten So Jumpy ", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo understand the wild swings on Wall Street, consider a farm town, a long drought and the cost of flood insurance.To understand why global financial markets have been so volatile the last few weeks, imagine a town full of farmers who have been living through a decade-long drought. The first few years of the drought, they probably adapted by shifting to crops that could grow without much water, but at the same time they probably kept renewing their flood insurance. After all, the drought could end at any time, and losses caused by too much water are every bit as painful as those caused by too little.But after years and years of writing checks for flood insurance, our farmers might get a little tired of throwing money away to protect against a risk that never seems to materialize. By the seventh or eighth year of the drought, they might just say \u201cforget it\u201d and let flood insurance lapse.Then, with the 10-year mark approaching, it rains. Not very hard: Imagine a perfectly normal rainstorm by pre-drought standards, not enough to cause a flood, but enough to make the farmers think flooding just might be a possibility again.What would the farmers do? There\u2019s a good chance that they would call their insurance broker and very quickly, even desperately, sign up for flood insurance once again.And that helps explain why the markets have been so topsy-turvy of late.Rain, in this metaphor, is inflation \u2014 and the decade-long drought is the near-decade that global inflation and interest rates have been persistently low.When you pick apart the shifts in the financial markets, they are consistent with the idea that investors are not yet betting on an inflationary flood but are opening their minds to the idea that it could happen.For example, by comparing the prices of regular Treasury bonds with inflation-protected bonds, you can get a sense of how worried investors are about inflation. On Dec. 1, those prices were such that an investor would break even if from five to 10 years in the future \u2014 December 2022 through December 2027 \u2014 consumer prices rose 1.78 percent a year.That has now risen to 2.21 percent, which is quite a large swing by the standards of the generally staid bond market.This framework also helps explain why there have been such big swings in financial markets lately.And the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 has moved more than 1 percent on eight of 16 trading days in February thus far, which doesn\u2019t make much sense if you\u2019re looking for fundamentals-based reasons for such big moves in stock prices. It makes more sense if you believe that investors are trying to extrapolate from tiny fragments of information the potential risk of a radically different economic and financial market environment in the years ahead.The swings in stock prices appear to be intimately linked to movement in long-term interest rates, which in turn hinges on those expectations of inflation and how the Federal Reserve will respond if inflation does rise.On Wednesday, for example, the stock market had been on track for a sharply positive day until the Fed released minutes of its last policy meeting at 2 p.m. Soon after, the stock market plunged and bond yields rose, as investors evidently concluded that the Fed was inclined toward a somewhat faster rate of interest rate increases than had been assumed.But you can also interpret swings like that one as a result of investors trying to draw big conclusions about the economic future from incremental pieces of information.In December, Fed officials projected that the main interest rate the central bank targets would be 2.8 percent in the longer run. But when it first started publishing its consensus of that number, in June 2015, it was 3.8 percent. If the economy evolves in a direction that causes the earlier estimate to prove more accurate, it implies that a wide range of assets are priced incorrectly (in particular, it would mean that prices for long-term bonds should be a lot lower and their yields higher). So as long as this pattern continues, you can interpret every day\u2019s economic news and market swings as a referendum on which state of the world is more likely. Are we still in the world of 2009 to 2017, in which inflation and interest rates stayed low and asset prices continued their steady rise? Or are we returning to the pre-2008 levels of each, a possibility that is perhaps less probable but would be hugely consequential if it happens?If that world does arrive, the people who re-upped their flood insurance at the first sign of rain will be glad they did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bonuses and Bogosity", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Feb. 19 Walmart, America\u2019s largest employer, announced broad-based pay hikes. In fact, it announced that it would be raising wages for half a million workers. The Trump tax cut is working!Why did Walmart raise wages? Partly because the labor market was tightening: unemployment had fallen more than 40 percent from its peak in 2009 (a decline for which the Obama administration\u2019s stimulus and other policies actually do deserve some credit.) This tightening labor market meant that Walmart was having trouble attracting workers.Walmart was also in the midst of a change in business strategy. Its policy of always low wages, always, was starting to look problematic: low pay meant high turnover and low morale, and management believed that moving at least partway to the Costco strategy of paying more and getting better performance as a result made sense.The moral of this story is that unless the economy is deeply depressed, there will always be some companies, somewhere, raising wages and offering bonuses. Which brings me to the Trump tax cut and the very bad, no good job much of the media initially did of covering its effects.Yet for a while there the news was full of stories about companies announcing that they were giving their workers bonuses thanks to the Trump tax cut. Why were they doing this?Well, the tax cut provided no immediate incentive to raise wages. It did, however, give companies that benefited from the tax cut a strong political incentive to claim that the tax break was the reason for bonuses or wage hikes they would have given in any case. Why not? They want the tax cut to look good, since it\u2019s good for them. And hyping its benefits is a cheap way to make a de facto campaign contribution to an administration that can do a lot to help companies it likes, say by removing pesky safety or environmental regulations.In other words, the whole \u201cbonuses thanks to tax cut\u201d story was bogus, and obviously so. Yet much of the media fell for it.Furthermore, the surge in stock buybacks suggests that the long run effect of the tax cut on wages will be small. Remember that the chain that should lead to trickle-down begins with lower taxes -> higher investment. If companies use the cuts to buy back stocks, not add to plant and equipment, the wage-growth story doesn\u2019t even get started.So the real news about the tax cut is that it is \u2013 I know you\u2019ll be shocked \u2013 mainly a giveaway to corporations. Who could have predicted?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kengo Kuma\u2019s Architecture of the Future", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRejecting flashy forms in favor of buildings in harmony with their environment, the architect \u2014 poised to become world famous for his stadium for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo \u2014 is trying to reinvent his entire trade.At 63 and admired in Japan, he is now poised to achieve international renown, despite having built comparatively little abroad, and having repeatedly written that he wants to \u201cerase\u201d his trade, to create a \u201cdefeated architecture.\u201d His potential status as a globally known architect may hinge on one building alone, one that, given what sparked his interest in his craft, seems almost fated: the National Stadium for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, the site of which is about a mile from Tange\u2019s masterpiece. It will also be his least characteristic work, and will arrive trailing controversy. The earlier winning design by the late Zaha Hadid \u2014 which resembled something between an enormous, sleek bicycle helmet and a manta ray \u2014 was the object of criticism by dozens of Japanese architects, including Pritzker Prize-winner Fumihiko Maki and the prominent Japanese postmodernist architect Arata Isozaki. The latter charged in a letter to the Japan Sports Council that the revised building was a \u201cmonumental mistake\u201d that would be \u201ca disgrace to future generations,\u201d memorably describing it as a \u201cdull, slow form, like a turtle waiting for Japan to sink so that it can swim away.\u201d (Hadid, still alive at the time, responded that these detractors were angry that a Japanese architect had not been chosen.) Kuma was a signatory to a petition Maki and other architects circulated protesting its selection, and in 2015 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe canceled the commission, citing skyrocketing costs. A hasty contest was arranged, and Kuma\u2019s proposal was selected.And yet he betrayed ambivalence about the project, complaining about how the Olympics may be driving up construction costs throughout the country, which especially hurt rural areas where Kuma has built some of his most important structures. Kuma \u2014 not otherwise averse to taking digs at other architects \u2014 said that, besides signing the petition, he had resisted openly criticizing Hadid\u2019s scheme at the time. The stadium site is in one of Tokyo\u2019s few notable greenbelts, a park filled with ginkgo trees erected in the early 1900s to commemorate Emperor Meiji, and it happens to be on Kuma\u2019s regular 30-minute commute between his home in the more traditional Kagurazaka district and his office in the fashionable Minami-Aoyama neighborhood. \u201cI know that area very well,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly noting that Hadid\u2019s scheme simply \u201cwould not fit.\u201d \u201cI go by it every day,\u201d he said, as if that alone was the reason he was building the stadium.Though the resulting plan is inevitably a compromise among a number of demanding parties \u2014 Taisei Corporation (a construction company), Azusa Sekkei Co. (a design firm) and the government of Japan itself \u2014 it is, like much of Kuma\u2019s work, rather simple in its initial impression and as unobtrusive as a massive stadium can be. Multitiered but relatively squat (at under 50 meters high, it is one-third lower than Hadid\u2019s design), its roof unpeels to reveal a latticed wood framework. Renderings show the concourses dotted with trees, and the entire complex is hugged by parkland, pointedly emphasizing its relationship with the natural landscape. The building\u2019s 2,000 cubic meters of cedar and larch are supposed to come from every prefecture in Japan (though recently, there have been protests about a subcontractor\u2019s alleged contribution to deforestation in Borneo). It is, though not explicitly intended as such, a diametric statement against futuristic and self-aggrandizing designs like Hadid\u2019s \u2014 and perhaps futuristic and self-aggrandizing architecture in general. Kuma\u2019s luminous, spare, predominantly wood-hewn buildings often look out of place among the stark shapes that fill architecture magazines and journals. His is an architecture that seems at first glance to exude tradition and \u201cJapan-ness,\u201d but it turns out to be one of allusions, tricks of the eye and uncertain thresholds and limits. Surfaces mislead and deceive; materials are returned to again and again, like an obsession; the gestures to high Modernism are rejected, reassumed and renewed. Kuma, a constant source of paradoxes and ironies, often makes demagogic statements on behalf of his own brand of architectural modesty. \u201cI want to change the definition of architecture,\u201d he told me; in a way, he already has.BY ITS NATURE, wood does not lend itself to spectacle. A common material in Japanese traditional architecture until the firebombing of World War II (which is to say, about 10 years before Kuma was born), it weathers easily and visibly, requires constant attention and replacement and exudes impermanence, fragility and modesty. Kuma gravitates toward it relentlessly, appropriate for someone who told me that \u201carchitects should be very shy, everywhere.\u201dKuma\u2019s pleas for shyness derive from a complex resistance to the profession he decided he wanted to enter some 50 years ago. He began his training as a proverbial angry young man, more inclined to define himself against trends, to say \u201cno\u201d rather than to determine what he wanted. Though visiting Tange\u2019s gymnasium was formative, he had soured on Japanese Modernism by the time he was 16, in 1970. That year, Kuma attended the Expo \u201970 in Osaka, where Tange and his \u201cMetabolist\u201d associates Kisho Kurokawa and Kiyonori Kikutake had displayed some of the most outlandish and eye-popping structures in the history of architecture. The Metabolists had emerged in the 1960s as the vanguard of Japanese Modernism \u2014 their name was meant to imply a flexible architecture that had a cellular, metabolic relationship to the growing city \u2014 and they produced a number of spectacular plans and futuristic visions that extended the programs of European Modernism into the realm of the fantastic: cities floating in the sea or houses vaulted into the sky. At Osaka, however, Kuma saw only exhaustion: The architects he admired were exclusively interested in producing fantastic forms, completely divorced from their environment or human needs.Kuma found a more copacetic model for his developing interests in architecture school in the late 1970s and early 1980s, where he studied with Hiroshi Hara. The renowned theorist took Kuma and his other students on a two-month trip through the Sahel, where they visited and documented village structures of nomadic peoples. With no knowledge of the relevant languages, let alone the customs, they had to learn to manage in harsh conditions, and explain their curious interests with a flurry of exaggerated gestures and a mixture of English and French. This experience with impermanent, modest dwellings, as well as the travel through unfamiliar rural areas, gave Kuma skills and confidence that he would later use in the countryside of Japan. (A recent guide to the architecture of Japan lists over 30 major projects by Kuma\u2019s offices, though his own website points to dozens more.)When Kuma arrived for a yearlong fellowship at Columbia University in 1985, he was in the midst of a transitional period both in architecture and in the economic history of his country. The high tide of architectural postmodernism was cresting, just as the economies of both the U.S. and Japan were entering a period of historic growth. That year, West German, French, British, American and Japanese officials signed a treaty known as the Plaza Accord, designed to coerce the United States into devaluing its currency, thereby limiting Japanese exports \u2014 cars and electronics \u2014 that had flooded U.S. markets and driven many Americans into an existential panic over their country\u2019s declining power. The immediate result was to give Japanese consumers a newly strong yen and, after the Bank of Japan lowered official interest rates, to overheat the domestic market. From 1985 to 1990, an enormous stock market bubble swelled. And it wasn\u2019t just bankers and salarymen who made fortunes. The result in architectural terms was an explosion of construction throughout the country, and a seemingly unending stream of commissions for any architect who wanted them.Various external forces coincided to make Kuma\u2019s flirtation with monumental excrescences an abortive one. Around the time that he was finishing M2, Kuma received a phone call related to some of the construction details on the building. Picking up the receiver with his left hand, he put his right hand \u2014 his drawing hand \u2014 down on a nearby glass table to balance himself, and the table shattered beneath him. The nerves and veins in his wrist were severed and the bone exposed. The injury he sustained to his hand was permanent. He lost his ability to draw in detail or fasten a button (Kuma\u2019s habitual uniform now is a suit with a T-shirt), and \u2014 as is perhaps typical of near-death experiences \u2014 he was at once shaken and, by his own account, liberated by the experience. Another paradoxical liberation came the following year, when the Japanese economic bubble burst. For an entire decade \u2014 known proverbially as Japan\u2019s lost decade, due to its persistently and irremediably sluggish growth, and intermittent years of recession \u2014 commissions in Tokyo completely dried up. Kuma was forced into a period of necessary reflection, and out of it he developed the practice and thought that would come to define his career.During his years in Yusuhara, Kuma was theorizing his own work with some frequency, and his substantial body of writing reveals a repeated turning over of the same ideas and experiences, much as he constantly comes back to wood to see what else it can accomplish. Above all, Kuma is drawn to a vision of architecture that he has variously called \u201cdefeated architecture,\u201d \u201csmall architecture\u201d or \u201canti-object\u201d architecture. It is a story of returning to the values of traditional Japanese architecture through the work of modern architects who admire them, as well as the rather simple idea \u2014 however sometimes tortuously expressed by Kuma via detours into Western philosophy and critical theory \u2014 that architecture should cease to force itself onto a landscape and should instead, through acquaintance with local materials and methods, relate itself harmoniously to its surroundings.Presented as an argument with the traditions of Modernism and postmodernism, it is also an argument Kuma has been conducting with his forbears and his peers about the function of architecture, part of a longstanding debate about what is \u201cJapanese\u201d in the art. Some of the most enduring monuments to international Modernism, especially in their use of concrete, are in Japan, perhaps the only Asian country to have embraced, so fully and ardently, the movement descended from Le Corbusier and the Bauhaus. Partly this is a result of the war: American firebombing decimated Japan\u2019s wooden cities, and after that, the government limited wood as a building material in cities like Tokyo. Breakneck development since then had by the 1970s turned Japan into the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and its exuberance for Modernist architecture exemplified this growing national self-confidence like nothing else. But as with many modernizing movements in Japan, there was always dissonance. Weren\u2019t these massive concrete forms, these spectacular metropolises, foreign to the humble wood architecture that Japan had always cultivated? Complicating matters was the fact that Modernist architects themselves \u2014 from Bruno Taut to Richard Neutra to Frank Lloyd Wright \u2014 had been greatly influenced by prewar, traditional Japanese architecture.Kuma was not the first to grapple with these questions. Kunio Maekawa, an acolyte of Le Corbusier, evoked the Japanese vernacular in concrete and used wood paneling throughout his buildings; decades later, Arata Isozaki alluded to the catastrophe of the American bombing campaign in buildings that resembled shards of ruins, reflecting on the problem of how Japan expresses its identity through its buildings in his essay \u201c1960 Blue Sky of Surrender Day: Space of Darkness.\u201d But among them, Kuma\u2019s solution \u2014 to focus obsessively on local materials, and to build with those materials, at the expense of the overall form \u2014 may be the most distinctive. He concentrates not on the formal aspect of his buildings, but on the immediate experience they provide \u2014 on surfaces, effects and moods \u2014 all at the risk of producing structures that photograph poorly, or seem modest. Besides his evocation of Japanese forms and materials, it is precisely all the modern obsessions that he ignores \u2014 sleek designs, a privileging of style over function \u2014 that signify what is traditionally \u201cJapanese\u201d in his architecture. Small architecture is not his only mode, but it is the most natural expression of his approach, and a testament to how much he fights against other architects in his work.AMONG ALL THE arts, architecture is perhaps the most susceptible to the vicissitudes of the economy, its health uniquely dependent on the confidence of actors far outside the architect\u2019s control: real estate investors, construction companies and corporate clients, to say nothing of interest rates set by central banks. A skyline registers with unusual acuity the history of boom-and-bust, and, with some allowance made for the delay in which buildings actually get completed, architectural fashions often swell and decline along with those same cycles. For the decades that followed the postwar era, the Modernism of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe dominated cities and even small towns across the world. But the recessions of the 1970s dented the era\u2019s confidence, and subsequently a knowing, sophisticated, and \u2014 at least in its initial phase \u2014 deferential postmodernism took hold. By the 2000s, the deference was gone, and a slick, glass-and-metal neo-modernism \u2014 exemplified particularly by Gehry, Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and Sir Norman Foster \u2014 set the tone for much architecture up until the financial crisis of 2008. Despite the ethereal condominium towers sprouting up over the global capitals of the world, there is no question that the Great Recession once again dimmed the profession\u2019s intellectual hubris, and the last eight or so years have been a kind of interregnum. Call it \u201cafter architecture\u201d: a period of still-unfinished searching for a new mode, ethical and stylistic, by its most thoughtful practitioners.Kuma\u2019s particular version of this search seems to have preceded that of most of his international peers, and unlike them he seems to have found a solution. This is partly because of the early collapse of the Japanese economy \u2014 the trauma of the 1990 bubble bursting was harsher for the country than even the effects of the 2008 worldwide crash. No longer would it be assumed, as was common in the 1980s, that Japan would become the world\u2019s biggest economy. Indeed, the country has never truly recovered \u2014 not financially, and, just as significantly, not psychically as well \u2014 and the need to find an architecture appropriate to a sobered world of vastly diminished expectations, one aware of the costs of imposing endless development and construction on an unresilient planet, became more urgent here than it did elsewhere \u2014 at least, it certainly did for Kuma.It is nonetheless hard to keep in mind Kuma\u2019s self-addressed injunction to \u201cerase\u201d architecture when viewing his Wooden Bridge Museum, his most recently completed work in Yusuhara. Technically a functional design to integrate Kuma\u2019s earlier hotel with a local bathhouse, the resulting structure is much greater than its ostensibly simple purpose. The gallery rises up several stories and is supported by a single strong central pillar. But most of the gallery\u2019s weight is cantilevered off the hillside thanks to another traditional Japanese beam technique, in which small cross sections of modern laminated veneer lumber are stacked one on top of another, at perpendicular angles, creating a luminous, exhilarating sense of infinity. The effect is less of a craft being renewed than an abstract monument to that craft, and to an architect, too. Despite Kuma\u2019s professed desire to distance himself from his forebears, it clearly resembles Arata Isozaki\u2019s famous but unrealized \u201cClusters in the Air\u201d (1960-62), a plan for housing projects in Tokyo, in which a single pillar supports capsule-like apartments, piled one above the other, like Kuma\u2019s beams. Kuma\u2019s rejoinder might be that his own plan represents the local traditions and materials of the surrounding region, rather than a fanciful object alien to the landscape. But the unmistakable reference suggests that Kuma has never quite abandoned his old combativeness.\u201cArchitecture should go back to fabrication, to using real materials, to using the hand,\u201d he told me. \u201cBefore industrialization, most of the world had that system.\u201d As with many of Kuma\u2019s programmatic statements, this is a principle or self-description designed to be betrayed. Though fond of traditional materials, he is not a fetishist, and seems just as interested in using computational design to create new effects. Later, he took me to the materials room of his lab at Tokyo University, where his students were using computers to come up with new uses for strange materials. All around me were truly bizarre, organic, basketlike shapes. Kuma fingered a loose, perforated canopy strung up by one of his students and discussed it briefly with him. It turned out to be made of coir, the threadlike skin of aging coconut husks. Was this a traditional building material, I asked him? \u201cNo!\u201d he laughed. \u201cAbsolutely not. No one has ever used it.\u201d But, after all, he seemed to be saying, \u201cwhy not?\u201dKUMA LOVES SPEAKING to craftsmen, who help him discover the possibilities inherent in traditional paper, or the soft oya stone that Frank Lloyd Wright also loved and used in his (long demolished) 1923 Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. But Kuma\u2019s use of these materials is also social, and is intended as a social criticism. For him, the Japan of the economic miracle, which built itself up on masses of concrete, long ago lost its way. Finding one\u2019s way back to the techniques that predated modernization can also point the way to a different economic framework. \u201cWe have to create that new system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe architect can show the system of the society.\u201d Show people what they build, he implied, and I will show you who they are.That Kuma continues to work in rural areas is unusual for an architect of his stature \u2014 he is also involved in master planning Minamisanriku\u2019s rebuilding efforts \u2014 but that does not minimize the fact that his practice has gone well beyond the \u201cdefeated\u201d architecture that he once called for. Kengo Kuma and Associates is now a global firm with 200 employees, and like most architecture practices, they accept commissions for, and compete for bids on, enormous condominium towers and luxury hotels. Michael Sypkens, a Dutch-Japanese architect and former employee who left in September to start his own practice, spoke fondly of Kuma\u2019s work, and his success in turning Japanese architecture away from form to details. \u201cJapanese space has always been about creating illusions, trying to make things appear more than they are,\u201d he told me. In his recapture of traditional techniques, \u201cKuma-san was trying to create that mood, that atmosphere. ... He\u2019s doing his best to make buildings disappear, or make buildings about small things.\u201d But he seemed to brood over the fact that Kuma had taken on too many projects from big developers, losing sight of that initial impulse. Regarding the National Stadium project, he admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s particularly proud of it in the office.\u201dWhether Kuma can successfully translate his rural and minute designs to a global stage remains to be seen. For now, Minamisanriku might be the purest distillation of Kuma\u2019s practice, and in October I visited there with one of Kuma\u2019s associates. The town was ablaze with construction: The banks of the river leading in from the menacing coast were being raised, and the river bed itself overlaid with concrete. With his predilection for small towns and their operation, Kuma had been one of the first architects to help Minamisanriku. He had erected a central market, entirely out of cedar. By no means a great building, it was nonetheless an elegant and thoughtful one: Its infinity of wood slats evoked, yet again, Kuma\u2019s love of louvers, but also the fragility of the structure and the town itself, now being rebuilt on higher ground. Viewed from the coast, it was neither self-erasing nor defeated. It was like a warm beacon in an otherwise dark, haunted place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Heir Freed, to Dismay of South Korea\u2019s Anti-Corruption Campaigners", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 When Lee Jae-yong, the de facto leader of Samsung, walked free on Monday after spending barely a year in jail, it reaffirmed a pattern South Koreans have fought for decades to break: Business tycoons convicted of corruption here hardly spend any time behind bars.So when an appeals court freed Mr. Lee, 49, on Monday by reducing his prison term to two and a half years and then suspending it, the scene was dishearteningly familiar for many.That led to criticism that the conglomerates were too powerful to tame \u2014 a problem President Moon Jae-in repeatedly decried when he rode waves of popular discontent to win an election in May to replace Ms. Park.\u201cThis is a critical setback for the country,\u201d said Jun Sung-in, an economist at Hongik University in Seoul. \u201cThis case once again shows why the South Korean judiciary does not have the people\u2019s trust when it comes to cases involving chaebol chieftains.\u201dSamsung is arguably South Korea\u2019s brightest corporate success story, as the country transformed from a war-torn agrarian economy into a global export powerhouse.In the span of a few decades, the company, once a copycat manufacturer of clunky television sets, surpassed Sony and other global giants in value and reach, offering high-end smartphones, computer chips and flat-panel TVs. It is the biggest and most lucrative of a handful of chaebol conglomerates that dominate South Korea\u2019s economy.But it is not universally beloved. At home, Samsung is often seen as a menace with unbridled power. Mr. Lee \u2014 known as Jay Y. Lee in the West \u2014 is a third-generation tycoon whose qualifications as a top manager are regarded with skepticism, if not downright scorn. Unlike their fathers and grandfathers, this latest set of business leaders stand accused of inheriting management control and wealth through opaque bookkeeping and questionable trading among subsidiaries.Mr. Lee\u2019s supporters say he has been made a scapegoat for politically motivated prosecutors. They accused the authorities of pandering to widespread anti-chaebol sentiments and building their case against Mr. Lee with little evidence.Prosecutors had originally indicted Mr. Lee on charges of giving or promising $27 million in bribes to foundations and business entities controlled by Choi Soon-sil, a longtime confidante of Ms. Park, to win Ms. Park\u2019s support for strengthening his control of Samsung, which he is inheriting from his ailing father.But the lower-court ruling recognized only about $8 million as bribes. In Monday\u2019s ruling, the size was reduced further to $3.3 million. Park Young-soo, the special prosecutor investigating the case, said his team would appeal to the Supreme Court.The latest ruling was closely monitored because it could also affect Ms. Park, whose corruption trial is still underway.Mr. Lee\u2019s lawyers acknowledged the payments but argued that Samsung did not receive any favors or special treatment in return. Instead, Mr. Lee said he was a victim of Ms. Park\u2019s extortion \u2014 an argument Justice Chung Hyong-sik sided with, to a degree, in his appeals court ruling.\u201cThis is a case where President Park intimidated the management of Samsung,\u201d Mr. Chung said, calling Mr. Lee a \u201cpassive\u201d provider of bribes.Shortly afterward, Mr. Lee emerged from prison a free man.\u201cI want to say once again how sorry I am that I have failed to present a good image of myself,\u201d Mr. Lee told reporters. \u201cThe past year has been a valuable time for me to reflect.\u201dPro-business groups, investors and conservative politicians welcomed the verdict.\u201cIn a time of worsening business environments, incarcerating businessmen for a long time does tremendous damage not only to their companies but also to the national economy,\u201d said Kim Kyong-man, an executive at the Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business.The jewel of the Samsung group\u2019s empire, Samsung Electronics, grew into a global force by identifying and getting ahead of big shifts in technology. It charged into the semiconductor business, for instance, when the company was still known as an assembler of cut-price TVs. The company also began focusing on slick, astutely marketed consumer products just as public enthusiasm for gadgets started ramping up in the 2000s.Today, the semiconductor business accounts for the bulk of the company\u2019s profit and, with demand for powerful servers and data centers continuing to rise worldwide, it is expected to continue to rake in money. Samsung is also the world\u2019s largest seller of smartphones.Credit for those successes, however, goes largely to Mr. Lee\u2019s grandfather and father. Industry observers have long questioned whether the Harvard-educated Mr. Lee, who had not been known for running a business by himself before he was thrust into his present role, can safeguard the company\u2019s success.But he stepped down the next year to develop new businesses in emerging markets. He then served as Samsung\u2019s president and chief operating officer, before becoming vice chairman in 2012.More recently, Mr. Lee has shown greater initiative in steering Samsung toward the technologies of tomorrow.\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a huge threat,\u201d said Nam Lee, a professor at Chung-Ang University in Seoul. \u201cIt\u2019s not imminent, I would say. But nobody can guarantee the future.\u201dThat means Samsung could still use a far-thinking leader to chart out the company\u2019s next strategic moves.\u201cOne thing is very clear,\u201d Professor Lee said, \u201cJ. Y. Lee has not proven if he\u2019s the one.\u201dChoe Sang-hun reported from Seoul, and Raymond Zhong from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Wants to Aid Only \u2018America\u2019s Friends.\u2019 If Only It Were That Easy.", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Distinguishing friends from enemies can be difficult. Sometimes friends disagree, and even enemies will occasionally do things for you that friends will not.Threats to cut American foreign aid have long been a talking point, particularly among Republicans trying to stir their base by tapping a popular, if inaccurate, perception that the money sent abroad is vast.Previous presidents have threatened to cut foreign aid, too, often to punish countries for violating human rights. Mr. Trump appears more motivated by the notion that the United States gets little in return.Whether or not Congress actually follows through, the president\u2019s warning left the impression of a superpower threatening to pick up its marbles and go home, they said. And they said it may only succeed in stoking resentment abroad and diminishing American influence in the world.\u201cEveryone knows the money serves U.S. interests, which is also true of European money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this feels ugly. And this is in the State of the Union, so it has gone through a policy process, so it matters more. There\u2019s a difference between the Twitter and the Teleprompter version of Trump policy.\u201dIn any case, only about 1 percent of the United States federal budget goes to foreign aid \u2014 and about 40 percent of that is considered security assistance, rather than economic or humanitarian aid.Even if the amounts of American aid are relatively small, the payoff can be substantial in leverage for the United States, in enhancing its image and promoting its values, others noted. That is changing.Mr. Trump, in his speech, referred to the many countries that voted disapproval of his decision to eventually move the American Embassy in Israel to disputed Jerusalem.On Thursday, his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, told Republican legislators that she was \u201ctaking names\u2019\u2019 at the body, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how helpful it is to have a Congress that backs us up. When y\u2019all play the heavy, it makes it so much easier for me to play the bad cop with a smile.\u201dBeyond retribution, however, Mr. Trump has also made a theme of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d proclaiming his dislike of programs like democracy promotion and generic humanitarian aid.\u201cWhat\u2019s changing is the view of American soft power,\u201d she added. \u201cWith Jerusalem and the State of the Union, there is a view that America is no longer doing the right thing and no longer for the right reasons. Its self-interest is explicit, as if it doesn\u2019t care, so those who gave Americans the benefit of the doubt no longer do so, and it does damage.\u201dBut the \u201cbroader question is whether America is reliable,\u201d Mr. Otte said. \u201cThese are long-term commitments, and what does this mean for the U.N. system, for refugees, for Syria and Yemen if U.N. agencies are constrained.\u201dIt creates resentment among other donor countries, too, he said.As a government, America gives less as a percentage of its gross national income than other countries \u2014 only 0.17 percent, well below the 0.3 percent average for developed countries. But because the economy is so large, Americans still provide more foreign aid in total than any other country, and aid cuts do cause disruptions.And he warned that he would withhold \u201cbillions\u201d from countries that voted against him. \u201cLet them vote against us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll save a lot. We don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cBut this isn\u2019t like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be taken advantage of any longer.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s warning appeared aimed largely at countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America who are regarded as more vulnerable to American pressure.At least 11 countries, including Russia, Belgium and Norway, have rushed to pay their own annual contributions early and in full, to fill the gap. Pressed by Norway, the European Union held an emergency session last week to seek faster contributions to the refugee agency.Even the Israeli government has quietly criticized the cut to the agency, which provides much of the schooling and health care in Gaza and the West Bank, meaning that Israel, considered by most of the world as an occupying power, is not under obligation to do so.Mr. Bildt suggested that the Europeans should not contribute more, but let Israel cope with the fallout of the aid cut. Noting that Israel was lobbying in Washington against the cutbacks, he asked: \u201cWhy should we jump in there? If it collapses, it is the responsibility of the occupying country, Israel, which should pay the costs of its occupation.\u201dMr. Trump has also suspended aid to Pakistan over its ties to the Taliban, and that is a more popular act, said Ian Lesser, a former American official who runs the German Marshall Fund office here.\u201cOn Egypt and especially Pakistan,\u201d which receive large amounts of United States aid, \u201ca lot of the foreign policy establishment will agree,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pent-up dissatisfaction with countries that have not been helpful.\u201cWith some key countries,\u201d he added, \u201cit could be that Trump\u2019s assertiveness comes together with this pent-up frustration to produce change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Children Because of Climate Change? Some People Are Considering It", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdd this to the list of decisions affected by climate change: Should I have children?A 32-year-old who always thought she would have children can no longer justify it to herself. A Mormon has bucked the expectations of her religion by resolving to adopt rather than give birth. An Ohio woman had her first child after an unplanned pregnancy \u2014 and then had a second because she did not want her daughter to face an environmental collapse alone.And the discussions about the role of climate change are only intensifying.That has changed, she said \u2014 either because more people are having doubts, or because it has become less taboo to talk about them.If it weren\u2019t for climate change, Allison Guy said, she would go off birth control tomorrow.But scientists\u2019 projections, if rapid action isn\u2019t taken, are not \u201ccongruent with a stable society,\u201d said Ms. Guy, 32, who works at a marine conservation nonprofit in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give birth to a kid wondering if it\u2019s going to live in some kind of \u2018Mad Max\u2019 dystopia.\u201dParents like Amanda PerryMiller, a Christian youth leader and mother of two in Independence, Ohio, share her fears.\u201cAnimals are disappearing. The oceans are full of plastic. The human population is so numerous, the planet may not be able to support it indefinitely,\u201d said Ms. PerryMiller, 29. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t paint a very pretty picture for people bringing home a brand-new baby from the hospital.\u201dThe people thinking about these issues fit no single profile. They are women and men, liberal and conservative. They come from many regions and religions.Cate Mumford, 28, is a Mormon, and Mormons believe God has commanded them to \u201cmultiply and replenish the earth.\u201d But even in her teens, she said, she could not get another point of doctrine out of her head: \u201cWe are stewards of the earth.\u201dMs. Mumford, a graduate student in a joint-degree program at Johns Hopkins and Brigham Young Universities, plans to adopt a child with her husband. Some members of her church have responded aggressively, accusing her of going against God\u2019s plan. But she said she felt vindicated by the worsening projections.For many, the drive to reproduce is not easily put aside.\u201cIf a family is what you want, you\u2019re not just going to be able to make that disappear entirely,\u201d said Jody Mullen, 36, a mother of two in Gillette, N.J. \u201cYou\u2019re not just going to be able to say, \u2018It\u2019s not really good for the environment for humans to keep reproducing, so I\u2019ll just scratch that idea.\u2019\u201dAnd so compromises emerge. Some parents resolve to raise conscientious citizens who can help tackle climate change. Some who want multiple children decide to have only one.For Sara Jackson Shumate, 37, who has a young daughter, having a second child would mean moving to a house farther from her job as a lecturer at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. She is not sure she can justify the environmental impact of a larger home and a longer commute.But for Ms. PerryMiller, the Ohio youth leader, the thinking went the opposite way: Once she had her first child, climate change made a second feel more urgent.\u201cSomeday, my husband and I will be gone,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my daughter has to face the end of the world as we know it, I want her to have her brother there.\u201dLaura Cornish, 32, a mother of two near Vancouver, said she felt \u201csome pretty strong cognitive dissonance around knowing that the science is really bad but still thinking that their future will be O.K.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t read the science updates anymore because they\u2019re too awful,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t engage with that, because it\u2019s hard to reconcile with my choices.\u201dPeople who choose not to have children are used to being called \u201cselfish.\u201d But many of them see their decision as a sacrifice.Parenthood is \u201csomething that I want,\u201d said Elizabeth Bogard, 18, a freshman at Northern Illinois University. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard for me to justify my wants over what matters and what\u2019s important for everyone.\u201dThis attitude seems particularly common among people who have seen the effects of climate change firsthand.\u201cI\u2019ve seen how Syrian refugees, who are running from a devastating war, are being treated,\u201d Ms. Kaff, 33, said in an email. \u201cImagine how my children will be treated if they have to flee their country due to extreme weather, drought, lack of resources, flooding.\u201d\u201cI know that humans are hard-wired to procreate,\u201d she said, \u201cbut my instinct now is to shield my children from the horrors of the future by not bringing them to the world.\u201dMs. Kallman and Josephine Ferorelli, the founders of Conceivable Future, said that the predominant emotion at their gatherings was grief \u2014 and that the very existence of these conversations should spur political action.\u201cThese stories tell you that the thing that\u2019s broken is bigger than us,\u201d Ms. Ferorelli said. \u201cThe fact that people are seriously considering not having children because of climate change is all the reason you need to make the demands.\u201dMost of the people interviewed, parents and non-parents alike, lamented having to factor climate change into their decisions at all.\u201cWhat kind of nightmare question is that?\u201d asked Ms. Guy, the Washington nonprofit worker. \u201cThat we have to consider that?\u201dAdvertisement"}

What?One answer is that stocks gonna do what they\u2019re gonna do \u2013 as Paul Samuelson famously put it, the market predicted nine of the last five recessions. But there\u2019s a bit of economic logic here too. One way of looking at recent economic data is that they\u2019re actually telling us that future U.S. growth will be lower than one might have hoped.If we care about the medium term \u2013 say, 5 or 10 years \u2013 prospects for U.S. growth depend on two things. First, how much slack is there in the economy? How many people who aren\u2019t working can still be drawn into employment without inflation taking off?Second, how fast will productivity \u2013 output per person-hour \u2013 rise?The first question has posed something of a puzzle. Standard indicators like the unemployment rate and the quit rate suggest an economy at more or less full employment. (Quits matter because they tell us how easily workers expect to find new jobs.) But low wage growth suggested that there might still be substantial room to run.Now, finally, we may be seeing some significant wage gains:Again, you don\u2019t want to make too much of one month\u2019s number. But the wage gain strengthens the case that we really are near full employment; interest rates rose because the odds of Fed rate hikes to limit inflation have risen. And that hit stocks.Meanwhile, productivity numbers have been pretty dismal:So what the data are suggesting, although not with a lot of confidence, is that America is about to settle into a low-growth rut, maybe 1.5% a year. And yes, that\u2019s only half what Trump is promising.Advertisement"}

The prices were different. So were the outcomes. Amazon and Walmart are battling to dominate the grocery market, fueling a price war that could rearrange where America shops for food.While the 365 line of stores was launched before Amazon\u2019s acquisition, the vibe of the new Brooklyn store seems in keeping with Amazon\u2019s consumer-first approach. The store is easy to navigate and pushes its private-label, and less expensive, 365 brand products. Wherever possible, we bought 365 brand items, including steak, hamburger, salt, pepper and olive oil. Many of the items were organic, and the eggs came from cage-free chickens. That helped drive up the prices. The grand total: $45.17Next, we went to the Walmart Supercenter in Secaucus, N.J., and bought almost entirely from Walmart\u2019s Great Value brand, which offers few organic options.That bill came to $27.18One ingredient that drove that difference: Whole Foods\u2019 organic shredded Cheddar cost nearly three times as much as the Walmart brand, which was not organic. The price of a dozen eggs at the two stores was comparable.For the highly unscientific taste test, we served the meatballs in the New York Times newsroom on Friday afternoon. The taste testers were not told whether they had chosen a Whole Foods or a Walmart meatball until after they voted.Some said the Whole Foods batch had too much bacon flavor. Others found the steak bits in the Walmart meatballs too chewy. When the votes were tallied, the Whole Foods meatball prevailed.But by the end of the day, the distinctions seemed to fade. Every meatball had been eaten.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Dept. Plan Could Let the Boss Pocket the Tip", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration is moving to give restaurants and other employers more control over workers\u2019 tips. But critics have denounced the plan as legalizing wage theft and accuse the administration of suppressing evidence that lends credence to the charge.Under the new proposal, for which the public comment period ends on Monday, employers could use workers\u2019 tips for essentially any purpose, as long as the workers were directly paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.The restaurant industry, which has fought the Barack Obama administration regulation for years, argues that the change would allow employers to share the tips of waiters and waitresses with so-called back-of-the-house workers like cooks and dishwashers.\u201cWe think it\u2019s unfair for a busboy who picks up dirty dishes to be able to get tips but for a dishwasher who cleans the dishes not to be allowed to share the tips,\u201d said Angelo Amador, senior vice president and regulatory counsel at the National Restaurant Association.But labor advocacy groups and former Obama administration officials argue that the regulation would legalize a vast income transfer from workers to employers, who would be permitted to pocket the tips.\u201cThere is a lot of wage theft, tip stealing in restaurants and other sectors where workers depend on tips,\u201d Christine Owens of the National Employment Law Project said. \u201cThis would be one more reason for employers to take workers\u2019 tips and do whatever they want to do with them.\u201dHeidi Shierholz, a former chief economist at the Labor Department who oversaw the study, said that under standard economic theory, employers were unlikely to pay workers more than needed to attract and retain them, which they are by definition already doing in most cases.She predicted that if the regulation took effect and employers decided to share tips with these workers, \u201ctheir base pay would be reduced and there would be no more take-home pay.\u201dMany tipped workers would not be affected, however, because the law would continue to prevent employers from taking the tips of those who earned less than the minimum wage. The law allows workers to be paid below the minimum wage as long as their tips make up the difference.At least one major business group and some restaurant owners wrote that the rule would allow employers to put in place new pay practices that benefited both them and workers.\u201cIt used to be that our servers typically made 1.5 to two times more than our kitchen staff, which is a big gap, but now they make two to four times more,\u201d wrote Kim Snuggerud, who owns the Hilo Bay Cafe in Hawaii. \u201cThis gap can be better managed with this change in the regulations. The wage disparity creates many problems, from morale issues to higher turnover.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Snuggerud emphasized that she was not a supporter of President Trump and tended to favor minimum-wage increases and \u201cbig government.\u201dBut many self-identified former restaurant owners, along with many workers and customers, wrote in to oppose the rule, saying it was unfair and might even amount to theft.\u201cWhen you put out a proposed rule, you have to put out the analysis you have that shows the impact of it,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the committee that has oversight over the department. \u201cI think, frankly, if they do that, people would be outraged.\u201dBut several former Labor Department officials said that while uncertainties and data limitations complicated any effort to measure costs and benefits, economists had well-established practices for addressing them.\u201cThere are assumptions one has to make, but you build that into the analysis,\u201d said David Weil, the former head of the division that enforces minimum-wage and overtime rules, which also produced this proposal. \u201cOn its face, it\u2019s just a ridiculous assertion.\u201dMs. Shierholz said it had taken her team of four primary researchers less than two weeks to generate their estimate.A Labor Department spokesman said that the department had sought public input about how to estimate costs and benefits when it released its proposal and that it \u201cintends to publish an informed cost-benefit analysis as part of any final rule.\u201dThe spokesman pointed out that the 2011 rule also did not include a detailed cost-benefit analysis, though former Labor Department officials say that was because the rule codified existing policy and did not change policy.The department declined to comment. But two former Labor Department officials said they had been briefed on the analysis by people currently at the department and echoed this account.Michael Hancock, another former top official in the division that produced the proposal, said he found it unimaginable that the department would not have produced an economic analysis because officials at the Office of Management and Budget, who must typically sign off on new regulations, would refuse to do so without one.\u201cAt least during my time, O.M.B. jealously guarded the executive order,\u201d said Mr. Hancock, who worked at the department for two decades beginning in 1995. \u201cThey always insisted if it\u2019s even close to the threshold that you\u2019ve got to do an economic analysis, no matter how challenging.\u201dThe restaurant industry contends that the Obama-era regulation is illegal because it goes beyond what the underlying law supports. It asked the Supreme Court to review the Obama rule after appellate courts in different parts of the country split on the issue.\u201cI would say the process was not followed in 2011,\u201d Mr. Amador said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any flaw here, it\u2019s that an illegal regulation passed in 2011.\u201dBut Mr. Hancock said the proposed change would be highly vulnerable to a legal challenge if completed because omitting an economic analysis denied the public a chance to comment.\u201cThe rule-making process is designed to give the public an opportunity to have their voices heard,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t include the economic analysis that underlies all of this, the public never had an opportunity to do that. I think it\u2019s going to create legal problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tumultuous Week on Wall Street Ends With a Small Rally", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks on Wall Street ended a volatile week on an upswing, as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended Friday\u2019s trading session about 1.4 percent higher.After Thursday\u2019s session marked a 10 percent drop from the market\u2019s peak in January, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average started higher on Friday, then plummeted, then swung back into positive territory in the afternoon.Asian and European markets tumbled on Friday. Chinese stocks were among the biggest casualties in a broad sell-off across Asia. It was a stunning reversal for Chinese shares, which investors had been snapping up only days before.The cause of one of the most turbulent weeks in recent memory, market participants in the United States said, appeared to be widespread expectations that the global economy is improving and that growth would accelerate in the near future.That has led to fears that interest rate increases could cheapen the value of certain kinds of investments.\u201cEven if stocks continue to rise, they could rise more slowly and could be subject to large drops,\u201d said Kate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.She said investors were moving money out of riskier stocks like Apple and Disney, which are considered \u201cconsumer discretionary\u201d stocks because they don\u2019t serve basic daily needs, and into safer areas like utility stocks and United States Treasury notes.\u201cLonger-term investors should stay invested and not let this worry them. This is an opportunity to buy at lower prices,\u201d Ms. Warne said.Many investors are now growing nervous that central banks will raise interest rates in a bid to keep inflation at bay. If policymakers move too quickly, their efforts could temper the global growth.Anthony Clemente, the chief executive of Canaras Capital, which specializes in high-yield loans and has $1.3 billion under management, said some of the market movement appeared to be an effort by portfolio managers to protect themselves from volatility in stocks rather than a broader fear of market turmoil.\u201cIt\u2019s really out of equities and inflows into the debt markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an expectations that yields \u2014 fixed income and debt instrument \u2014 are the place where you will want to be at some point.\u201dWhatever the cause, there is now little doubt that markets are jittery.After being lulled into a sense of complacency by years of steadily rising stocks, even small worries can snowball into a bad day for stocks. The losses can then feed on themselves in a financial industry dominated by computerized trading systems, with the weakness in the United States spreading around the world.\u201cAsia is going to be the tail that gets wagged by the U.S. dog,\u201d Timothy Moe, chief Asia Pacific strategist at Goldman Sachs, said on Friday.But the Chinese market does offer reasons for concern. Investors kept a careful eye this week on China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, which is carefully managed by the Chinese government. It took a hit on Thursday, falling as much as 1.2 percent before strengthening a bit on Friday.Before that, the renminbi had been rising steadily against the American dollar, leading to worries that Beijing might step in further to contain it. World markets can be sensitive to sharp swings in China\u2019s currency.The tough day of trading on Friday put Chinese shares by some measures into correction territory. \u201cWe are witnessing the longest rally in the history of Chinese stocks,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote to clients early this week, adding, \u201cA tactical correction appears overdue, and markets could fall further.\u201dShares in Shanghai fell about 4 percent on Friday, while Hong Kong shares lost 3.1 percent. Shares in Tokyo fell 2.3 percent. In Europe, stocks wavered, off more than 1 percent in afternoon trading.In the logic of stock markets, bad news can sometimes be good news. Recent gains in the value of the euro against the dollar and other major currencies were expected to slow exports and potentially put the brakes on the eurozone economy.Slower growth would, in turn, dissuade the European Central Bank from raising interest rates too soon, prolonging the cheap money that has been partly responsible for the bull market.\u201cThe E.C.B. has, in fact, a vital interest in keeping euro area interest rates at low levels,\u201d Ralph Solveen, an analyst at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients on Friday.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Upgraded Designs Unveiled for Road Tunnel Near Stonehenge", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInitial designs for the project at Stonehenge, a World Heritage Site, were unveiled on Thursday. They are part of a project set to cost 1.6 billion pounds, or about $2.2 billion, to upgrade a highway near the monument in the county of Wiltshire, in southwest England.The designs address concerns that the tunnel portals and deep cuttings would scar the landscape and cause irreparable damage. Heritage groups had also been concerned that the proposed tunnel exit would be too close to the Normanton Down Barrows, a collection of tombs that is a part of the Stonehenge landscape.In the proposal, the latest and most significant one put forward by Highways England, the British government organization overseeing the project, the tunnel would be longer than previously envisaged: 1.8 miles.The plan also incorporates a green canopy, which aims to remove the \u201csight and sound\u201d of the road and help it blend into the landscape.The highway upgrade is intended to lift the surrounding economy, tourism and heritage in the southwest of England.\u201cThese upgrades in the southwest will improve millions of journeys,\u201d said Highways England\u2019s chief executive, Jim O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cEach of these milestones in the region is evidence of Highways England delivering major infrastructure upgrades for the whole country.\u201dDespite the revisions to the designs, archaeologists warned that prehistorical remains at the site of the monument would be ruined by the construction of a tunnel and called for the plans to be scrapped.\u201cIt seems blatantly obvious the Stonehenge landscape is unutterably precious,\u201d said David Jacques, an archaeologist at the University of Buckingham. \u201cIf you tamper with it, you are not going to get it back.\u201dBut they expressed concerns about the impact of traffic that they say would be made worse by the proposal to link existing byways after the surface of the highway is removed.\u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reunite this ancient landscape, giving people the opportunity to tread pathways used by our ancestors who built the monuments, to visit and appreciate the monuments and see and hear wildlife without the intrusion of the traffic and noise from the road,\u201d the agencies \u2014 Historic England, the National Trust and English Heritage \u2014 said in a joint statement.Highways England has begun seeking public feedback on the project and will hold a series of local consultation events, which will run until April 6.

{"Headline": "Making Connections: 50 Teenagers Suggest Creative Ways to Link Classic Texts to the World Today", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContestsSome texts came up so often that, if you\u2019re a teacher currently working with any of them, you could do worse than to search this post to find the many and varied ways students see their resonance. \u201cBrave New World,\u201d \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d \u201cThe Prince,\u201d \u201c1984,\u201d \"Othello\u201d and \u201cMacbeth\u201d are in that category.Certain issues in the news also appeared in all kinds of contexts. The #MeToo movement reminded students of literature like \u201cJane Eyre\u201d and \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d but one student also thought Newton\u2019s first two laws of motion applied, while another saw an analogy to the rock cycle in geology. Participants discovered that fake news is old news, with clear parallels in the plots of \u201cThe Crucible\u201d and \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d President Trump was compared to literary characters including Macbeth and Grendel, and his policies were invoked in examining topics as varied as \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d and the Indian Removal Act.Below, in alphabetical order, is a list of winners, runners-up and honorable mentions, including full essays by our top eight winners. All told, the list represents the work of 50 students, more than we usually call out in our contests. But not only were there simply that many ideas we wanted to honor, we also think the variety and originality of the choices speak for themselves: Any future student who wonders what school-assigned reading has to do with \u201cthe real world\u201d only has to look at this list to see how easy it is to answer that question.Is it really possible to control how people think? Today we are inundated with media from the moment we wake up: images, text messages, news stories. In school, students read articles, novels, and textbooks. If we took all of these stimulants away, would we still be able to think for ourselves, or would we lose the motivation to do so?This theme is one at the forefront of Ray Bradbury\u2019s novel, \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d which I recently read for my Literature class. The story examines a dystopian society where books have been banned completely. The average people in this story seem to lack emotional complexity; they have no desire to read because they have been taught that books made people upset. In the novel, there are a few people who question the status quo, but the majority of people live in a state of blissful ignorance.Though the novel is meant to depict a contemporary society that Bradbury could not have predicted, there are elements of its narrative that are uncannily similar to our world. Specifically, the mindset of our leaders. Following the mandate from the president disallowing the use of seven scientific words by the CDC in budget documents, I read an article in the New York Times called \u201cThought Control, Trump-Style\u201d published on December 18, 2017. The Trump administration has almost completely erased any trace of the LGBT+ community on government websites and banned the phrase \u201cclimate change\u201d from use by the Department of Agriculture. This virus has infected so many establishments that its ban on seven words in budget documents pales in comparison.Why are our leaders seeking to control the media we consume? Even the controversy of \u201cfake news\u201d is an attempt to restrict the press we see to only one side of the story. Our government has become a Mind Flayer of sorts: it sees itself as a superior race of thinkers and feels a need to dominate other beings to the point of mind control. This evil and fantastical government is what Ray Bradbury was trying to warn against in his novel. Complacency only breeds complacency. Congress will surely be more effective in passing legislation that Republicans are in favor of if the only news consumed by the American public leans to the far right, but what good does it do us as a society to all agree?American democracy is predicated on freedom of speech and the desire to seek knowledge. The very idea of precluding this information is a threat to our republic. It is scary to think that Bradbury saw signs of today\u2019s society almost seventy years ago. Perhaps even scarier is how many people in today\u2019s society have failed to become Guy Montags. It would be difficult to find someone who does not agree with the dangers presented in this book, but, unfortunately, it is not hard to find someone who agrees with the thought control of America\u2019s own Mind Flayer.If complacency breeds complacency, will deliberate minds produce deliberate actions?Stauffer\u2019s story begins her freshman year of college, when she remembers this paralyzing fear. She recalls going from a confident student; optimistic about the year, to a terrified, voiceless wreck. Her high school education had prepared her for the coursework but not the reality her actions impacted her future, and could possibly mean failure. Stauffer became so petrified that she stopped eating and participating in classes, dropped courses, lost weight, and eventually dropped out of college altogether. She\u2019d failed, and her worst fear had become a reality.Yet, somehow this wasn\u2019t as crushing as she thought it would be. Stauffer moved home, and inadvertently started seeking out education the same way Thoreau did: through experience. She found that the hands on experience of ballet and yoga studios and a nonprofit organization furthered her education more than any college course ever could. Eventually Stauffer found a way to finish her degree at the New School, a collection of universities that offered credit for real-life experience instead of academic courses. She went from the lowest point in her life to one of the highest, and all she had to do was fail.The moral is clear: there are gaps in our education system, and because of these gaps students aren\u2019t adequately prepared for their own futures. In his book Walden, Thoreau elaborates on the ideas Stauffer touches on in her article. As stated before, he believed learning through experience was exponentially better than a in classroom. When a rigid curriculum with expectations is set in place, students aren\u2019t given the same hands on learning as they would be without one. Just as Stauffer embraced this learning style in the New School, Thoreau did so in Walden Woods. For that is all Walden really is; Thoreau learning from nature by immersing himself in it, instead of seeing it on the pages of a book. A quote from Walden most fitting is as follows, \u201cWe boast of our system of education, but why stop at schoolmasters and schoolhouses? We are all schoolmasters, and our schoolhouse is the universe\u201d (Walden 10/15/1859.)Most of the literature I have explored in my English classes have been novels and plays with sophisticated language and complex storylines, but this semester we read an eye-opening essay about racism\u2013 \u201cWhite Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\u201d by Peggy McIntosh\u2013which finally made me realize that what my teachers say is true: the things we read and discuss do apply to the real world.I read Charles Blow\u2019s editorials regularly. The effect of his words is sharp and impactful. When I came across \u201cChecking My Male Privilege\u201d after the deluge of sexual harassment accusations came out in Hollywood and Washington, the connection was obvious.In \u201cUnpacking the Invisible Knapsack,\u201d McIntosh emphasizes how in our society, white privilege is so lethal because its beneficiaries are \u201ccarefully taught not to recognize [it].\u201d How can racism be eradicated if the people with advantages don\u2019t even know they have them? Unless white people recognize all the ways our quality of life can be so much higher simply because of the color of our skin, we will forever have this invisible pack full of assets and protections secured tightly on our backs.If we apply the same logic McIntosh uses in her essay to our discussions about sexual harassment in America, it\u2019s easy to see that most men are also conditioned to evade any blame whatsoever for the injustices so many women face. Just like the white people who attribute their success to their own merit and turn a blind eye to their privileges, the men who focus on the \u201cgood guys\u201d who don\u2019t grope or whistle or slap are choosing to overlook the privilege of physical dominance. It seems simple, but men can enjoy the luxury of knowing that a vast majority of the time, women don\u2019t have the physical superiority to victimize or overpower men for unwanted sexual behavior.In cases of both sexism and racism, privileges hurt both those without and with the privileges. White people might not condone racism, but their blindness to privilege leads them to believe that racism may not be as bad as the underprivileged make it seem. As Blow writes, it\u2019s extremely difficult to understand how bad something is if you never experience it firsthand, and so listening to people with fewer privileges is one of the best tools we can use to evaluate the state of discrimination black people and women are immersed in.Beneath the shimmery surface of American ideals, from John Winthrop\u2019s iconic imagery of the country as a \u201ccity upon a hill\u201d to the twentieth century metaphor of a \u201cmelting pot\u201d accepting all cultures, nationalities, and ethnicities, recent events reveal the underlying racism of a nation claiming to be \u201cpost-racial.\u201d In George Yancy\u2019s \u201cWill America Choose King\u2019s Dream or Trump\u2019s Nightmare?\u201d the professor illustrates how Trump\u2019s offensive and racist statements pertaining to Haiti, El Salvador, and African nations highlight America\u2019s deceptive fa\u00e7ade as a beacon for civil liberty. A classic piece of American literature, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald unveils the flaws of high society during the Roaring Twenties, a period of both economic prosperity and unrivaled income inequality, through the narration of Nick Carraway. Reflecting current news, \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d showcases how harsh reality is often hidden under a superficial exterior.After moving to Long Island, Carraway optimistically believes in the American dream of working hard to be rewarded and achieve upward mobility. However, his encounters reveal the faults of the rich whose lifestyles and wealth are so widely admired. Tom Buchanan, a Yale graduate from a prominent family, has more than enough wealth to transport his polo ponies across the country while owning an elaborate mansion framed by French windows and half an acre of fresh roses. Despite Buchanan\u2019s dignified appearance and prestige, Carraway uncovers the truth of his racism, domestic violence, and immorality. At his own dinner party, Buchanan recommends a book claiming the importance of the dominance of the white race. That same night, a woman reveals his infidelity and the fact that everyone in town is aware of it. Not only is the man unabashedly unfaithful, but he frequently leaves bruises on his wife and breaks his mistress\u2019s nose during a disagreement. Meanwhile, the vanity of his wife and mistress is undeniable since Buchanan\u2019s exuberant wealth was the subject of their attraction. The sole genuinely magnanimous rich character, Jay Gatsby, is delusional and dependent on illegal means to maintain his lavish lifestyle.Although written nearly a century later, Yancy\u2019s op-ed examines the same theme of reality contradicting American ideals. Ever since the Declaration of Independence affirmed equality for all men and the United States emerged as the land of liberty, the nation claimed to be a republic of moral justice and equality. Yet on January 11, President Donald J. Trump revealed the contradictory truth when he made a racist and derogatory statement condemning immigrants from several nonwhite countries. The representative of the United States allegedly using \u201cshithole\u201d to describe the homelands of foreign immigrants is contemptuous and clearly inconsistent with America\u2019s image of acceptance and tolerance.In \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d Fitzgerald warns readers against accepting society at face value, a lesson that Yancy emphasizes as well. To learn from the misplaced optimism of Nick Carraway, Americans today must remain unaffected by the country\u2019s idealistic rhetoric of freedom and equality to speak out against our president\u2019s bigotry, rather than silently accepting the unjust reality of racism.Mark Twain was friends with abolitionist Frederick Douglass, yet he permitted grotesque drawings of escaped slave Jim in \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d Twain was a benefactor for African American students, yet he depicted Jim as helpless and inferior in the \u201canti-slavery\u201d satire. Twain clearly had conflicting views regarding African Americans. In his New York Times op-ed, \u201cThe Other Inconvenient Truth,\u201d author Charles Blow states, \u201cJust because one abhors violence and cruelty doesn\u2019t mean that one truly believes that all people are equal\u2026 Entertaining the notion of imbalance-that white people are inherently better than others in any way- is also white supremacy.\u201d Blow invents the term \u201csoft white supremacy\u201d to describe these beliefs. This concept offered me a way to navigate Twain\u2019s puzzling attitudes towards African Americans in Huck Finn.When reading Twain\u2019s classic with my AP English class, I was confused as to why the text wasn\u2019t resolutely anti-slavery. In the novel, protagonist Huck and Jim travel down the Mississippi to escape their lives in St. Petersburg, Missouri. It takes over 300 pages for Huck to realize Jim is a human being, and even then Huck infantilizes Jim by offering the grown man \u201chelp.\u201d In the book\u2019s last ten controversial chapters, Jim becomes subservient to Huck and Tom, refusing to stand up for himself even when made to complete ridiculous tasks. Jim\u2019s behavior in these chapters led me to suspect Twain believed slaves were too unintelligent and submissive to stand up to adolescents. Although Twain depicted Jim as a true human being, giving this book its \u201canti-slavery\u201d reputation, subtleties in Huck\u2019s and Jim\u2019s attitudes make me wonder if Twain \u201centertained notions of imbalance\u201d even though he didn\u2019t openly show it.Most importantly, Blow showed me that \u201csoft white supremacy\u201d still plagues our current times, most notably in the executive branch of our government. In 2011, Trump said President Obama needed to show his birth certificate to prove he was American-born. When announcing his Presidential candidacy, Trump stated Mexicans were drug dealers, criminals, and rapists. Trump said of the white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville that violence had taken place \u201con many sides.\u201d No, he didn\u2019t openly support the supremacists, but yes, he didn\u2019t really condemn them either. Recently, Trump called Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas,\u201d actively belittling her and Native Americans simultaneously.I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Blow speak on January 7th and his words continued to enlighten my understanding of white supremacy. Passive white supremacy, he said, is more deadly than open white supremacy because these feelings can increase exponentially when sparked. Those who turn a blind eye to hateful events are the ones who allow extremism to grow.I was disappointed that in the end of Twain\u2019s novel, Huck knows his Southern society has the wrong views about slavery yet he decides to turn his own blind eye. Huck\u2019s choice to escape to the West and ignore these issues on the final page is symbolic of the actions many in our country take today.It can be a terrifying thing to see decades of the pent-up rage of an oppressed person finally let out against their oppressor. This is the case in William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d when the Jewish moneylender Shylock brings his nemesis and lifelong tormentor, the Christian merchant Antonio, to court over an unpaid loan. The punishment, as agreed upon between the two men as a condition of the deal, is that Shylock may remove a pound of Antonio\u2019s flesh. But before Shylock exacts this cruel retribution, a friend of Antonio\u2019s makes a fascinating appeal in his favor. Portia claims that the true sign of strength is not the ability to take revenge, but to show mercy. Mercy, she says, \u201cblesseth him that gives, and him that takes \u2026 \u2018tis mightiest in the mightiest\u201d (Shakespeare IV.i.183-84). In June of 2017, half a millennium after Shakespeare\u2019s fictional court case, the Louisiana state legislature seemed to realize the same thing as Portia when they passed a series of unexpected but widespread criminal justice reform laws which aim to dramatically reduce the prison population and lower recidivism rates. Both instances show that the ability to have mercy gives the person in power an unparalleled opportunity to do good, and ultimately, to benefit themselves.At its surface, the Louisiana reform package could appear purely as an act of mercy: an attempt to help those who have fallen victim to the state\u2019s brutal justice system. On some level, this is all it is; surely there were legislators for whom this was their sole motivation. But whether intended or not, Louisiana stands to receive enormous gains from this package \u2013 it truly is \u201ctwice blest.\u201d As well as expanded parole and prison alternatives, which aim to help those convicted, the state expects to see an improvement in public safety and save over $180 million. The monetary benefits from this merciful outreach will help the state in ways that would never be thought of as connected to improving an inmate\u2019s life.However, conservative politicians, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, fail to see this link. They maintain that the best way to keep law and order among their constituents is to wield their power like a sword, striking down any who violate that peace. But Portia reminds us that mercy is what makes a ruler truly powerful; she calls it \u201can attribute to God himself\u201d (Shakespeare IV.i.190). Sessions and others must reject this easy show of power by way of force and cruelty in the justice system, choosing instead a path that will benefit disadvantaged citizens and show the people that they are worthy of the power we grant them. In this time of political distrust, the American people could use an indication that our politicians are capable of the \u201cawe and majesty\u201d that Portia speaks of (Shakespeare IV.i.186). I am certain that if they chose to show mercy, we would know beyond a doubt that they are worthy of leading us.I stumble upon a New York Times article, \u201cJudge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees,\u201d that makes me wonder if Hawthorne, the literary genius, is wrong.The article explains a recent case in which a judge, James Robart, lifted a Trump administration ban after hearing a compelling argument that Muslim refugees struggle to reunite with family members who have already legally settled in the U.S. due to discriminatory policies of the U.S. refugee program. Governmental lawyers counter-argued that the ban was necessary because it was in interests of national security.I sit at the breakfast table wondering if xenophobia was always that pronounced in the United States. It appears to me that xenophobia underlined the governmental lawyers\u2019 arguments; an attorney called the ban \u201creasonable and appropriate.\u201d I do not understand how a ban that targets certain groups, specifically Muslims, can be \u201creasonable.\u201d I ask my father, who grew up in an Italian immigrant household if he recalls facing immense oppression. He says no. I often hear people casually declaring that Muslims should not be allowed in the U.S. because they will bomb our cities. When did Muslim refugees become synonymous with terrorism? The answer: recently. How may you ask? The death of our shadows.Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d explores the concept of the shadow-self. The character Pearl is praised because she possesses no shadow. Hawthorne suggested that our world would be a better place if we did not have shadows, meaning our dark parts would be exposed to society. We live in Hawthorne\u2019s world, and it is not one of sublime beauty, rather it is one of chaos and disgust.With recent changes in administration, more people have become comfortable vocalizing xenophobic, along with homophobic, racist, and sexist, thoughts. It has become more common to witness politicians share their dark, most discriminatory, comments to gain support. Those thoughts are normalized, causing the death of our shadows.Shadows barricade impertinent comments and prevent xenophobia from manifesting itself into discriminatory policies like the ban seen in the New York Times article. Although Judge James Robart partially lifted the ban, part of it still exists, along with other similar policies. He\u2019s combating xenophobia, while others do little to eradicate discriminatory policies. By doing nothing, a shadow-less world exists. Perhaps if we had shadows, a ban would not exist to prevent Muslim families from reuniting. A Muslim father can watch his daughter blow out the candles on her birthday cake, and a Muslim mother can applaud when her son receives his high school diploma. But they can\u2019t.Hawthorne is wrong. His envisioned world has its perils. It allows xenophobia to persist, causing the unjust discrimination of certain groups like the Muslim refugees mentioned in the article \u201cJudge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees.\u201d We can live again in Hawthorne\u2019s imperfect world, where shadows exist, even finding it to be not so imperfect. A shadow can only exist with light; there is no light in a shadow-less world.In the New York Times article, \u201cCareers for Women in Technology Companies Are A Global Challenge,\u201d writer Alina Tugend discusses the similarities and differences for women around the world working in the tech field. Tech companies in the United States suffer from a male-dominated, \u201cbro\u201d culture that gives a cold shoulder to female coworkers. In other places, such as the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, the problem lies with class differences, leading to the alienation of middle-class and poor women. The article sums that, while the execution of these issues vary around the world, the underlying effect is still the same: women have a much harder time entering and remaining in the tech field.The lack of female representation in STEM is not new. While there are many factors that lead to this problem, the one with the deepest consequence is negative stereotypes planted at a young age.In psychology, we learned about the idea of stereotype threat: a phenomenon in which people are reminded of negative stereotypes of a group they belong to and hence perform on given tasks conforming to those stereotypes. In 1997, researcher Steven Spencer applied this idea to classrooms and discovered that equally intelligent women performed worse on a math exam than their male counterparts after being told that the test showed gender differences. This characterization evoked the negative stereotype of women\u2019s lack of math skills and led them to under-perform on the exam. In contrast, he found that if, before the test, participants were led to believe that both parties performed equally, women\u2019s scores were similar to the men\u2019s. Additional research post Spencer\u2019s experiment has further supported this idea, proving that negative stereotypes in gender as well as race and ethnicity reduces the performance of individuals.This institutionalized idea that women are not as capable of performing mathematical or technical tasks as well as men is deeply rooted in our culture, starting in elementary schools all the way to professional work settings. Learning about stereotype threat was eye-opening because it allowed me to see the deeper effects of the way we teach children about careers and how it differs in males and females. Dr. Spencer\u2019s experiment involved one math exam; however, the negative stereotypes about women\u2019s lack of technical skills are prevalent universally. The most corrosive part of this narrative is that men are lead to believe these same ideas, so in the future they are equally as unwelcoming of women, a disheartening reality reflected in our companies today.It is vital that we start debasing these myths and start encouraging women from young ages to be open about any career. Most importantly, we need to teach both men and women such values, so that men can also live in a world where the idea of women being empowered to work in any field is a standard, a world in which creativity and innovation need no gender classification._________ Whether heroes take the form of a mighty Anglo-Saxon warrior or a fierce Amazonian princess, the people who rise up to lead us out of the shadows of death are cultivated by the trials they face and the hope for a brighter future that we project upon them which are often rooted in the injustices we experience.A lot can be learned from the prisoners in the Stanford Prison Experiment. Despite the fact that they were innocent, not actual prisoners deserving of punishment, as the simulation progressed they increasingly accepted their abuse without protest. Of course while there are many factors contributing to the silence of sexual assault victims (social pressure, and the fear of losing their jobs among them), it is also true that many of these factors stem from the victim\u2019s powerless role, which is similar to the silence of the prisoners in Zimbardo\u2019s experiment. While the issue of sexual misconduct is complex and it is impossible to pinpoint any one cause, the findings of the SPE shed a startling light on the effect power has on both the victims and perpetrators of such a widespread epidemic.In the world we live in, fake news is becoming a threat to credibility. With the assistance of the Internet, no one can be completely sure what they are reading is accurate...During the Salem Witch trials in which The Crucible took place, news of witchcraft had spread like ivy. Accusations against Goody Proctor and Rebecca Nurse were the talk of the town not only in Salem, but also in neighboring towns. However, in the 1600\u2019s, people were not very educated and did not have much sense of the world; the majority of the townspeople of Salem and the neighboring towns believed everything they heard about witchcraft.Over the course of recent weeks, my AP World class has been conducting a mock trial to try Genghis Khan for being an uncivilized tyrant... As I did more research, not only for the trial but for a more personal understanding, I came across a New York Times article titled \u201cWhat Experts Know About Men Who Rape\u201d which went on to describe a study that took place to understand the science and psychology behind men that raped...Much like Genghis Khan, these men wanted power, especially if their sexual offenses were violent or aggressive. I believe that Genghis Khan was on a power trip and violated these poor innocent women to demean their societies and to show that he had enough power to do so.In the day and age of wealth, where consumerism is ubiquitous, it\u2019s become acceptable to compulsively fill desires through material gains, such as new clothes or electronics. After all, if we have the capability to harmlessly buy whatever we desire, then what\u2019s wrong with instant satisfaction?The problem is that we constantly reward ourselves, which in turn causes us to feel less grateful for items we receive. Just like the inhabitants of Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, we seek products to provide short bursts of satisfaction and often ignore more wholesome alternatives. Similar to the imaginary civilians in Brave New World, we are surrounded by consumables that are marketed for being quick: Amazon Prime, faster internet, minute-microwave rice, etc. Even subpar TV dinner can seem more attractive than a home cooked meal because of its immediate nature. However, better things come to those who wait.Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison\u2019s bildungsroman centered around an unnamed black protagonist (written to be symbolic of any black man), should not be relevant today. Ideally, Invisible Man should serve as a dated reminder of America\u2019s dark racial history; unfortunately, its underlying themes remain just as prevalent in today\u2019s world as they were when Ellison first released the novel 66 years ago. Charles M. Blow\u2019s Op-Ed \u201cA Rebel, a Warrior and a Race Fiend\u201d particularly highlights the similarities between the nameless protagonist\u2019s struggles and the deeply-embedded racism that still plagues modern America. Blow uses the racially-charged language of President Donald Trump towards black professional athletes to make a broader point about the \u201cracial inequities fused to the DNA of power in this country.\u201d The similarities drawn between Ellison\u2019s work, written in an overtly racist America, and Blow\u2019s contemporary opinion piece convey a depressing message regarding the glacial rate of social progress.Why is this [#MeToo] happening now? Why are all of these women all of a sudden sharing their stories? These questions seem to puzzle many, yet there is a simple answer: Newton\u2019s first two laws of motion can easily explain the growth of the #MeToo movement. Newton\u2019s first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force...While the initial force is debatable - whether it be President Trump\u2019s locker room talk, the growing women\u2019s rights movement, or simply women banding together against Harvey Weinstein - it is evident that a strong force had pushed this moment into action. The once silenced women now gained courage and support to speak up; this cause which was once at rest, is now in motion and will remain in motion.The unequal power dynamic that can exist between the oftentime male offender and female victim in these situations has been a pattern that has existed for generations, going as far back as Shakespearean times. This discussion of male power exerted over women plays out in Othello as we watch high-ranking, socially-influential men manipulate this power dynamic in their favor. As we see the mistakes of Venetian society, we remember our own as well.My junior year lit class focused on Shakespeare\u2019s Troilus and Cressida and the explicit objectification of women present throughout the play. The romance between idealistic Troilus and rational Cressida abruptly ends when Cressida is sold off forcefully to the enemy troop. In the fourth act however, the Greek soldiers welcome Cressida to the camp by doting her with compliments and kisses. The soldiers refer to her as \u201cmy fair lady\u201d and \u201csweet lady\u201d, neglecting the fact that they had ripped her out of her home and relationship against her will. This polite diction makes readers believe that Cressida is enjoying her time at the Greek camp, and we oversee the emotional torture she was forced to endure.Similar to Shakespeare\u2019s play, the reference to the sex slaves as \u201ccomfort women\u201d and \u201chalmonies\u201d impose a positive connotation on a subject that dare not be taken lightly, as we sometimes come to disregard the injustices these women endured.Considering that this play was written in the sixteenth century, during the Renaissance period, it is surprising and even baffling, that it is more relevant now than ever before. Today, everybody wants to be famous. Everyone wants to be noticed, loved and desired by everyone else. They want to raise eyebrows and swivel heads the moment they walk into a room and be important enough to make people stop chewing their food at the mention of their name.In Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play, Faustus\u2019 unbridled ambitions tragically lead to his downfall. After twenty-four years of enjoying all worldly pleasures, Lucifer along with his armada of devils drag Faustus into Hell for eternity as he cries out gut-wrenchingly.Sinking into pillows with a pair of fuzzy socks hugging my feet and the delicious aroma of cacao permeating the air, I lost myself in the world of \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Beyond the ball gowns and fancy cars, a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washed over me, and it wasn\u2019t due to the fact that I spent most of winter break in a similar position: curled up in bed, sipping hot chocolate. The real explanation was much less pleasant, as I realized that the same issues F. Scott Fitzgerald was commenting on in 1925 still exist today. We live in a society suffering from a severe lack of authenticity. There is no substance beneath our shiny exterior of purported principles. Maybe some of our historical documents provide a gilded barrier between what we say we represent and what we actually are. The article \u201cThe Heartbeat of Racism is Denial\u201d addresses this disparity between our stated beliefs and the reality of our condition.This poem describes a teacher who largely downplays the brutal and gruesome truths within history and even changes some history in order to protect the children\u2019s innocence. He describes the Ice Age as \u201cThe Chilly Age\u201d (3) and teaches that the \u201cEnola Gay dropped one tiny atom on Japan\u201d (12-13). This seems harmless and appears to keep the children happy and in a world of white picket fences, but the children in the poem are later on the playground \u201ctormenting the weak and the smart\u201d (15-16). The teacher\u2019s simplistic and inaccurate accounts of history is producing adverse effects on the children- information that is necessary for their educational growth and development has been kept from them, thus breeding ignorance, hatred, and violence.This same phenomenon is happening in current times as books are being banned from schools. This is a robbery of information, as most books that are banned include great lessons for children about the world and themselves.In Intuto, Peru, Amadeo Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda is the last man to speak the language of Taushiro, a language dating back centuries from the jungles of the Amazon. He hasn\u2019t had anyone to speak the language with, and it is highly likely that the language and culture will die with him. The last person Amadeo has spoken with in his native language was his brother, Juan, who died, along with his parents and others in his village, due to diseases such as malaria. Now that he is the last one, there is pressure on Amadeo to retain his culture and language....Learning a foreign language and learning the culture of another country will always have tremendous benefit, in all aspects of life and careers. We should never force someone to be in the position Amadeo is now in; we should work to maintain cultural diversity in order to benefit society and future generations.At the end of stories with important messages, there is a silence that speaks. Danish writer Karen Blixen\u2019s short story, The Blank Page, teaches this profound lesson. An old woman relays the advice her grandmother gave when teaching how to tell stories, \u201cWhere the storyteller is loyal...there, in the end, silence will speak.\u201d ...While in this tale the reluctance to represent every story comes from a place of shame, there are numerous reasons why some stories don\u2019t get told.These days, with access to thousands of news stories at any given moment, people have a nearly endless choice of what narratives to follow. In Nicholas Kristof\u2019s article My Worst Columns he writes about his least \u201cclicked on\u201d pieces for the New York Times website. All of his \u201cworst columns\u201d feature stories of injustice or of situations needing humanitarian attention. These are stories with a silence that speaks, but not that many people have ever read them....When Americans avoid reading stories that place, as Kristof puts it, \u201c...a spotlight on injustice or humanitarian need,\u201d they never get the silence that speaks, and choose instead brash, superficial noise. This is the narrative of 2017 America which focuses on the distracting, at-home crisis of Trump and disregards issues of worldly injustice.Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen 2000% in 2017; the newfound attention associated with this rise has brought record traffic levels to many cryptocurrency exchanges, many of them buckling under the pressure of thousands of market orders during highly volatile periods of trading. This meteoric and unsustainable rise has drawn many comparisons to famous speculative bubbles throughout history, but the most commonly referenced is the Tulip Mania experienced in 17th century Holland....While the comparison between Tulip Mania and Bitcoin may seem reasonable at first, given the unprecedented rise in bitcoin price combined with the hyper-speculative nature of Bitcoin itself, what sets bitcoin apart from the Tulip Bubble is its utility and widespread distribution. Unlike a Tulip a Bitcoin can be fractionalized, making it accessible to common folk even as the price increases. It can also be traded throughout the globe near-instantaneously using the blockchain, an incorruptible cloud based ledger system that records transactions in real time, all while continuously analyzing itself for errors...The comparison between Bitcoin and Tulip Mania is overblown and irresponsible for the press to be touting as it is a poor comparison to the history behind Tulip Mania.A recent opinion editorial piece titled \u201cMueller\u2019s Facts and Trump\u2019s Make-Believe\u201d discusses Donald Trump\u2019s contempt for the truth, especially in regards to maintaining his power, and how other political figures are influenced by his words and actions. This piece was written by Roger Cohen, published on December 5, 2017, and gives a general synopsis of the current state of Trump\u2019s presidency. However, it conveys the leader of the United States as a delusional, lying, and power driven similar to how Shakespeare conveyed Macbeth in his 17th century drama, Macbeth. The only difference between Cohen\u2019s portrayal of Trump and Shakespeare\u2019s portrayal of Macbeth is, Macbeth is a fictional character while Trump is actually the President of the United States.The motivations behind the Chinese Exclusion Act and President Trump\u2019s executive order are shockingly similar. Both were designed to limit the immigration of one particular ethnic group so those immigrants did not take jobs from the American population. But unlike the Chinese Exclusion Act, the president\u2019s executive order faced harsh criticism and was challenged in court on several occasions. It was repealed and replaced with another, less harsh version based on similar principles, which has again been challenged several times in court, eventually making its way up to the Supreme Court .Despite similarities between the two laws, the American people have learned a lot in the last 136 years. We\u2019ve learned that immigration doesn\u2019t hurt the economy - it might even help it. We\u2019ve learned that, true to American beliefs, the color of a person\u2019s skin or the religion they practice does not matter. In a time when increasing diversity and the equality of all people under the law is considered a good thing, Americans are unafraid to speak out for what they believe in and against what they don\u2019t.__________________Thank you, as always, to the teachers and students who took the time to participate.

{"Headline": "Do You Think Donald Trump Is Ready for a Real Financial Crisis?", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe global financial markets are not in crisis. Though some pundits stoked panic with their coverage of several days of market plunges before Tuesday\u2019s leap, stock prices are still near their record highs, the economy is creating jobs and many workers are finally getting decent raises after years of stagnant wages.A big drop in stock prices focuses minds, especially when it comes after years of relatively steady gains.

{"Headline": "Another of Obamacare\u2019s Unloved Provisions Is Gone", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen congressional Republicans were hoping to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act, they often railed against its least popular features as a sign of the structure\u2019s overall dysfunction.The idea behind the IPAB was that Congress often has little appetite for cost control. So, the thinking went, if Medicare spending took off, the board would develop a plan to get that spending back under control. If Congress hated the idea, it could pass an alternative that saved the same amount by a deadline \u2014 or ignore the cuts altogether if it could muster a supermajority vote to do so. But if it did nothing, the board\u2019s will would become law. But the idea was never particularly popular, even in the Congress that voted for it. The IPAB would have taken away Congress\u2019s power to make the cost-saving choices it wanted \u2014 or its choice to avoid them.As part of the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers could swallow it. And as part of a repeal package, it was a rallying cry. But on its own, it fell quietly.\u201cYou take the sour with the sweet in a big bill,\u201d said Rodney Whitlock, a vice president at ML Strategies, who remembers the development of the IPAB when he was a Republican health staffer for the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut then when somebody comes back and says, \u2018Did you enjoy this part of it?\u2019 you\u2019re forced to say, \u2018Not so much,\u2019 and take it out.\u201dThe loss of IPAB won\u2019t gut Obamacare in any major way, though it may stymie its cost containment agenda. But it\u2019s another sign that, now that big repeal-and-replace ambitions are on the shelf, the law will face instead a series of minor cuts.An earlier version of this article misstated the options available to Congress if it didn't like a decision by the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Congress could have passed an alternative to an IPAB proposal with a simple majority, so long as its proposal saved as much money. Congress was not limited to a supermajority vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Afghanistan\u2019s Unwinnable War, What\u2019s the Best Loss to Hope For?", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterAfter 16 years of war in Afghanistan, experts have stopped asking what victory looks like and are beginning to consider the spectrum of possible defeats.All options involve acknowledging the war as failed, American aims as largely unachievable and Afghanistan\u2019s future as only partly salvageable. Their advocates see glimmers of hope barely worth the stomach-turning trade-offs and slim odds of success.It is a strategy, as Ms. Miller described it, to \u201cprevent the defeat of the Afghan government and prevent military victory by the Taliban\u201d for as long as possible.Though far from the most promising option, it is the least humiliating. But sooner or later, the United States and Afghanistan will find themselves facing one of Afghanistan\u2019s endgames \u2014 whether by choice or not.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what my best-case scenario would be,\u201d said Frances Z. Brown, an Afghanistan expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.That, she said, would see the American-led coalition abandon its efforts to impose a centralized state and instead allow Afghans to build their own state from the bottom-up.It would mean accepting a central government that acts more like a horse trader among local strongmen and warlords. American and allied troops would guarantee enough security to sustain the state. Afghans would figure out the rest for themselves.Over time, ideally, Afghans might develop a functioning economy, then something like real democracy and, finally, peace and stability.\u201cBut what we know from other cases is that this takes generations,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cSo the 18-month time frames we\u2019ve always had for Afghanistan are not realistic.\u201dThe perpetual occupation necessary for this to work might also doom it. Continued foreign aid incentivizes Afghan elites, who are already on the verge of splintering, to compete rather than come together.This approach would involve tolerating the Taliban\u2019s presence in rural areas. And rolling crises would be built into this model, so Afghans would have to hope that they would somehow never derail the decades of progress needed before lasting change could take hold.If Afghanistan were forced back to square one, it might, some scholars think, be able to rebuild itself from scratch.After all, humanity lived for millenniums in something resembling low-grade anarchy. Modern nation-states grew out of that chaos only recently.This would start with the effective collapse of the state and American withdrawal. Because the Taliban are too weak and unpopular to retake the country, as most analysts believe, Afghanistan would splinter.Out of the ashes, local warlords and strongmen would rise up. Without the United States forcing them to take sides in an all-or-nothing war, they might eventually accommodate one another, and the Taliban. Their fiefs, once stable, could coalesce over years or decades into a fully realized state.Jennifer Murtazashvili, a University of Pittsburgh political scientist who studies state building and failure, said the process might unfold more quickly and stably in Afghanistan. She has studied rural Afghan communities that outside the reach of the state, have begun reproducing the basic building blocks of one.But hers is only a theory, untested in modern history.In a sign of how far hopes have fallen, the war-torn East African country of Somalia is increasingly being raised as worthy of emulation.The Afghan government would retreat to major cities. Formally, it would switch to a federal system, as Somalia did in 2012. But power would effectively flow to whichever warlords and strongmen \u2014 potentially including the Taliban \u2014 rose up in the countryside.This would, in theory, combine the first two models. The government could reconstitute itself as it mediated between local enclaves that would one day reintegrate with the state.\u201cThis is the outcome we have de facto ended up with, but not in a peaceful sense,\u201d Ms. Murtazashvili said. The government is receding and the warlords are rising, but the two are in conflict.The paradox of peace deals is that while all sides benefit, each fears that it will not do as well as it could \u2014 or that its enemies might do too well. This gives each an incentive to block all but the perfect deal, a dynamic so pronounced in Afghanistan that in 16 years, talks have never advanced far enough to make clear what each side considers acceptable.\u201cI doubt the Taliban has even given any thought at a higher level to what a government looks like that it could have a stake in,\u201d said Courtney Cooper, a Council on Foreign Relations analyst.And any American president would risk a political backlash for appearing to usher the Taliban back into power. Veterans and military leaders might reasonably ask what they had fought for.The clearest winner of any deal might be the Afghans themselves, but they are largely at the mercy of political actors for whom peace is risky.There is a more pessimistic version of the collapse-then-rebuild model, in which warlords compete until one prevails over all.Afghanistan itself offers a particularly vivid example of this scenario: After the 1992 collapse of the Soviet-backed government there, the country was gripped by a terrible civil war. If the Americans abandoned the government now in place, that history could repeat.\u201cThere is a strong possibility that this county could splinter, and not in consensual ways,\u201d Ms. Murtazashvili said.That war culminated, in 1996, with one faction prevailing: the Taliban. It then sheltered Al Qaeda, prompting the American-led invasion and the war still raging all these years later.The likeliest outcome may be allowing the status quo to continue, even as all sides suffer under rising violence.Neither the government nor the Taliban are strong enough to retake control. Outside actors like the United States and Pakistan may be unable to impose their vision of victory, but they can forestall losing indefinitely.Foreign aid can sustain the government, even as its control of the country shrinks. There is little to stop the Taliban from carrying out ever more brazen attacks in the capital. The death toll, already high, would probably rise.Eventually, the stalemate would almost certainly break, hurtling Afghanistan into one of its possible endgames. But it is difficult to say when.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of an analogous case,\u201d said Ms. Brown, the Carnegie Afghanistan expert.Few modern wars have raged this long, this destructively and with this much outside intervention. If there is an obvious way out, history does not provide it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Live by the Dow, Die by the Dow? Trump Is Quiet on Market", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump boasted about the economy during a speech on Monday, he left out one of his favorite lines. Nowhere did he mention the skyrocketing stock market.By the time a bullish Mr. Trump was done speaking in Blue Ash, Ohio, the bearish market had plunged by nearly 1,600 points before recovering somewhat to close 1,175 points down.Despite the stumble of the past two trading sessions \u2014 totaling 1,841 points, or 7 percent \u2014 the Dow remains far higher under Mr. Trump, and there is no sign that the broader economy has lost momentum. But critics who have chafed at what they considered the president\u2019s shortsighted boasting for the past year saw Monday\u2019s meltdown as overdue comeuppance and eagerly piled on.After Monday\u2019s tumble, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides were left in the awkward position of ignoring it or explaining that it was not especially meaningful. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accompanied Mr. Trump to Ohio, declined to comment on the market when he encountered reporters on Air Force One during the trip back to Washington and again on the tarmac after it landed. The television on the plane was tuned to Fox Business Network as it dissected the day\u2019s dark developments.\u201cLook, markets do fluctuate in the short term. We all know that,\u201d Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, told reporters en route to Ohio when the market was heading down. \u201cAnd they do that for number of reasons. But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong and they\u2019re headed in the right direction \u2014 for the middle class, in particular.\u201dAfter the president returned to the White House, his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, issued a written statement.\u201cThe president\u2019s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment and increasing wages for American workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president\u2019s tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people.\u201dThose tax cuts may actually be contributing to the market\u2019s decline. Analysts attributed plummeting share prices to Friday\u2019s job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment. Rising wages are a good thing for those who receive them, and for the presidents who seek to stimulate them, but investors see them as a sign of possible inflation and higher interest rates.Instead of fueling growth, investors worry that the extra money Mr. Trump is pumping into the economy through tax cuts and, if he is successful, with a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan will inflate wages and prices. And that could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly, suppressing growth to keep a lid on inflation.\u201cEven before the fiscal stimulus plan has really begun to kick in, we are already seeing markets worrying more about inflation,\u201d said Torsten Slok, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. \u201cThey are coming to the conclusion that the U.S. economy is in danger of overheating.\u201dStill, some analysts cautioned against overinterpreting the meaning of market movements.\u201cIn many cases, it is near impossible to figure out what moves the stock market in any given day,\u201d said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard University economist and former chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Bush. \u201cThe stock market is a leading indicator, albeit an imperfect one. So it is natural to see a rising market as good news. But it is highly speculative to tie a stock market movement to any particular set of policies.\u201dWhile the Dow closed at its lowest point in two months, the market remains well above where it was when Mr. Trump was elected. Even with the loss, the Dow is 23 percent higher than on Inauguration Day 2017 and 33 percent higher than on Election Day 2016.Over all, the 25 percent increase in 2017 was the largest annual rise since 2013, when the Dow shot up by 26.5 percent. Over the eight years of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, which began at the depths of a financial crisis and recession, the market rose nearly 150 percent.After calling attention to the daily running of the bulls for so much of the past year, Mr. Trump chose to focus on other metrics on Monday at a manufacturing plant in Ohio where the company used some of the proceeds from the tax cuts to give employees bonuses.\u201cYour paychecks are going way up,\u201d he told workers. \u201cYour taxes are going way down. And right now, for the first time in a long time \u2014 and you\u2019ve seen it \u2014 factories are coming back. Everything is coming back. They all want to be where the action is.\u201dAt least some of the action, for the moment, will be on the trading floor.Advertisement"}

The Turks consider them terrorists, indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party that has waged a separatist war in Turkey for more than 30 years. While the Syrian group plays down its ties to the organization in Turkey, and there are differences, links do exist. The two groups have common roots, but experts say the Syrian contingent has largely kept a 2012 promise not to provide material support to the Turkish Kurds, who are formally recognized as a terrorist group by the United States and Europe.Despite the complications of Americans working with one Kurdish group while another group waged an insurgency against a NATO ally, the decision made sense. Turkey was so focused on overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that it refused to help America fight ISIS. It left its border wide open, enabling foreign fighters to swell ISIS\u2019 ranks. The Kurds, on the other hand, wanted to fight ISIS, which threatened their forces, and they were good at it.Still, the United States should have done more to prevent the two parties from going to war with each other even before the ISIS threat receded.Turkey had grown alarmed about American collaboration with Kurdish forces after 2012, when those forces created an autonomous semi-state in northeastern Syria. The Turks now want to prevent the Kurds from linking three enclaves along the border into a unified Kurdish region. They worry that such a consolidation will embolden Kurdish fighters in Syria to aid the Kurdish party within Turkey.When Turkey reacted angrily, the White House disavowed the plans and hinted it was easing support for the Kurds, but the Pentagon said a Kurdish-led force was still in the works.To placate Turkey, Washington gave a green light to its offensive against Afrin, claiming that the Kurds in that area were not American allies. But it warned against an incursion into Manbij, where the Turks could come into direct contact with American forces.Still, the administration needs the Kurds. Both the Trump and Obama administrations always assumed that if they gave Mr. Erdogan a free hand to wage war against the Kurds in Turkey, he would give America a free hand to work with the Kurds in Syria. That assumption was blindly optimistic, and it has left Washington with two allies at war \u2014 to the benefit of Mr. Assad and his enablers, Russia and Iran, as well as the remnants of the Islamic State.The United States and NATO need to push Mr. Erdogan to resume peace talks with Turkish Kurds that were suspended in 2015. The Turkish president needs to be assured that a semiautonomous region for Syrian Kurds, a long-marginalized minority, would not threaten his country and would not collude with the Turkish Kurds. Kurds need to agree to those terms, promise to observe human rights norms, allow non-Kurds to live in their region and accept that the region will not become an independent state.As the Turks and Kurds face off, Mr. Assad is pushing to reassert control over Syria, while Russia and Iran maneuver to ensure they will have a permanent presence and influence in the country. Meanwhile, despite its military commitment, the United States is shirking its responsibility for Syria\u2019s political future. Syria\u2019s long agony will never end as long as leaders who should see a value in fostering regional stability keep tearing the country apart.Advertisement"}

Trump officials have been accused of wasting taxpayer dollars when they travel for work \u2014 or, in the case of one cabinet secretary, when they travel for a work trip-cum-European vacation. Others have appeared to misuse their positions to benefit special interests and political allies. Then there are those who have conscripted family members to help them do their jobs, possibly under the mistaken belief that it takes a village of people with the same last name to run a government department.Perhaps we should not be surprised by these ethical lapses, given that the president himself has little interest in ethical niceties. He has refused to disclose his tax returns or divest businesses that may create conflicts of interest between Mr. Trump the executive and Mr. Trump the president. And he has given his daughter and son-in-law, who have no government experience, plum White House jobs.Here are some of the recent scandals in Trumpland that deserve greater public scrutiny, or even congressional hearings and investigations.MR.

{"Headline": "The Market Collapse Blame Game", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAccording to an old proverb, success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan. That proved to be all too true of the 2008-09 Great Recession: In the aftermath, nobody in the policymaking, financial or academic communities stepped forward to accept responsibility for the worst global economic setback in the past 70 years.It\u2019s unlikely anyone will take credit for the current global market free fall, which, after three days, is clearly not just a correction but an overdue unwinding of years of excess. Whether the damage remains limited to markets or spills over into the general economy remains to be seen, but we could well be on the verge of another global financial crisis.This despite the fact that the outgoing Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, repeatedly reassured us that we would not see another global economic crisis in her lifetime, while the academic economic community again distinguished itself by its virtual silence as bubbles formed in the market over the past few years. And just last month in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump boasted again that his administration\u2019s policies were leading to the stock market shattering records on a routine basis, while the bankers kept making risky loans as the music played on.It\u2019s no surprise that sooner or later, the global financial markets would unwind as violently as they now seem to be doing, considering how far they were allowed to get out of line with their underlying values. It was only a matter of time before a market bust was going to occur.It was not simply that nothing was done to stop global stock market valuations from reaching levels seen only three times in the past hundred years. It was also that government bond yields were allowed to drop to historically low levels, and nothing was done to stop financial institutions from making very risky loans at unusually low interest rates.One can perhaps partly excuse the world\u2019s major central banks, including the Federal Reserve under Ms. Yellen\u2019s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, for having set in motion our present boom-bust cycle by their policy response to the Great Recession. Major economies relied too heavily on monetary policy to get past it, while refusing to deploy adequate and well-targeted budget stimulus measures.With the economy then in danger of succumbing to a deflationary spiral and with interest rates having gone as low as possible, the world\u2019s central banks had little option but to buy government bonds on an enormous scale to encourage investors to take on additional risk. At the time, that seemed a price worth paying, even though it came at the risk of distorting financial market prices and creating a global market bubble.Less easy to excuse was the Fed\u2019s failure last year to remove the low-interest-rate punch bowl when the global economic party was showing clear signs of getting out of hand. With the American economy having reached close to full employment, and with a 25 percent jump in equity prices and 10 percent depreciation in the dollar over the past year, why was the Fed so reluctant to increase rates? A more aggressive monetary policy in 2017 might have brought sense back to the market and reduced the chance that the American economy might overheat and bring inflation in its wake.It is also difficult to excuse the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress for providing us with an unfunded tax cut at precisely the wrong time in the economic cycle. With unemployment very low and the economy growing at a healthy clip, the last thing the economy needed was a fiscal stimulus that might stoke fears of inflation and bring the bond vigilantes out of the woodwork.The academics and bankers also deserve blame for having learned so little from the world\u2019s last boom-bust cycle. Is it too much to ask of academic economists to learn that excessive asset price inflation is not consistent with long-run economic stability \u2014 and that their role should be to sound the alarm when bubbles are forming? Is it too much to ask of the financial sector to remember that making reckless loans gets us all into deep trouble when the music eventually stops?I raise all these questions not as an exercise in finger-pointing but in the hope that over the weeks ahead policymakers, economists and politicians draw the right lessons about how we got into this very difficult economic and financial market situation. Only then will there be some chance that we might escape these boom-bust cycles, which now appear to be occurring on a regular basis.Desmond Lachman is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

From 2008 through 2012, Tucker\u2019s companies extended approximately five million loans to customers across the country, while generating more than $2 billion in revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. Most of this money flowed through accounts that Tucker maintained at the Bank.USB employees responsible for servicing Tucker\u2019s ongoing account activity disregarded numerous red flags that Tucker was using the tribes to conceal his ownership of the accounts. For example, Tucker spent large sums of monies from accounts in the names of Tribal Companies on personal items, including tens of millions of dollars on a vacation home in Aspen and on Tucker\u2019s professional Ferrari racing team.U.S. Bancorp said on Thursday that it had put in place measure to improve its anti-money laundering controls.

The cause? Fears the economy was heating up, which would lead to a pickup in inflation and Federal Reserve raising rates faster than anticipated.But in the week since the S.&P. 500 has stage a comeback. The index is up 7.6 percent and on pace for best week since 2014, according to Bloomberg. In fact, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 2 percent the past two days despite the latest inflation data coming in much higher than expected.So what happened to those concerns about inflation? One explanation for why stock investors shrugged off the inflation data was a very weak report on retail sales. Investors seemed to take that as evidence the economy is not overheating and that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a very slow pace.Two weeks ago when the sell-off started, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow forecast for first-quarter G.D.P. fell to 3.25 percent from 5.4 percent two weeks ago.\u201cWhile it does appear that inflation is accelerating, it appears much less likely that the economy is really taking off and forcing the Fed into a more aggressive rate hiking cycle,\u201d write the strategists over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The bigger pictureA rising rate environment is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks. Jodie Gunzberg, the head of United States equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, points out that since 1971 the S&P 500:ProPublica\u2019s article centers on the bureau\u2019s handling of investigations into Wells Fargo. It reports that Mr. Mulvaney ordered restrictions on the accessing of personal data of Wells Fargo customers, a move that hampered the bureau\u2019s investigations. An exemption on the freeze was later granted to enforcement staff looking into Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance business. But ProPublica added:Mulvaney\u2019s order has had effects beyond enforcement, hampering the bureau\u2019s efforts to monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer protection rules and conduct research on financial products, according to several staffers. The freeze has even stymied state attorneys general, according to two C.F.P.B. staffers and one attorney for a state office.The tax overhaul requires funds to hold onto investments for three years to qualify for the lower rate. They\u2019ve been getting around it by creating single-member LLCs in Delaware to receive carried interest payouts.More from Miles Weiss of Bloomberg:Four LLCs have been created under the name of Elliott Management Corp., the hedge-fund giant run by Paul Singer. More than 70 have been established under the names of executives at Starwood Capital Group Management, the private-equity shop headed by Barry Sternlicht.The headline reason is his belief that Silicon Valley is too intolerant of conservatives and libertarians. But there\u2019s an interesting second reason in the article (emphasis added):The WSJ reports that Mr. Thiel will spend at least a bit more time working on a non-tech endeavor: a right-leaning media organization. He will still be involved in Founders Fund, the V.C. firm he co-founded, as well as stay on the boards of Facebook, the data consultancy Palantir and other tech companies.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cMy goal is to make it so the next generation grows up in a world where cancer is managed just like the common cold, and the body\u2019s natural regenerative engine remains empowered throughout our lives,\u201d said Dr. Hariri.Celgene, United Therapeutics, Sorrento Therapeutics, Human Longevity, the Dreyfus Family Office and Section 32 took part in the series-A funding.In other health care deal newsWhy? The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation report was higher than expected. But weaker retail sales tempered those fears \u2014 at least for equity investors.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeTo some, the bond market is a particularly prescient predictor of economic trends. So is it picking up on an inflationary surge that the Federal Reserve likely will take too long to recognize?But the overheating fears may be overdone. Yesterday\u2019s January inflation report was hardly conclusive. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that the January increase \u201cprobably overstates the underlying trend.\u201dStill, even though there are reasons to believe that while the U.S. economy is breaking out of its recent rut \u2014 thanks to big tax cuts and a revival of the global economy \u2014 it may not be as vibrant as it looks.The economic flyaroundNestl\u00e9 added that its future is likely to contain more deals in the several-hundred-million range of the Blue Bottle Coffee takeover. \u201cThe sweet spot is in small to mid-sized deals, but we don\u2019t want to rule out anything,\u201d its C.E.O., Mark Schneider, said.The deals flyaroundHe also offered this ambition: \u201cI want you to be able to take an Uber and get into the subway \u2014 if the trains are running on time, you\u2019ve got real-time data \u2014 get in the subway, get out and have an Uber waiting for you for right now. Or know that there\u2019s a bike right there for you that gets you where you\u2019re going in the fastest manner.\u201dWhether the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C. are the best venues for this type of regulation is something Congress will have to decide. Neither agency has experience in overseeing virtual currencies, so assigning responsibility to one (or both) will require increased appropriations to develop rules and effective oversight.\u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.

{"Headline": "To Power the Future, Carmakers Flip on 48-Volt Systems", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWhile automakers sketch out a world of sleek and silent electric cars or even self-driving pods that are more den than dragster, the all-electric future is further off than it may appear.Car companies, starting with Volvo last summer, have laid out plans to electrify entire lineups of vehicles. But the fine print makes it clear that the coming decade and beyond will focus not just on massive battery packs powering electric motors, but also on adding a little extra juice to the venerable internal combustion engine.Increasingly, that juice will arrive in the form of new electrical systems built to a 48-volt standard, instead of the 12-volt systems that have dominated since the 1950s. Simpler than Prius-type drivetrains and less expensive than Tesla-scale battery power, the new electrical architecture both satisfies the demands of cars made more power hungry by their gadget load and enables the use of lower-cost hybrid drive systems.Earlier proposals to take cars to a 42-volt standard fizzled for cost reasons, but recent regulatory developments and the hardware that will one day make autonomous cars feasible have reignited the urgency.Besides the drop in battery prices and control electronics, other factors have made 48-volt technology worth re-examining, said J\u00fcrgen Wiesenberger, director of the hybrid electrical vehicles unit at Continental North America. \u201cThe market was not ready for them in the past because of cost, but the 2013 fuel price spike changed that,\u201d he said.In limited ways, 48-volt systems have already found their way into vehicles, including the Porsche Cayenne and Bentley Bentayga S.U.V.s., where they operate the antiroll bars that keep the body level when cornering hard.But the more integrated applications of the technology, amounting to what\u2019s known as a mild hybrid system, offer the greatest value \u2014 up to 70 percent of the benefit of a full hybrid at 30 percent of the cost, according to industry analysts. Continental projects that 48-volt mild hybrid systems will account for 14 percent of global new vehicle sales in 2025, as sales of vehicles powered exclusively by gasoline or diesel engines drop to 65 percent.Audi, which is bringing 48-volt systems to the 2019 A7 and A8, replaces its conventional alternator with a larger, water-cooled alternator-starter. Rather than merely charging the battery and powering accessories, it restarts the warmed-up V6 engine after it shuts down at a stoplight and recaptures energy when slowing down to charge a lithium-ion battery in the trunk.This design has another trick up its sleeve: It will also start the engine after the car goes into an engine-off coasting mode at speeds between 34 and 99 miles an hour, for up to 40 seconds, all in the cause of saving fuel.Power gains are possible, too. In the SQ7, a diesel S.U.V. that Audi does not currently sell in the United States, an electric motor drives a vane-type supercharger. Similar in operation to a turbocharger, this device delivers its power boost at low engine speeds without the lag of an exhaust-driven turbo. And Mercedes-Benz is equipping the new in-line six-cylinder engine of the 2019 CLS 450 with its EQ integrated starter-generator system. In this design, the electricity is produced in the space between the engine and transmission. In motor mode, it adds 21 horse power and 184 pound-feet of torque for quick getaways, and it can take over for the gas engine at a steady-state cruise.And 48-volt mild hybrid systems can work in heavy-duty applications: Fiat Chrysler will follow the belt-alternator approach with its eTorque system in Ram pickups and the Jeep Wrangler.Why 48 volts? Settling on this level holds the electrical system under the 60-volt safety threshold of what is considered high voltage, where power cables must be orange and special connectors, costing 10 times as much, are required, said Mary Gustanski, chief technical officer of Delphi Technologies.For now, the more powerful systems run alongside the traditional 12-volt electronics rather than replacing them altogether. This dual-voltage strategy avoids the need to redesign simple, reliable components like the motors that open windows and adjust seats.\u201cA full switch-over makes no sense,\u201d Oliver Maiwald, a senior vice president for powertrain technology at Continental, a major industry supplier, said. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee a need to redesign these low-tech, low-cost parts.\u201dThe advantages of the new 48-volt systems are considerable. They offer fuel economy improvements of up to 15 percent, Ms. Gustanski said, and would cost an automaker between $650 and $1,000 to add to the vehicle \u2014 well under the approximately $3,000 it costs to install a full hybrid system. Powering a supercharger electrically can bring a 30 percent gain in torque at low engine speeds, at an added cost of about $250.And there are still more potential applications for 48-volt systems: Electrically heated catalytic converters, for example, could be an important advance in reducing cold-start emissions.There\u2019s little question that the automobile will be increasingly dependent on electric power to meet fuel economy mandates and carbon dioxide limits. Battery electrics, shrinking in cost and growing in range, will be part of the solution. So will plug-in hybrids, which pack enough battery reserve for the needs of most daily commuters.But skeptics may wonder why engineers are devoting so much effort to developing the mild hybrid systems that could be seen as stopgap measures on the path to a fully electric vehicle fleet.It is the reality of how long it takes for the automotive fleet to turn over that really clarifies the picture. A forecast by IHS Markit, an industry analyst firm, said 10 percent of vehicles built around the world seven years from now would have 48-volt systems.\u201cIn 2025, more than 95 percent of vehicles sold globally will still have internal combustion engines,\u201d Ms. Gustanski said. \u201cSo even in 2030, 48 volts will be part of the mix.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Pervasive stereotypes about older workers, he said, include the perception among employers (and even among many older adults themselves) that \u201cthey\u2019re not tech-savvy, and that they can\u2019t learn new things.\u201dNot true.

Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.\u2019s rule.The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: \u201cCourts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition\u2014tell the S.E.C.\u2014Congress imposed.\u201d By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers.One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don\u2019t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.\u2019s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation.\u2014 Peter J. HenningWhy?There didn\u2019t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish.Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday\u2019s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on.In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained.\u2014 Peter EavisBroadcom\u2019s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders. From the news release:Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS\u2019s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP\u2019s activist stockholders.Let\u2019s take a look at the math\u2022 Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price.\u2022 Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn\u2019t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year.The bet on the shareholder meetingBroadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm\u2019s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees.A Qualcomm representative didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe deals flyaroundLittle in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey\u2019s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cIf these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place.During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter.The tower would be the first major project under New York City\u2019s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area.Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software.Here\u2019s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor\u2019s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: \u201cWe are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.\u201dGlassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants.Skadden\u2019s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.The judge overseeing the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T\u2019s request to see government communications about the case.

{"Headline": "Tools of Trump\u2019s Fixer: Payouts, Intimidation and the Tabloids", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs accounts of past sexual indiscretions threatened to surface during Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, the job of stifling potentially damaging stories fell to his longtime lawyer and all-around fixer, Michael D. Cohen.To protect his boss at critical junctures in his improbable political rise, the lawyer relied on intimidation tactics, hush money and the nation\u2019s leading tabloid news business, American Media Inc., whose top executives include close Trump allies.Mr. Cohen\u2019s role has come under scrutiny amid recent revelations that he facilitated a payment to silence a porn star, but his aggressive behind-the-scenes efforts stretch back years, according to interviews, emails and other records.They intensified as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign began in the summer of 2015, when a former hedge-fund manager told Mr. Cohen that he had obtained photographs of Mr. Trump with a bare-breasted woman. The man said Mr. Cohen first blew up at him, then steered him to David J. Pecker, chairman of the tabloid company, which sometimes bought, then buried, embarrassing material about his high-profile friends and allies.In August of that year, Mr. Cohen learned details of a deal that American Media had struck with a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, that prevented her from going public about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen was not representing anyone in the confidential agreement, but he was apprised of it by Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer, and earlier had been made aware of her attempt to tell her story by the media company, according to interviews and an email reviewed by The New York Times.Mr. Cohen, who is still described as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer although he is no longer on the Trump Organization payroll, has denied any wrongdoing and insists the arrangement was legal. In an interview, he disputed details of some of his other activities that were described to The Times. But he has never shied away from his role as Mr. Trump\u2019s loyal defender. \u201cIt is not like I just work for Mr. Trump,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in an interview in 2016. \u201cI am his friend, and I would do just about anything for him and also his family.\u201dAn examination of the efforts to shield Mr. Trump from aspects of his own past shows how Mr. Cohen maneuvered in the pay-to-play gossip world \u2014 populated by porn stars and centerfold models, tabloid editors and lawyers with B- and C-list entertainment clients \u2014 that came to unusual prominence in an American presidential election.Mr. Cohen exploited mutual-self interest. By heading off trouble involving Mr. Trump\u2019s history with women, he accrued loyalty points, the ultimate currency with Mr. Trump. He dealt with lawyers who could win fat cuts of any settlements women might reach with American Media or with Mr. Trump.At least two women got money and, in Ms. McDougal\u2019s case, a promise of favorable attention in American Media publications, which include The National Enquirer, Star, Us Weekly and Radar. Mr. Trump, of course, benefited the most: avoiding more scrutiny as he struggled to dismiss multiple allegations of groping and unwanted advances that arose during the campaign.One American Media executive, in a 2016 interview, said that the priority was that nothing embarrassing come out. But in the gossip economy, secrets last only as long as the incentives to keep them do.It was July 2015 when Mr. Cohen received a phone call from Jeremy Frommer, a hedge-fund manager turned digital entrepreneur, who had obtained photos of Mr. Trump appearing to autograph the breasts of a topless woman from the estate of Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse magazine. Mr. Cohen was not pleased.\u201cHe was in a rage,\u201d Mr. Frommer said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018If you show those photos, I\u2019m gonna take you down.\u2019\u201dIt was the rough talk of a Long Island native who started his career juggling work as a personal injury lawyer and taxi fleet manager and met Mr. Trump after acquiring units in Trump buildings.In talking with Mr. Cohen, Mr. Frommer mentioned Mr. Pecker. Years earlier, Mr. Frommer had sold American Media the exclusive rights to a suggestive photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2014 which it did not publish \u2014 and he knew the company\u2019s chief executive.Mr. Frommer recalled Mr. Cohen\u2019s saying, \u201cYeah, I know Pecker.\u201d Mr. Frommer added, \u201cThat\u2019s where the conversation calmed down.\u201dMr. Pecker and Mr. Trump, a staple of the American gossip media since the 1980s, have a friendship that goes back decades. The relationship benefited Mr. Trump throughout the campaign as The Enquirer lionized him and hammered rivals like Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and, finally, Hillary Clinton.Mr. Cohen formed his own bond with Mr. Pecker, keeping in touch with him and Dylan Howard, a top executive, throughout the campaign.American Media acknowledged those ties, saying in a statement, \u201cMichael Cohen and President Trump have been personal friends of Mr. Pecker\u2019s for decades.\u201d But, it said, neither of them \u201cnor any other individual has attempted to, or ever, influenced (or will ever influence) coverage at A.M.I.\u2019s publications. Period.\u201dAfter the initial blowup, Mr. Frommer said, he and Mr. Cohen quickly agreed that Mr. Frommer would take the Trump photos to Mr. Pecker. The men soon began discussing potential business deals, including an interview with Mr. Trump as part of a joint project between American Media and Mr. Frommer\u2019s company, Jerrick Media, according to text messages and emails reviewed by The Times.\u201cSpoke to Cohen we are set. Well done!\u201d Mr. Pecker told Mr. Frommer in a July 2015 text exchange.Two months later, when Mr. Frommer expressed doubt that the Trump interview would take place, Mr. Cohen responded in an Oct. 5 email: \u201cNo no \u2026 relax. I am on it and will make it happen.\u201dMr. Frommer said he had assured Mr. Cohen at the time that he wouldn\u2019t make the photos public \u2014 \u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to publish them\u2019\u201d \u2014 but that the decision had nothing to do with the business talks.In the end, American Media concluded that the photos were of little value. The interview and the deals never materialized for Mr. Frommer, who went on to publish one of the Trump photos on his own website.American Media said in a statement that it had no interest in suppressing the photographs. But in early 2016, an American Media executive, speaking only on condition of anonymity in discussing internal company thinking, said that when the negotiations between A.M.I. and Mr. Frommer began, they were intended to suppress the photos, part of broader efforts by American Media to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d information that would damage Mr. Trump.In an interview Friday, Mr. Cohen acknowledged directing Mr. Frommer to A.M.I., but said he did so not because of photographs of Mr. Trump but for other photos of \u201canother notable individual that I had no interest in seeing or wanting.\u201dBack then, however, Mr. Cohen acknowledged that he had been eager to keep the photos hidden. \u201cMr. Trump has a family,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I had to protect his family.\u201dFor Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, American Media was more than a company they could rely on for friendly coverage. It was also where people looking to sell potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump were likely to turn.In the summer of 2016, American Media came to Mr. Cohen with a story involving Ms. McDougal, the former Playboy Playmate. She claimed to have had a consensual affair with Mr. Trump in the mid-2000s, early in his marriage to Melania Trump. Mr. Trump denies an affair.Ms. McDougal had retained Keith Davidson, a Hollywood lawyer, who reached out to contacts at American Media. After negotiating on and off for a couple of months, A.M.I. agreed to give Ms. McDougal $150,000 for the exclusive rights to her story, along with promises of publicity and marketing opportunities through its fitness magazines. The contract did not identify Mr. Trump, but required her to keep quiet about any relationship with a married man.A.M.I. had shared her allegations with Mr. Cohen, though it said it did so only as it worked to corroborate her claims, which it said it ultimately could not do. But that was not the only heads-up Mr. Cohen received.Soon after Ms. McDougal signed the confidential agreement on Aug. 5, 2016, Mr. Davidson emailed Mr. Cohen, \u201cMichael, please give me a call at your convenience.\u201d Mr. Davidson followed up by explaining to Mr. Cohen over the phone that the McDougal transaction had been completed, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Cohen said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall those communications.\u201dMr. Davidson acknowledged the public\u2019s interest in Ms. Clifford\u2019s and Ms. McDougal\u2019s stories, but said that he was \u201cnot at liberty to discuss private client information.\u201dIn the months after Ms. McDougal\u2019s agreement with A.M.I., Mr. Trump\u2019s relationships with women drew more scrutiny on the campaign trail. The release of an audio recording that captured the candidate bragging about grabbing women\u2019s genitals inspired numerous women to step forward with allegations that he had groped or kissed them against their will.Mr. Davidson\u2019s client list had included the professional athletes Jalen Rose and Manny Pacquiao, as well as gossip-page regulars who placed him in the middle of the sex-tape cases of the \u201cAustin Powers\u201d actor Verne Troyer, the wrestler Hulk Hogan and the onetime Playboy model and MTV host Tila Tequila. He was a natural choice for Ms. Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, when she sought to sell her own Trump story.She was alleging that she had had a consensual sexual relationship with Mr. Trump after they met at a celebrity golf tournament about 10 years earlier (Mr. Trump denies her claims).Just two months after Ms. McDougal\u2019s story was effectively muted by her contract with American Media, Mr. Davidson set about brokering the silence of the adult film actress. This time, the negotiator on the other end of the transaction was Mr. Cohen.The other outlet, The Dirty, took down a brief story after Mr. Davidson threatened legal action just a day after his client had provided information to the website, according to Nik Richie, The Dirty\u2019s founder, and a letter seen by The Times.After the deal between Ms. McDougal and A.M.I. was completed, Mr. Davidson regularly exchanged emails, text messages and calls with Mr. Cohen, according to people familiar with the contacts, including last week, when Mr. Davidson publicly bolstered Mr. Cohen\u2019s statement that he had paid Ms. Clifford himself.Murray Waas contributed reporting, and Jaclyn Peiser contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Centrica, Britain\u2019s Largest Energy Supplier, to Cut 4,000 Jobs", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Centrica, owner of British Gas and the largest energy supplier in the country, said it would cut about 4,000 jobs by 2020 as profits fell and it continued to lose customers.The company reported a 17.4 percent fall in full-year operating profits, to 1.25 billion pounds, about $1.7 billion.Centrica\u2019s chief executive, Iain Conn, said the firm had a \u201cweak\u201d second half of 2017, and it was not helped by political and regulatory intervention in the United Kingdom, according to Bloomberg.The job losses, which are part of an extended cost-cutting program, would fall mainly in its energy supply business in Britain. The company said it expected to reduce about 1,000 jobs on a like-for-like basis in 2018 and save about 200 million pounds.The utility shocked the market in November by saying that its full-year adjusted earnings per share would be around 12.5 pence, against forecasts of 15 pence, largely because of its North American and British businesses were hit by tough competition and warmer-than-expected weather-cutting demand.British Gas, which supplies 7.8 million customers, shed 9 percent of its domestic customers in 2017.Around 12 million British households are charged some form of default tariff for their energy, which can cost hundreds of pounds more per year than the cheapest deals on offer. The government is planning to cap the standard variable tariffs.Centrica\u2019s shares have lost more than half of their value over the past year as politicians have focused on ways to limit the cost of energy to ordinary consumers. Britain\u2019s big energy suppliers have been under pressure from smaller rivals offering cheaper deals in the consumer market.Mr. Conn told the BBC the job losses resulted in part because of \u201cintense\u201d competition and partly because of customers \u201cmoving to digital.\u201d But he also said the probable introduction of a price cap was another reason for the job losses.\u201cThere is a link between our cost efficiency program and preparing for any price cap in the U.K.,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be competitive and this measure means we\u2019ve got to drive more efficiency.\u201dInvestment in technology and the simplification of core business processes would result in cost savings of 1.25 billion pounds per year by 2020, the firm said. It expects to also create around 1,000 additional roles.Despite the fall in profits for Centrica Group as a whole, British Gas saw profits rise 3 percent, to \u00a3572 million. Centrica also has operations in North America and Ireland.The job cuts announcement came as new figures showed Britain\u2019s economy expanded less than previously estimated in the fourth quarter as consumers and businesses absorbed faster price increases. Britain\u2019s pending exit from the European Union continued to dominate the outlook for the economy, creating uncertainty for companies and consumers and holding back demand.Advertisement"}

They\u2019re our protectors against Trump and the Russians.For me as a conservative, the experience is just head-snapping.Suddenly we\u2019re supposed to believe that Carter Page \u2014 a man who charitably can be described as Vladimir Putin\u2019s useful idiot \u2014 is a martyr to American civil liberties.Suddenly we\u2019re supposed to think that people like Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray \u2014 both of whom were appointed by Trump \u2014 are anti-Trump villains.Suddenly we\u2019re supposed to think that an election that Trump won was stolen from him.You\u2019ve argued that the congressional elections won\u2019t be as bad for Republicans as people have been predicting because the public will be happy about the tax cuts. You may be right \u2014 although I\u2019m hoping critics can convince average Americans their boon is a tiny speck compared to what the rich are raking in.But doesn\u2019t it worry you that the debt is soaring so high, the stock market is suddenly looking shaky and the Fed is worrying about inflation? It feels like the beginning of something bad. Although I immediately admit that when the Democrats were working on expanding the safety net, I pooh-poohed the whole deficit issue. The one perpetual rule of politics, I think, is that the people on neither side care about the deficit when they\u2019re trying to get what they want.That\u2019s probably a bit glib, but I really do think the deficit is not much of a problem so long as investors, foreign and domestic, continue to have faith in the economy. Among the ingredients in that faith are the prospects for economic growth, the ease of doing business, the predictability of legal and regulatory frameworks, the attractiveness of the culture, society and environment, and so on. Most of the old debates between Republicans and Democrats center on just which parts of that overall package should matter most.But you were asking me about the tax cuts. And I want to tell you, that $1.50 extra in my paycheck is really putting a bounce in my step!But, anyway, here goes: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a deal. I think we\u2019re going to live from one continuing resolution to the next. Both parties see immigration as a political winner for them in the fall, and so they are not going to want to bury it in the form of a compromise that leaves a lot of people in their respective bases unhappy.I could be wrong for all sorts of reasons, but I think Democrats need to stop playing to the most passionate quarters of their Trump-hating base and start targeting a different demographic: namely, the millions of people who voted for Obama in 2012 but went for Trump in 2016.Basically, it needs a figure such as Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, or Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, or \u2014 subtracting libido, finger-wagging, and other character defects \u2014 Bill Clinton.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "As in aviation, precision \u2014 down to the smallest detail \u2014 is paramount in the high-velocity world of speed skating.\u201cIn order to speed up, you need to go against wind resistance by lowering your body,\u201d the high school student, who is six feet tall, says. Lee began speed skating at seven, when his mother hoped the sport would help him lose weight and alleviate his asthma. The repetitive training regimen almost drove him to quit the sport initially, but his perseverance eventually paid off and Lee now says he can\u2019t think of doing anything else. \u201cSpeed skating is science. Skaters have to do 12 strokes for the straight course, eight at the corners, and 12 for  the other side. It\u2019s like a mathematical formula.\u201dLee\u2019s height is an advantage, no doubt. But his coach, Ko Suk-bong, says that an ideal physique is not enough. \u201cHe\u2019s tall and is well built for a ninth grader. But more important, his reflexes are good and his cornering techniques are on par with older skaters\u2019.\u201d There are three basic techniques that professional speed skaters must master: the starting pose, the stroke to propel oneself in a straight line and cornering.To commit perfect executions to muscle memory, Lee\u2019s whole life revolves around speed skating. The ninth grader trains for at least four hours a day when he\u2019s in school and up to seven hours during the school holidays. \u201cI\u2019m a Sparta-style coach,\u201d says Ko of his tough-love approach. \u201cBut it\u2019s for the benefit of the skaters, so they can overcome hardship.\u201d Half of the time is devoted to warm-ups and exercises outside the rink. There\u2019s always running involved, as well as form-perfecting drills that Lee practices in front of the mirror, closely supervised by Ko, who refines and hones Lee\u2019s techniques. On the ice, everything has to come together.All athletes have their own pre-competition ritual, and Lee is no exception. \u201cI listen to music. Last year, they were all sad songs,\u201d he says, adding that he has since changed his tunes, which now reflect his growing prominence in the speed-skating world. \u201cThis year, I\u2019ve started listening to more upbeat music before competitions. I don\u2019t want my mood to be dragged down.\u201dJust like professional speed skaters, Korean Air has internalized the art of precision.Speed skaters spend a significant amount of time training outside the rink. For Korean Air, quality of service on the ground is just as important as the actual journey in the sky. From 2018, passengers flying with Korean Air from Seoul check in at Incheon Airport Terminal 2, which minimizes the amount of time needed for travelers to reach their gate. Upon request, first class travelers are greeted by a staff member who will accompany them from the First Class Check-in Lounge to the boarding gate.For skaters and Korean Air alike, it\u2019s all about slicing through air with maximum efficiency. Korean Air is constantly upgrading its fleet to adopt the latest fuel efficient technology and is also the first Asian carrier to purchase the cutting-edge Bombardier CS300, which is not only fuel efficient but also 75 percent quieter than similar models. Meanwhile, the wingtips and winglets are specially designed to reduce wind drag.While other airlines have been scaling back amenities and service offerings, Korean Air remains dedicated to providing for the comfort of its travelers. Passengers are given slippers, blankets and a toiletry kit, while the new 18-inch-wide economy seat reclines 118 degrees. Even the cabin lighting is calibrated to help passengers sleep. Korean Air is a restful way to fly and the carrier has been recognized by Airline Ratings as having the best economy class service for 2018.Servicing 123 destinations in 43 countries across all six continents, Korean Air enjoys a world-renowned reputation. If you\u2019re searching for the best ice-skating destinations, the airline can whisk you away to some of the world\u2019s favorite options: Somerset House in London, Rockefeller Center in New York City, Yeouido Ice Park in Seoul, ICE*Amsterdam in Amsterdam and Shichahai Lake in Beijing.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "The Economy Is Getting Hotter. Is a Productivity Boom Next?", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe it\u2019s not a coincidence.This idea should excite both conservatives and liberals.For years, McKinsey researchers have tried to understand what drives productivity growth from the ground up. They\u2019ve studied how innovations that enable a company to make more goods and services per hour of labor spread across the economy. \u201cWe have always looked at this from the supply side to a large extent,\u201d said James Manyika, a partner at the firm and a co-author of the study. \u201cYou look at companies and the introduction of technology and business processes, the adoption of best practices. We\u2019ve always kind of assumed away the demand side of the equation.\u201dProductivity growth in the United States was 3.8 percentage points lower in the period from 2010 to 2014 compared with the 2000-2004 period. Part of that, McKinsey found, was a result of the information technology boom of the 1990s \u2014 which paid continuing productivity dividends into the first years of the 21st century \u2014 having run its course. But 1.1 percentage points of the drop was due, in its analysis, to aftereffects of the financial crisis. Those effects sapped even more productivity growth, 1.3 percentage points, from the British economy.Take the auto industry. Automobile production in the United States fell 50 percent from 2007 to 2009, meaning the sector had tremendous excess production capacity in the ensuing years even as the sector recovered. \u201cCompanies could fulfill a lot higher demand without having to make any new investments,\u201d said Jaana Remes, a McKinsey partner and a co-author. \u201cTypically the newest technology is implemented in the latest factories. People don\u2019t upgrade a factory that can fulfill demand perfectly well.\u201dOr consider how this dynamic might apply in the restaurant industry (or retail, or tourism).The basic technology for self-serve kiosks has been around for years. But when the unemployment rate was at its post-crisis highs, employers could have their pick of good workers at relatively low prices. Now, with the jobless rate at 4.1 percent, good workers are harder to find. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, companies have been more open to installing technology that may have a significant upfront cost and require reworking how a restaurant is organized, but allow more sales without hiring more workers.\u201cA consequence of a really tight labor market is a higher turnover rate,\u201d said Liah Luther, marketing manager at Nextep Systems, a Michigan company that sells self-ordering kiosks to restaurants, casinos and corporate facilities. \u201cOnce you eliminate the need for extensive training on a point of sale system, you can focus on soft skills like customer service, and reduce the cost of turnover.\u201dThe optimistic case for both productivity and overall economic growth goes like this: For the last several years, a lack of demand and plenty of spare capacity of both workers and equipment made businesses complacent and unwilling to invest in new equipment, software or new ways of doing things that might allow more output per hour of labor.Now, with companies having a harder time finding qualified workers and with demand for their products rising, they\u2019ll have no choice but to re-engineer how they work to try to increase productivity. Higher productivity will in turn make it easier to justify higher wages, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of higher economic growth.There are some risks to that rosy forecast, which Ms. Remes and Mr. Manyika warn about.They see a great deal of potential from digitization of businesses that have been slow to embrace the lessons of the cutting-edge companies in their industry. But this might be slow to generate the kinds of big productivity gains that are possible.Even as more retailers adapt to an age of digital commerce and learn from Amazon, for example, they may in the near term end up simply doubling up traditional retail and e-commerce-focused workers, making such companies less productive rather than more. \u201cUnless displaced labor can find new highly productive and high-wage occupations, workers may end up in low-wage jobs that create a drag on productivity growth,\u201d the McKinsey researchers wrote.So it\u2019s not worth pulling out Champagne bottles for productivity yet. First we have to see if the theory holds up \u2014 that a tighter economy will feed into higher capital investment and experimentation by businesses about finding new efficiencies. Then we have to see whether that feeds into a virtuous cycle in which more productivity creates more growth and vice versa. And then we have to hope that it turns into wage gains for workers who haven\u2019t seen many of them in the last decade \u2014 or else it just may not last.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Elbows Out, Charges Ahead", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialNot long ago, America and its democratic allies hoped to integrate a rising China into the political and economic system they built after the Cold War. Instead, China is creating its own institutions, or reshaping existing institutions and norms, to suit its own needs.It makes perfect sense that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, wants to see his country play a greater international role. China enjoys a growing economy, substantial military strength and very stable leadership. But that does not give it license to unilaterally reorder the Indo-Pacific region to its advantage, as the Pentagon asserted. A focused and forward-looking American president would work to counter such moves. President Trump, blinded by Mr. Xi\u2019s flattery and blind to history, does nothing except cede more power to Beijing.Mr. Xi, a powerful authoritarian leader, has the advantage of seeming to know where he is leading his country. Mr. Trump, politically weakened and under investigation by the special counsel, vacillates between declaring economic war on China and wanting to be Mr. Xi\u2019s friend.It was alarming to watch Mr. Trump cede diplomatic ground to China early in his presidency, because America is the natural counterweight. He withdrew from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate agreement, called into question the North American Free Trade Agreement and rejected the Iran nuclear deal, alienating allies.China\u2019s biggest play could be a plan to spend more than $1 trillion on roads, power plants, bridges, cyber networks and other projects in countries across Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America to expand markets and political influence. Despite concerns that this \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative could burden participating countries with debt, many countries are already involved or intend to become involved. By contrast, Mr. Trump is cutting back on America\u2019s already modest foreign aid budget.Beijing even took aim at democracy via a state newspaper, saying that while the American system is supposed to be politically superior, the recent federal government shutdown showed it was rived by chaos and \u201cchronic flaws.\u201dTo an extent, Mr. Trump is pushing back. American ships have stepped up patrols in the South China Sea to assert freedom of navigation. The White House persuaded China to support tighter sanctions on North Korea.So far, though, it\u2019s not clear that Mr. Trump has a real strategy to manage these complex policy strands effectively. Most Asian countries want the United States to lead both in cooperating with and counterbalancing Beijing, and no one wants to have to choose between the two behemoths. The Chinese-American relationship has become more competitive and fraught, and will remain so. It will be up to both powers to prevent competition from sliding into confrontation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hotel Carrying New Trump Brand Secures $6 Million Tax Break", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe State of Mississippi on Wednesday awarded a tax break worth up to $6 million for a hotel project involving the Trump family business, a public subsidy that could indirectly benefit President Trump.The subsidy, to be paid out over a period of many years, is expected to offset nearly a third of the Chawlas\u2019 projected $20 million in costs for building the hotel, which is scheduled to open this fall in Cleveland, Miss. The property, called Scion West End, is to be the first in a new line of four-star Scion hotels that the Trump Organization announced late in the 2016 presidential campaign.The state\u2019s approval of the tax rebate is the culmination of more than two years of efforts by the Chawlas that predate their partnership with the Trumps, according to emails obtained by The New York Times through a public records request. After the Chawlas announced plans last June to team up with the Trumps, Suresh Chawla alerted an array of personal contacts and state and local officials, including an aide to Mississippi\u2019s governor, Phil Bryant, in emails with the subject line \u201cTrump Hotels Coming to the Mississippi Delta.\u201dIn December, the Chawlas formally applied for the tax rebate from the state development agency, which is led by Glenn McCullough Jr., an appointee of Mr. Bryant, both of whom are supportive of President Trump.In an email on Wednesday, Dinesh Chawla said he and his brother were pleased by the approval, though they said the development agency had not notified them of it.The development agency declined to comment.The decision to approve the request was not unusual for the agency, which evaluates applications for the tourism rebate program based on set criteria and has granted similar subsidies to other hotels.The award renews legal questions about a Trump-affiliated property receiving benefits from a state or local government. Ethics watchdogs and the president\u2019s critics say the Mississippi tax break would benefit the president, albeit indirectly, because he continues to own the Trump Organization through a trust.Dinesh Chawla said in an email to The Times earlier this month that the Trump Organization had played no role in the rebate application and that the Trumps and the Chawlas had agreed that any rebate would not figure into fees paid to the Trumps.Mr. Chawla said he and his brother had sought the rebate to \u201cimprove our cash flow.\u201dA spokesman for the Mississippi development agency said the Trump name was not mentioned anywhere in the Chawlas\u2019 application.The development agency\u2019s tourism rebate program is part of an effort to draw tourists to Mississippi and help the local economy. According to the development agency, the program allows a developer to recoup some of the sales taxes collected on a property to \u201creimburse the applicant for eligible costs incurred during the project\u2019s construction.\u201d The agency said earlier this month that 23 other tourism rebate applications had been approved under the program, including 10 for hotels.The partnership between the Chawlas and the Trumps materialized after Mr. Bryant, a Republican, introduced members of the two families during the 2016 presidential campaign. The governor and the Chawlas have known each other for years.Clay Chandler, a spokesman for Mr. Bryant, said earlier this month that the Chawlas had followed the same procedure as other applicants for the tax rebate. \u201cState law guides the application process, and state law alone will determine if any application is approved,\u201d he said.In his earlier email to The Times, Dinesh Chawla said that \u201cno contact with Governor Bryant or his executive staff has been made regarding the project, other than our general discussion about what the project contains.\u201dStill, the Chawlas contacted state officials for more than two years, seeking to get the project on their radar, according to the emails obtained through a public records request.\u201cI would really appreciate your efforts in advocating this idea with the Governor\u2019s office, MDA executive director Glenn McCullough, and MDA staff and others,\u201d Suresh Chawla wrote in a July 2015 email to Robert Morgan, an aide to Mr. Bryant, using the acronym for the development agency.\u201cWe did not ask for any favors, other than an honest referral,\u201d Dinesh Chawla said in his email to The Times on Wednesday. \u201cWe wanted to introduce it to the state hierarchy, because in our state, a $20 million project is of significant note.\u201dLast summer, Suresh Chawla alerted Mr. Morgan to the partnership with the Trumps within minutes of its being announced, sending him and other officials a news release about the deal.When Mr. Morgan received the message, he shared the news release with three other members of Mr. Bryant\u2019s administration, including his chief of staff, along with an official at the development agency.Dinesh Chawla said that he and his brother had emailed more than 1,000 people with the news of the deal. \u201cIt had nothing to do with the people in high offices,\u201d he said.Ellen Ann Fentress contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "In 2015, Egypt began work on a project that would boost the country\u2019s power output by 50 percent. Constructing this energy megaproject would require transporting 24 H-Class gas turbines, each weighing more than an Airbus 380, from Berlin to Egypt, and one million tons of materials, enough to build 24 cruise ships. The result? By early 2017, when its first stage was complete, the project had beaten its own target, bringing 4.8 gigawatts of power online in a record-breaking 18 months.But the technological achievements were only part of the story. Underpinning the megaproject was the no less sprawling issue of securing finance, a task that involved governments, export credit agencies and 17 leading banks. Against the backdrop of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, meeting the world\u2019s biggest infrastructure challenges is prompting ever-more sophisticated combinations of technology, finance \u2014 and the expertise to make it all happen.In both developed and emerging countries, economic growth and expanding populations have placed infrastructure under unprecedented strain. While governments and banks would once have been expected to plug this gap, both are increasingly limited in their capacity to take on complex infrastructural risk. At the same time, cities and manufacturers \u2014 both key actors in developing the urban and economic landscape \u2014 are having to wrestle with the transformative, but hugely expensive, implications of digital technology.In this environment, collaboration between the public and private sectors has become essential, as has the ability to forge new business models around digital technology. These changes are already evident across industry and infrastructure, which is increasingly reliant on applications ranging from remotely controlled electric networks to collecting, interpreting and acting on the mountains of data those operations generate.investment gapinvestment gapinvestment gapinvestment gapglobal investment by 2040that stand to benefit most from smart financingPerhaps no single undertaking more clearly displays the new realities of major infrastructure than the Egypt megaproject. Here, the role of German conglomerate Siemens was pivotal, from the provision of everything from internet-linked sensors to the financing that made it all possible.\u201cOne of the reasons we were able to manage the Egypt project was the way that Siemens\u2019 industrial and financing units collaborated,\u201d says Tobias Behringer, head of project and export finance, power and gas at Siemens Financial Services (SFS), Siemens\u2019 financing arm. \u201cSFS\u2019s insurance unit dealt with insurance and our trade finance team arranged for local banks to provide contractual guarantees, while we on the advisory side met the challenge of structuring a high volume of financing.\u201dIn Egypt, as in all Siemens\u2019 projects, risk management is key. Faced with an interdependent global economy and the growing diversity of investors, key actors in projects are increasingly adopting a \u201clife cycle\u201d approach, which uses vast tranches of data to consider risk across a project: from its outset, through its construction and on to the full lifespan of returns to investors.\u201cOne of the reasons we were able to manage the Egypt project was the way that Siemens\u2019 industrial and financing units collaborated.\u201dCentral to this holistic approach is an acknowledgement that some risks should be passed on to bodies better equipped to cope with them. Just as homeowners wouldn\u2019t ordinarily assume the full financial risk of earthquake damage, neither would the builders of a toll bridge. In both cases, a crucial part of the equation is insurance.As CEO of insurance at SFS, Alexander Mahnke has been at the forefront of efforts to customize coverage to very specific needs. \u201cOne of our main roles is about providing insurance solutions that support the marketing and sales of products and new business models,\u201d he says. One such solution, for the Rhine-Ruhr Express in Germany, included tailored coverage for the train operator: an insurance package against train damages of all sorts helping to provide for budget security.Illustrating the intricate relationships between innovation and financial models, this graphic shows three hypothetical technology projects and the potential combination of finance instruments needed to fund them.Most large-scale development or modernization projects require a highly tailored financing solution.Here are three highly diverse projects and the potential combinations of financing instruments that can get them off the ground.A national government is looking to build a major energy project, of a scale that promises to transform the life and economic prospects of the city it will serve. The project will involve building entirely new facilities on a previously unused \u2014 or \u201cgreenfield\u201d \u2014 site, and the facilities themselves will be costly and complex to build.As a result, though the country is stable, the project itself is risky, time-consuming and expensive.Faced with intensifying competition, a manufacturer wants to implement sweeping digital changes to its business. The new technology promises to bring major costs savings through the efficient use of energy, while improved forecasting will enable more intensive use of the machinery.Additionally, product testing will be possible using virtual models, saving huge amounts of time and resources. Unfortunately, this shiny new technology is both complex and subject to rapid change. And it doesn\u2019t come cheap, either.A city government is looking to add a new line to its metro system, helping ease the pressure on what is one of the region\u2019s busiest transportation networks. The new development stands both to improve the daily commute for millions of passengers and to unlock further investment in the surrounding areas.However, building the line presents major technical and logistical challenges that require a wide array of suppliers to deliver according to a very specific timeline. The failure of any to stick to their schedule could result in severe bottlenecks and delays \u2014 and spiraling costs.Most large-scale development or modernization projects require a highly tailored financing solution.Here are three highly diverse projects and the potential combinations of financing instruments that can get them off the ground.Usually the earliest investors and the key to bringing other investors on board, equity \u201csponsors\u201d require high levels of specialist knowledge in the project. The government itself will likely be an equity investor in the energy project, as will the construction company.Another source of capital could be debt financing, ranging from bonds to hybrid (or mezzanine) finance. The most likely debt instrument for our energy project is syndicated loans, in which several banks join forces to issue a big loan, making it less risky for each of them.As the government or the construction company building the power plant can\u2019t control for the vagaries of nature, this risk can be passed on to insurers who would cover losses caused by, for instance, fires or earthquakes.Rather than paying up front, the manufacturer can access the technology through an arrangement that spreads payments across time, broadly in line with the benefits the equipment will generate. Key examples of this are tech-refresh arrangements or retrofit packages, which allow regular upgrades to next-generation equipment to accommodate shortening replacement cycles.Backed by rigorous, precision data, the manufacturer can be certain it will make major savings once the new technology has been in place for a while. Consequently, companies like Siemens can, in place of up-front fees, agree to take payments only once those savings are realized.Should the equipment be too expensive for the manufacturer to buy outright, SFS could retain ownership of the technology (or part of it) and lease it \u201coff balance sheet\u201d to the manufacturer. This option allows the manufacturer\u2019s cash flows to be preserved, with flexible options available at the end of the contract.Designed specifically to cover such risks, business interruption insurance can cover losses that might arise should the new line not operate as intended, for reasons such as physical damage or disruptions to the supply chain leading to a shortage of raw materials.To deal with the highly specific time demands of the metro project, SFS can offer tailored financing, ranging from delayed credit lines to flexibility around when and how credit is repaid. With delayed credit lines, funds for the project are released as they are needed, thereby incurring smaller interest payments than a single lump-sum loan would.But insurance is just one of the ingredients SFS uses in structuring deals tailored to the needs and risk profile of projects worldwide. In the Dominican Republic, to finance the design and construction of new lines in the capital\u2019s metro system, SFS devised a multisource financing package, backed by export credit agencies, that essentially guaranteed payments for all suppliers\u2019 parts. In Bangladesh, where only about 50 percent of the population has stable access to electricity, SFS provided construction loans totaling almost $80 million as the \u201clead arranger\u201d to the Sirajganj III combined cycle power plant. In both cases, the work of SFS\u2019s in-house ratings experts was crucial.\u201cTo deliver a fair assessment, our ratings analysts need to have in-depth knowledge not just of the industry but of the technology involved and the potential competitive position of the project.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to be an expert in your financial field,\u201d says Mahnke. \u201cYou need to bring the right mindset. You have to be willing to stretch the boundaries of what is possible and rethink the status quo every day.During the planning stage \u2013 which can last more than two years \u2013 suppliers can go bust, governments can fall and technology can become obsolete. In this stage, risks are high that the whole project will fizzle out before a single foundation has been laid.Apart from challenges with suppliers, existing infrastructure and other human factors, the construction phase can face delays through weather, fire and other natural accidents. These delays also push up the financial risk, as do the huge outlays required throughout construction.Will the project work as advertised? And even if it does, will those painstaking demand forecasts prove to be far too optimistic? Throughout this phase, these operational and financial risks will present the central challenges to the project\u2019s success.As the initial operation phase ends, cashflows should become steadier, meaning investors should see returns or be repaid. However, as the customer assumes operational control of the project, they have to learn the day-to-day challenges, meaning that operational risk stays high.At this stage, often years down the line, lenders have recouped their outlay and equity holders have made returns on their investment. In the case of governments, those returns can include a more dynamic economy, a more contented populace, and a cleaner environment.With many trillions of funding required to achieve the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, industrial giants have become central players in addressing some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges.Take climate change. As buildings now account for some 40 percent of energy use worldwide, making factories, offices and homes more energy efficient is crucial in tackling carbon emissions. Siemens has been involved in numerous such initiatives across the world, frequently providing high-tech solutions \u2014 and helping overcome the prohibitive initial costs \u2014 through financing innovations such as energy performance contracting.In Leipzig, Germany, this meant that the Gewandhaus concert hall could undertake a complex \u201csmart tech\u201d upgrade \u2014 which would greatly improve its energy efficiency \u2014 and face none of the estimated one million euro costs up front. Instead, payments would be made through guaranteed future energy cost savings.Though infrastructure development has never been so urgent or daunting, the endeavors of companies like Siemens are showing that new tools and technology provide real grounds for optimism that the U.N. sustainability goals can be reached. And as the Egypt megaproject so clearly shows, \u201cIf you\u2019re not in the business to improve society,\u201d as Siemens\u2019 CEO Joe Kaeser says, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be in business.\u201dThe 2015 Paris climate accord committed its signatories to keeping temperature rises this century to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. That same year, the U.N. issued 17 development goals addressing global issues ranging from social justice to climate change.But there is a contradiction at the heart of these two initiatives. How do we curb carbon emissions while generating power for a vast share of the global population? There are no easy answers. But there\u2019s no way we can develop sustainably - create cleaner energy and infrastructure - without harnessing the technology and structuring the financing needed to do so.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

Economists are still debating the impact on the economy of Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1986 tax reform legislation more than 30 years after its passage.With that in mind, here\u2019s a look at the major areas where Mr. Trump claims credit.The S.&P. 500 index rose 23 percent during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office, an increase surpassed only by Franklin Roosevelt and Barack Obama, both Democrats who took office in the wake of financial crises and stock market crashes. Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and Republicans in Congress deserve some credit, given that economists expect the cut in corporate taxes to raise company earnings, and stock prices are fundamentally a reflection of earnings expectations.\u201cThere\u2019s no question after-tax earnings will be higher\u201d thanks to the tax legislation, Professor Slemrod said.But the estimated impact on after-tax earnings \u2014 a range of 7 to 10 percent, according to most economists \u2014 accounts for less than half the stock market\u2019s rise over the past year. The rest is because of other factors, which may include Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-business outlook, but also many things beyond his control.Stock market valuations are reaching lofty levels by many measures, and those gains may prove ephemeral if growth doesn\u2019t live up to investors\u2019 rosy expectations. \u201cThe value of the stock market isn\u2019t an indicator of the economic health of America,\u201d Professor Slemrod noted.Gross domestic product grew by 2.3 percent last year, lower than Mr. Trump\u2019s predictions of 3-plus percent, but significantly better than the 1.6 percent growth in 2016, Mr. Obama\u2019s last year in office.As should be obvious, passage of the Republican tax legislation was too recent to have had any impact on those numbers. To the extent that expectations of tax reform fueled investment decisions, they may have had some effect, but that\u2019s nearly impossible to measure.The first real clues will come next year, when 2018 gross domestic product numbers are released. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new tax legislation would raise G.D.P. by seven-tenths of a percent over what it would have been under the old law.\u201cThe economy has been strong, and forecasts for next year have been bumped up due to the tax cut, \u201d said Professor Auerbach. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot going on. You won\u2019t be able to tell what the impact is from just a few quarters.\u201dEven 10 years after the 1986 law, \u201cit was very difficult to tease out the impact of tax reform on the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best estimate is it didn\u2019t have much effect.\u201dProfessor Slemrod agreed. \u201cTax policy might not be as critical to the rate of business investment as had been thought,\u201d he said.Still, if United States economic growth hits Chinese levels of 7 percent a year or more, which Mr. Trump repeatedly has said is attainable, then Republicans will have a \u201cmuch stronger\u201d basis for claiming credit for it, Professor Slemrod said. But he deemed such an outcome \u201cextraordinarily unlikely.\u201dThe tax overhaul has prompted hundreds of employers, including at least 40 members of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, to pass on savings to workers.Many companies have been doling out bonuses to employees since the tax legislation passed, but \u201cI don\u2019t think that tells us anything,\u201d Professor Slemrod said. That\u2019s because in standard economic theory, labor market conditions dictate employee compensation levels, not cash flow or profitability.\u201cThe labor market was strengthening long before Mr. Trump was elected or the tax bill was passed,\u201d Professor Slemrod said. \u201cIf companies were going to raise wages anyway to stay competitive, they have a public relations incentive to attribute it to tax cuts.\u201dWage growth actually slowed during the first year of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency compared with the last year of Mr. Obama\u2019s.Mr. Auerbach added that given the length of the recovery and low levels of unemployment, many economists \u201chave been wondering why we haven\u2019t seen stronger wage growth\u201d as competition for labor heats up. \u201cNow we may be starting to see it.\u201dMuch the same can be said about unemployment, which fell to 4.1 percent from 4.7 percent during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year as president, and which also reflects the tight labor market conditions that have been developing for years. The unemployment rate fell much more during the Obama years (three full percentage points, from when Mr. Obama took office until when he left), which would be expected given the severe recession he inherited.In any event, it\u2019s far too soon to evaluate Mr. Trump\u2019s impact on the labor market. Economists generally agree that at least some of the Republican tax cuts will flow through to workers, although there are widely differing projections about how much, and most say the largest share will go to shareholders in the form of dividends, stock buybacks and higher share prices. Professor Slemrod said we may never know for sure, but \u201cin five or six years we may be able to tell if some of the more extreme claims are reasonable.\u201dUnlike the 1986 tax legislation, which claimed to be revenue-neutral, the latest Republican bill is a huge tax cut. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new law would add just over $1 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. It predicted higher interest rates as a result, which it estimated would cost the Treasury an additional $66 billion in debt service costs.Some supporters of the tax law contend that economic growth will come so quickly that increased tax revenue will more than make up for the cuts. The actual impact on the deficit won\u2019t be evident for at least a year, but the rising deficits that followed tax cuts in 1981 forced Republicans to raise taxes in both 1982 and 1984.Interest rates are already trending higher. Both Professors Auerbach and Slemrod agreed that rates are likely to rise further and would be an important measure of the impact of the tax legislation and Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies. If they rise faster than at the cautious pace the Federal Reserve has projected and investors expect, that could bring the stock market rally to an abrupt end. Higher-than-expected rates could also slow the economy, or even tip it into recession.How sensitive the stock market is to interest rates was on display the same day as Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, when shares plunged on fears of higher rates after the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2.7 percent; that\u2019s still very low by historic standards, but higher than when Mr. Trump took office.The big tax cut is a large economic stimulus, and \u201cright now stimulus is a danger,\u201d said Professor Auerbach, given that there is nearly full employment and already-strong economic growth.We\u2019ll know a year from now whether the Federal Reserve stuck with its projected three increases in rates this year, and whether any exceeded quarter-point increments.The bottom line: Presidents tend to get credit (or blame) for whatever economies they preside over, but it\u2019s far too soon to evaluate Mr. Trump\u2019s long-term impact. Even after years have passed, Professor Slemrod said, \u201cWe\u2019ll never know with 100 percent certainty.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the fall was pegged to good economic news stems from Friday\u2019s job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment. Rising wages are good for those who receive them, and for the presidents who seek to stimulate them, but investors see them as a sign of possible inflation and higher interest rates. Analysts pegged the sell-off in stocks to the strong employment numbers as investors feared the Federal Reserve might quicken the pace of its interest rate hikes.White House officials had released only a terse statement after the market\u2019s decline earlier this week. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement on Monday that \u201cthe President\u2019s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment, and increasing wages for American workers.\u201dOn Tuesday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, tried to walk a fine line in distancing the administration from the recent drop in stock prices while still taking credit for the run of success that preceded it.\u201cWe are very focused on long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we have enacted, including tax reform, are very positive for long-term economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at a House Financial Services Committee hearing.Asked after the hearing if the administration would in the future refrain from embracing the stock market as a proxy now that it has become such a volatile measure, Mr. Mnuchin made clear that he was not ready to do so.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been looking at the long-term impact of the stock market.

The Pakistani delegation walked away with the impression that \u201cthey are still going to put us on the gray list,\u201d he said, calling the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy inconsistent.That would undermine moderates in the country, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ll have egg on our faces,\u201d Mr. Ismail added. \u201cWe pushed for these reforms, although many thought we wouldn\u2019t be successful changing Washington\u2019s behavior.\u201dA State Department spokesman said that the United States welcomed Pakistan\u2019s efforts against the groups tied to Lashkar-e-Taiba, but that it sought additional information on what \u201cconcrete steps\u201d were being taken to deprive them of financing. The spokesman said the Paris meeting would determine the next steps on Pakistan, but refused to elaborate.The Treasury Department said it would not comment on the sanctions list before the meetings in Paris next week or private meetings expected to be held with Pakistani officials.President Trump\u2019s increasingly hawkish stance on Pakistan has left officials in the South Asian country worried that it could become politically isolated. Previous administrations have tried to force Islamabad to cut off support for extremist organizations that operate in Pakistan and cross the border into Afghanistan, where they launch attacks on United States-led forces.The military denies that it supports groups like the Haqqani network, which has been designated a terrorist organization in the United States. It and others are responsible for some of the largest attacks on the United States-led military coalition in Afghanistan, and on the Afghan government.But with $3 billion in debt coming due, Pakistani officials worry that the United States could put pressure on global institutions like the International Monetary Fund to block future loans. As the meeting in Paris this week inched closer, Pakistan decided to move swiftly against extremist groups.\u201cF.A.T.F. is supposed to be a technical forum. It\u2019s not supposed to be a political forum,\u201d Mr. Ismail said, referring to the Financial Action Task Force. He cited concerns that Washington planned to use the Paris meeting to exert further pressure on Pakistan, after receiving an underwhelming response to the January aid cut.Islamabad reacted coolly when Washington announced that it would cut assistance, pointing out that American aid had declined for years and was too meager to support Pakistan\u2019s economy. But American officials insist the suspension will hurt Pakistan\u2019s ability to service its mostly American-made military hardware, a major blow to a country that has frequent border skirmishes with India, its main rival, and that is struggling to quell a violent insurgency at home.Publicly, Pakistan denies supporting insurgent groups in Afghanistan, saying that the United States is trying to blame it for the Pentagon\u2019s failure to achieve victory after 17 years in Afghanistan.\u201cThere are large swaths of Afghanistan outside the control of the Afghan government, and that\u2019s where the opposition is,\u201d Pakistan\u2019s defense minister, Khurram Dastgir Khan, said in an interview last week in Islamabad. \u201cAny war of words with the U.S. takes our eye off the prize: a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan.\u201d\u201cHas Trump\u2019s onslaught of hostile words increased Afghanistan\u2019s prosperity and democracy?\u201d he continued. \u201cHas it seen Kabul take charge of more of Afghanistan\u2019s territory?

Peacefully, if Possible", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2014 Milorad Dodik would like to make two things clear at the outset: that he is the president of a legitimate state, rather than an ethnically cleansed territory in a country with internationally recognized borders; and that, at 58, he can still shoot hoops like a pro.He also has no use for the American ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Maureen Cormack, saying, \u201cShe is pursuing policies as if Hillary Clinton were the president of the United States.\u201dShe has given him a wide berth lately, he says, which suits him. \u201cHonestly,\u201d he said, \u201cmy life is better now that she\u2019s not coming over here to tell me what to do.\u201dMr. Dodik has called for all Serb politicians serving in Bosnian state institutions to return to Banja Luka, the Serb region\u2019s capital, and has declared those who refuse traitors. He has deepened state control of the news media, and has tightened his grip over the economy and the Serb entity\u2019s institutions, the main employer in his patch of land.\u201cHe went from being an autocrat to being a dictator,\u201d said Vukota Govedarica, one of Mr. Dodik\u2019s rare political rivals. \u201cHis governing strategy of making enemies, foreign and domestic, has brought us to the verge of financial bankruptcy and political ruin.\u201dDuring an interview in Banja Luka, he dismissed foreign allies-turned-critics, saying \u201cNow, Dodik is the bad man.\u201dSlumped in an antique armchair too small for his towering figure, he seemed slightly offended by the mention of the American sanctions. Without admitting it openly, he likes to be liked, and along with most Serbs, he has high hopes that the Trump administration will take his side. More important, he wants to be respected.He defended his decision to break with Bosnia, citing \u201cdangers to the Serbs\u201d dating from the Ottoman era up to the threat of Islamic extremism today, which he says still lurks in the shadows of the fight against terrorism.He confidently laid out his revision of Balkan history, mixing anecdotes of past horrors with images of the present. He said that Serbs had been victims of Islamic extremism long before Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, saying that \u201cSerbs were beheaded not far from here during the war.\u201dHe was adamant that \u201cnot all Muslims are terrorists,\u201d and proudly declared that five Bosnian Muslims currently serve in the Republika Srpska government. But he added that \u201cmost acts of terrorism have recently been done by Muslims.\u201dHe mumbled thoughts on the current sad state of the region, the result of Western leaders who \u201cbought the Muslims\u2019 idea that Bosnia is a multicultural state and needs to be preserved as such in one piece, no matter what the cost.\u201d\u201cThey can accuse me of being a bad man 100 times over,\u201d he said during the interview in a 1930s building in downtown Banja Luka that is now called the Palace of the Republic \u2014 fittingly, given Mr. Dodik\u2019s idea that he leads an independent state.\u201cI am a politician. I am only reacting to the will of the people living here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people here don\u2019t want to be in Bosnia anymore.\u201dMr. Dodik grew up in Laktasi, a town outside Banja Luka, where he played on a local basketball team that was part of Yugoslavia\u2019s thriving amateur league in the 1970s and 1980s. He stayed involved in the sport after the country\u2019s disintegration in the early 1990s, and is now the honorary president of the legendary Belgrade basketball team Partizan.He has a degree in political science from the University of Belgrade, but, like his basketball career, his run in politics was at the local level until he was elected to the Bosnian Parliament in 1990. An opponent of Mr. Karadzic, he formed the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats \u2014 a party he still leads \u2014 and after the war caught the attention of American diplomats, who pinned their hopes for peace and democracy on him.For a decade after the war, Mr. Dodik was showered with funds and compliments from Brussels and Washington, with Madeleine Albright, the former Secretary of State, calling him a \u201cbreath of fresh air in the Balkans.\u201dClearly out of favor with the Americans these days, Mr. Dodik has turned his attention to the East, where he now counts President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia among his closest allies.He traces Bosnia\u2019s troubles to the poor implementation of the Dayton accords, which he says favors Bosnian Muslims over Serbs and Croats.\u201cIt was an arranged marriage, and it has not worked out,\u201d he said. \u201cBosnia and Herzegovina is an arranged state, and we want out.\u201d Peacefully, if at all possible, he added.Perhaps. But just this week, he bought 2,500 rifles for his police force.\u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d he said of the purchase. The weapons are intended to \u201craise their capability to the standard of regional police forces, fighting terrorism.\u201dHe added: \u201cFor 20 years, we have been denied the right to properly equip our police force. Now, we\u2019ve decided to do just that.\u201dIt is impossible to say how far Mr. Dodik is willing to go to achieve his goal of breaking up Bosnia. \u201cIs he a nationalist at heart? I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Lo\u00efc Tr\u00e9gour\u00e8s, a Balkans expert who has studied Mr. Dodik\u2019s rise and who teaches at the Catholic Institute of Paris. \u201cHe is a politician who will do anything to remain in power.\u201dMr. Tr\u00e9gour\u00e8s said that Mr. Dodik had once offered an explanation of sorts for his nationalist push. \u201cHe told me bluntly, \u2018I can talk about heath care and the social system and nobody will listen.

Wildes, declined to offer any details.\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to help this family, but I have to respect their privacy as well,\u201d Mr. Wildes said in a brief interview.\u201cImmigration is in our DNA,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have to take great pride, no matter where somebody hails from, in that legacy.\u201d\u201cIt would be odd if she sponsored her parents and didn\u2019t want to talk about that because it\u2019s a fairly routine thing,\u201d said Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in immigration law. \u201cIt only becomes sensitive if her husband is taking a position against this.\u201d\u201cIn some ways, lawful permanent resident status is the best of all visas,\u201d said Kevin R. Johnson, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Davis, who has taught immigration law. \u201cIt\u2019s the Cadillac of immigrant visas because it allows you a path to citizenship.\u201dBut Mr. Trump has vilified the program as a way for terrorists to enter the United States and has called for aspects of the program to be eliminated as part of immigration reform.It also might have been possible, Mr. Johnson said, for the Knavses, both in their 70s, to obtain residency through an investment visa or a work visa, although the latter would involve employer sponsorship. Mr. Knavs, a former traveling car salesman, and Mrs. Knavs, who used to design patterns for children\u2019s clothes, both appear to be retired.Immigrants can also apply for asylum or enter the diversity lottery, a path that offers limited numbers of visas. Mr. Trump has also criticized the diversity lottery, which allows admission to immigrants from countries that do not send many people to the United States.\u201cIf somebody came to me and asked me how to become a citizen, the first question I would ask is \u2018Do you have an American citizen as a relative?\u2019\u201d said Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. \u201cThat is the fastest and most direct route to getting a green card.\u201dIn his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump described a four-pillar immigration plan and continued to criticize the family-based immigration program, eliciting boos from Democrats in the chamber.\u201cUnder the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives,\u201d he said. \u201cThis vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for family-based immigration. The president would limit it to spouses and children under 21, but would not include parents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Destructive Dynamics of Political Tribalism", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBy now we all understand that America is in the grip of political tribalism. We lament and condemn this phenomenon even as we voraciously engage in it. But by fixating on the symptoms, we remain blind to the root causes. America is being ravaged by predictable, destructive political dynamics that follow from the combination of democracy and a market-dominant minority.Most Americans assume that democracy and free markets go hand in hand, naturally working together to generate prosperity and freedom. For the United States, this has largely been true. But by their very nature, markets and democracy coexist in deep tension.Introducing free-market democracy in these circumstances can be a recipe for disaster. Resentful majorities who see themselves as a country\u2019s rightful owners demand to have \u201ctheir\u201d country back. Ethnonationalism rears its head. Democracy becomes not a vehicle for e pluribus unum but a zero-sum tribalist contest. This dynamic was also at play in the former Yugoslavia, in Zimbabwe, in Venezuela and in virtually every country where there has been a market-dominant minority.For most of our history, it seemed as though we were relatively immune to dynamics like these. Part of the reason is we never had a market-dominant minority. On the contrary, for 200 years, America was economically, politically and culturally dominated by a white majority \u2014 a politically stable, if often invidious, state of affairs.But today, something has changed. Race has split America\u2019s poor, and class has split America\u2019s white majority. The former has been true for a while; the latter is a more recent development, at least in the intense form it has now reached. As a result, we may be seeing the emergence of America\u2019s own version of a market-dominant minority: the much-discussed group often referred to as the coastal elites \u2014 misleadingly, because its members are neither all coastal nor all elite, at least in the sense of being wealthy.But with some important caveats, coastal elites do bear a resemblance to the market-dominant minorities of the developing world. Wealth in the United States is extraordinarily concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of people, many of whom live on the West or East Coast. Although America\u2019s coastal elites are not an ethnic or religious minority, they are culturally distinct, often sharing similar cosmopolitan values, and they are extremely insular, interacting and intermarrying primarily among themselves.They dominate key sectors of the economy, including Wall Street, the media, Hollywood and Silicon Valley. And because coastal elites are viewed by many in the heartland as \u201cminority-loving\u201d and pro-immigrant, they are seen as unconcerned with \u201creal\u201d Americans \u2014 indeed as threatening their way of life.What happened in America in 2016 is exactly what I would have predicted for a developing country pursuing elections in the presence of a deeply resented market-dominant minority: the rise of a populist movement in which demagogic voices called on \u201creal\u201d Americans to \u201ctake back our country.\u201dTrumpism is part of a global pattern, but Europe\u2019s right-wing nationalist movements aren\u2019t the only or even most apt comparison. American politics today has as much in common with the developing world as it does with Europe. Time and again, vote-seeking demagogues with few political credentials have swept to power in developing countries by tapping into deep-seated resentment toward a market-dominant minority. President Trump is neither the world\u2019s first \u201ctweeter-in-chief\u201d nor the first head of state to star on a reality TV show. That would be Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela.Venezuela, too, has a market-dominant minority: the light-skinned, insular elite that historically controlled the country\u2019s corporate sector and its staggering oil wealth. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez swept to victory in 1998 on an anti-establishment platform, attacking the mainstream media, the \u201crotten oligarchs\u201d and a slew of \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d He won over millions of the country\u2019s have-nots with unscripted rhetoric that struck elites as vulgar, outrageous and often plainly false. But Venezuela\u2019s majority saw in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez a leader who looked and spoke like them.Seeing coastal elites as a market-dominant minority is sobering. In my research, I\u2019ve found no examples of countries successfully overcoming this problem. On the contrary, all over the world, when this dynamic takes hold of a nation\u2019s politics, a result has been an erosion of trust in institutions and in electoral outcomes. Countries lurch toward authoritarianism, hate-mongering and an elite backlash against the popular side of democracy.Signs of all these developments are present in the United States. As to the latter, right before the 2016 election, a book review in The New Yorker discussed \u201cthe case against democracy,\u201d including proposals to impose knowledge tests on voters (something Latin American elites have been writing about for a long time). The review quoted from a book by Jason Brennan, a libertarian political philosopher at Georgetown, who wrote that \u201cexcluding the bottom 80 percent of white voters from voting might be just what poor blacks need.\u201dThis is not the way forward. If any way out exists, it will have to be both economic and cultural. Restoring upward mobility should be viewed as an emergency. Upward mobility is what made America different from developing countries that have disintegrated. Research shows that zero-sum political tribalism is worst under conditions of economic insecurity and lack of opportunity.But the emergence of coastal elites as an insular minority is also rooted squarely in the breakdown of national unity \u2014 in the fracturing of our country into two (or more) Americas in which people from one tribe see others not just as the political opposition, but as immoral, evil and un-American. America desperately needs leaders with the courage to break out of the tribalist cycle, but where are we going to find them?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Good Girls\u2019 Offers Equal Time for Antiheroines", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are reasons, which quickly become apparent, that \u201cGood Girls\u201d is not called \u201cBreaking Bad Girls.\u201d But the surface parallels to \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the teacher-turned-drug-dealer drama, are tough to miss.The story starts with money trouble that can\u2019t be solved within the bounds of lawful behavior. Beth (Christina Hendricks) wants to shed a philandering husband (Matthew Lillard) without losing her house. Her sister, Annie (Mae Whitman), is in a custody battle with her more-affluent ex (Zach Gilford). Ruby (Retta) has a daughter in need of an expensive medical treatment that must be paid for out of pocket.Within a couple of commercial breaks, the three are in and out and counting their take. But the plan has worked too well. Instead of the $30,000 they were expecting, the store vault has half a million bucks. Annie\u2019s sleazeball boss has been laundering money for a gang, leaving the trio to hide a fortune and get a quick education in organized crime.The resulting frying-pan-and-fire story line forces the three leads to confront how serious they are about being criminals. The problem, as enjoyable as \u201cGood Girls\u201d often is, is that it seems unsure how serious it is about being a crime story.For Walter White and his many TV cousins, crime has often been about self-worth, even virility. (Tony Soprano\u2019s big boat is named \u201cThe Stugots,\u201d after an Italian male-anatomical slang term.)For Beth, Annie and Ruby, the money is more about self-determination: freedom from reliance on lousy men or the whims of the economy. When Ruby, flush with cash, sees an expensive doctor who offers her cucumber water, she cries a little bit at the upgrade in attention that money can buy.The series, created by Jenna Bans, is tartly funny, less heavy than its cable kin and more concerned with righteous payback than ethical angst.But it\u2019s not entirely light, either. There\u2019s some blood \u2014 more than a tablespoon, less than a gallon \u2014 and an attempted rape early on. This material feels like it should carry more weight than \u201cGood Girls\u201d often gives it.\u201cGood Girls\u201d certainly works as a caper, especially given the rapport among its three leads. You can\u2019t not want to spend an hour watching Ms. Hendricks, Ms. Whitman and Retta rob stuff. The show gets plenty of mileage from its surburbanites-gone-wild conceit, as when Ruby chooses the location for a rendezvous: \u201cThey always do the drop-off at a park on \u2018Law & Order.\u2019\u201dTo work as a walk-on-the-wild-side drama, the series needs a sense of stakes, that bad things can happen and that characters can come to bad ends. To deliver on the ironies of that \u201cGood\u201d in the title, there needs to be moral conflict \u2014 the possibility that these protagonists, however much we like them, might make a wrong choice that will get somebody hurt.But because \u201cGood Girls\u201d has an offbeat tone \u2014 and airs on a broadcast network \u2014 you get the feeling that the guardrails are up. Most of the threatening situations resolve comically, and we\u2019re reminded that the robbery is a victimless crime. \u201cWe\u2019re normal people,\u201d Beth says. \u201cWe pay our taxes, and we take our kids to P.F. Chang\u2019s, and we take orange slices to soccer games.\u201dThat\u2019s a valid choice, but one more consistent with an escapist comedy, and at times the show seems to have other intentions.I\u2019ve only seen three episodes of \u201cGood Girls,\u201d however, and it\u2019s possible that the uneven tone reflects the characters\u2019 situations. Just as the women have to decide if they\u2019re actual criminals or just dabblers, so, too, may \u201cGood Girls\u201d land on a better sense of what kind of series it is.There\u2019s a sign of its long-term direction in the third episode, when Beth considers whether she\u2019s breaking the law simply for the money or because she likes it. This might also address the question of how you make an extended series about three characters trying to get out of the crime business, rather than into it.But maybe the pleasures of \u201cGood Girls\u201d so far are like the proceeds from a heist. You\u2019ve just got to enjoy them while they last.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Reserve Shackles Wells Fargo After Fraud Scandal", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve on Friday imposed unusually harsh penalties on Wells Fargo, punishing it for years of misconduct and barring it from future growth until the bank fixes its problems.The central bank blasted Wells Fargo\u2019s board for failing to oversee the bank, and it announced that the company would replace four members of its 16-person board by the end of the year.The move, taking place on Janet L. Yellen\u2019s last working day as the central bank\u2019s chairwoman, is all the more extraordinary because it comes at a time when federal banking regulators appointed by President Trump are working vigorously to relax rules that were imposed in the years following the financial crisis.The Fed\u2019s punishment, a forceful intervention by the government into the affairs of a large company, means that one of the country\u2019s largest and most powerful financial institutions will be unable to keep pace with its fast-growing rivals.\u201cUntil the firm makes sufficient improvements, it will be restricted from growing any larger than its total asset size as of the end of 2017,\u201d the Fed said.Wells Fargo said on Friday that it was working to address the problems, and the bank\u2019s shares slid sharply in after-hours trading.The central bank\u2019s penalties are uncommon. The Fed\u2019s regulators have routinely penalized banks for misconduct, but they have not previously imposed strict limits on a major bank\u2019s growth.The regulatory pendulum has recently been swinging in favor of big banks. President Trump and his advisers argue that regulators have gone too far in curbing banks\u2019 activities.Mr. Trump, however, has taken specific aim at Wells Fargo as a rogue institution. He wrote on Twitter in December that penalties against the bank \u201cwill be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!\u201dOn a conference call with analysts and investors Friday night, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, said the Fed\u2019s actions related to past conduct that the bank was already taking steps to fix and that they did not affect the bank\u2019s financial condition.\u201cWe want to have this cap lifted as soon as possible, and we\u2019re going to work very hard to make sure that\u2019s the case,\u201d Mr. Sloan said. He added that the bank remains open for business and will continue to make new loans even as the Fed\u2019s limits remain in place.Wells Fargo said it would submit a plan to the Fed within 60 days for improving its board oversight and risk management practices. It will also submit to an independent third-party review that will be completed by the end of September.Wells Fargo officials expect that they will be able to get the restrictions lifted within the next year, which they believe will minimize the financial impact of the penalty, according to a person close to the bank.The Fed\u2019s action Friday stunned industry observers.\u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time the board has ever done anything quite as dramatic as that,\u201d said Evan Stewart, a regulatory lawyer at the law firm Cohen and Gresser, referring to the Federal Reserve Board. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite a dramatic intervention by the major federal regulatory agency in the governance of a major bank.\u201dFor years, Wells Fargo was the toast of the United States banking industry. It was showered with awards and praise for appearing to perfect the art of \u201ccross selling,\u201d in which it found creative new ways to peddle financial products to its existing customers. The bank\u2019s savvy management of risk allowed it to avoid the worst of the financial crisis.While others retrenched, Wells Fargo substantially expanded, snapping up ailing North Carolina lender Wachovia, in late 2008. That acquisition was engineered in part by federal regulators, who viewed Wells as one of the country\u2019s strongest, best-run institutions.That reputation has crumbled recently, though. Wells Fargo was found by regulators to have systematically created fake customer accounts and misled customers and government officials.It is unclear what impact the Fed\u2019s penalties will have on Wells Fargo\u2019s future. The bank had nearly $2 trillion in assets at the end of 2017. Going forward, the Fed will not let Wells Fargo\u2019s average balance sheet expand beyond that size, according to a senior Fed official. Because large banks\u2019 assets tend to expand as the economy grows, the Fed believes that this limitation will be a significant constraint on the bank\u2019s ability to grow.Wells Fargo\u2019s board has already undergone a makeover in the wake of the scandal, although half of its current board \u2014 eight members \u2014 were there at the time the scandal erupted. Wells Fargo on Friday night declined to say which four directors would be stepping down as part of the agreement with the Fed.Wells Fargo\u2019s current board chairwoman, Elizabeth A. Duke, took on the position last month, replacing Stephen W. Sanger, a 13-year board member who retired after a year filled with scandals. Two other longtime directors departed at the end of last year.Last year, a longtime Wells Fargo investor, Gerald R. Armstrong, submitted a shareholder proposal calling for the bank\u2019s directors to be replaced. His proposal was voted down. Mr. Armstrong welcomed Friday\u2019s news. \u201cI hope they bring in some very effective new directors,\u201d he said.The Fed, in letters sent Friday to Wells Fargo board members, leveled harsh criticism on their oversight of the bank and made clear that more changes need to happen quickly.\u201cThe bank is lucky it is too big to shut down,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \u201cA smaller bank might have lost its banking licenses.\u201dMatthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Vision for Vocational Education Gets a Tepid Reception", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s calls this week for more vocational schools have received a lukewarm reception from the higher education community, including from the educators who teach in the programs he is championing.The president first raised expanding vocational education in his State of the Union address on Tuesday \u2014 the only nod to education policy in the speech \u2014 as a work force development strategy. On Thursday, Mr. Trump expounded on the proposal, asserting that efforts to teach students trades had diminished since he attended an elite military boarding school, where he said he had a classmate who wasn\u2019t the \u201cgreatest student\u201d but \u201cwas able to fix a car engine blindfolded.\u201dPolicy experts and organizations that advocate the trade programs \u2014 which for more than a decade have been recognized as career and technical education, or C.T.E. \u2014 took issue with the president\u2019s antiquated characterization of a sector of higher education that has expanded beyond laborers who are not cut out for academia.The Association for Career and Technical Education, which represents 25,000 such educators and professionals in secondary and postsecondary programs, said that Mr. Trump failed to recognize the critical ways that the schools had evolved.The programs serve thousands in secondary schools, and millions of students in more than 1,600 two-year colleges. They encompass a broad range of trades, like health science, information technology and business management, and in many cases, are an off-ramp to four-year colleges and universities. The group also noted that career and technical education students tend to have lower dropout rates and are more likely to graduate on time.Mr. Trump\u2019s speeches may have been more like a rhetorical appeal to the base that elected him, particularly blue-collar workers, than a policy proposal.\u201cThe danger is we tend to view these young people who are drawn to these programs in very deficient ways,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cThey value intellectual pursuits. They\u2019ve watched industries die in their communities and know the danger of not being able to adapt to other kinds of work.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on bolstering the role of education in work force development has been largely embraced by education leaders across the country, many of whom are looking to Congress to reauthorize some parts of the Higher Education Act to meet the job demands of the future. Already, through a House bill, members of Congress have made clear their goals to overhaul the law governing higher education to be more responsive to six million unfilled jobs.\u201cAmerica must do better to prepare our students for success in the 21st-century economy,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in a statement after the president\u2019s speech. \u201cI join the president in calling on Congress to act in the best interest of students and expand access to more education pathways.\u201dBut policy experts also said that Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that vocational education was the silver bullet to the country\u2019s work force deficit was misguided.Michelle Asha Cooper, the president of the Institute for Higher Education Policy, noted that labor economists estimated that in 2020, of the millions of jobs created, two-thirds would require postsecondary degree.\u201cWhile bricklayers are an important part of our labor market, I think we have to recognize that vocational schools are not going to solve our work force needs alone,\u201d Ms. Cooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a purposeful discussion to say vocational schools can do it all, because statistically, it cannot be done.\u201dCommunity colleges were also on the defensive after the president\u2019s remarks.The role of community colleges was crystallized in 1947, when President Harry Truman ordered a Presidential Commission on Higher Education to re-examine the higher education landscape after veterans came home from World War II to find traditional colleges crowded.\u201cThe name used does not matter, though \u2018community college\u2019 seems to describe these schools best,\u201d the commission wrote. \u201cThe important thing is that the services they perform be recognized and vastly extended.\u201dIn the 1960s, Portland Community College answered that call, its president, Mark Mitsui, said.The school covers 1,500 square miles and serves 76,000 students over four campuses. Students from high schools can enroll, but the average age of the student body is 29 because the school serves a range of functions, like allowing students to take a traditional college curriculum that affords them transfers to Ivy Leagues or offering basic skills and English-language courses.Its graduates include the author Rebecca Skloot, who wrote the best-selling book \u201cThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.\u201d\u201cWe respond to the needs of our community, and the community\u2019s needs are complex, so we want to be as comprehensive as possible,\u201d Mr. Mitsui said. \u201cI think our communities do know what we do and represent. There are a lot of bridges in Portland, and we are a bridge to opportunity.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, relying on information from a source, misstated the student enrollment at Portland Community College. The school serves 76,000 students, not 90,000.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Anbang Takeover, China\u2019s Deal Money, Already Ebbing, Could Slow Further", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina\u2019s global deal making was already slowing down. Beijing\u2019s takeover of one of the country\u2019s biggest spenders threatens to bring it to a near stop.\u201cIf it can happen to Anbang, it can happen to any number of Chinese firms looking to gain a share of our critical industries, infrastructure and technologies,\u201d said Robert Pittenger, a Republican representative from North Carolina.That scrutiny could test what has long been a ready source of money for companies in the United States and elsewhere.For years, China was an enthusiastic and big buyer of hotels and real estate, entertainment companies and logistics companies in the United States, rewarding those who put the deals together. But those warm business ties between China and the United States are cooling.The Trump administration has expressed concerns about investments by Chinese companies in United States firms in areas where Beijing wants to be dominant, like artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. The Anbang takeover will most likely add to that trepidation.\u201cRegulators will naturally be somewhat concerned by the reality that often there is an asymmetry of information about the Chinese firms operating internationally,\u201d said Jeremy Stevens, an economist for Standard Bank Group in Beijing. \u201cThis event further underlines this truth,\u201d he added.Anbang has said it will carry on business as usual. \u201cWe remain fully committed to our overseas subsidiaries, business and investments,\u201d it said in a statement on Friday.But already, Chinese companies aren\u2019t buying \u2014 or sealing deals \u2014 like they once were.Newly announced Chinese acquisitions in the United States in 2017 fell to $8.7 billion, one-tenth the transaction value of acquisitions in 2016. It marks the lowest level in six years, according to data from Rhodium Group, which tracks Chinese investments abroad.Some of the drop in deals last year had to do with China\u2019s skepticism of its large private conglomerates and its crackdown on what it called irrational spending overseas on trophy assets like the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, which Anbang bought in late 2014 for nearly $2 billion. High-flying giants like Anbang and its peers Dalian Wanda and HNA Group, which have large amounts of debt, have started shedding assets overseas.Some of the slowdown comes from American concerns as well.Just as the Chinese government announced its plans to take over Anbang last week, the American semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corporation announced that its $580 million sale to Hubei Xinyan, an investment fund backed by the Chinese state, had been blocked by American officials. It was the latest high-tech China deal blocked by Washington amid concerns that China could gain access to cutting-edge technology.The Committee on Foreign Investment, the government committee that reviews foreign purchases of American companies in the United States, could become an even tougher hurdle.Mr. Pittenger, the congressman, is co-sponsoring a bill that would broaden the scope of the committee, known as Cfius. While the panel reviews deals for national security issues, Mr. Pittenger and others want it to consider economic and other factors in deciding whether to approve deals.\u201cThis cannot go unnoticed by those tasked to uphold our national security through Cfius and export controls,\u201d Mr. Pittenger said, referring to China\u2019s takeover of Anbang last week.With the government takeover, Anbang could be under pressure to begin to sell its many holdings overseas. These include hotels across the United States, a large stake in a South Korean bank, a Dutch insurance company and a South Korean insurance company.\u201cInvestors in companies outside China in which Anbang, Wanda or HNA own a stake of less than 100 percent should expect that the stake held by the Chinese investor will be put on the market over 2018,\u201d said Gordon Orr, the former Asia chairman at global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. These could \u201cbe pushed through very rapidly,\u201d Mr. Orr added.Dutch regulators are reviewing the potential impact on Vivat, a Dutch insurance company that Anbang bought in 2015.

{"Headline": "U.K.\u2019s Governing Party Is Clashing Over \u2018Brexit.\u2019 Again.", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEach time Prime Minister Theresa May makes a move over Britain\u2019s looming departure from the European Union, she upsets someone within her fractured Conservative Party.But with that withdrawal a little over a year away, silence is no longer an option, and on Wednesday it was the turn of hard-line supporters of withdrawal to be disappointed when a government paper appeared to suggest that the transition period after Brexit could be longer than two years.The two-year time frame has been cited as the period necessary to protect the economy immediately after withdrawal, or Brexit, which is scheduled for March 2019. Brexit supporters fear that extending it could lock Britain into the European Union\u2019s economic architecture for years to come.The paper\u2019s release heightened tension within the Conservative Party ahead of a meeting on Thursday at which Mrs. May will seek to cajole a bitterly divided cabinet toward an agreement over its longer-term Brexit objective.In the meantime, the government on Wednesday sought to reassure pro-Brexit lawmakers, insisting that there would be an early end date to the transition period, during which Britain plans to negotiate the details of a trade deal with the European Union, something widely expected to take several years.Experts are skeptical. \u201cIt was a given that the two-year deadline was never realistic,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director and leading Europe analyst at Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. The new position, he said, \u201creflects realism.\u201dNor is the latest move in line with the European Union\u2019s plans. It has identified Dec. 31, 2020, as an end to the transition, perhaps thinking that such a deadline puts Britain under pressure in negotiations because of the economic risk of a \u201ccliff edge\u201d departure without a deal until one is agreed on.The divisions within the Conservative Party were further underscored on Wednesday with the emergence of a letter from more than 60 Brexit-supporting lawmakers calling for a clean break with the European Union \u2014 demands that one of their pro-European colleagues, Heidi Allen, said suggested \u201can ideological obsession with Brexit at all costs.\u201dSince losing her parliamentary majority in an election last June, Mrs. May has often played for time, refusing to reveal detailed objectives to her European interlocutors as she balances demands from competing factions within her party.Ultimately Mrs. May wants Britain to leave the European Union\u2019s customs union, which ensures tariff-free trade, and its single market, which lays down standards and rules and removes non-tariff barriers. But she also says she wants to minimize friction in trade and avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union.At the cabinet meeting on Thursday in Mrs. May\u2019s country residence, Chequers, the buzzword is likely to be \u201cmanaged divergence,\u201d with her asking colleagues to agree on close alignment with European Union regulations for goods, at least in the short term, and the right to diverge from those rules in the future, accompanied by a new system to manage such changes.For services that are vital to Britain\u2019s economy, she would like to achieve deep access to European markets, probably by negotiating a system under which each side recognizes the other\u2019s regulatory systems.But to many in the European Union, that sounds very much like the objective once famously outlined by Mr. Johnson: that Britain have its cake and eat it too.So, even if her cabinet agrees on that position this week, Mrs. May\u2019s opening bid in the negotiation is likely to be rejected by the European Union, leaving the Brexit endgame still some months away.\u201cI think there is a widespread understanding that the European Union isn\u2019t going to go for managed divergence,\u201d Mr. Rahman said.\u201cThey see right through this,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause they regard the single market as an ecosystem, and you can\u2019t just remove one part of it without unraveling others.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Shuttle Service, Minus the 1980s Frills", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesThe announcement by American Airlines seemed to hark to another era: The airline would be adding shuttle service between New York and Chicago this spring \u2014 and serving free beer and wine, no less.But the American shuttle is a \u201cshuttle\u201d in only the narrowest definition: It will adhere to a regular, frequent schedule.In the glory days of air shuttles, a few decades ago, shuttles were more freewheeling affairs. Passengers could buy their tickets onboard, and operators kept extra planes on standby so every person who showed up could be accommodated. There was just one class on the planes \u2014 no first class or economy \u2014 and meals were served to everyone on many of the flights, even if the plane was in the air for under an hour.Today, the seating is more finite \u2014 a reservation is probably a good idea. Snacks are available to everyone, but full meals are usually offered only to first-class passengers on flights between New York and Chicago. And American acknowledged that while its new shuttle service would translate to more round trips between La Guardia Airport and Chicago each day, some flights would use smaller planes, so overall capacity on the route would not change.Robert W. Mann Jr., an aviation consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y., said the new American service was \u201can aspirational thing, it\u2019s a grab for the past.\u201dBut like its predecessors, the new service is targeted at business travelers. \u201cThese were unique opportunities,\u201d Mr. Mann said, \u201cto do something that was much more generous than you would typically get.\u201dEastern Air Lines was the first to operate air shuttles, beginning in 1961, with service every other hour from La Guardia to Washington and Boston. Over the next four decades or so, shuttle services increased in frequency and, crucially, offered unlimited capacity on every departure.If, for example, 100 people could fit on the plane at the gate in New York for the 8 a.m. departure to Boston but 101 passengers showed up, a second plane would be rolled out. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive proposition,\u201d Mr. Mann said, because airlines had to have planes and crews on standby. (Frequently, though, those standby aircraft never left the ground.)Airlines, however, still try to distinguish their shuttle flights to appeal to business travelers. \u201cThe word \u2018shuttle\u2019 has a really distinct meaning to our most frequent business travelers,\u201d said Vasu Raja, the vice president for network and schedule planning at American Airlines.American\u2019s shuttles to Boston and Washington still follow a more consistent schedule than flights on other routes and tend to leave from the same gate. Passengers can also check in for the flights closer to departure time. Because of that consistency, Mr. Raja said, travelers \u201ccan be on autopilot\u201d while going through the airport.He said the company had decided to expand its shuttle in response to customer demand. Chicago is a particularly strong market for business travel, he said, and the airline\u2019s frequent fliers in New York have long wanted the shuttle to fly there.Delta Air Lines is the only other airline that offers shuttle service. Like American, it operates out of La Guardia with flights to Boston, Washington and Chicago.The Delta shuttle caters to business travelers with similar in-flight amenities and check-in rules, and has dedicated security lanes at La Guardia. The schedule is aimed at accommodating travelers who want to fly round-trip in one day.\u201cThose shuttle markets are designed for a customer to leave in the morning and come back in the afternoon or evening,\u201d said Henry Kuykendall, Delta\u2019s senior vice president for Northeast airport operations. \u201cOther markets you have to overnight.\u201dThe company even had a concierge service during the week. Passengers could drop off their dry cleaning before departing in the morning and have it waiting for them when they returned in the evening. The concierge would even arrange a dinner reservation.While flying is the fastest way to get to Chicago from the East Coast, shuttle flights face stiffer competition from Amtrak in the Boston-New York-Washington corridor. Frequent travelers tend to gravitate to one mode of transportation over another, and fans of the air shuttle are more than happy to make a case for their preferred way to travel.\u201cI definitely take the shuttle more than I take the train,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a co-founder and the president of the National L.G.B.T. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cI do both, but I definitely prefer the shuttle.\u201d He lives and works in Washington, but has to travel to New York about twice a month and, he said, most often takes the American shuttle.\u201cI\u2019m an American Airlines frequent flier, and part of that is just loyalty and doing good by companies that are doing good by you,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cI have found that the airlines fight hard for your business. They want to provide a service, and they\u2019re by no means perfect, but they\u2019re fighting for you as a customer.\u201dHe said he found the service on Amtrak to be more impersonal. He also likes that he can accrue frequent flier miles on the shuttle that apply to the airline\u2019s whole network. In addition, he said, American and Delta both support Mr. Nelson\u2019s organization.Eric Schwartz, the president and chief executive of Atavis Jet, a private plane charter company, also said he preferred to fly in the Northeast. \u201cThe shuttle is more efficient for my needs,\u201d he said.Mr. Schwartz lives in New York and frequently flies Delta to Washington for business or to visit family. \u201cI can get door to door from Manhattan to downtown D.C. in two hours,\u201d he said, adding that that\u2019s faster than the train.\u201cThe fact that Amtrak calls Acela a \u2018high-speed\u2019 train is silly to me,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cIt\u2019s slow, it\u2019s lumbering, you\u2019re stopping every 20 minutes or so in little towns that don\u2019t warrant high-speed service.\u201dAirlines and railroads have gone toe to toe to win over customers in the Northeast corridor for decades, boasting of their own unique efficiencies. Amtrak stresses how train stations are more centrally located than airports.But many shuttle fans prefer the speed of flying over taking the train.Mr. Schwartz said one ad he saw more than a decade ago really drove the point home.\u201cI remember maybe 10 to 15 years ago when Amtrak was really trying to push Acela,\u201d he recalled, \u201cthere was an advertising war on the tops of taxicabs, and Delta had one that said: \u2018Planes are faster than trains. Period.\u2019 That stuck with me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trudeau Needs Trump", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMONTREAL \u2014 When Justin Trudeau first met Donald Trump face-to-face last February, the contrast between the Canadian prime minister and the American president couldn\u2019t have been any sharper. Mr. Trudeau, worldly and dapper, can barely open his mouth without extolling Canada\u2019s cheery multiculturalism or its open-border globalism. Mr. Trump lurches from thinly concealed xenophobia to America-first protectionism by way of insults and tirades.Yet Mr. Trudeau survived their meeting and has remained in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces ever since. \u201cI like the prime minister very much,\u201d Mr. Trump told a gathering of his supporters last December. \u201cNice guy. Good guy.\u201dMr. Trudeau\u2019s smooth relationship with Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t only kept the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations alive, if teetering. It is also one of the main reasons that, after just over two scandal- and gaffe-prone years as prime minister, Mr. Trudeau remains far and away the most popular political figure in this Trump-adverse country.Canada\u2019s obsession with Mr. Trump\u2019s whims and overindulgences goes beyond morbid curiosity.Despite differing views on the metric system and the occasional far-flung war, the United States and Canada have enjoyed more than 150 years of benign relations. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent threats to scuttle Nafta are seen here as an existential threat to Canada\u2019s economy, which sends over 75 percent of its exports to the United States.Faced with a similar threat over trade relations nearly 50 years ago, Pierre Trudeau, Justin Trudeau\u2019s father, who served two stretches as prime minister in the 1970s and \u201980s, took an aggressive tack. In 1971, he lectured Richard Nixon about the dangers of economic protectionism. Mr. Nixon later referred to him as a \u201cpompous egghead\u201d and imposed import tariffs anyway.Aware, perhaps, of this history, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s Nixonian temperament, Mr. Trudeau has practiced deft diplomacy. He sticks to platitudes and smiley detachment in public meetings with the president. His government is careful not to criticize Mr. Trump at home or abroad. Canadian trade missions dispatched to the United States gently remind everyone in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit of Nafta\u2019s importance to the American economy.And so far, Canada has remained on the good side of Mr. Trump and his Twitter feed, while the president\u2019s ire is mostly directed at the other Nafta partner, Mexico.The strategy has paid off domestically for Mr. Trudeau. Canadians appreciate that Mr. Trudeau\u2019s policy positions and demeanor are decidedly anti-Trump. And yet, by staying in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces, Mr. Trudeau also avoids the pain that would come from clashing with his counterpart in the United States.This boost has been a big help for Mr. Trudeau as his government feels the effects of middle age.In 2015, Mr. Trudeau rose to power by promising to be friendlier, greener, more transparent and far less scandal-plagued than the previous Conservative government. Yet over the last two years his government has broken a promise to overhaul the country\u2019s electoral system, and it botched a tax-reform plan designed to target the country\u2019s one percent. The minister for sport and persons with disabilities resigned after allegations of sexual harassment. And last year, The Globe and Mail uncovered a scheme in which wealthy Liberal Party donors wrote checks to gain access to the prime minister.Mr. Trudeau himself is the first sitting prime minister to break a federal law, the result of his 2016 vacation at the sumptuous private Bahamas retreat of the Aga Khan, whose organization regularly lobbies the government.Despite it all, Mr. Trudeau has a 20-point lead over his closest rival, the Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, according to a recent poll. Other polls and analysts agree that if an election were held today, Mr. Trudeau would easily win another majority government. (The next federal election is in 2019.)By playing nice with Mr. Trump, Mr. Trudeau has co-opted the opposition, which already suffers from weak leadership and finds itself in agreement with Mr. Trudeau\u2019s strategy. \u201cWhen it comes to our relationship with the United States, we speak with one voice,\u201d Mr. Scheer said at an event in January.Mr. Trudeau has a few vulnerabilities. His government has spent more than a year and considerable political capital trying to get a pipeline from Canada\u2019s tar sands to at least one of the country\u2019s coasts, as well as to the United States. Should ground not break on at least one of these projects before the 2019 election, he will be exposed to attacks from the Conservatives, who derive their support largely from the country\u2019s powerful oil regions.And an inquiry into the causes of disproportionately high rates of murder and disappearances among Canadian indigenous women, another Liberal government promise, is a mess of high-profile resignations and criticism of its efficacy.Then there is Mr. Trudeau himself. Perky and ever-smiling, he often floats dangerously close to self-parody. It was difficult to watch the spectacle of Mr. Trudeau, his family in tow, on a recent trade mission through India, replete in traditional Indian dress, offering earnest namaste hand gestures to the many cameras following him. More serious was the invitation he extended, and then rescinded, to a Sikh separatist convicted in the attempted murder of an Indian cabinet minister in 1986.Domestically, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s eternal optimism would be blunted should the Nafta negotiations collapse. Even if it were prompted by Mr. Trump\u2019s scorched-earth nationalism, a failure of Nafta would nonetheless be an enormous political liability for Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government, and a stain on his eventual legacy.Still, by staying true to his politics while remaining on Mr. Trump\u2019s good side, Mr. Trudeau has earned continued support of Trump-wary Canadians. To the surprise of many Canadians, Mr. Trump has so far proved to be crucial to Mr. Trudeau\u2019s political success.Martin Patriquin is a columnist at iPolitics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Memo, Devin Nunes, Once a Scourge of the Hard Right, Becomes Its Hero", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. \u2014 Representative Devin Nunes once called fellow Republicans \u201clemmings in suicide vests.\u201dNow it is Mr. Nunes, Republican of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who appears ready to blow things up \u2014 in this case the delicate relationship between American intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the committee that oversees them.Mr. Nunes is the man behind a secret Republican memo that suggests the F.B.I. and the Justice Department abused their authority to obtain a warrant to spy on a former campaign adviser to President Trump. His push to make the memo public \u2014 with the strong backing of the president \u2014 has thrust him into a partisan fight, attracted scorn from former intelligence officials and raised the ire of the F.B.I.But to the president\u2019s most ardent supporters, Mr. Nunes is a hero.Mr. Ryan, for his part, waved off any suggestion of removing Mr. Nunes.\u201cHe\u2019s focusing on keeping our country safe, focused on national security,\u201d he told reporters here at the Greenbrier resort, where congressional Republicans are gathered for their annual retreat. He accused Democrats of playing \u201csome political game\u201d to divert attention from tax cuts and a strengthening economy.A spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not respond to messages seeking comment.Mr. Nunes, 44, has made an unlikely transition from a leadership loyalist who once heaped scorn on Republican hard-liners to one of the hard-liners\u2019 idols. His \u201clemmings\u201d comment came in 2013 as Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and the conservative House Freedom Caucus were pressing to shut down the government unless President Barack Obama agreed to stop all funding for the Affordable Care Act. At that time, he was quick with a quip to dismiss his party\u2019s impractical right flank.The Nunes family has run a dairy farm in California\u2019s Central Valley for three generations. At age 23, he ousted a seasoned incumbent on the board of the two-year College of the Sequoias, which he had attended. From that seat, he befriended his representative, Bill Thomas, then a Republican powerhouse in Congress, and a Thomas staff member, Kevin McCarthy, who rose to be the House majority leader.The House and Senate Intelligence Committees were created in the 1970s post-Watergate era with a kind of unwritten understanding: The nation\u2019s intelligence agencies would submit to oversight and share sensitive information with selected members of Congress and their staff, and in exchange the committees would operate in a bipartisan fashion \u2014 and not use sensitive intelligence for political gain.Even some of the House\u2019s most hard-charging partisans, from Representative Nancy Pelosi of California on the left to Representatives Mike Rogers of Michigan on the right, have tempered their political instincts on intelligence matters.Furthermore, Mr. Nunes charged, the identities of the Mr. Trump and his associates swept up by the surveillance, which are supposed to be \u201cmasked\u201d in intelligence reports, had been unlawfully revealed in classified reports at the order of senior Obama administration officials.The incident prompted an ethics investigation and forced Mr. Nunes to recuse himself from the committee\u2019s Russia investigation, a move that Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York and a committee member, said almost certainly left Mr. Nunes feeling disappointed.Most of the news about Russia falls into one of three categories, which we break down.\u201cThis is the largest issue facing the Intelligence Committee in years, probably the biggest one since the Iraq war,\u201d Mr. King said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a moment in history, and you want to be there.\u201dMr. Nunes has not read the warrant from which the memo is said to be drawn. The Justice Department considers such warrants extremely sensitive and allowed only one Democrat and one Republican from the committee, plus staff, to view it. Rather than do so himself, Mr. Nunes designated Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina to be the Republican reader.Yet even during his recusal, Mr. Nunes appeared eager to turn the spotlight on those who had sought to expose what they believed was a conspiracy to elect Mr. Trump.The visit was highly unusual; it appeared that the staff members were trying to meet with Mr. Steele outside official channels. Ordinarily, such a visit would be coordinated through lawyers, conducted with knowledge of the committee\u2019s minority party and the American Embassy.Mr. Nunes once enjoyed a cordial working relationship with his fellow Californian and Democratic counterpart, Representative Adam B. Schiff. But that ended when Mr. Nunes made his run to the White House in March, and Mr. Schiff called for his recusal.In an interview, Mr. Schiff called Mr. Nunes\u2019s push to release the memo \u201ca cynical strategy that the president applauds,\u201d and said he was \u201cdeeply concerned about the breach of faith between our committee and the intelligence community.\u201dBut Republicans were rallying around Mr. Nunes.Sheryl Gay Stolberg reported from White Sulphur Springs, and Matthew Rosenberg from Washington.

Cruise Lines International Association, a trade group comprised most of the industry\u2019s cruise lines, said that about 10 percent of its members\u2019 ships are registered in Bermuda, accounting for about 13 percent of passenger capacity. Subsequent to the reversal, cruise ships registered in Bermuda that offered same-sex weddings have determined they can no longer do so. Given the repeal, another couple, who had planned to marry next fall on a ship, has decided to wed before the sailing, according to a company spokeswoman.\u201cBecause Princess had not yet formally launched a same-sex wedding program we had only a few couples with bookings,\u201d wrote Negin Kamali, a spokeswoman for Princess, in an email.

{"Headline": "The Elder Statesman of Latin American Literature \u2014 and a Writer of Our Moment", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "FeatureMario Vargas Llosa isn\u2019t a household name among American readers. But at 81, he remains a literary and political colossus across the Spanish-speaking world, and his novels have never felt more relevant.Supported byPreysler, who was born in the Philippines but has lived in Spain since she was 16, built the home with her third husband, Spain\u2019s former Minister of Economy and Finance Miguel Boyer, who died in 2014. Paparazzi often loiter around its gates; Preysler, 67, has been an object of fascination for Spanish-language tabloids ever since she married her first husband, the pop star Julio Iglesias, in 1971. (Her second husband was a Spanish marquis.) And it was something of a scandal that Vargas Llosa now had a desk with tidy piles of books and a bust of Honor\u00e9 de Balzac in a little corner of her library amid Boyer\u2019s old science and math books. He used to live in a floor-through apartment in the heart of historic Madrid, steps away from the Royal Theater, where the streets are as narrow as trenches. But in 2015, he left his wife of 50 years for Preysler. As I followed him out onto the terrace, I wondered briefly if part of Preysler\u2019s appeal had been her ability to wrap him in such luxury.We took seats under a white awning on a pair of white couches facing an aquamarine pool. My coffee arrived in a delicate pink china cup. As we talked, the sun slid behind a narrow forest of closely planted trees, which hid the street, the high stone walls and the long gravel driveway, giving the garden the illusion of a park. We talked for more than two hours in Spanish, about the Mississippi modernist William Faulkner and the Spanish superagent Carmen Balcells, about the TV shows \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cVikings.\u201d For most of our conversation, Vargas Llosa was strikingly self-contained. He barely touched his glass of water and rarely moved his hands, though he said almost everything with a smile and ended many sentences with a laugh. He was like the home itself: a fortress camouflaged in the warmth of social grace. \u201cHe can strike one as being a very formal person, and he has cultivated that to some degree,\u201d said Marie Arana, a Peruvian-American writer and former editor of The Washington Post\u2019s books section. \u201cPeople who are enormously attractive compensate by trying to be formal, to look serious.\u201dIn March, Vargas Llosa will turn 82. He once looked like a dark-eyed John Travolta: full lips, strong chin, thick black hair. The hair is now white, but the serene manners and the prodigious self-discipline remain. He has written almost every morning of his life, publishing 59 books in 55 years, among them some of the greatest novels of the past half century: \u201cThe Time of the Hero,\u201d \u201cConversation in the Cathedral,\u201d \u201cAunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,\u201d \u201cThe Feast of the Goat.\u201d \u201cIf I didn\u2019t write,\u201d he told The Paris Review in 1990, \u201cI would blow my brains out, without a shadow of a doubt.\u201d This week Vargas Llosa has three books coming out \u2014 English translations of a novel (\u201cThe Neighborhood\u201d) and of a collection of political essays (\u201cSabers and Utopias\u201d), as well as a new volume in Spain, \u201cThe Call of the Tribe,\u201d which is not yet available in English. It\u2019s a condensed history of three centuries of classical liberal thought, from Adam Smith to Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Revel, that doubles as a kind of intellectual autobiography.For Vargas Llosa, writing has always been a weapon against both despair and despotism, and \u201cThe Call of the Tribe\u201d feels like his attempt to beat back the waves of nationalism and populism now flooding our world. He is a defender of individual liberty and democracy in Latin America. His attacks on authoritarians have made him enemies among both socialists and conservatives. What he most respects in a person, he told me, is integrity: \u201cConsistency in what you believe, what you say and what you do.\u201d And while his insistence on saying and doing exactly what he himself believes has left a scorched path in his personal life, it has also been the making of his career.\u201cWhen I went to live with my father, and I was feeling alone, feeling completely isolated, separated from the people whom I felt were my family, reading saved me,\u201d Vargas Llosa told me. He buried himself in novels by Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Charles Dickens and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, dreaming of a life filled with adventure. \u201cIt was a marvelous way of not living the horrible life that I had.\u201d\u201cWhen [my father] beat me,\u201d Vargas Llosa writes in his 1993 memoir, \u201cA Fish in the Water,\u201d \u201cI went off the deep end, and terror many times made me humble myself before him and beg his pardon with my hands joined. But that didn\u2019t calm him down. And he went on hitting me, screaming and threatening to put me in the army as a private as soon as I was old enough to be a recruit so that I\u2019d be set on the right path. When the whole scene was over and done with, and he could lock me in my room, it was not the blows, but rage and disgust with myself for having been so afraid of him and having humbled myself before him in that way, that made me spend a sleepless night, weeping in silence.\u201dFiction and poetry were Mario\u2019s refuge from Ernesto\u2019s domestic despotism. They were also his defiance. \u201cMy father saw literature as something extremely dangerous,\u201d Vargas Llosa said in the garden, brushing aside his old traumas with a laugh. \u201cHe thought that literature was a passport to failure in life, that it was a way of starving to death.\u201d Novels, Ernesto also believed, were the work of drunk bohemians and homosexuals. Bent on turning Mario into a real man, Ernesto enrolled his son in Leoncio Prado Military Academy when he was 14. \u201cI went to Leoncio Prado because my father thought that the military was the best cure for literature and for those activities that he understood as very marginalized.\u201d Vargas Llosa chuckled at the paradox. \u201cOn the contrary, he gave me the subject of my first novel!\u201dEven now, \u201cThe Time of the Hero\u201d (1963) still has the power to shock with its scenes of bullying and dissipation among cadets. Highlights include: the gang rape of a chicken, blow jobs endured for liquor, officers\u2019 kicking students and the killing of a boy nicknamed \u201cSlave,\u201d who marks himself for special humiliation when he makes the mistake of pleading for mercy with clasped hands. Incensed by the expos\u00e9, administrators at Leoncio Prado Military Academy rounded up 1,000 copies and set the books aflame in an official ceremony. But a judge for Spain\u2019s prestigious Premio Biblioteca Breve Prize declared it \u201cthe best novel in the Spanish language in the past 30 years.\u201d \u201cThe Time of the Hero\u201d was among the first sensations of a transformative age of Latin American literature known as the Boom. (All its other major writers \u2014 Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Carlos Fuentes, Jos\u00e9 Donoso, Juan Rulfo, Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias and Guillermo Cabrera Infante \u2014 have died.)Vargas Llosa\u2019s masterwork is \u201cConversation in the Cathedral\u201d (1969). It\u2019s Faulkner cross-pollinated with Balzac, modernist techniques used to paint a sweeping historical panorama. The structure of the novel spirals out from a single point: an unexpected meeting in 1960s Lima between Santiago Zavala, a 30-year-old reporter estranged from his upper-crust family, and Ambrosio, his family\u2019s former chauffeur. The two run into each other at a pound, where Ambrosio slaughters dogs for money. Together, the men get drunk at a dive bar called the Cathedral, and from their conversation rises a blistering vision of the whole of Peru under Gen. Manuel Odr\u00eda\u2019s eight-year military dictatorship in the 1950s. Vargas Llosa implicates everyone in the moral catastrophe, from the bickering student dissidents to the cowardly media to the rich women drowning themselves in alcohol and gossip.Why has Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s magical realism cemented its place on American bookshelves and syllabuses while Vargas Llosa\u2019s gritty masterpieces are neglected? Vargas Llosa\u2019s best books are harder to read than Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s. He\u2019s less sentimental, dirtier, raunchier, angrier. \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude\u201d looks like a Hallmark card next to \u201cConversation in the Cathedral.\u201d You might be fired for assigning Vargas Llosa in high school English. And Vargas Llosa has published so many novels \u2014 18 in all \u2014 that the tours de force can get lost among the mediocrities. His buttoned-up public demeanor hasn\u2019t helped. \u201cGabo\u201d was not only a tremendous writer; he was an expert showman who once worked in advertising and cannily played up his Caribbean exoticism for foreign audiences. When the two fell out in the 1970s, many intellectuals leaned left toward Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, while Vargas Llosa was shunned.Yet Vargas Llosa is the more daring, more democratic writer. While Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez cozied up to Fidel Castro and refined a distinctive style, Vargas Llosa reinvented his over and over again while defending free markets and reproductive freedom, gay rights and open elections. His political tracts underscore the value of diversity, of stellar public education, of equal opportunities for the poor. And his novels, whether they are kaleidoscopic histories, political thrillers, generational sagas or slapstick comedies, are remarkable for their ability to inhabit a host of perspectives. He\u2019s especially good at the psychology of collaborators \u2014 the people who surround authoritarians and make their administrations function. Such characters were not popular among readers in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s, who preferred Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s romantic heroes, but they might feel especially relevant to Americans today.The sacrifice was provoked by the debut of another book in Spanish. This volume, \u201cConversaci\u00f3n en Princeton,\u201d provides a view into a seminar that Vargas Llosa gave in 2015 with Rub\u00e9n Gallo, a professor of language and literature at Princeton University. For months, Vargas Llosa, Gallo and his students discussed five of Vargas Llosa\u2019s most famous books, including \u201cConversation in the Cathedral.\u201d The whole project, Gallo explained, was inspired by his desire to do a careful, point-by-point questioning of \u201cthe Goethe of our own time\u201d in a utopian space \u201cfree of any political pressure, and of any other pressures, save the pleasure of reading itself.\u201dPolitics, however, were inescapable that week in Madrid. The leaders of Catalonia, the semiautonomous region that is home to Barcelona, were threatening to hold a referendum on the question of whether Catalans ought to secede from Spain. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had already declared such a referendum illegal, and Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court had also ruled it unconstitutional. But Catalonia\u2019s regional president, Carles Puigdemont, looked determined to proceed.\u201cHow do you see what\u2019s happening in Catalonia?\u201d asked the first reporter during the event\u2019s question-and-answer session. \u201cI think we should focus on the book,\u201d Vargas Llosa responded affably. Then he segued into a four-minute answer in which he recalled that Catalan nationalists were regarded as \u201clittle old reactionaries\u201d during the 1970s; opined that the current referendum was \u201can absurd blunder, an anachronism that has nothing to do with the realities of our time\u201d; and suggested that Catalan nationalism was a kind of \u201cillness.\u201d \u201cMy hope,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the government will have the energy necessary to impede a coup \u2014 that is really what\u2019s gestating \u2014 from taking place and to give it the appropriate sanctions.\u201d Within hours, these pronouncements had made headline news in Spain, Venezuela and Peru.It\u2019s almost impossible to imagine the same reaction happening here if, say, Toni Morrison or Philip Roth voiced a political opinion. But Vargas Llosa looms as a political figure in his own right: He almost became the president of Peru in 1990, and he is still admired and loathed as one of Latin America\u2019s most influential champions of limited government, free enterprise, democracy and rule of law. For the past 25 years, he has penned an op-ed column called \u201cTouchstone\u201d for the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds that is devoured by politicos in Spain and Peru. When Casa de America held an event to celebrate Vargas Llosa\u2019s 80th birthday in 2016, attendees included the president of Chile (Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era), a former president of Uruguay (Luis Alberto Lacalle), two former presidents of Colombia (\u00c1lvaro Uribe and Andr\u00e9s Pastrana) and two former prime ministers of Spain (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar and Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez). The event was kicked off with a speech from Prime Minister Rajoy.\u201cWords are acts,\u201d Vargas Llosa said while we sat on Preysler\u2019s terrace, emphasizing each word as if pointing at the sentence hovering in the air. This phrase by Jean-Paul Sartre, he told me, crystallized his understanding of the novelist\u2019s political role in the 1950s. Back then, he was a Marxist. The scenes of Communist resistance in \u201cConversation in the Cathedral\u201d were inspired by his own activities at the University of San Marcos in 1953.In 1959, Vargas Llosa enthusiastically supported Fidel Castro\u2019s socialist revolution in Cuba. At one point, he even housed Che Guevara\u2019s mother in his apartment. But as Castro\u2019s regime developed, Vargas Llosa grew uneasy. During a trip to Havana, he learned that gay Cubans were being imprisoned with counterrevolutionaries and common criminals in forced-labor camps. \u201cSome of them had that totally idealistic idea that the revolution was not only going to bring socialism, but it was also going to change customs, that there would be a homosexual liberation,\u201d he said. He told me he sent a private letter to Castro, expressing his confusion and surprise.By 1971, however, such private protest felt insufficient. When the poet Heberto Padilla was subjected to a Stalinist show trial, Vargas Llosa gathered several friends at his home in Barcelona to draft a public denunciation of Castro. This famous \u201cPadilla letter\u201d appeared in the French newspaper Le Monde and was reprinted all over Latin America, signed by Susan Sontag, Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, among others. The fallout from its publication was atrocious, including accusations that Vargas Llosa worked for the C.I.A., as well as the beginning of the disintegration of his close friendship with Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\u201cBut at the same time I felt a great freedom, you know?\u201d Vargas Llosa told me. \u201cBecause until then \u2018you can\u2019t give weapons to the enemy.\u2019 So you had to swallow all kinds of frogs and snakes\u201d \u2014 the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the labor camps in Cuba \u2014 \u201cbut after the Padilla affair, I never again swallowed a frog or snake.\u201dVargas Llosa\u2019s break with Castro precipitated a fundamental reconstruction of his political beliefs. By 1982 he was having dinner with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the classical liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin at the home of the historian Hugh Thomas in London. This political conversion had an impact on his literary reputation. Gerald Martin, who wrote the definitive biography of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and is now working on another about Vargas Llosa, believes it was the most important factor keeping him from a Nobel win. \u201cIt was generally believed before with Lundkvist\u201d \u2014 Artur Lundkvist, an influential member of the Swedish Academy \u2014 \u201cthat he preferred the Socialist, Marxist, Communist, radical, progressive writers,\u201d Martin told me. Vargas Llosa received the prize for literature only after the Nobel committee had changed by the early 2000s.It didn\u2019t help that Vargas Llosa\u2019s beliefs were often subject to gross distortion. Carlos Gran\u00e9s, the editor who assembled \u201cSabers and Utopias,\u201d told me that he once heard the Peruvian author Dante Castro Arrasco declare that if Vargas Llosa had become president of Peru, he would have replaced the national coat of arms with a swastika. In truth, Vargas Llosa\u2019s politics are closer to libertarian, and he has denounced every Latin American authoritarian of his lifetime. \u201cSabers and Utopias\u201d shows him inveighing against not only leftists like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela but also Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile and the Peronist military dictatorship in Argentina.\u201cMario Vargas Llosa has been a central figure \u2014 central, central, central \u2014 for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director of Human Rights Watch, told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m exaggerating. He\u2019s some sort of father of the current Peruvian democracy.\u201dThe mobs were not always so friendly when Vargas Llosa campaigned for president of Peru in the 1990 election. His house received bomb threats. His van was attacked. Members of his political party, the Freedom Movement, were murdered. His candidacy had emerged unexpectedly in 1987, after he penned a vitriolic op-ed against President Alan Garc\u00eda\u2019s plan to nationalize Peru\u2019s banks. Soon after, Vargas Llosa stopped writing fiction to create the Freedom Movement. His eldest son, \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa, then 23, became the campaign spokesman.Vargas Llosa\u2019s platform attracted new people to Peruvian politics, including the corporate executive Beatriz Merino, who later served as prime minister of Peru. But most Peruvians were fed up with political parties. During the 1980s, the incompetence of Peru\u2019s political class had turned the country into a nightmare. Terrorist groups killed some 17,000 people and controlled large swaths of the sierras. Hyperinflation hit 7,650 percent in 1990. At least one-third of the country\u2019s population lived in poverty. Vargas Llosa\u2019s call to reduce state subsidies terrified many of these citizens, as did his connections to the rich, white elite that dominated Peru like an oligarchy. Nevertheless, for much of the campaign, polls predicted a Vargas Llosa win. Then, in the final laps of the campaign, an unknown agricultural engineer named Alberto Fujimori started closing in.Fujimori mocked and attacked Vargas Llosa relentlessly, drawing attention to his agnosticism, his international connections, his earnest intellectualism and his racy novels. A son of cotton pickers from Japan, he presented himself as an outsider who would defend Peru\u2019s poor and working class from a foreign neoliberal \u201ceconomic shock.\u201d Fujimori himself sometimes appeared on a tractor. He had a gift for vague, emotionally resonant statements. But Fujimori won only because Peru\u2019s leftists and centrists swung behind him for the sole purpose of sinking Vargas Llosa. Then almost immediately after he took office, Fujimori pivoted right and implemented a version of the \u201ceconomic shock\u201d that Vargas Llosa had recommended. This reversal depended on the collaboration of the same economists, lawyers and business owners who had rallied around the Freedom Movement. But by 1992 \u2014 after Fujimori used tanks to shut down Peru\u2019s Congress because it resisted his reforms \u2014 it became obvious that many of Vargas Llosa\u2019s former supporters did not feel as strongly about freedom as he did.Fujimori foreshadowed a new wave of authoritarians in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia. The political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way have coined a term for this kind of regime: \u201ccompetitive authoritarianism.\u201d On paper, it looks a lot like democracy. In practice, it operates more like autocracy. Yet Fujimori\u2019s popularity remained high for much of the 1990s. As Vargas Llosa predicted, economic reforms finished hyperinflation. And in 1992, Peruvian police officers captured the leader of the most grotesquely violent guerrilla group in Latin American history, the Shining Path, allowing them to dismantle it. These two triumphs are why some Peruvians claim that Fujimori \u201csaved\u201d Peru, even though his government formed military death squads, suspended habeas corpus, crushed the free press, mishandled a cholera epidemic, sterilized thousands of indigenous women, blackmailed opponents and fomented widespread corruption.Sitting over a glass of tomato juice at the Four Seasons, Vargas Llosa emphasized that he never worked against Fujimori until he brought out the tanks. \u201cNot only did I respect the election, I was one of the first to congratulate Fujimori, to wish him luck,\u201d Vargas Llosa said. \u201cAnd during the two years that he governed legally as president, I did not make the most minimal opposition.\u201d But when Fujimori shut down Congress, Vargas Llosa became his enemy. He asked the international community to cut off aid to Fujimori and noted (correctly) that Latin American militaries often favor coups d\u2019\u00e9tat. In response, Fujimori\u2019s head of the armed forces, Nicol\u00e1s de Bari Hermoza, suggested that Vargas Llosa was deliberately harming Peruvians. \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa told me that they learned of a plan to strip the entire Vargas Llosa family of its Peruvian citizenship. Mario appealed to Spain, and in 1993 it granted him citizenship. In Peru, this event was widely perceived as the petulant betrayal of a sore loser.If you have never read Vargas Llosa before, this is the place to start. Gorgeous and harrowing, \u201cThe Feast of the Goat\u201d is also the most accessible of his great political fictions. Here his taste for baroque narrative multiplicity has been simplified to just a handful of perspectives, and Edith Grossman\u2019s translation is superb. Trujillo, Vargas Llosa writes, is an \u201castute exploiter of men\u2019s vanity, greed and stupidity.\u201d Almost every character collaborates with him as long as they believe that he can help them gain power or money. Even the man who organizes Trujillo\u2019s assassination first guards the dictator\u2019s life. Trujillo nevertheless murders his brother and destroys his reputation. Trujillo had killed him in stages, the man reflects later, \u201ctaking away his decency, his honor, his self-respect, his joy in living, his hopes and desires, turning him into a sack of bones tormented by a guilty conscience that had been destroying him gradually for so many years.\u201dFujimori\u2019s regime came apart the same year that \u201cThe Feast of the Goat\u201d was published in Spanish. On Sept. 14, 2000, the media aired footage of Fujimori\u2019s head of secret intelligence, Vladimiro Montesinos, paying a congressman $15,000 to switch to Fujimori\u2019s party. Two months after the tape surfaced, Fujimori made an unscheduled trip to Japan and faxed his resignation from a Tokyo hotel room. By then more than $50 million had been located in foreign bank accounts in Montesinos\u2019s name. Five years later, Fujimori was arrested in Chile, and he was eventually extradited to Peru. In 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for, among other atrocities, his role in creating a death squad that murdered an 8-year-old boy.\u00c1lvaro moved back to Lima during the final year of Fujimori\u2019s regime to join the democratic resistance, and after Fujimori\u2019s collapse, Vargas Llosa\u2019s influence in Peru soared. In 2011, father and son used their new political capital to derail the presidential hopes of Fujimori\u2019s daughter, Keiko. To defeat her, Keiko\u2019s opponents rallied behind Ollanta Humala, a man Hugo Ch\u00e1vez endorsed in Peru\u2019s 2006 election. After interviewing Humala in Vargas Llosa\u2019s office, \u00c1lvaro helped arrange a public meeting at which Humala swore a democratic oath. Vargas Llosa sent a video endorsement that played at the event. \u201cIf Vargas Llosa had not supported Ollanta Humala against Keiko Fujimori, Ollanta Humala would not have won,\u201d the Peruvian political scientist Alberto Vergara told me. \u201cThey moderated Humala so that he could win the runoff.\u201d\u201cHalf the country hated us, obviously,\u201d \u00c1lvaro said. \u201cAnd until this day they won\u2019t forgive us. But in the end I think that what they won\u2019t forgive us is that we were right.\u201d Humala did not become an authoritarian. When his term in office ended, he stepped down. He is now in jail awaiting trial for corruption.As the cocktail hour dragged on, Vargas Llosa became restless. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous to sit or to walk,\u201d he said, \u201cbut standing around is horrible.\u201d He is a man who likes to be doing, not waiting, and I got the sense that for him and Preysler all their charming, pre-awards chitchat was a kind of necessary work. Finally the bells chimed for dinner. Vargas Llosa escorted Preysler to the meal on his arm.In our conversations, Vargas Llosa declined to discuss his romantic entanglements. When I asked him what had fractured his marriage to Patricia Llosa, which produced three children, he dropped all his smiles and chuckles. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthat topic has to do with love. Love is probably the most enriching experience that a human being can have. Nothing transforms a person\u2019s life as much as love. At the same time, love is a private experience. If it\u2019s made public, it becomes cheap, shoddy, full of commonplaces. This is why it\u2019s so hard to write about love in literature. You have to find the most clever ways so that it doesn\u2019t lose its authenticity and become commonplace. So I think that a person shouldn\u2019t talk about love precisely if love is so important in his life.\u201dYou\u2019re a romantic, I said.\u201cI think we all are. I think that romanticism has marked our lives very much, that it\u2019s very difficult not to be romantic in some way, although many of us don\u2019t realize it. You live it or you reject it. You vaccinate yourself against it. Let\u2019s say that I haven\u2019t rejected it. When it\u2019s happened, I\u2019ve lived it.\u201dThe first time he lived it was in 1955, when he eloped with his aunt\u2019s sister, Julia Urquidi Illanes. At the time, Vargas Llosa was a 19-year-old university student, and Urquidi was a 29-year-old divorc\u00e9e. Ernesto Vargas was so enraged by their marriage that he threatened to kill Mario. But the couple refused to divorce. The day Ernesto accepted the marriage, Vargas Llosa writes in his memoir, marked his \u201cdefinitive emancipation\u201d from his father. But nine years later, they divorced, and a year after, in 1965, he married his first cousin Patricia Llosa Urquidi, Julia\u2019s niece. In her memoir, \u201cWhat Varguitas Didn\u2019t Say,\u201d Julia suggests the cousins began their romance when Patricia visited them in Paris in 1960, when Mario was 24 and Patricia was 15.Forty-five years into their marriage, Vargas Llosa declared in his Nobel lecture that Patricia \u201cdoes everything and does everything well. She solves problems, manages the economy, imposes order on chaos, keeps journalists and intrusive people at bay, defends my time, decides appointments and trips, packs and unpacks suitcases and is so generous that even when she thinks she is rebuking me, she pays me the highest compliment: \u2018Mario, the only thing you\u2019re good for is writing.\u2019\u2009\u201d The year she turned 70, however, he left her for Preysler.\u201cWhat you have to understand about him is that he\u2019s a person who gives himself with absolute passion to what he believes in, even when he is wrong,\u201d \u00c1lvaro told me. Of all Vargas Llosa\u2019s children, \u00c1lvaro has been the most accepting of his father\u2019s new relationship, perhaps because their ties go far beyond the familial. Vargas Llosa\u2019s daughter, Morgana, a photographer and documentary filmmaker who lives in Peru, told me that she was shocked when Vargas Llosa appeared with Preysler in the Spanish-language celebrity weekly \u00a1Hola! just days after the entire family had gathered to celebrate Patricia and Mario\u2019s 50th anniversary. Now she takes the situation more stoically. \u201cSeeing how marriages fall apart after two, three, five or 10 years, I think it\u2019s an absolute success to have shared a life together for 50 years,\u201d she said.But Vargas Llosa\u2019s younger son, Gonzalo, who works with the United Nations in Britain, still reels from the way Mario handled the divorce. \u201cWe had a very special and very close relationship, and I love him greatly,\u201d he told me. But he was enormously disappointed when Mario told \u00a1Hola! that his first year with Preysler had been the happiest year of his life. \u201cIf the year in which you leave your wife of 50 years and you don\u2019t speak to your son is the happiest year of your life, well, that doesn\u2019t say a great deal about whatever he may have really felt,\u201d Gonzalo told me. \u201cSo this is fine to think, but why say it publicly? This what I find distasteful but also hurtful.\u201dDivorce, and its painful aftermath, can happen in any family. But what galls many people, including Gonzalo, is that Preysler embodies the celebrity entertainment culture that Vargas Llosa long claimed to abhor. A woman of feline poise and beauty, she has shrewdly parlayed tabloid attention into a kind of proto-Kardashian career: hosting television shows, promoting luxury goods like Rabat jewelry and Porcelanosa tiles. Their social life is now extensively documented by \u00a1Hola!, where Preysler herself once worked, as well as by many less savory gossip sheets. A quick online search turns up images of the couple sailing on the Costa Azul, watching bullfighting in Seville and attending parties at Dumfries House with Prince Charles.\u201cThere are hundreds of publications, radio and television programs, that feed a kind of morbid curiosity that consists of basically revealing the private lives of people,\u201d Vargas Llosa told me in Madrid. \u201cMany people are delighted. On the contrary, it\u2019s a real profession to show your privacy. It\u2019s a kind of striptease, no, of a life, especially sexual, erotic. And it\u2019s a world that literally produces horror in me.\u201dThis \u201cprofession\u201d is Preysler\u2019s, however, and as long as they are together it will be, in some way, Vargas Llosa\u2019s profession as well. In December the Spanish edition of Harper\u2019s Bazaar magazine published a soft-focus video of the couple embracing and talking about their life together \u2014 precisely the sort of thing that, to listen to Vargas Llosa, \u201cliterally produces horror\u201d in him. This sudden, major gap between what Vargas Llosa says and what he does reminds me of a conversation we had about his puckish character Fonchito, a boy with the face of an angel and a taste for Egon Schiele. In \u201cThe Discreet Hero\u201d (2013), Fonchito develops an interest in religion and asks his father, Don Rigoberto, \u201cCould you tell me what this Sodom and Gomorrah is, Papa?\u201dSometimes I wonder if Fonchito is your alter-ego, I said to Vargas Llosa.\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cHe\u2019s a character who disturbs me a bit because I don\u2019t really understand him very well.\u201d A moment later he added, \u201cI can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s really so innocent or if he\u2019s concealing something or if it\u2019s a way of behaving that\u2019s clever, no?\u201dFonchito first appeared in Vargas Llosa\u2019s erotic comedies \u201cIn Praise of the Stepmother\u201d (1988) and \u201cThe Notebooks of Don Rigoberto\u201d (1997). Most critics ignore these libertine novels when they discuss Vargas Llosa\u2019s work. His own fans tend to regard them with either distaste or hilarity. But the skittishness about sex has kept readers and critics from appreciating how erotics pervade all of Vargas Llosa\u2019s fiction. Even the novels that are best known for their political dissections are filled with a kind of transgressive sexual realism: scenes in brothels, secret homosexual affairs, rapes. \u201cPeople don\u2019t tend to think of him as an erotic writer, but his literary project is so interesting in part because of the way it connects sexuality with politics,\u201d Gallo told me. \u201cI think there is an idea, and he\u2019s said as much, that a dictatorship affects all the levels of citizens\u2019 lives, including the sexual sphere.\u201dNowhere has this connection been as explicit, or as graphic, as in Vargas Llosa\u2019s latest novel, \u201cThe Neighborhood.\u201d The story opens with best friends Marisa and Chabela in bed. A few pages in we find the words \u201cperspire,\u201d \u201cclitoris,\u201d \u201cscratching\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d \u2014 their platonic evening has transformed into a lesbian affair. In Vargas Llosa\u2019s opinion, this scene, and the novel\u2019s many other triple-X plot twists, realistically capture the bedroom adventures that occurred during the darkest part of the Fujimori years. Lima\u2019s authoritarian curfew, which forbade residents to travel through the city at night, turned many dinners and parties into spontaneous sleepovers, he told me, with some inevitably kinky consequences.\u201cIn those periods of tension, of terrible aggravation, eroticism often springs up as a compensation, no?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of distracting oneself, of losing oneself. It\u2019s like the idea of the end of the world. The world is ending: All sins are allowed.\u201d\u201cCommunism has destroyed itself by its total incapacity to fulfill all the expectations that were put into this system to bring prosperity, justice, happiness, culture to a society,\u201d he said in English. \u201cBut populism is much more difficult to fight because it\u2019s not an ideology, not a system with principles, with ideas that we can refute rationally.\u201dAs recently as three years ago, it seemed as if Vargas Llosa\u2019s political values had conquered the world. Almost everywhere in Latin America, the totalitarian regimes that he opposed had collapsed \u2014 while free markets, democracy and sexual liberation found favor. But in 2016, the tide seemed to change. During our conversations, he recalled feeling astonished during a visit to England shortly before the vote on Brexit. For Vargas Llosa, London had long been a model of how polyglot pluralism, democracy and free markets should work together. Yet there was Boris Johnson on his hotel television, shamelessly declaring that Britain\u2019s payments to the European Union subsidized bullfights in Spain.\u201cTo lie so brazenly, so cynically,\u201d Vargas Llosa told me. \u201cWell, I was amazed.\u201d He never imagined that such retrograde tactics could work in Britain. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s been proved that no country is really vaccinated against demagogy or populism.\u201d In Europe, it\u2019s easy to name major political figures, like Angela Merkel in Germany, who embrace the principles of liberal economics while also defending a liberal society. That\u2019s rare in Latin America. \u201cThe attraction to a caudillo is a characteristic that many Latin American countries share,\u201d the Peruvian journalist Diego Salazar told me. \u201cAnd not just Latin Americans. In fact, President Trump is the first Latin American president of the United States in that respect.\u201dIn 2016, Keiko Fujimori lost the presidency by only 0.2 percent of the vote, and her party, Popular Force, gained a majority in Congress that she has used, in true competitive-authoritarian fashion, to attack her strongest opponents. In late December, Popular Force nearly deposed President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in a legislative coup. Kuczynski was saved only by the intercession of Alberto Fujimori and his son, Kenji, who persuaded nine congressmen to sit out the key vote. Soon after, Kuczynski granted Alberto a Christmas Eve pardon. It\u2019s widely believed that the abstentions were quid pro quo for this release.\u201cWe have always had to choose between the lesser of two evils,\u201d Gustavo Gorriti, editor of the investigative-news outlet IDL-Reporteros, said about Peruvians. \u201cAnd we have had substandard democratic candidates, which we chose to elect just in order to avoid the return to the Fujimori dictatorship.\u201d But the Fujimoris are now essentially in power \u2014 Kuczynski\u2019s political survival depends upon their favor \u2014 and Peru\u2019s loose coalition of democratically minded forces may not pull off another win in the 2021 elections.Vargas Llosa\u2019s own role in these battles is diminishing. The pain and friction of his unexpected divorce have estranged him from Peru and strained many of his old friendships. He does not travel to Lima as often or stay long when he goes. The apartment where \u00c1lvaro met with Humala now belongs solely to Patricia Llosa, who has dismantled Vargas Llosa\u2019s office and is turning it into a TV room. His political opinions will always matter in Lima, but now that he has opted to join Preysler\u2019s jet set, they will carry less weight. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa predicted this shift at the start of his father\u2019s affair. \u201cHe was a god for me not just because I loved him as a father,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut because I thought he was the most brilliant and important and inspiring intellectual that I had ever come across or read about. And when I see a Nobel Prize winner giving interviews to \u00a1Hola!, I feel sad that he has allowed himself to become part of a world which is intellectually so absolutely poor.\u201dNothing may transform a life as much as love, but Vargas Llosa has always been hard to comprehend. He\u2019s a modernist and a comedian, a politician and an aesthete, an intellectual and a libertine. Writing was not simply a refuge from or a rebellion against Ernesto, he told me in Preysler\u2019s garden; it was \u201ca way of revealing myself to be different from what he wanted me to be.\u201d His whole life has been a series of these startling revelations. Perhaps we all contain multitudes, but Vargas Llosa has put his contradictions into action, in his life and on the page.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Inflation Works (or Why Your Chicken Is Going to Cost More)", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "Advertisement\nIt\u2019s the worrisome byproduct of a healthy economy: inflation.After the global financial crisis, the world sank into one of the deepest recessions since the Great Depression. And for most of the last decade, it has been in an economic funk, characterized by low levels of growth and piddling price increases.To get their economies out of that rut, central banks helped push interest rates sharply lower. The goal was to bolster investment and growth. And now it appears that the world economy is finally starting to generate real momentum.The United States has been ahead of the pack, having started its somewhat sluggish recovery in the second quarter of 2009.As the economy gains momentum, companies and business buy more. Metal tubes. Industrial hose. Accounting and legal services. Steel. Wireless internet. Tires. Printer toner.And amid the Amazonification of American retail, cardboard boxes. Lots of cardboard boxes.\u201cClearly demand is strong,\u201d Thomas A. Hassfurther, head of the corrugated products division at the Packaging Corporation of America, said on a conference call with analysts.  \u201cWe're in a phase now where the box business is tracking the G.D.P. a lot closer than it had been.\u201dTo make more boxes, his company needs more of the material that goes into them, like raw cardboard fiber and chemicals. And it is paying higher prices for both. \u201cWe're competing with everybody for that same shortage of labor and equipment,\u201d Mr. Hassfurther said.Trucks deliver the raw ingredients and trucks deliver the final goods. But there is a limited supply of trucks.Basic economic theory then kicks in. When demand goes up and supply holds steady, prices should rise. Essentially, companies that need things shipped are willing to pay more to get them delivered.Sure enough, so-called spot rates for freight \u2014 the price for deliveries not covered by longer-term contracts \u2014 rose by more than 20 percent last year.Those rates aren\u2019t likely to fall anytime soon. While trucking companies are ordering more vehicles for their fleets, it will take time for those rigs to be ready. And even when they are, an acute shortage of drivers could limit the number of vehicles deployed.\u201cIf you buy more trucks, the challenge is finding enough drivers to put in those trucks,\u201d said Bob Costello, the chief economist of the American Trucking Associations.When trucking companies need more employees, they simply offer more money. In recent months, hourly wages for truckers moved steadily higher. In the fall, their annual growth rate exceeded 4 percent, the fastest pace seen since late 2013.When Eduardo Andrade looked at one of his paystubs in the fall, the trucker thought his boss might have made a mistake. His check from Baylor Trucking, a family business based in rural Indiana, showed that he was earning 52 cents per mile, up from the 48 cents he had been making. He often drives for three straight weeks, moving food and garments from the East Coast to the Midwest and then hauling insulation materials back. The raise will fatten his paycheck by $6,000 per year, if he maintains his regular mileage.\u201cThis is the biggest increase I have ever had with the company,\u201d said Mr. Andrade, who has driven for Baylor for a decade. The 60-year-old has seven grandchildren and plans to spend his extra cash to buy them more movie tickets, clothes and pizza dinners.Those higher wages have to be paid for \u2014 and it\u2019s usually trucking customers that end up footing the bill.For example, during the third quarter, packaged food companies, which need lots of trucks to ship their products, saw their margins shrink by 0.8 percentage points. They attributed the trend, in part, to rising freight costs.\u201cAll my companies are talking about it,\u201d said Robert B. Moskow, an analyst who researches companies in the food industry for Credit Suisse.Corporations are in the business of making as much money as possible, and they generally aren\u2019t inclined to simply accept thinner profit margins.They have a couple of options. They can try to reduce costs in other parts of their businesses. Or they can try to charge more for their products.Tyson Foods, the giant meat and chicken company, recently told analysts that it planned to increase prices to offset rising freight costs. Tom Hayes, Tyson\u2019s chief executive, estimated that rising freight prices would cost the company more than $200 million this year. \u201cUltimately, the consumer is going to pay for it at some point,\u201d Mr. Hayes said.By itself, a 3-cent price increase for a pound of chicken isn\u2019t significant. But recent signs suggest that prices are edging higher for a range of products, like oil and gasoline, clothing, car insurance and medical care.And if other industries follow suit, it would mean that the United States \u2014 and likely the world \u2014 is finally shifting into a higher economic gear after over a decade of sputtering.Illustrations by Pete RyanAdvertisement"}

Yes, it\u2019s the best. I wouldn\u2019t vote for any other party.\u201dMany others at Maponya Mall, Soweto\u2019s most fashionable shopping center, echoed Ms. Mapanya\u2019s comments Saturday morning. Few expected the sudden change in presidents \u2014 after several days of intense negotiations among a few party leaders \u2014 would bring change to their lives, though they expressed the hope that it would.They also showed the resignation shared by many A.N.C. supporters: They had lost hope in the party but could not bring themselves to leave it.Many in Soweto, the black township south of Johannesburg famed for its resistance to apartheid, cannot imagine leaving the party because of the indisputable good it brought to their lives. Maponya Mall itself, built a decade ago, was proof of that.Inside the mall, SUVs from Mazda, Kia and Renault were on display. The storefronts were mostly South African brands and restaurants, but McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Timberland and Le Coq Sportif, the French manufacturer of sportswear, had also set up shop there.Snooks Estates, a real estate agent, advertised properties for sale across Soweto, including a two-bedroom ranch-style house with a fitted kitchen, a carport, and a wall and gate, for $82,000.Dipuo Kalodi, 34, a domestic worker, said she had cast ballots for the A.N.C. in every election since the end of apartheid in 1994. Mr. Ramaphosa is \u201cthe same as Zuma,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019ve been together for quite a long time. So what can you expect from that?\u201d\u201cI keep thinking it might change, it might change, let me give him some time \u2014 but there\u2019s no change,\u201d she said, adding with a laugh, \u201cI\u2019m a strong fighter.\u201dLebo Ngema, who came to the mall with her three children, said that the political change \u201creally doesn\u2019t have that much impact on me. No matter what you can do, you can vote, you can speak out, nothing much is going to be done.\u201d\u201cBut I guess we\u2019ll see with this new one,\u201d she added.In his state of the nation address, Mr. Ramaphosa said that \u201ca new dawn is upon us.\u201d He promised to resurrect the economy and create jobs.\u201cThis is the year in which we will turn the tide of corruption in our public institutions,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are determined to build a society defined by decency and integrity, that does not tolerate the plunder of public resources, nor the theft by corporate criminals of the hard-earned savings of ordinary people.\u201dIn December, Mr. Ramaphosa was elected leader of the A.N.C., defeating Mr. Zuma\u2019s preferred candidate. He and his allies then pushed Mr. Zuma to resign from the presidency, though his term did not expire until mid-2019. The A.N.C. was split in two factions.Mr. Ramaphosa eventually prevailed with an argument that spoke to the party\u2019s sense of self-preservation: Getting rid of the unpopular Mr. Zuma as soon as possible would help efforts to rebuild the party before national elections in 2019.To many, the back-room deals that ultimately led to Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s elevation reinforced the belief that a handful of A.N.C. elites had decided the country\u2019s future with little regard for the people.\u201cThey were talking among themselves; there was no information we were receiving,\u201d said John Baloyi, 43, a postal worker. \u201cI was uncertain about the future of our country. I thought maybe there would be violence, and there would be loss of life. I was scared actually.\u201dBut Mr. Ramaphosa, he said, was preferable to his predecessor.\u201cThat man was a businessmen,\u201d Mr. Baloyi said. \u201cHe understands what he\u2019s talking about.\u201dTeboho Sephohle, 30, was waiting to open a bank account \u2014 his first \u2014 at the mall. He said he worked odd jobs in the clothing and construction industries.In the 2016 municipal elections, Mr. Sephohle said he had volunteered for the local A.N.C. ward leader after he was promised a job. But he was still waiting.\u201cMaybe we can get jobs or something with Ramaphosa,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see.\u201dMr. Ramaphosa\u2019s state of the nation address, and the pageantry surrounding the annual speech, also raised eyebrows in Soweto.A few days after threatening to remove Mr. Zuma through a humiliating no-confidence vote in Parliament, Mr. Ramaphosa thanked Mr. Zuma for his service \u201cduring which the country made significant progress in several areas of development.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re spending a lot of money just on catering, the money that\u2019s supposed to be helping people,\u201d said Nett Phamotse, 45, who is employed as a school maintenance worker.Some of the dresses worn on the red carpet, he said, were the equivalent of \u201csix months\u2019 salary.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re just doing each other favors,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a headline with this article misspelled the surname of South Africa\u2019s president.

A snarly new master of high-octane carnage has risen into view. And she \u2014 yes, she \u2014 is putting her own audacious stamp on that most venerable of pop genres, the old-as-time tale in which getting even comes accessorized with flames, screams and buckets of blood.By the way, God is a human being \u2014 female, in case you were assuming otherwise. What\u2019s more, she is alive and unwell on this cruel, stinking planet, shedding her burned flesh in a hospital bed where she has lain for nigh on two decades.And God has a mission for her girls: to seek out and kill the man who did this to her. Or, as she puts it, \u201cMake your Daddy dead. Dead. Dead. All the way dead.\u201d In other words, she ain\u2019t kiddin\u2019.The play wears its learning lightly, though. Its masterstroke is newly contextualizing ages-old themes and motifs into a thoroughly contemporary, divided African-American landscape. That every character is black doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s solidarity between the play\u2019s haves and have-nots or, for that matter, within a single family.Resentment festers so deeply in the people portrayed here that they\u2019re all going to wind up alone. That may even include the symbiotic sisters at the play\u2019s center.Racine and Anaia open the play downstage center, in glaring light, positioned in a way that invites \u2014 no, dares \u2014 us to stare at them. They bear hideous scars, which, in Anaia\u2019s case, cover much of her face.The sisters, in turns out, are survivors of a fire, which was set by their mysterious father and which they believe killed their mother. They grew up in a series of foster homes. As Racine describes their upbringing, \u201cWe been kilt. Again and again. More than one way to die. How we still alive after all the times we been passed around? How we still alive after all the times we got hit?\u201dThe infernal plot machinery is set in motion when they receive a letter. Their mother is alive, in a rest home in the \u201cDirty South,\u201d and she wants to see them before she dies. What follows unfolds in a series of chapters signaled by titles (including \u201cBefore God,\u201d \u201cThe Weapon,\u201d \u201cIn the Valley\u201d) that pop up \u2014 against hokey cinematic backdrops \u2014 on that battered television above the stage.The twins wind up in the hills of California, where they encounter a fat-cat lawyer (Michael Genet) and a well-heeled but uneasy suburban family, which includes a perfectly groomed, miserable mother (Nehassaiu deGannes) and her teenage boys (Caleb Eberhardt and Anthony Cason). What do you know? They\u2019re twins, too!You don\u2019t need to ask, \u201cWho is the father?\u201d Identified only as the Man (a perfect, laconic Teagle F. Bougere), this unholy father shows up late, whistling, his face concealed by a black cowboy hat. And so the reckoning is at hand.Not every element of this play is equally satisfying. The satire of bourgeois affluence can seem glib and overextended. But the relationship of the sisters, and the shifting power between them, is expertly drawn and embodied.Ms. Hughes\u2019s Racine is an insolent, lip-smacking extrovert, to whom violence comes almost naturally; Ms. Fuller\u2019s slowly blooming Anaia mostly keeps her eyes lowered and her voice at a self-erasing mumble. Of course, you have to watch out for those quiet ones.The production has been designed with gritty wit and verve by a team that includes Montana Levi Blanco (costumes), Matthew Richards (lighting) and Jeremy Toussaint-Baptiste (sound). Then there is Adam Rigg\u2019s set, which at first suggests a simple, grimy institutional corridor.But as anyone knows who\u2019s familiar with earlier Soho Rep productions \u2014 including \u201cBlasted\u201d and \u201cAn Octoroon\u201d \u2014 seemingly simple sets have a way of surprising their audiences here. It feels most appropriate that for this vital company\u2019s return to its comfortably restored home, \u201cIs God Is\u201d sees fit to bring down the house \u2014 literally \u2014 once again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Low Can Unemployment Really Go? Economists Have No Idea", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s an uncertainty that has huge economic consequences.Here are two things most economists can agree upon: They want an economy where everyone who seeks a job can get one. Yet for the economy to be dynamic, some people will always be unemployed, at least temporarily as they move between jobs.There exists, in theory at least, some magic number for the unemployment rate that keeps those priorities in perfect balance, a bare minimum level of joblessness that makes room for people to move around yet ensures that nearly everyone who wants to can find work without inflation bubbling up. Economists, as they are prone to do, have created an acronym for it: Nairu, or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.Does the 4.1 percent jobless rate in January represent something lower than this \u201cnatural rate\u201d of unemployment and presage damaging inflation, as mainstream estimates have long suggested? Or could it fall more \u2014 maybe a lot more \u2014 putting more people to work without negative side effects?The stakes are huge. Just five years ago, as discussion swirled about whether there had been a rise of \u201cstructural unemployment\u201d caused by a mismatch between the skills workers had and those the job market needed, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Nairu was 5.5 percent, and Fed leaders\u2019 forecasts were in the same ballpark.At the time, February 2013, the jobless rate was 7.7 percent. If the Fed had stuck to those higher estimates of Nairu and raised interest rates to try to head off inflation, millions of Americans who are now working would have been consigned to unemployment for no good reason.Indeed, lately, some of the very scholars and policymakers who once put Nairu at the center of their economic analysis have lost faith that they have a good handle on it at all. The number is shaped by such factors as the technology people use to match up with new employers and people\u2019s willingness to relocate to find work. But like many concepts in economics, it can\u2019t be calculated directly. Rather, it must be inferred based on what is happening to other variables, which inevitably involves guesswork, assumptions and the use of historical data in a changing world.\u201cIt\u2019s not a terribly useful tool right now,\u201d said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. \u201cFor it to be useful you have to have at least a little confidence you know the number. You don\u2019t need to know it to two decimal places, but within a reasonable range. If your range is 2.5 to 7, that doesn\u2019t tell you anything.\u201dIn the mid-1990s, when Mr. Blinder was at the Fed, he and Janet Yellen, then a Fed governor, tried to persuade the chairman Alan Greenspan that interest rate increases were needed because the unemployment rate was quickly falling below estimates of Nairu in the 6 percent and higher range.Mr. Greenspan won the argument, as he almost always did at the Fed in that era. And with hindsight it seems he was correct. Unemployment kept falling through the late 1990s, and reached as low as 3.8 percent in the spring of 2000, without evident flares of inflation pressure.Indeed, the jobless rate in the United States has now fallen below 4.5 percent just three times since 1970 \u2014 the late 1990s, 2006-2007, and in the last year. In none of those times did inflation flare up (and in the current expansion, it hasn\u2019t flared up yet).Looking abroad is instructive, too. Each country has a distinct labor market that probably implies a different natural rate of unemployment. But it is striking that in Germany and Japan, joblessness levels have fallen in the last couple of years below estimates that officials in those countries have generally considered their Nairu \u2014 without inflation taking hold.That tells some officials here, charged with making policy in 2018, that the sensible strategy is to see just how low joblessness can go without causing problems.\u201cWe have to have humility\u201d about where the natural rate of unemployment really is, said Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. \u201cUltimately we\u2019re trying to assess supply and demand in the market for labor, and we can start by looking at the price. The price of labor has not been growing very quickly, and we\u2019ve been seeing job creation far in excess of what we need to keep up with labor force growth.\u201dIn other words, the fact that the United States keeps adding jobs at a healthy clip, and that wages are rising only gradually, is itself evidence that unemployment can be allowed to drift lower than historical data might suggest. One reason, Mr. Kashkari theorizes, may be greater credibility that the Fed and other central banks won\u2019t allow inflation to take off as it did back in the 1970s.Meanwhile, if the unemployment rate continues drifting down and testing the lower limits of Nairu further, 2018 may turn out to be the first time in nearly two decades to test just what good things might result from a Lycra-tight labor market.As employers find good workers to be more and more scarce, might they be willing to hire less qualified employees and train them, enhancing those workers\u2019 long-term earning potential? Will they be more willing to take a chance on people who have been unemployed for years or have a checkered past?Could they be more willing to invest in some of the cities that have been left behind by the expansion for the last nine years? After all, 33 metropolitan areas in the United States still have a jobless rate over 6 percent, and four, including Ocean City, N.J., and El Centro, Calif., have double-digit rates.\u201cNo social program can substitute for a full-employment economy,\u201d said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies issues around poverty and inequality. \u201cIf a job is the best anti-poverty strategy and we\u2019re not producing enough jobs because of a misunderstanding of the macroeconomy and a failure to manage it in the best way, we are missing a huge opportunity.\u201dIn the 1960s and 1970s, central bankers\u2019 reluctance to tolerate any unemployment really did fuel a spiral of wages and prices that created years of high inflation and economic weakness. That was a long time ago, though, and in that time there have been huge changes in everything from how people find a job to the power of unions.As Mr. Powell begins his term as Fed chairman, the question is how much he is willing to test the lower limits of unemployment. Is this more like the 1970s, or more like the 1990s? Nobody said guiding a $19 trillion economy would be easy. Yet the fate of millions depends on Mr. Powell and his Fed colleagues to get the right answer. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Backward View of Immigration", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialCongress now appears likely to reach a budget deal to keep the government functioning without treating as bargaining chips hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were children. It also appears, though, that President Trump will consider undoing his threat of deportation for these young \u201cDreamers\u201d only if Congress considers the first deep cuts to legal immigration since the 1920s.The changes the president is demanding stem from a nativist, zero-sum view that what\u2019s good for immigrants is bad for America. That view runs counter not just to the best of American tradition and principles, but to evidence of what\u2019s best for the country.The programs targeted by Mr. Trump are designed to make legal immigration more diverse and humane. One is the lottery system that offers the chance for visas to people from countries that are underrepresented as sources of American immigrants; the other is family-based immigration, which offers visas to close relatives of citizens and legal residents.Mr. Trump has said that the family reunification program \u2014 which he and other immigration opponents prefer to call \u201cchain migration\u201d \u2014 opens the floodgates to \u201cvirtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.\u201d In fact, relatives other than spouses, parents and minor children are subject to annual caps and country quotas, so that, today, the backlog is almost four million applicants, most of them facing many years of waiting to get a visa. Mr. Trump would allow no new applicants other than immediate family members, and even these would no longer include parents. Imposing these restrictions and ending the diversity visa lottery would cut in half the number of legal immigrants.Politicians have wrestled for decades with how to deal with immigrants who are in the United States illegally \u2014 now around 11 million people. But immigration in itself has been widely regarded as good for America and for the American dream. The preponderance of evidence shows that immigrants help the economy grow. They are more likely to own businesses or to start businesses than the native-born; of the 87 privately held companies currently valued at more than $1 billion, 51 percent had immigrant founders.There are questions worth examining and debating about whether the United States ought to admit more skilled immigrants and what criteria it uses to screen applicants. But such a debate can\u2019t unfold in the shadow of Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to imminently expel the Dreamers. So what is Mr. Trump really after?Members of Congress know better, and they are aware that there are sensible measures that would clear the immediate hurdle and produce a bipartisan deal. Senators John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, have offered a stopgap bill that would end the threat to the Dreamers while strengthening border security. Nothing about diversity visas or family-based migration, nothing for the wasteful wall.That makes sense. The way we deal with legal immigration should not be changed without a thorough, honest debate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Britain Stumbles Over \u2018Brexit,\u2019 Support Grows for 2nd Vote", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFFORESTFACH, Wales \u2014 In a 2016 referendum, Stephanie Holtom voted to leave the European Union, worried about immigration and convinced that other countries were telling the British government what to do.But outside a supermarket recently in a large, suburban strip mall not far from the Welsh city of Swansea, Ms. Holtom conceded she might have been wrong.\u201cI agreed to come out of Europe, but I am beginning to have second thoughts. I think it\u2019s a mess, and I\u2019m sick to death of it,\u201d said Ms. Holtom, who is retired, as she collected her shopping cart. She added that, if there were a second referendum, \u201cpeople would vote to stay.\u201dUntil now.London may be almost 200 miles away, but people here in Wales have noticed that Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to negotiate Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc, and to control her bitterly divided cabinet. \u201cI think Theresa May is absolutely hopeless,\u201d Ms. Holtom said.They even picked up support from an unexpected quarter when Nigel Farage, the former U.K. Independence Party leader and the leading proponent of Brexit, recently suggested that there might be a second referendum.Prominent \u201cleavers,\u201d as supporters of Brexit are known, dismiss that possibility out of hand, but it may not be as far-fetched as they would have people believe.Some time later this year Parliament is likely to face a fateful vote on the actual terms of any agreement Mrs. May can reach with the European Union on Britain\u2019s withdrawal. A defeat in Parliament would prompt a political crisis, very likely topple Mrs. May and possibly prompt a general election. Potentially, that could open the way to a rethink, to new Brexit options, or to a second referendum.That is what people like the local Swansea lawmaker, Geraint Davies, from the opposition Labour Party, are banking on. He believes the tide is turning against Brexit in Wales, where a majority opted to quit, although Wales is a big recipient of European development aid, and has several industries that might lose from Brexit.\u201cWhat I am sensing is that people who voted Brexit in good faith are now saying, \u2018Hold on, that\u2019s not what I voted for, and I want a final say,\u2019\u201d Mr. Davies said, listing promises made during the 2016 referendum, including one \u2014 later ruled misleading by the country\u2019s statistics authority \u2014 that quitting would free up 350 million pounds a week, or about $486 million, for health spending.\u201cYou should have the right to look again, and say: \u2018You ordered a steak and you ended up with a bit of chewed up bacon. Do you want to accept that?\u2019\u201d Mr. Davies added, arguing that Britain faces higher inflation and slower growth, and that, far from getting money back, it has offered around 39 billion pounds, or about $54 billion, in divorce payments to the European Union.Experts say they have detected a subtle shift, in Wales and elsewhere. Though few people admit to changing their views, there is growing support for a vote on the terms of any Brexit deal, according to Roger Awan-Scully, a professor of political science in the Wales Governance Center at Cardiff University.\u201cThere is some change on whether there should be another referendum on the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen a move towards the idea of the public having a greater say.\u201dHard-line supporters (and opponents) of Brexit remain steadfast in their views, but many of the less committed have yet to fully focus on what it will mean and have been turned off by the stream of complex, sometimes contradictory, reports emerging from the tortuous negotiations. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the O.J. Simpson trial: It keeps going on and on and people tune out of it,\u201d Mr. Awan-Scully added.And with signs that public opinion is volatile and could be shifting, the political ice is starting to crack.When Tony Blair, a former prime minister, called last month for another plebiscite, Brexit supporters derided him as a pillar of a failed, elitist, pro-European establishment.But it was hard to say the same when Mr. Farage suggested there should be another vote. Though Mr. Farage appeared later to retreat on the idea, Arron Banks, a big financial supporter of one of the Leave campaigns, endorsed it as well. For hard-line leave supporters, a referendum is a chance to once and for all kill off the argument to stay, and precipitate a clean break with the bloc.Pro-Europeans, by contrast, would like a plebiscite on the specific terms of any deal negotiated by Mrs. May\u2019s government, with the option to remain in the bloc if voters prefer.Several things would have to happen to make that a reality, including a change of government policy and, almost certainly, of prime minister.Some say it is too late to rethink the withdrawal, given that Britain has invoked its two-year exit clause. Others say that to date the shift in British public opinion, if any, is simply not big enough, and that Brexit support remains strong outside the big cities and in many working-class communities.But the logic of having a second referendum is compelling. The 2016 vote was a choice between leave and remain, yet was silent on the path that Britain should take thereafter.At the two extremes, these are starkly different prospects. A so-called soft Brexit could keep Britain integrated within the European Union\u2019s economic model and part of its single market and customs union, accepting all its rules, albeit without having a say over them.A hard Brexit might cut most of those ties, and take the country toward a low regulation, low tax economy \u2014 \u201cEurope\u2019s Singapore\u201d \u2014 for example.The problem is that there is no specific democratic mandate for either option, or even for Mrs. May\u2019s preferred (though probably unobtainable) idea of something in between. So any outcome is likely to be contested for years to come.Within Mrs. May\u2019s government, the implications of Brexit are causing concern, even as hard-line Brexit supporters step up their campaign for a clean break from the bloc.Following the leak of a government analysis that predicted the British economy would suffer under all of the most likely scenarios, one minister, Phillip Lee, wrote on Twitter that, if the figures were anywhere near right, \u201cthere would be a serious question over whether a government could legitimately lead a country along a path that the evidence and rational consideration indicate would be damaging.\u201dOne obstacle to another referendum is the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong Euroskeptic, who currently rejects the idea \u2014 despite arguing that, unlike Mrs. May, he would negotiate a withdrawal that would protect British jobs.Yet, if Mrs. May reaches a Brexit deal that takes Britain out of the bloc\u2019s economic structures, Mr. Corbyn would face overwhelming pressure to oppose it, a move that, if successful, could bring down the government.Mr. Davies argues that the Labour Party\u2019s large number of youthful members \u2014 the bedrock of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s support \u2014 are strongly pro-European and want a second referendum.Len McCluskey, a union leader and a close ally of Mr. Corbyn, wants Labour to oppose any Brexit deal that Mrs. May puts to Parliament, and has not ruled out supporting another referendum.Of course, even if there were a second vote, it is far from clear that it would reverse the original verdict. Taking a break in central Swansea, Robert Hughes, a bus driver, said that as far as the Brexit talks are concerned, the public are \u201clike mushrooms \u2014 we are kept in the dark.\u201dBut he still supports Brexit. \u201cWe had a vote, it\u2019s not best of three. Once it\u2019s run, it\u2019s run,\u201d he said.Back at the mall in Fforestfach, a spirited debate was going on in the coffee shop between two people whose views encapsulate some of Britain\u2019s divisions.Gerard Turley, director of an investment company and a Conservative Party voter, felt the pull of Brexit but concluded that the economic price would be too high.\u201cWith my heart I wanted to go, but my head said stay,\u201d he said, adding that he feels his decision to remain had been vindicated.His wife, Christine Turley, a housewife, said that she voted to quit to stop \u201cpeople in Brussels making our laws,\u201d though she believes that, in fact, it was \u201ctoo complicated a subject\u201d for a straight yes or no vote.\u201cNow I\u2019m not sure I made the right decision,\u201d she added. \u201cThere is so much doom and gloom about how badly off we will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Experts Doubt Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Plan Will Boost Economy", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe budget model\u2019s forecasts draw on a wide range of economic literature that finds federal grant programs, similar to the ones Mr. Trump proposes to employ for infrastructure, often do little to encourage states and localities to spend more than they would have otherwise in the intended area. Instead, states often claim federal money to fund existing plans, and then free up state funds for other, unrelated spending, said Kent Smetters, an economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and now directs the budget model.\u201cWhen we reviewed the literature,\u201d he said, \u201cthere just really is no set of studies that support that massive multiplier effect, where you can get $1.5 trillion.\u201dThe administration disagrees and says that the $200 billion in federal spending, combined with quicker permitting that allow projects to get started fast, will incentivize a wave of projects. Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of transportation, said this month that a goal of the administration\u2019s plan is \u201cto use federal dollars as seed money to encourage infrastructure investment by the states, localities and the private sector.\u201d\u201cWe all want better infrastructure,\u201d she said at a White House news briefing.\u201cBut unfortunately, there\u2019s just not enough money in the world to pay for all the infrastructure, which is why\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s plan also puts an emphasis on the private sector, Ms. Chao said.The White House has indicated it is open to some type of dedicated funding stream, such as user fees like tolls or a new type of tax, such as a gas tax, to help finance projects, though it has yet to officially propose such a plan.The Economic Report of the President, which was released Wednesday, said that \u201cadditional resources can be secured for infrastructure investment, turning to some combination of user charges, specific taxes or general tax revenues.\u201dDemocrats have criticized the administration\u2019s proposal for the size of its federal investment and its lack of a dedicated funding stream, such as a tax increase, to support it. They have warned that the reliance on private spending could lead to high user fees, such as tolls, on new projects.On Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that \u201cIf we ever needed proof that Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan is made out of thin air and would create Trump tolls, Trump tolls and more Trump tolls across the country, this independent study is it.\u201dThe administration has consistently been more optimistic than outside analysts in forecasting the economic effects of his proposals. The Council of Economic Advisers projected this week that the $1.5 trillion tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law last year would boost the economy by 2 percent to 4 percent, a much higher rate of growth than independent analyses have found. Top administration officials said this fall that faster growth from Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies, including the infrastructure plan and tax cuts, would generate enough additional tax revenue to more than offset any increase to the federal budget deficit from the tax cuts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pyeongchang\u2019s Winding Path From Obscurity to Olympics Fame", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPYEONGCHANG, South Korea \u2014 Lee Ji-seol was in elementary school when her hometown, Pyeongchang, first applied to host the Winter Olympics. During a visit by Olympic officials, she recalled, her entire class lined up on a street to cheer and wave flags.Their enthusiasm notwithstanding, the bid hardly seemed promising. Located 50 miles from North Korea and the world\u2019s most heavily fortified border, Pyeongchang was known mainly as a mountain backwater that produced potatoes and cattle. The town center was a nondescript crossroads, going to seed with \u201clove motels\u201d and karaoke bars. The area boasted two ski resorts, but they struggled to muster enough snow to attract visitors.That first bid for the 2010 Games failed, as did a second bid to host in 2014, but the International Olympic Committee finally gave Pyeongchang, population 43,000, the nod for the 2018 Winter Games, which open next week. It was a victory for those who never stopped believing in the obscure little town, one of the most unlikely hosts of the Games in Olympic history.\u201cThe entire town was out dancing,\u201d Ms. Lee, 22, said of the day they heard the news. \u201cBefore we started our Olympic campaign, few South Koreans, much less any foreigners, even knew we existed.\u201dPyeongchang\u2019s obstacles were both economic and physical. It is one of the poorest places in Gangwon, South Korea\u2019s most isolated and least developed province, which shares a long border with the North. And though it is just 80 miles from Seoul, getting to Pyeongchang from the capital used to take hours on mountain roads that twist like \u201ca sheep\u2019s intestines,\u201d as the locals say.The provincial governor, Choi Moon-soon, called it \u201cthe last place the government thought of when it thought of investment,\u201d adding, \u201cWe hoped an Olympics would change that.\u201dEven the town\u2019s name was a problem. Originally spelled \u201cPyongchang\u201d in English, it was often confused with Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. So in 2000, the town added a letter, capitalized another and changed its name to \u201cPyeongChang,\u201d though most foreign news agencies declined to use the capital C.In time, though, South Korea embraced Pyeongchang\u2019s bid for the Games as its own. The nation\u2019s leaders were eager to build global prestige and saw the Winter Games as a chance to become one of only a handful of countries that have hosted a \u201ctrifecta\u201d of international sports events. (The World Cup took place in South Korea and Japan in 2002, and Seoul hosted the Summer Games in 1988.)In a country where winter sports never quite caught on, only one other town with ski slopes, Maju, was interested in hosting the Olympics. Pyeongchang edged it out for national support, perhaps because it sits in a province that has been a major electoral battleground.The government has poured $13 billion into the region, building a new bullet train and highway \u2014 and 97 tunnels and 78 bridges \u2014 to improve access to Pyeongchang from Seoul, as well as sporting facilities such as ice rinks and ski slopes.While some residents worried about the impact on local forests, support for the Olympic bid has been almost universal in Pyeongchang: A poll taken at the time of the first bid showed nearly 94 percent support, and it has not wavered.Many believe the area\u2019s future lies in bolstering tourism and are hopeful the Winter Games will help. The service sector already accounts for 70 percent of the local economy, in part because of vacationers drawn to the province\u2019s scenic coast. But inland Pyeongchang has not really benefited; it\u2019s betting that the Olympics will change that.In lobbying for its bid, South Korea used a potential handicap \u2014 Pyeongchang\u2019s proximity to the North Korean border, in a region bristling with troops and weaponry \u2014 as a selling point. Holding the Games in Pyeongchang, officials argued, would promote peace between two nations still technically at war.A third of South Korea\u2019s 600,000 military personnel are based in Gangwon Province. Many who were posted here as conscripts \u2014 all men in South Korea are required to serve about two years in the military \u2014 say they never want to see it again, so rugged are its hills and cold its winters.Dreams of easing tensions and reunifying with the North one day are also more acutely felt here than anywhere else in South Korea. Many older people in the area came from the North as war refugees, settling near the border in hopes of returning quickly once the Koreas were reunified.\u201dOur dream is to one day take the train to go to North Korea and all the way across Siberia and to Berlin,\u201d said Noh Yeon-su, curator of the DMZ Museum, referring to roads and rail lines that stop at the border, essentially making South Korea an island.And it was in nearby Gangneung, where the ice hockey and speedskating events are scheduled to be held, that a North Korean submarine ran aground in 1996. Twenty-six crewmen and agents spilled out, setting off a huge manhunt in the area.But Mr. Choi, the governor, shrugs off such concerns.\u201cThose of us who live here are not afraid of North Korea because the North, despite all its missile tests and bombast, doesn\u2019t have an ability to fight a war,\u201d he said. The economic output of his province, the South\u2019s poorest, he noted, exceeds that generated by all of North Korea.He added, \u201cThe happiest thing about the Olympics is that when foreigners see the Games taking place here, we can shake off our stigma as a dangerous place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paychecks Are Getting Bigger. Don\u2019t Get Too Used to It.", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneHow low must unemployment go for workers to get a raise?A couple of decades ago, it was normal for workers to get regular pay increases. After declining mercilessly since the early 1970s, the hourly pay of private-sector production and nonsupervisory workers \u2014 nurses, cashiers, manufacturing workers on the shop floor and such \u2014 hit bottom in 1995 and rose by more than a tenth in real terms over the following eight years.This suggests a double challenge for the nation\u2019s workers. For starters, the American economy needs to recover some of its lost dynamism. For workers to reap a larger share of the spoils of growth, they must claw back the bargaining power they lost. While the goal doesn\u2019t seem impossible, it requires pushing back against a view that has dominated economic policy over the last half century: that government should not stand in the way of corporate America\u2019s forward march, and definitely not mess with its efforts to lower labor costs.Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggests that to begin with, policymakers could do more to keep labor markets tight. He argues that the Federal Reserve has worried too much about inflation and not enough about the lid it puts on workers\u2019 well-being when it raises interest rates to slow growth.Since 1980, he estimates, the job market has suffered from slack 70 percent of the time \u2014 periods when workers, rather than employers, are scrambling. That compares with only a third of the time from 1949 to 1980. To keep it closer to full employment, he proposes a set of policies, including raising the Fed\u2019s inflation target from its current 2 percent, creating a fund to bolster job creation in moments of slack and engaging the government in job creation.And yet, as Mr. Bernstein acknowledges, tight labor markets are only part of the solution. For starters, they eventually end when the cycle turns \u2014 and wages can get stuck for a long time. And tight labor markets don\u2019t carry the power they used to.At this pace, unemployment will soon have to hit zero for workers at the bottom to get a raise.So what else can be done? There is obviously a role for training and education to help workers meet employers\u2019 rising demand for skills, especially at the beginning of their career. Fatih Guvenen of the University of Minnesota notes that the income of 25-year-old men starting their careers has declined sharply since the early 1970s and is now about where it was in the late \u201950s.But a strategy focused on education will not tip the balance. As Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute points out, the list of remedies is long. It includes raising the minimum wage, increasing unionization, banning mandatory arbitration for employment claims, ending arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling, and ensuring that companies that subcontract their low-wage work remain in some way accountable for the workers.Over the last 50 years, employers have been allowed to exercise ever more sway over their workers. The share of private-sector workers covered by unions has dwindled to a sliver. Businesses have grown to imposing heft. All along, executives and policymakers have sold this rebalancing of power as a boon for competitiveness, efficiency and economic growth.And yet unbalanced labor markets not only hold back wages but also stymie the American economy as a whole. As Mr. Krueger pointed out to me, a rigged labor market is not efficient. Barring anti-competitive hiring practices will increase economic efficiency and encourage both higher wages and more employment. Better training will improve workers\u2019 productivity, but so will helping them relocate to better operations.Rebalancing the labor relationship might not only improve the way the pie is shared but also make it bigger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Overhaul Gains Public Support, Buoying Republicans", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law now has more supporters than opponents, buoying Republican hopes for this year\u2019s congressional elections.The growing public support for the law coincides with an eroding Democratic lead when voters are asked which party they would like to see control Congress. And it follows an aggressive effort by Republicans, backed by millions of dollars of advertising from conservative groups, to persuade voters of the law\u2019s benefits.That campaign has rallied support from Republicans, in particular. But in contrast with many other issues \u2014 including Mr. Trump\u2019s job approval rating \u2014 it also appears to be winning over some Democrats. Support for the law remains low among Democrats, but it has doubled over the past two months and is twice as strong as their approval of Mr. Trump today.Erin Parker, a high school history teacher in San Antonio, said she did not like many elements of the law, particularly its big reduction of the estate tax, and said she was skeptical that it would provide much of an economic lift. But Ms. Parker, who described herself as an independent who tends to support Democrats, said the bill would probably help the technology start-up where her husband works.\u201cHearing about the implications for my husband\u2019s business improved my view of it a bit,\u201d she said.\u201cPublic opinion is moving in the direction of this bill,\u201d said Jon Cohen, chief research officer for SurveyMonkey. \u201cConsidering where it was, it is dramatically different.\u201dMr. Cohen cautioned that the bill still was not particularly popular, and opposition among Democrats remained strong. Still, support has grown even among Democrats, from 8 percent just before the bill passed in December to 19 percent this month. For Democrats, Mr. Cohen said, running on opposition to the bill has become more of a political gamble.\u201cIt\u2019s less of a sure bet than it seemed in December,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem yet for Democrats, but the movement isn\u2019t a positive one.\u201d\u201cI think we are essentially seeing Republicans \u2018come home\u2019 on the tax plan in our data,\u201d said Lori Weigel, a partner with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm. \u201cThat is certainly in part due to consistent communications about the tax plan and the news coverage of prominent companies investing in workers.\u201dDemocrats have done little to counter the Republican messaging and concede it has had an effect, along with a series of high-profile company announcements of bonuses, raises or other benefits attributed to tax savings.But they are ramping up efforts to rebrand the law as disproportionately helping shareholders and the wealthy, and they contend the boost from bonus announcements will fade.The Times polling suggests that Americans are overestimating the degree to which the benefits of the law\u2019s corporate tax cuts are flowing straight to workers \u2014 while underestimating the likelihood that the law will reduce their individual taxes.Just under one in five respondents expect to see either a raise or a bonus thanks to the law\u2019s business tax cuts. Early returns from public companies indicate that\u2019s an overshot. Just Capital, a nonprofit research organization, analyzed the 90 largest public companies that have announced how they will spend the combined $45 billion in savings they stand to receive from the tax bill this year. It found that those companies planned to pass 6 percent of those savings directly on to workers, with more than half of that spending in one-time bonuses.\u201cThat does not really track to how the public thinks the companies should be spending that money,\u201d said Martin Whittaker, Just Capital\u2019s chief executive.Close to half of Americans now expect some direct benefit from the law \u2014 either a tax cut or a salary increase or bonus. Support for the bill is far stronger among that group: More than three-quarters of Americans approve of the law, compared with fewer than a third who don\u2019t expect a benefit or aren\u2019t sure.Gina Coats, a project manager for a plumbing company in Springfield, Mo., said she didn\u2019t follow the tax debate closely last fall. But in January, when she began preparing the company\u2019s payroll systems to handle the new law\u2019s provisions, she realized almost every employee would take home an extra $20 to $40 per week.\u201cEveryone seems to be a little more upbeat,\u201d Ms. Coats said. \u201cIt\u2019s causing people to let go of their money a little more easily.\u201dMs. Coats puts herself in that category. A few days ago, she called a contractor to move forward with a long-delayed plan to replace the roof on her house. That decision reflected her tax savings, she said, but also the strength of the local economy, which has meant lots of projects for her company, and stability for its employees.\u201cIf we have more work in the bag, then I feel more comfortable,\u201d Ms. Coats said.Republicans have long promoted tax cuts as a way to encourage economic growth. Many economists are skeptical of that approach when unemployment is low and the Federal Reserve is moving to tamp down inflation. Rising support for the bill has coincided with an uptick in consumer confidence, although there aren\u2019t yet clear signs that Americans are spending more.Colleen Doering, who runs a small facilities maintenance business outside Orlando, Fla., said she and her husband were paying several hundred dollars a month less in taxes because of the new law. As a result, they recently decided to spend $10,000 on a landscaping project and started to plan a vacation.\u201cMy paycheck has increased, and if I see it in my paycheck, then I know my employees are seeing it in theirs,\u201d Ms. Doering said.And the law\u2019s corporate tax cuts are giving the Doerings more money to spend on marketing, which they hope will allow them to expand their three-year-old business and hire more people. That may not be easy, however. Ms. Doering said it was already hard to find good workers, and the stimulus provided by the tax cuts could make it even harder.\u201cIt was becoming more challenging to find good, solid employees with the right skill sets,\u201d Ms. Doering said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more challenging because some of these larger companies are grabbing up even more employees.\u201dAbout the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 10,255 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Feb. 5 to Feb. 11. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.Advertisement"}

If any of the men had placed bets, none of them showed elation.In an otherwise empty betting hall, a security guard patrolled listlessly as staff members sat behind glassed-in counters, napping or tapping away on their smartphones.The racing track in this Chinese gambling hub no longer sees the excitement it did in its 20th-century glory days. The greyhounds that ran on that recent Saturday were among the last to compete here before the track shuts down in July.Last year Macau\u2019s government told the track\u2019s operator, the Macau (Yat Yuen) Canidrome Company, to move the races out of downtown to make space for urban redevelopment. The company confirmed last month that the track would close.The track\u2019s demise, a closing that animal rights advocates say is long overdue, in part reflects the transformation of Macau from a colonial backwater into a popular tourist destination for China\u2019s fast-growing middle class.Nearly two decades since Portugal formally ceded control of the territory to China, the tiny enclave off China\u2019s southern shore, home to about 600,000 people, is the world\u2019s casino capital, with gambling revenue five times that of Las Vegas.Buses ferry crowds of Chinese tourists to the giant casinos, where many gamble on slot machines with touch screens, shop in stores set in a replica of Venice and take selfies in front of a copy of the Eiffel Tower.But at the Canidrome, revenue has stalled in recent years, its annual reports suggest.Dog racing first came to Macau in the 1930s but failed after a few years because it was not widely affordable, according to a local veteran journalist\u2019s history of the territory. In 1963, racing was revived as part of a new effort to turn Macau into a Western-style gambling hub. It was more accessible than before and proved instantly popular.Half a century later, the fascination has faded and even turned into disapproval.\u201cIt is now a modern economy built on tourism,\u201d said Albano Martins, a 68-year-old native of Portugal who moved to Macau in 1981, and runs Anima, the territory\u2019s largest private animal rescue group. \u201cBefore it was very tough, there was only betting.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a clean environment now, for families,\u201d he added.It also said it planned to establish a \u201cvirtual\u201d track where bets can be placed on dog races taking place elsewhere.Animal rights advocates fear that the greyhounds, most of which were imported from Australia, will be sold to illegal racing tracks in the Chinese mainland, Vietnam or elsewhere, be auctioned off to breeders or even be sold for their meat.\u201cWe are concerned because if they didn\u2019t care about animals beforehand, why would they care about them now?\u201d said Mr. Martins of the animal rescue group.Speaking from the top floor of his multistory shelter for strays, he estimated that 650 dogs \u2014 about 45 of them puppies \u2014 live at the Canidrome\u2019s kennels. He is asking the government for permission to take over the kennels for a year to find owners for them.At least a few retired racing dogs have found new lives here as pets.A greyhound originally named Dynamite Spice is one. She raced in Australia before being brought to Macau, according to Australian records.Her new name is Garlic \u2014 the only word the 5-year-old dog reacted to, said her new owner, Edith Lam.Ms. Lam, 38, a part-time assistant at a law firm, said she had adopted the dog last year after spotting her at a government-run kennel.Canidrome had given Garlic to the kennel early last year, according to the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau, the local government department that runs the facility. Two other greyhounds found new homes the same way last year, it said.The department said it had asked the track operator to provide a plan for \u201crehoming\u201d all of its dogs but that it had not yet received a response.Ms. Lam said Garlic was \u201cvery, very shy,\u201d and had initially barked in her sleep in what Ms. Lam interpreted as nightmares. Though the dog is still scared of the benign ocean waves on the nearby beach, she appears to have taken well to her new home.\u201cThe truth is she is just like furniture,\u201d Ms. Lam said, describing how Garlic spends much of the day sleeping in the kitchen or watching the family and their other two dogs\u2019 every move.Ms. Lam said no one she knew would approve of dog racing these days. \u201cAll my friends are against it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe younger people do not like that kind of cruelty.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Era of Easy Money Is Ending, and the World Is Bracing for Shocks", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe worst that could happen, the money masters averred, was that investors would be lulled into reckless investments, taking on too much risk in the belief that the dangers of the marketplace had been tamed.As it turns out, the dangers were already at work. A decade-long era of easy access to money engineered by central banks in Asia, Europe and the United States was ending, opening a new chapter in which corporations would have to pay more to borrow and ordinary people would have to pay more to finance homes, cars and other purchases.To digest the wild swings in stocks and bonds from New York to London to Tokyo is to absorb this uncomfortable realization taking hold.Investors concluded that interest rates would rise faster than they had anticipated, almost certainly in the United States, and perhaps eventually in Europe and Asia, too. They yanked their treasure out of stocks and entrusted it to safer repositories of wealth like bonds and cash.No degree in finance was required to divine the lesson of the moment: Markets go down as well as up, a reality often drowned out by the euphoric celebrations to greet one record or another being shattered.While trading in the United States was clearly the initial source of alarm, the concerns spread to everywhere that money changes hands. The American economy had swapped the frivolity of a stock market party for the grim trappings of a bedside vigil. The result was gloom and anxiety in every reach of the financial sphere.\u201cThe United States is by some distance the largest market on earth,\u201d said Gaurav Saroliya, director of global macro strategy at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cGrowth in the United States has a huge bearing on economies everywhere. If the largest market is selling off, that has a very powerful effect on investment sentiment. It makes people risk averse.\u201dThe fear that seized the United States was the spawn of good times. As the feeling sank in that stock trading was governed by a surplus of exuberance, the odds increased that the Federal Reserve would dampen the festivities by lifting interest rates faster than policymakers had previously telegraphed.Not for nothing, central banks are seen by investors as crucial yet fun-averse grown-ups charged with solemnly watching for trouble. When crises emerge, they make money available to spur commerce while keeping terror at bay. The global economic expansion underway now is in large part a product of the Fed\u2019s swiftly unleashing an overwhelming surge of credit after the start of the financial crisis in 2008, combined with the slower yet, eventually, effective torrent of cash delivered by the European Central Bank.But when the party gets raging \u2014 when economies accelerate and stock prices ascend to levels out of whack with fundamentals \u2014 central bankers play killjoy, lifting interest rates to snuff out attendant dangers.Higher rates diminish speculation that can end badly by making credit more expensive. They slow economic growth while making stocks less appealing, because corporations must pay more to keep up with their debts. Investors can make more just by keeping their holdings in cash or bonds, rather than by accepting the higher risk of stocks.Then, last Friday, the latest monthly snapshot of the American labor market revealed that wages had climbed 2.9 percent in January compared with a year earlier. The tight job market was forcing employers to pay more.This appeared to presage a strengthening of American consumer power. If more working people take home more money, they will presumably be more inclined to buy houses and cars, generating jobs in construction and at auto plants from Michigan to South Carolina. They will fill restaurants, necessitating more truck drivers to ferry the food, and more mechanics to keep the trucks running.This same so-called virtuous cycle appeared to be amplifying global growth. More cars made in the United States would require more brake linings made in Mexico and more circuitry forged in China, using copper mined in Chile. More construction would require equipment from Germany and Japan, and more iron ore from Brazil to make steel.This interconnectivity has been central to the anticipation that a strengthening economy in the United States would lift fortunes around the world.But the increase in wages for American workers meant something else. It was a flashing warning to investors about potential inflation, or rising prices, which have crippled many economies. The Fed, always vigilant, wields a standard tool for snuffing out inflation if necessary: higher interest rates.This is how a positive jobs report, presumably a sign of a strengthening American economy, wound up as the impetus for the dumping of stocks from Taipei to Toronto. It enhanced the likelihood that the Fed would raise rates faster. It prompted investors to wonder how long the European Central Bank could maintain its own ultralow rates.In the past year, Europe has shaken off perpetual worries of a grinding decline to emerge as one of the faster-growing major economies on earth. Inflation remains weak in Europe, undergirding expectations that the central bank will be slow to take back its free money.But if the Fed were to lift rates faster, that could prompt Europe and perhaps even Japan to follow suit. Otherwise, the United States would be in a position to capture an outsize share of global investment, as rates presumably rise on American government bonds.Mario Draghi, the Italian who heads the European Central Bank, is scheduled to complete his eight-year term late next year. At the Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s term as governor expires in April, and there is uncertainty over whether he will be reappointed.Some economists think that the dour talk is overblown and that the stock markets are running on emotion untethered from economic reality, a narrative that gained force as markets in New York snapped back from the depths on Tuesday.The fundamentals of the United States expansion remain intact. Rising wages should indeed give people money to spend without resorting to some newfangled credit bubble that ends tragically.Whatever the interest rates, central banks retain trillions of dollars on their balance sheets earmarked for buying up financial assets, making credit available. And the return to higher interest rates is inevitable, a healthy turn for a world economy that can finally close the books on the global financial crisis that began a decade ago.\u201cWe have gotten used to this low interest rate environment,\u201d said Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at SEB, a global investment bank based in Stockholm. \u201cThis is not the normal situation.\u201dThe global economic expansion has occasioned hopeful talk that the world now has multiple engines of growth, inoculating it against trouble in any single region. But the events of recent days have challenged that notion, given that a sudden deterioration of stock prices on Wall Street quickly burst into a global rout.Sentiments are clearly a viral phenomenon. Yet the distress in global markets also underscores the fact that real economic fortunes are fused.If General Electric, Ford and other multinational companies see their share prices brought down as borrowing costs climb, they could limit plans for expansion. The trend would be felt in diminished orders for computer chips made in Taiwan, flat-panel displays forged in South Korea and auto parts built in the Czech Republic. It could cool demand for raw materials harvested from Argentina to India to South Africa.\u201cBusiness cycles across different markets are more correlated than they have ever been,\u201d said Mr. Saroliya, of Oxford Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s the global supply chain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That diatribe by Sykes is worth quoting as a window into the backlash against #MeToo and empowered women:\u201cI don\u2019t buy the non-stop feminization campaign against manhood,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to come home to a home cooked dinner at six every night, one that [my fianc\u00e9e] fixes and one that I expect one day to have daughters learn to fix.\u201dSpeaking of those daughters, Sykes clarifies: \u201cI don\u2019t want them [to] grow up into career obsessed banshees who \u2026 become nail-biting manophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils.\u201dSykes, who has not been endorsed by Donald Trump and who seems unlikely to be elected, says that young women are turning against feminism because of distaste for Hillary Clinton: \u201cThey look at her personal life\u2019s wreckage and didn\u2019t want to become like her.\u201dProgress on women\u2019s rights has been enormous since I was a kid and Margaret Chase Smith was the only female senator (she had to line up with tourists for bathroom breaks, as there was then no restroom designated for female senators). As recently as 1987, only half of Americans said that it was always wrong for a man to beat his wife with a belt or stick.Men like Sykes reflect the other dimension, the powerful backlash fueled by a combination of male resentment, anxiety at social change and a newfound freedom in the Age of Trump to say things that were previously beyond the pale.Backlashes go way back, of course. After Mary Wollstonecraft published her \u201cVindication of the Rights of Woman\u201d in 1792, laying the groundwork for discussions of gender equity, Horace Walpole mocked her as a \u201chyena in petticoats,\u201d and she was savaged for her \u201cwhoredoms.\u201dWhy is a man writing this column? Frankly, because women\u2019s rights aren\u2019t \u201cjust a woman\u2019s issue,\u201d any more than civil rights were \u201cjust a black issue.\u201d We all have an interest in a more fair society \u2014 and if only women speak up for gender equity, they may be dismissed as shrill \u201chyenas.\u201dWhat matters above all are policies. That means pushing for easier family leave, better child care, more women on boards, and cracking down on sex trafficking and domestic violence. It means helping teenage girls avoid pregnancy, providing locations at work for moms to express milk, and confronting the general tendency to defer to male self-confidence rather than female expertise. It means a determined effort to hold accountable sexual predators even when they\u2019re not Hollywood figures but simply factory supervisors or shift managers at a McDonald\u2019s.Of course there will be disagreements about policies or about where to draw lines \u2014 about what to make of Aziz Ansari and how to distinguish between the Harvey Weinsteins and the Al Frankens. But those controversies are secondary.The fundamental fault line today is between those working toward broader opportunity and those yearning for a mythic past before feminists developed \u201cnasty, snake-filled heads.\u201d To be on the right side of history, we should all, men and women alike, stand on the side of the she-devils.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Economy Grows, Federal Reserve Frets Next Downturn", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve on Friday described recent volatility in financial markets as a brief blip and affirmed its plans to raise its benchmark interest rate in the coming months.The immediate problem confronting the Fed is how quickly to raise interest rates. The Fed forecast in December that it would raise rates three times in 2018, just as it did in 2017. Fed officials say stronger growth is fortifying those intentions, and the next rate increase is expected in March. A growing number of Wall Street analysts predict the improving economic forecast will persuade the Fed to raise rates four times this year.The hot topic on Friday, however, at a conference attended by several Fed officials in New York, was whether the Fed would be ready for the next economic downturn.The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is in a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent, and the Fed does not expect it to rise much higher than 3 percent in the current economic expansion. That\u2019s a problem given that, in the last four downturns, the Fed has cut rates by an average of 5.5 percentage points to stimulate renewed growth.During the last downturn, the Fed reduced the benchmark rate to nearly zero in 2008, and then supplemented its efforts by pledging to keep interest rates at a low level and by purchasing large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds.Fed officials have said that those policies benefited the economy, and could be used again during a future downturn. Other central banks have relied on similar policies in recent years, and have reached similar conclusions. Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a board member of the European Central Bank, said economic research was \u201cfairly clear\u201d that such asset purchases helped to hold down interest rates.\u201cOur conclusion is that the most important and reliable instrument of monetary policy is the short term interest rate,\u201d wrote the authors, a team of two academics and two bank economists-The danger of a rapid return to near-zero interest rates seemed particularly acute in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, as the Fed repeatedly delayed any increase in rates. Now, the economy has gained strength and the Fed has raised rates five times. Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said the progress showed the Fed\u2019s policies had helped, and that the Fed might be able to raise interest rates above current expectations.\u201cMy own view about what is possible at the zero lower bound is quite a bit more optimistic than it was back then,\u201d Mr. Hatzius said.Nonetheless, there is growing support among Fed officials for a review of the Fed\u2019s approach to policy, and of alternatives that might allow it to respond more forcefully to future downturns.Loretta Mester, the relatively conservative president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told the conference she favored starting such a study \u201clater this year.\u201dAlternative approaches fall into two broad categories: Permanently replace the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target, or set it aside in the aftermath of downturns.Raising the target is a simple way of creating more room to respond to crises. Interest rates include expected inflation, so higher inflation would raise rates.Embracing higher inflation, however, could cause political problems for the Fed.Alternatively, the Fed could tolerate higher inflation on a temporary basis. For example, the Fed could aim to maintain average inflation at 2 percent over some specified period, meaning that it would compensate for periods of lower inflation, as during the last six years, by allowing periods of higher inflation, thus maintaining a 2 percent average.Last year, the Fed began to include a comparison between its actual management of interest rates, and the results produced by alternative approaches to monetary policy.The report on Friday included an inflation-averaging approach among those alternatives for the first time.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Olympic Skier Wants to Save the World\u2019s Snow", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:This week: the threat to skiing, a $1 million prize for peat and a hidden flooding risk.Jessie Diggins is a cross-country skier on the American women\u2019s team and a favorite to win a medal at the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. If she succeeds, it will be only the second time the United States has won a medal in the sport and the first for an American woman.Diggins is also an advocate for climate action. I interviewed her to understand more about why she believes winter is worth protecting. (The following has been condensed and edited.)How has climate change affected you?Over the last 10 years, it has been hard to ski on real snow. Over the last three years, most venues have been exclusively on man-made snow. And in places like Davos, Switzerland, where they normally have three feet of snow, they\u2019ve been snow farming and saving it for the next year because they don\u2019t even count on getting snow anymore. I\u2019ve spoken to people in Switzerland who are losing their jobs because winter\u2019s going away.How is skiing on man-made snow different?It\u2019s a little faster. So the same World Cup courses that we race get more and more dangerous with man-made snow because it gets icy. One of my teammates broke his leg on a corner on a course where it never should have been as fast as it was. Real snow, it feels softer. It\u2019s not as hard when you fall. What about people who say that fighting climate change is going to hurt the economy?What do you say to those who say, \u2018You\u2019re just an athlete, stay in your lane\u2019?I\u2019m also someone who lives on this planet. I think you need to be able to stand up for things you believe in, and saving winter is something I believe in. It just breaks my heart because this is such a cool sport, and winter is so amazing and beautiful and I feel like we\u2019re actually really at risk of losing it. And I don\u2019t want my kids to grow up in a world where they\u2019ve never experienced snow because we weren\u2019t responsible enough.Indonesia has a peat problem, and it just awarded a $1 million prize to help solve it.Peatlands \u2014 thick layers of waterlogged, partially decomposed vegetation \u2014 hold enormous amounts of carbon. Worldwide, by some estimates, they store twice as much as the world\u2019s forests. Indonesia, with 50 million acres of swampy peatlands, has the most peat in Asia and probably the most among tropical countries.But over the past several decades, uncontrolled agricultural development has led to the draining and burning of Indonesian peatlands and the destruction of the forests that cover much of them.The carbon in peat was removed from the atmosphere when the vegetation was growing, hundreds or even thousands of years ago. Burning it is like burning coal or oil \u2014 it adds old carbon back into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.Under international pressure to better manage its peatlands, the Indonesian government has taken some steps, including a very basic one: trying to accurately determine where the peat is.Two years ago the government, with assistance from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group, opened a competition to develop an inexpensive and efficient method of mapping Indonesia\u2019s peat. Twenty-two teams entered.Last week, the winner was announced, as selected by a scientific advisory board: a German remote-sensing firm, RSS, working with researchers in Europe and Indonesia. Calling itself the International Peat Mapping Team, the group takes home the $1 million prize.The team\u2019s approach uses satellite imagery and radar- and laser-based data about elevations and terrain, coupled with coring of peatlands to determine thickness (some peatlands are as thick as 50 feet).Dr. Siegert said the next step was for the Indonesian government to actually undertake a mapping program. By knowing more precisely where the peatlands are, the government can be more careful about where it grants concessions for agricultural development, and perhaps even revoke some concessions already granted.Indonesia in the past has been accused of dragging its feet on its peat problem. But Dr. Siegert said he thought the government would follow through with a mapping program. \u201cNow I think the international pressure is big enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fires in 2015 were so extensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Literary Road Trip Into the Heart of Russia", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "FeatureIn the land of Tolstoy, Turgenev and now Putin, what are the stories Russians are telling themselves?Supported byRussia is still an enigmatic country to me. Every day there is news from Russia \u2014 we hear about Putin, about his imprisoned dissidents, about his meddling in the elections of his rivals \u2014 all of it serving the notion that \u201cRussia\u201d is a singular, comprehensible, clear-cut entity. But what do the people who live inside of that entity think? What is \u201cRussia\u201d to them, what are the stories they tell themselves? A hundred years after the revolution, 25 years after the fall of Communism?For years, I have wanted to see Russia with my own eyes, to meet some of the people who live inside of that entity, to find out what they think it means to be Russian. That is why, early one morning in October, I found myself driving from Moscow to Ivan Turgenev\u2019s estate, accompanied by a photographer and a translator. If I wanted to see what life in Russia was like, unfiltered by news stories, I couldn\u2019t think of any better place to start than Turgenev\u2019s world, the countryside that formed the setting for his first book, \u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches.\u201dPublished in 1852, \u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d is a collection of simple stories about a hunter\u2019s encounters as he wanders around the woods. There is nothing here of Dostoyevsky\u2019s psychological and emotional savagery and depth, nor of Tolstoy\u2019s epic complexity or his ability to encapsulate an entire society with a few strokes; these stories are in all ways modest, aimless even. A man strolls through the forest with a shotgun over his shoulder, he exchanges a few words with someone he happens to meet, possibly shoots a bird or two, possibly spends the night in a barn on the way home \u2014 and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole story. And yet the book numbers among the greatest works of world literature, largely because Turgenev gets so close to the world he is describing, the Russian society of the 1840s. His characters and descriptions do not lead to anything beyond themselves, they are not in themselves part of a greater sequence of events, they stand apart from everything \u2014 except the specific time and the place. And it is from there that we experience the world.The landscape we drove through was flat and monotonous, the sky a pale gray. Sometimes we would pass a rundown gas station, sometimes a small town would come into view, sometimes the forest would open up into fields. Then, among all the trees, a little park suddenly turned up on the right. I saw a black wall and a flame burning.\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I said.\u201cIt\u2019s just a war memorial,\u201d the translator said. Her name was Oksana Brown; she was a young Russian news producer who sometimes worked as a fixer.\u201cOh, no, this is perfect. I want to see it,\u201d I said.\u201cThere are monuments like this in just about every town in Russia,\u201d she said, not seeming to understand why I wanted to stop here of all places.The photographer, Lynsey Addario, walked around the little park taking photos on her own while Brown and I stood in front of the black marble wall and watched the flame fluttering in the breeze. To our right, another wall, etched with portraits of soldiers, stood next to a green-painted cannon, its barrel pointing at the gray sky.\u201cWhat does the inscription say?\u201d I asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Your name is unknown, but your heroic deed is immortal,\u2019\u2009\u201d Brown said. \u201c\u2009\u2018Eternal honor to the heroes who lost their lives in the fight for the freedom and independence of our homeland during the Great Patriotic War.\u2019\u2009\u201dOnly Westerners, she explained, referred to it as the Second World War.As we pulled out onto the road again, I thought about how affecting the simple flame of the memorial had been. It had rendered the forest ancient, and on the dead soldiers it had conferred a sort of immortality, drawing them into the eternal ranks of the fallen. In reality, death was small and dirty, nothing to aspire to, nothing to celebrate. But with the aid of this memorial, death had been elevated from the real world into the ideal. The flame was the agent of this elevation; it was bound to grimy materiality but reached up into the pure ether; it moved as if alive, but it was dead.So Turgenev hadn\u2019t exaggerated the beauties of his childhood world, I thought. Because this was definitely his world that we had come to, this was the countryside that he had ridden through as a young man and later described in \u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d \u2014 and it was only half an hour later that we turned off the highway and drove along a bumpy country road that brought us first to a village, then to a large enclosed estate with a parking lot and various small office buildings.There was no one around, and it was very quiet. The clouds hung low in the sky; the air was heavy with moisture and seemed to stop all sound in midflight. In one corner stood a stone chapel, the feet of its walls thick with mildew, and about a hundred yards farther on lay what had to be the main house. I was expecting something grand and monumental, something like an English stately home, because the Turgenevs were a noble family, but this was a low, wooden house, painted violet and covered in intricate carvings.It aroused no feelings, no breath of history.I tried to picture Turgenev coming through the door and striding across to where we stood, but it was impossible to associate him with us, then with now.We followed a young, bearded and bespectacled guide who explained that most of the original buildings had been destroyed: These were exact replicas. Some objects from the writer\u2019s home, though, were exhibited in the rooms of the house next door to the main building. There were tables and chairs, pictures and knickknacks, shelves lined with books. But even though these things were authentic, they did not speak; they simply sat there mutely, presenting the past.The only items that held any real interest were the gun, powder pouch and game bag that Turgenev used on his hunting trips. They made me think of Ernest Hemingway, who was inspired by Turgenev\u2019s hunting sketches when writing \u201cThe Nick Adams Stories,\u201d of how he strove to achieve that same effortless intensity, and may even have done so, but never quite matched Turgenev\u2019s receptiveness to the world, because he himself stood in the way of it. And there was a sofa that Tolstoy had sat on; not only were these two great writers contemporaries, they lived only hours away from each other. At first they were great friends, but Tolstoy gradually grew to hate Turgenev and even went so far as to challenge him to a duel. Turgenev observed the peasants but did not become as directly involved in their lives as Tolstoy, who delved deeper and deeper into his search for the essence of the Russian soul, not only practicing the principles of simplicity and poverty but also holding them up as the ideal for all.We walked into the great park outside, where rows of trees ran straight and long until they met the disorderly forest. There was no one there but us. The damp, chill air hung motionless between the tree trunks.\u201cAre there always so few people here?\u201d I asked the guide.He shook his head vigorously.\u201cNo, not at all. It\u2019s usually swarming with schoolchildren, they come here from all over Russia. And next year is the bicentennial of Turgenev\u2019s birth. That\u2019s why we\u2019re renovating the place. We\u2019ll have lots of visitors then. But today\u2019s Monday, and it\u2019s October. ...\u201dHe stopped beside a tall tree with a low fence around it.\u201cThis oak tree was planted by Turgenev himself,\u201d he said.To the right of the tree stood what looked like gravestones.\u201cWhat are those?\u201d I asked, pointing to them.\u201cThose are the graves of soldiers,\u201d the guide told me.\u201cHere?\u201d\u201cYes. They were fighting the Germans during the war, and they fell here.\u201dWhen we drove away shortly afterward, it was the image of those graves that stayed with me, maybe because the violence they represented had seemed so unexpected there, in the isolated world of the museum. That and the two horses we saw lying in the grass, a mare and her foal, black and glossily beautiful in the moist air.These depictions of the Russian peasantry in the 19th century as backward and primitive are not untrue, but they are viewed from a very great distance and are extremely generalized. Distance, of course, is necessary; it is the historian\u2019s aid to understanding and explaining social development, just as it is the politician\u2019s aid to dealing with social problems. But a similar distance is what allowed the Bolsheviks to destroy the structure of their society without a thought for the hundreds of thousands and, eventually, millions who died in the process, because these were not real people, only \u201cpeasants,\u201d viewed from so high above that all individuality was erased. And if the overall statistics improved \u2014 well, then it had all been worth it.\u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d shows the culture Trotsky and Figes describe, but from the inside, with no distance. One of the best stories in the book is about a man returning from the hunt who loses his way and then, in the darkness, spies two fires burning in a field far below him. It turns out that a group of boys are camped out, minding the horses. They lie around the fires, telling stories to pass the time, most of them tales of supernatural occurrences. Turgenev brings these boys to life, each with his own distinct appearance and personality, and there is something deeply moving about the way he portrays them; he takes them so seriously, according them dignity, and the stories they tell one another, there in the night, are in themselves incandescent. This is not the superstitious, reactionary peasant class of the revolutionaries and the historians; these are five boys, each with a life of his own, woven from the threads of their language, their culture and the camaraderie of their campfire.\u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d was by no means a political statement, yet it had great political impact in Russia in the 1850s, possibly precisely because, lacking a political or literary agenda, it showed life for what it was and not for what it symbolized.At that time, serfdom still prevailed in Russia, which is to say that the nobility not only owned the villages on their land, they also owned the peasants who lived in them. It was, in other words, a form of slavery. Turgenev\u2019s book did much to stoke the fast-growing criticism of serfdom, which was abolished nine years later, in 1861, by the progressive Czar Alexander II. He was assassinated 20 years later, his death witnessed by his son and grandson, who would become the next two czars, Alexander III and Nicholas II. It is not unreasonable to imagine that his assassination was instrumental in turning both of them into reactionary, anti-liberal autocrats, so opposed to any sort of reform and so intent on gagging all opposition that eventually revolution became inevitable.\u201cWould you like to speak to her?\u201d Addario asked from the back seat.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said.\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to take some shots of her anyway,\u201d she said.Brown and Addario got out and stepped over to the fence. Brown said something in Russian; the woman replied. Suddenly I realized that I had to speak to her, that the museum, the trees and the old books, the things I had been focusing on so far, represented nothing but my own ideas about the country I was visiting.What on earth was I getting myself into?My whole view of Russia was based on myths and romantic imagery. What kind of hubris made me believe that I would be capable of saying something about the real Russia after a nine-day trip through one tiny corner of this vast country?It was like describing a bucket of water in order to say something about the ocean.I went out and joined them by the fence.\u201cShe says she doesn\u2019t want her picture taken,\u201d Brown said.\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cShe says she\u2019s just gathering some corn for her chickens,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t her field.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d I said.It was no great crime, though \u2014 the corn had already been harvested \u2014 and after a bit of back and forth, the woman agreed to tell us about her life.\u201cAsk her where she lives,\u201d Addario said, snapping away. \u201cAsk her what she does. Ask her if she has any family.\u201dIt appeared that the woman had been born in a small village just down the road. She had moved to Moscow when she was 15 and lived there until just a few years ago when she returned to the village to take care of her mother after her father died.\u201cWhen I was a girl, there were lots of people here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a thriving, bustling community, there must have been 15 or 20 families living there,\u201d she said, pointing to the unpainted cottages farther down the road. \u201cNow they\u2019ve all moved away.\u201d\u201cHave you read Turgenev?\u201d I said.\u201cI\u2019ve read \u2018A Sportsman\u2019s Sketches.\u2019 It\u2019s set in this area.\u201d\u201cDid you like it?\u201dShe smiled for the first time.\u201cI read it to my grandchildren now.\u201d\u201cIs it different here now from the way it was when Turgenev wrote about it?\u201d\u201cThe area is the same. But life here is different. It\u2019s very different.\u201dShe then pointed us in the direction of the meadow, and we walked on. The trees lining the hill beyond it seemed to soak up the darkness. They stood there in inky silhouette against the still palely gleaming sky. There was utter silence, our footsteps the only sound.Then the cry of a bird in the distance.The past was in us, I thought, not in the world.The book, \u201cLenin the Dictator: An Intimate Portrait,\u201d by Victor Sebestyen, was intriguing. Lenin\u2019s favorite writer was always Turgenev. I found that strange, because Lenin was one of the most strong-willed men who ever lived; he was at once zealously one-sided and emotionally evasive, but nevertheless, throughout his exile, no matter where he happened to be, in Zurich, London or Paris, he made sure to have Turgenev\u2019s collected works with him.I was reading about Lenin because the places we were going to for the next seven days had been set up in part with him in mind: In just a few weeks it would be exactly 100 years since the 1917 October Revolution, when he almost single-handedly seized power in Russia. We were going to Kazan, where Lenin studied law and where he was radicalized, and then we were going to Yekaterinburg, where Czar Nicholas II and his family were executed in a cellar on Lenin\u2019s order in 1918. That act, in its ruthless brutality, marked the end of Russia\u2019s old world and the beginning of its new one. Everything in the old world would be eradicated to make way for the new; no price was too high and there would be no way back.I desperately wanted a cigarette. Brown said it was against the law to smoke on the train, but if we just bought something from the crew, a candy bar or some tea, she was sure they would be able to suggest something.After we finished our tea, I followed Brown through the carriage. Just then the conductor emerged from her little cubicle. Her face was set and solemn, grim almost. She opened the door leading to the narrow passageway between the carriages.\u201cSmoke here,\u201d she said.I stepped out onto the juddering, swaying metal platform, one side of which was open all the way down to the rails underneath, so the sound of the thundering wheels filled the tiny space. She shut the door, and I bent to light a cigarette.When I got back, we walked through to the adjoining carriage. This one was third class: completely open, with bunk beds on both sides, and it was packed with people. The feet and heads of those sleeping in the top bunks were only inches away from my face as I went by, and the fact that they lay completely uncovered made me feel that I was intruding on something private. But none of the passengers seemed to think anything of it; they acted as if they were at home in their own living rooms.Not since the 19th century could any Scandinavian railway carriage have been as crowded, I thought.We stopped in front of three women sitting chatting by a window who could have been in their late 50s. I asked Brown if she could introduce us. She did, and the three women eyed me attentively and expectantly.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked them.\u201cTo Izhevsk,\u201d one woman said. \u201cWhere they make the Kalashnikovs.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been in Moscow?\u201dThey nodded.\u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201dThey exchanged glances.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret,\u201d she said, smiling. The other two laughed.Behind me someone said something, and when I turned I saw an old man, probably in his late 70s, grab Addario\u2019s hand and kiss it.Everyone around us laughed, including Addario.The woman said something to Brown who smiled.\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\u201cShe said you\u2019re very handsome.\u201d\u201cOh, no,\u201d I said.\u201cAre you going to write that down?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d I said. \u201cBut would you ask them if we can come back later and speak to them again?\u201dThe woman who did most of the talking earlier must have given some thought to what she should say, because she started telling us about herself before I had even asked a question. Her name was Natalya. Her two friends were Olga and Zinaida. She told us that she was brought up in an orphanage, that she could not remember her parents, but that she had a sister from whom she had been separated and whom she never saw again. She had been searching for her sister all her life but still didn\u2019t know where she was.\u201cIn those days, it was standard practice to split up siblings when they were taken into care,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t do that anymore, but that was the system back then. She was sent to another home. When I grew up, I went back and got a job in the same home, I thought I might be able to steal her file and find out where she was. But I didn\u2019t find anything. So now I\u2019ve written to the producers of a state television program, which helps to reunite people with lost family members, and I\u2019m waiting to hear from them. I\u2019m hopeful!\u201d\u201cWhen did you write to them?\u201d\u201cTwo years ago.\u201dIt must have occurred to her as she said this that it didn\u2019t actually sound very hopeful, because she looked at me and added: \u201cIt can be difficult to trace people, even for their reporters. Sometimes it can take as many as five years.\u201dThe steady, rhythmic rumble of the train wheels over the railroad ties reverberated through the carriage. Now and again the walls were buffeted by a shift in the air pressure outside, and each time the door next to us was opened, all the sounds of the train would suddenly rise to an infernal cacophony of rattling and banging and hissing as the air from the gap between the carriages swept in.Natalya started to talk about her Christian faith. She had visited Israel the previous year to see the spot where Jesus was crucified.\u201cI once prayed for another woman to have a baby,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd she did. For myself I prayed for a husband. And then I met this wonderful man!\u201dThe others laughed.As the stream of Russian flowed easily, almost dreamily back and forth in the sleep-drenched compartment, I caught the word \u201cPutin.\u201d\u201cDid she say something about Putin?\u201d I asked Brown.\u201cYes, yes. She says her mother is a great fan of Putin. They\u2019re all fans of Putin.\u201d\u201cWe love our homeland,\u201d Natalya said. \u201cAnd for the first time we have a Christian president, an Orthodox president.\u201dShe flipped over a magazine that was on the table to show us the cover. All the photos on it were of Putin. In one of them, he was stripped to the waist.\u201cDo you see that? Could Trump show off his body like that? He\u2019s old. His body is just a lump of lard!\u201dAll three laughed loudly.\u201cIt\u2019s now a hundred years since the revolution. What does that mean to you?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t care about it,\u201d Natalya said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hundred godless years. They tore down all the churches. They\u2019re being rebuilt now, and we can go there without being afraid. Here in this city, there\u2019s an icon of the Virgin Mary. It\u2019s very, very old. When it was found, it was completely black. Now it\u2019s gradually getting lighter. With every year that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer.\u201dWhen the interview was over, I headed down the corridor to the tiny space between the carriages for a smoke. As I opened the door I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked around. It was the young, grim-faced conductor.\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said wagging her finger at me. \u201cNo smoking anymore.\u201dWhat the hell?I returned to our compartment and sat down by the window. In the bunks across from me, Addario and Brown had turned in for the night. About an hour later, the train stopped, and I peeped out of the window. It was pitch-black out there, no station to be seen. I got up and went to investigate. I opened the door onto the space between the carriages, and there was the conductor, puffing on a cigarette.\u201cAha!\u201d I felt like saying. \u201cGotcha!\u201dInstead, I locked eyes with her for a second, just long enough to let her know that I knew, then I closed the door and went back to my compartment.What sort of city was Kazan?The neighborhood in which I found myself was modern and well maintained. The magnificent mosque, which I had seen from my hotel window when I woke, was brand new. When I went out for a walk, even the old wooden kiosk I stood and stared at, which was octagonal with a green metal dome and a little spire on the top, looked freshly renovated, more like a reconstruction of the past than a symbol of it.Kazan, the capital of Tatarstan, is also the city where Lenin studied law and was expelled from the university. His father was an official in the czarist Civil Service, and the young Lenin\u2019s life revolved around school, literature and chess, which he played at a high level. Then two things happened that changed everything. First, his father, only 54, died suddenly from a stroke. And second, his brother Alexander, whom he idolized, was executed for conspiring to kill the czar.Alexander was studying natural sciences at Petersburg University when he became involved with a revolutionary student cell. To help finance the plot, he sold a gold medal he had been awarded for his academic work. Lenin had known nothing about his brother\u2019s revolutionary activities, and until then he had been totally uninterested in politics. His brother\u2019s execution changed all that. Not only did he immediately join a revolutionary cell at the university in Kazan but, as Sebestyen describes it in his Lenin biography, his whole personality was transformed. The happiness and high spirits of his early teens vanished, leaving behind a determined, withdrawn, highly disciplined, single-minded young man. It seems as though, from the moment he was expelled, Lenin never looked back: He spent the rest of his life working for the revolution, a revolution that he could not be sure would ever actually happen.And when it did finally come, he forced it to follow his line. The Bolsheviks were atheists, and religion was expunged from the whole of the new Russian state. For three generations, religion was repressed, until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, when it returned with a vengeance. That was very visible in Kazan. There are nearly 200 national and ethnic minorities in Russia. The largest of these are the Tatars, who make up roughly 4 percent of the population. Most of them practice Islam, and Kazan had, therefore, one of the largest Muslim communities of any city in Russia.That evening I parked our rental car by the curb across the road from the National Museum of the Republic of Tatarstan. It was 6 o\u2019clock, and we were there to pick up a young woman named Dina Khabibullina, a Tatar and a practicing Muslim. We had met her earlier that day and talked about what it was like to belong to a religious and cultural minority in Russia, and she invited us to her apartment for dinner.Dina was 29, we learned, and a postdoc at the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Tatarstan. She also worked at the museum and organized tours to local Tatar attractions. She was six months pregnant.She was brought up as a non-Muslim, in a home in which the Tatar culture was scarcely detectable and where they mainly spoke Russian. When she was 19, she had a sudden awakening. She converted to Islam and taught herself Tatar. So did many of her friends.Had religion always been there, buried deep in the society, merely biding its time? Did it fulfill such a powerful need in people that it was simply indestructible?\u201cWhat made you turn to the faith?\u201d I asked her.\u201cI was 19, and my father had died,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question arose as to whether he should be buried according to proper Muslim practice. At that moment I understood that there is an explanation for everything. I asked myself what I could do for him after his death. And in the teachings of Islam, it is clearly written: You must give alms to the poor, perform the hajj and slaughter a he-goat.\u201dDina\u2019s apartment complex appeared to date from the 1950s. The brick buildings, along narrow roads and surrounded by tall trees, were old and weathered but beautiful nonetheless, as buildings from bygone eras often are.She led us up the stairs to the third floor, where her son, Gizzat, who was 7, was waiting along with her husband and her mother. The boy\u2019s father, her first husband, was dead, I eventually gathered.The apartment was small, consisting of one room in which the adults and the child all slept, a tiny bathroom and a narrow kitchen. But it was warm inside, and Dina no longer seemed wary, as she had earlier that day; she was cheerful and relaxed. After saying goodbye to her mother, who was not staying for dinner, she went into the kitchen to make dinner while her husband, Damir Dolotkazin, spread a prayer mat on the living-room floor and the boy sat on the sofa bed and watched him.Damir looked as if he was in his late 20s; he was skinny, with short, dark hair and intense but gentle eyes. Barefoot, he stood in the corner of the living room and began to sing. The music, foreign to my ears, filled the room, and I was struck by the way in which it changed the whole apartment. Suddenly the mood grew solemn, but with the everyday routine \u2014 Dina cooking, her son on the sofa with his feet dangling, the toy helicopter on top of the bookcase \u2014 still present and alive.Damir knelt and bowed down. As he got to his feet again he whispered an almost silent prayer. Then he rolled up the mat, and the air of solemnity was gone as abruptly as it had come.From the kitchen, Dina called us in. She ladled a clear soup with pearls of fat, vegetables and chunks of dark meat into our bowls.The intensity I had initially seen in Damir\u2019s eyes proved to be, or turned to, enthusiasm. He ate heartily and willingly answered all my questions.\u201cHave you always been a Muslim?\u201d I asked him.\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in the army here in Kazan. I was with a security division that escorted supply troops. I was 18 at the time and a Christian.\u201d One of his army friends was a Muslim, Damir went on, and \u201che taught me what it was about. I thought it was a very strong religion. Everything is explained in its teachings, including what to do, how to act.\u201dThere was silence.\u201cThis is very good,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat sort of meat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s horse meat,\u201d Damir said.Oh, no.Oh, no, oh no.There was no choice but to carry on eating; we were their guests, and it would have been rude not to eat the food they served us.Damir must have sensed the air of misgiving that suddenly emanated from his guests, because he said:\u201cBut it was a nice horse!\u201dWe laughed.\u201cWhat do people in the West think about Russians?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs it just stereotypes?\u201d\u201cThere are some stereotypes, yes,\u201d I said, biting into a large chunk of meat while carefully avoiding breathing through my nose, a trick that had got me through many childhood meals that I found hard to swallow, like smoked haddock or smoked cod.\u201cPeople think we\u2019re barbarians. It\u2019s very sad. What the politicians say and do doesn\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with those of us who live here. There are a lot of good people here, kind souls, and bad people too, of course. When it comes to politics, nothing has really changed. The elections are a joke.\u201dAfter dinner, a large tray of Tatar cakes was placed on the table. Damir told us that he used to be a great soccer fan. But then he corrected himself.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really like the soccer. I liked the fighting.\u201d\u201cYou were a soccer hooligan?\u201d\u201cYes. I spent three years traveling to soccer matches and fighting. I had some trouble with the law back then. But I no longer have any contact with that scene. Now I read instead. I try to read 20 books a year.\u201dOnce we had eaten and felt that we couldn\u2019t take up any more of their time, we said our goodbyes and were putting on our coats in the tiny hall when he came up to me.\u201cMy sister was killed in a plane crash in 2013,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d I said, not knowing what to do with the information.He simply nodded, and we shook hands. I felt a great warmth toward him; he had told me about his life and this, one of the most important events, couldn\u2019t be left out, even if it didn\u2019t fit the rest of the conversation. The last thing I saw before the door closed behind us was the chair in the living room, over which hung a little boy\u2019s suit, a white shirt and a tie.It was beautiful, and wild too, although most of the land was cultivated. Maybe the air of wildness came from the scale, I thought, the very sense of earthly grandeur aroused as we drove along in our tiny car.After a while we stopped at a roadside diner lying out in the middle of a steppe. We all ordered soup at the counter and sat down at one of the tables. The four women working there, all white-clad, with red, hot cheeks, went back and forth between the counter and the kitchen beyond.Once we had eaten, we asked one of the waitresses if we could talk to her. She nodded uncertainly and dried her hands on her apron. She was young, in her late 20s, and she told us that this was just a temporary job; the restaurant was part of a chain, and she came in to help out when someone was sick. There was something reserved and guarded about her, and when I started asking her about Russia, she shot a glance at the others before answering.\u201cThings are better in Russia now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economy is improving, our lives are getting better and better.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d said a man over at the cash register, looking at us. \u201cThings are worse in Russia! It\u2019s all going downhill! Worse and worse!\u201dHe was big and powerfully built, with close-cropped hair and a pale, flat face.But he was smiling when he said it.\u201cNo progress,\u201d he boomed and went to sit down at a table in the center of the room. I thanked the reserved young woman, who fled into the kitchen, clearly relieved, as I walked somewhat hesitantly over to the truck driver.He looked up at me, with his spoon in his hand.\u201cWhy are you writing about Russia?\u201d he said.\u201cIn America, the image of Russia has so much to do with Putin and politics. So we\u2019ve come here to see what life outside of that is like.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you!\u201d he said. \u201cSit down!\u201dHis name was Sergei. He was 44, and he drove a truck carrying cars from a Lada factory to dealers in Kazan.\u201cI have to work 16 hours a day to make ends meet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to live, you have to work. In 2004 I slept four hours a day and worked the rest. Then I had a boss to answer to. Now I work for myself, so at least I can choose my own routes.\u201dHe looked straight at me as he spoke, always with a glint in his eye. A joke was never far away.\u201cIt\u2019s the chance of a lifetime, meeting someone like you,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI got robbed once, would you like to hear about that?\u201dOne evening, 15 years earlier, he had parked his truck outside Moscow and was making tea in the cab. The doors were locked. Suddenly the passenger window was smashed and two men were forcing their way in.\u201cLuckily only one of them had a knife,\u201d Sergei said. \u201cThe first one opened the door, the other climbed in and put a cord around my neck. I held him off with one arm, started the truck and drove it out onto the road to block it and get help that way. The guy who was trying to choke me was in the way of the guy with the knife. That\u2019s what saved me. I managed to open the other door and jump out. Then the guy with the knife stabbed me in the back. I still have the scar.\u201d\u201cAnd they took off with the truck?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I just wanted to save myself. I walked along the road, but no one stopped to help. It was hardly surprising, I was half naked and covered in blood. There was no one at the police station. Eventually I came to a house where there was a party, I ran in, grabbed some clothes and ran off again. They found the truck later, abandoned and broken down, minus the load. And I was arrested for stealing the clothes!\u201dHe laughed. His face was constantly in motion, his expression changing in counterpoint to every twist and turn. It was a trait I recognized: He was a storyteller.He said his grandfather once claimed that he was a Romanov.\u201cA Romanov?\u201d I said. \u201cAs in the imperial family?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I asked my mother about it, but I have never been able to find out for sure.\u201dThat was pretty good luck, I thought. Running into a possible descendant of the czars in a roadside diner in the middle of Russia.He started to talk about his grandfather.\u201cHe was very strong,\u201d he said, bringing his fist down between us on the table. It was giant.\u201cHis fist was like two of mine. One time he was going to water a calf. It was a hot day, and the air was still. The calf was being bothered by a fly, it kept trying to shake it off.\u201d He raised his head, tossing it about the way the calf had done. \u201cIts head hit Grandfather. He got mad and punched the calf and it dropped down dead. One punch. Dead.\u201dHe paused for a moment to let this story sink in, then he laughed.\u201cI believe that dreams are real,\u201d he said.\u201cSo do I,\u201d I said.\u201cYou do?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIn that case I\u2019ll tell you about a dream I had. I added an extra year to my grandfather\u2019s life in that dream. I had left my father and was living with my grandfather. I loved him very much. One night I dreamed that three men in black hats and black clothes \u2014 very mysterious, they looked a little like Georgians \u2014 came into our house. They walked right past me and up to my grandfather. They grabbed hold of him, and he didn\u2019t put up a fight, he just went with them. I hung on to him and was dragged along with him, out into the darkness. I couldn\u2019t save him, even though I\u2019m strong, too. It was hopeless. I started shouting and screaming. One of the men in black asked, \u2018Who\u2019s that shouting and screaming?\u2019 He spotted me, and then he asked: \u2018How long has he got?\u2019 \u2018One year,\u2019 said one of the others, \u2018for a few good deeds.\u2019 And then they disappeared.\u201dThe truck driver looked at me.\u201cOne week later Grandfather was taken into intensive care, he was in a coma. I said we didn\u2019t need to spend money on doctors, that he would get better. Five days later he woke up. He lived for exactly one more year.\u201dAfterward we stood outside and watched Sergei walk across the forecourt to his long semitrailer in the sunshine. He turned and waved, clambered in, started the grumbling engine, put the truck into gear and drove off.The village seemed deserted except for a solitary old lady, bent over double working in a vegetable plot. Brown talked with her, and it appeared that there was a woman living in the village who was 102 years old.\u201cCan we meet her?\u201d I said.Brown asked the woman, who nodded and pointed out the direction.We walked over to a bright, blue house with a woman in a head scarf moving around outside it. In her arms she held a large white hen that was struggling to get free.While Brown talked to her, a young rooster sped by with another in hot pursuit. The chase ended in a ball of feathers a little farther off.\u201cWe\u2019ve been invited in,\u201d Brown said.I stepped over the high threshold and into the hallway. It smelled slightly sour and musty inside, but it was pleasant and warm. There were rugs everywhere, both on the floors and on the walls. It felt like entering a cave.In the middle of the living room stood a very old woman. As we entered, she turned her head slowly and looked at us.The woman who had followed us in bustled past, led the old lady over to a bed that was pushed up against the wall, sat her down, removed her head scarf and put on a fresh one, then slipped a pair of leather slippers onto her feet.It was almost as if she were dressing a doll. But the old woman didn\u2019t seem to mind. She sat perfectly still with her hands in her lap, watching us.She wore a black dress patterned with roses. The white head scarf was big; it not only covered her head but also fell all the way down her back. Her name was Minizaitunya Ibyatullina.I walked over to her and gently shook her hand. It was dry and warm. She said something as she looked up at me.\u201cShe\u2019s speaking Tatar,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying.\u201dMinizaitunya slowly turned her head toward the camera as Addario started taking photographs of her. Her son, Kasym, stood in the doorway, smiling and looking on. His wife, whose name was Alfiya, produced a large laminated photograph from a drawer and handed it to the old woman. It was of a soldier, and she held it up in front of herself.This was a photograph of Minizaitunya\u2019s husband, who died in the war in 1943, in Ukraine. He was a very beautiful man. How odd it must be for her, I thought, to look at that picture of him, 70 years later, with him so young and handsome and her now 102.She didn\u2019t appear to think anything of it. She looked proud, sitting there holding his picture.It must have been odd for her son too. He was 80, more than twice as old as his father was when he died.Kasym had lived in the village all his life. It had been a collective farm under the Soviet Union. He had worked as a carpenter, he told us. His mother had also worked all her life.She said something in a soft voice, and her son bent down to her.\u201cShe says she\u2019s too old to work now,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the strength for it.\u201d\u201cWhat sort of work did she do?\u201d\u201cShe worked on the collective farm. Milking the cows and other chores.\u201dAlfiya came into the living room and invited us to come to the table. She had been baking while we were there: On the table was a platter holding a warm flat loaf and several sorts of jam. There were only two chairs, and there could be no talk of either of them sitting down. The wife poured tea, the husband presented a large bag of hard candy and when I made no move to help myself, he took out three pieces and laid them next to my plate.From the living room came the sound of soft, slow footsteps.\u201cThe babushka\u2019s coming!\u201d Alfiya said. Seconds later Minizaitunya appeared in the doorway. Her son escorted her over to another bed, where she sat and watched us while we ate.She was born in 1915. Russia was still a monarchy then, and Nicholas II still ruled. So she had seen the old czardom, the revolution, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union and, now, the new Russia.Alfiya put some fresh bread in a bag for us, Kasym gave us some bags of candy, and each of us was also presented with a small embroidered cloth to take with us. Even Minizaitunya had gifts for us: a bar of soap for Brown, scarves for Addario and me.\u201cAll of the people I grew up with are dead,\u201d she said from her seat on the bed when we were on our feet and about to leave. \u201cThere\u2019s no one left.\u201dI never look anyone straight in the eye for more than a few seconds at a time. I don\u2019t want to intrude on anyone, and maybe I don\u2019t want them to intrude on me. But once I had shaken everyone\u2019s hand in farewell that afternoon and was standing there looking at her and she looked back at me, I thought that I ought to hold her gaze, that I should look into her eyes. Those eyes that had seen the world during the time of the czars and seen the world for a hundred years after that.We looked at each other for a long time. At first she seemed surprised, as if she were wondering what I was up to, but then, slowly, she began to smile, and it was so wonderful, that smile, that there were tears in my eyes a moment later when we walked out the door and left the house.A set of headlights flickered farther in among the trees. I followed them with my eyes as they drew closer. When the lights lit up the car I was leaning against, they slowed down. A faint unease welled up inside me. I had heard stories about violent robberies in the towns nearby. But then whoever it was sped past. I stepped on my cigarette, got into our car and drove back onto the main road. It was probably just some bored teenagers out for a ride, I thought. And you could understand why, out here where there was nothing but trees and water.\u201cWhat are they protesting?\u201d Addario asked.\u201cThere are demonstrations all over the country today,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn support of the imprisoned opposition leader Aleksei Navalny. It\u2019s Putin\u2019s birthday today.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d I said, but a moment later I had forgotten the demonstration, because we were approaching the Church on the Blood, which sat on the actual spot where the legendary czar\u2019s story ended. It also housed something that, to me, was just as much the stuff of legend \u2014 an authentic Orthodox church service, which, thanks to all the Russian novels I had read, not least the works of Dostoyevsky, was bathed in a special light. This was the selfless light of mercy, associated not only with the highest and richest but also with the lowest and poorest. In Dostoyevsky\u2019s books, there is something morbid about this light, a frenzied, exhausting quality, which I have always regarded as typically Russian. I\u2019ve certainly never observed it anywhere else.We got out of the car and stood in the rain, looking up at the church.I knew right away that I would not be realizing any kind of Dostoyevskian vision. The church had been built in the traditional style, with multiple shining domes, but it was clearly brand new. Looking at it gave me the same strange feeling I had once in Warsaw Old Town, where the buildings destroyed in World War II, many of which were centuries old, had been replaced with pristine replicas. It was like flickering through a glitch in time. The old was not old, the new was not new. So where were we?On the night of July 16, 1918, as the story goes, the czar\u2019s family was awoken and told that they were being taken to a safer location. They came down from their rooms and were asked to wait in the cellar. They had no idea what was about to happen until the guns were raised against them. The revolutionaries who made up the firing squad were amateurs; some of them were drunk. The shots hit the family at random, the floor ran with blood, the air was thick with smoke, there must have been screaming and banging and confusion, several members of the family lay bleeding, but alive, on the floor, until they were finally killed with shots directly to the head. The bodies were then driven out of the town, and attempts were made to render their faces unrecognizable with acid before they were thrown down a mine shaft. Some days later, they were brought up again, transported to a nearby forest and buried there.The house was gone, the cellar was gone, the blood and the bodies were gone. But the Romanovs weren\u2019t gone. In the Church on the Blood, they had returned, as symbols. Those crazed and bloody minutes, and all that they represented, had now been subsumed into reliquary forms that promised the opposite: foresight, structure, harmony, balance.At the entrance to the church stood a sculpture of the whole Romanov family, made in the same heroic-realist style that Soviet artists used to depict the workers of the 1920s and 1930s. Inside the church hung icons in which Nicholas II was portrayed in the manner of the Middle Ages. Almost everything in the church involved a distortion of time. The ritual and repetition of the services abolished time entirely, linking the time within that chamber to divine time, which was eternal, unaffected by life or death, which was always there, which lasted forever. The czar and his family were lifted into this room, and the story with which they were associated disappeared, traceless. And yet Lenin existed in a similar space. Lying embalmed in his mausoleum on Red Square, his body was real and bound to the moment, but there was nothing about the body that connected him to the time when he held sway; he, too, was simultaneously inside and outside time.History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake, Joyce wrote. Nowhere was that truer than Russia.My first thought was that I should have been there, that this was the place where it was all happening, that this was what I should have gone to see in order to present the best possible picture of modern Russia.Then I thought: no.Stories have always held Russia together, and what makes them different from most other countries\u2019 nation-building stories, perhaps, is the authoritarian nature of the stories themselves: One story has been paramount while all that deviate from it have been forbidden. So it was under the czars, who censored books and newspapers; so it was under Lenin. And so it still is today \u2014 reporters in Russia are regularly imprisoned and sometimes simply murdered.And yet the alternative stories, the ones the authorities did not want to see gaining a foothold, the ones that told of abuse of power and oppression, of living in a dictatorship where all hope for the future was gone \u2014 these too had become standardized.The demonstration was what the international newspapers reported about Russia the day before, and their stories confirmed and reinforced the larger story about a downtrodden people in a totalitarian state. But behind this reality there was another reality as well. The three lively women on the train; Dina and Damir, the young couple in Kazan with a baby on the way; Sergei the truck driver; the old, old woman in the village and the elderly couple who cared for her \u2014 which story about Russia could contain all of them without, at the same time, drastically reducing what was unique to each of them?Turgenev\u2019s stories could. The characters in them do not lead to anything beyond themselves. But the world as it is can\u2019t exist without its twin, the world as we want it to be. Lenin, the oppressor, read Turgenev all through his life, and Vladimir Putin revealed his love for \u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d in an interview from 2011, when he said: \u201cThe main character, in a simple but picturesque and very sympathetic way, tells stories about people he met while hunting, and their lives. They are a sort of sketches on Russia\u2019s heartland of the mid-19th century that provide food for thought and allow us to see our country, its traditions and national psychology in a new light.\u201d\u201cI was born into a classic Soviet family,\u201d he said once we had taken our seats at a table near a window looking out onto the street. \u201cBoth my parents were geologists; they were members of the Soviet intelligentsia.\u201dHe was short and stocky, with a stubbly beard, and there was something indomitable about him that made me think about an animal that won\u2019t let go of something when it gets its teeth into it. Lebedev\u2019s books dealt with history \u2014 it lay like a shadow over everything he wrote \u2014 and the fact that its presence was so powerful suggested that the conflicts and tensions inherent in it were still unresolved, still had a bearing on Russian society in obscure yet palpable ways.Lebedev told me that everything in his childhood was designed to keep parts of the past hidden from him. His great-grandfather had, for example, been an officer in the czar\u2019s army before he switched sides and joined the Red Army. But in the family\u2019s version of events, he had always worn the Red Army\u2019s cape with its red star, as if he had been born in 1917 and there had been nothing before that.\u201cFor me that was normal,\u201d he said. \u201cTo live in an incomplete world. To live in a world full of holes. With all these questions that could never be asked.\u201dThe street outside was lit by the rays of the low October sun and busy with people strolling through the town on this Sunday afternoon. Many of them must have had stories similar to Lebedev\u2019s, I thought. There is a mechanism in people that stops us from talking about bad experiences and makes us reluctant to stir up the past. But secrets foster a specific version of reality in which the individual pieces have to be arranged in a particular way, fitting so neatly together that if just one were to change position, the whole picture would fall apart. Our identity is shaped by stories, about our own history, about our family\u2019s history, about the history of our people or our country. What happens when one of these identity-shaping stories doesn\u2019t fit? Suddenly you are not who you thought you were. And then who are you?I asked him what the narrative in Russia was like now.\u201cIt\u2019s very strange,\u201d he replied. \u201cFirst of all, it is important to understand that the authorities have no single, coherent ideology. They use elements from all sorts of different fields: If it works, they\u2019ll take it. They need a smoke screen to hide the fact that they\u2019re nothing but a bunch of kleptocrats. Take, for example, the name of the United Russia party. Those words, a \u2018united Russia,\u2019 were a slogan of the counterrevolutionaries, coined in reaction to Lenin and the Bolsheviks, who wished to establish new, self-governing republics. The current administration is building a state founded on Soviet nostalgia, but they have no qualms about appropriating an opposition slogan. And it\u2019s not the slightest bit controversial.\u201dLebedev led the way past the Bolshoi Theater, pointing and explaining as we walked along. The square in front of the theater\u2019s magnificent neoclassical facade was dominated by several parked police buses and the police officers and police dogs standing near them.\u201cRiot police,\u201d Lebedev said. \u201cThere were demonstrations here yesterday, so they\u2019re worried and want to make sure nothing happens.\u201dDense crowds of people milled around the stalls and the profusion of food and drink. The mood was light, people were smiling and laughing, children running around the feet of the adults, the sun shining on faces, and behind us, stark against the deep blue sky, reared the towers of the Kremlin.\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of the harvest,\u201d Lebedev said. \u201cIt\u2019s so typical of Putin and the government. They invest in nonpolitical events and public meeting places like this. Here it\u2019s all about pumpkins! They\u2019re trying to invent new traditions, and this is meant as a display of Russia\u2019s riches.\u201dWe continued walking, to Revolution Square, which under the czars was called Resurrection Square. \u201cAs you can see, there\u2019s no trace of the revolution here,\u201d Lebedev said. \u201cThe centenary is hardly being celebrated at all; certainly there\u2019s no discussion of the violence, the atrocities. But if you are to understand what happened in this country in the \u201920s and \u201930s, you cannot ignore the violence and the horrors of the five years from 1917 to 1921. You cannot understand why people were so willing to slaughter one another. There has been a sort of a war fought over memories in Russia, over what should be remembered and what should be forgotten. History today is all about symbols, not about notions of mutual forgiveness and reconciliation.\u201cBut wait till you see this, in here,\u201d he said, pointing to the entrance to a metro station. The escalator we stepped onto was steep and long, and in the underworld to which it carried us, time seemed to have stood still.Placed on a series of platforms along the walls were huge, heroic bronze statues of human figures. The first of them bore rifles and cartridge belts; these were the revolutionaries. But then came the ordinary people, men and women, young and old, peasants, fishermen, factory workers \u2014 the whole exquisite, mesmerizing series ending with a child held aloft, a symbol of the future.Oh, it was so full of hope and faith that the knowledge that it was propaganda no longer mattered, because this was a vision of a life, of a land, of a future, and it was not untrue, just beautiful.This, too, was the revolution, the dream of a better life for all. All the art from that time shares this same energy, an almost wild optimism, a sense that this is where it begins. Women are as much in the vanguard as men, not sexualized or objectivized, but there in their own right. The artists are experimenting; this is the age of Mayakovsky, Eisenstein, Kandinsky. As well as killing, violence, ruthlessness, hunger, want, misery and, in due course, a system that became ossified, closed to the world, trapped by its own truths. The underground station was the most beautiful place I saw during my days in Russia, but the beauty could not be used for anything, bound up as it was with concepts of reality that no one believed in anymore and that could never, therefore, be realized.And yet neither did that make it a lie. The statue of the czar outside the Church on the Blood was a lie, because it changed the past. These statues were meant to change the future. The fact that this future was never realized, that it never came to pass, did not make this subterranean vision untrue; it just made it vain and beautiful. Few things are more beautiful than vain hope.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Has Trumphoria Finally Hit a Wall?", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen talking about stock markets, there are three rules you have to remember. First, the stock market is not the economy. Second, the stock market is not the economy. Third, the stock market is not the economy.So the market plunge of the past few days might mean nothing at all.And on the other side, don\u2019t assume that the stock price decline tells us much about the economic future, either. The great economist Paul Samuelson famously quipped that the stock market had predicted nine of the past five recessions. That 1987 crash, for example, was followed not by a recession, but by solid growth.Still, market turmoil should make us take a hard look at the economy\u2019s prospects. And what the data say, I\u2019d argue, is that at the very least America is heading for a downshift in its growth rate; the available evidence suggests that growth over the next decade will be something like 1.5 percent a year, not the 3 percent Donald Trump and his minions keep promising.There are also suggestions in the data that risky assets in general \u2014 stocks, but also long-term bonds and real estate \u2014 may be overpriced. Leaving Bitcoin madness aside, we\u2019re not talking dot-coms in 2000 or houses in 2006. But standard indicators are well above historically normal levels, and a reversion toward those norms could be painful.About that plummet: If there was any news item behind it, it was Friday\u2019s employment report, which showed a significant although not huge rise in wages. Now, rising wages are a good thing. In fact, the failure of wages to rise much until now has been a deeply frustrating deficiency in the otherwise impressively durable economic recovery that began early in the Obama administration.Again, this is all good news. But it does mean that future U.S. growth can\u2019t come from putting the unemployed back to work. It has to come either from growth in the pool of potential workers or from rising productivity, that is, more output per worker.Did the markets believe Trump? At the very least, they\u2019ve been acting as if the U.S. economy still had lots of room to run; throwing cold water on that belief should mean both higher interest rates and lower stock prices, which is what we\u2019re seeing.But should we be worried about something worse than a mere downshift in growth?Individually, these numbers aren\u2019t that alarming: Stocks, as I said, don\u2019t look nearly as overvalued as they did in 2000, housing not nearly as overvalued as it was in 2006. On the other hand, this time both markets look overvalued at the same time, at least raising the possibility of a double-bubble burst like the one that hit Japan at the end of the 1980s.Still, all of this would be manageable if key policymakers could be counted on to act effectively. Which is where I get worried.It\u2019s surely not a good thing that Trump got rid of one of the most distinguished Federal Reserve chairs in history just before markets started to flash some warning signs. Jerome Powell, Janet Yellen\u2019s replacement, seems like a reasonable guy. But we have no idea how well he would handle a crisis if one developed.So are we heading for trouble? Too soon to tell. But if we are, rest assured that we\u2019ll have the worst possible people on the case.Advertisement"}

I mean, they certainly didn\u2019t seem to love our country very much.\u201dMr. Trump was speaking during a visit to a company near Cincinnati that makes pneumatic and hydraulic cylinders. The company, Sheffer Corporation, awarded each of its 126 employees a one-time bonus of $1,000 after the passage of the tax cut, and the White House clearly hoped to use it to drive home the message of economic health in last week\u2019s State of the Union speech.\u201cYour paychecks are going way up,\u201d a beaming president said to this more friendly audience. \u201cYour taxes are going way down.\u201dBut as Mr. Trump spoke, TV networks broadcast a jarring split screen. While the president boasted of companies bringing billions of dollars back to America, the Dow Jones industrial average was shedding billions more. At one point, the rout become so drastic that CNN and MSNBC switched from the speech to report exclusively on the market gyrations.Unlike most of his predecessors, who have generally avoided talking about the ups and downs of the stock market, Mr. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the rise in stock prices. He often mentions the bull market in settings that have nothing to do with the economy. But on Monday, he made no mention of it, preferring to focus on other economic indicators, like the unemployment rate and economic growth.As Mr. Trump patted himself on the back for the tax cut, he went after the Democrats for opposing the $1.5 trillion legislation. He delivered a lengthy digression on the State of the Union address, noting that Democrats sat on their hands as he ticked off one measure of success for the country after another.\u201cIt got to a point where I really didn\u2019t even want to look up too much during the speech over to that side because honestly, it was bad energy,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cEven on positive news, really positive news like that, they were like death and un-American,\u201d he said, repeating, \u201cUn-American.

{"Headline": "The Trump Tax Cuts Hurt This Manufacturer. It Kept On Lobbying.", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLATHAM, N.Y. \u2014 By noon on Wednesday, the snow was ankle-deep in the parking lot and the workers had abandoned the factory floor at Plug Power to escape the storm. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells meant for forklifts in Amazon or Walmart warehouses sat half-finished in steel casings.The empty plant was a weather fluke, but to the 300 employees in this town outside Albany, it might have been an omen of the company\u2019s fate, which was resting in the hands of Washington lawmakers.The $1.5 trillion tax bill President Trump signed into law last year failed to extend a crucial tax credit for fuel-cell makers such as Plug Power, putting the company\u2019s domestic future in jeopardy. As workers drove home that afternoon to ride out the storm, a flurry of hope was swirling as Congress hashed out a bipartisan budget deal that company leaders hoped would reinstate the fuel-cell tax credit.An extension of the credit would allow Plug Power\u2019s executives to continue their recent expansion in the United States. Without it, the 20-year old company would shift resources to China and Germany, potentially leaving the workers here out in the cold.The giant tax bill ushered in the most significant changes to the tax code in decades, with the aim of helping businesses grow and flourish. But Washington has a long history of picking winners and losers through the tax code \u2014 even in bills meant to simplify it \u2014 and Plug Power\u2019s experience demonstrates just how much power Congress wields over companies who build businesses based in part on policy decisions.For more than two years, Plug Power\u2019s president and chief executive, Andy Marsh, had spent a chunk of his working hours advocating a long-term extension of the credit. The company spent more than $750,000 during that period to lobby Congress. Early in the day on Wednesday, Mr. Marsh said he was 65 percent certain the tax credit would make it into the budget deal. Around lunchtime, he put the odds at 35 percent.While Mr. Marsh prepared to follow his workers out the door, his chief operating officer, Keith Schmid, took a visitor on a last walk across the now-silent plant.\u201cI\u2019m a little spooked by how quiet it is today,\u201d he said.An hour later, his reprieve arrived. Congress cut a deal to extend the credit.For years, Washington has set tax policy in fits and starts, creating targeted tax breaks for particular industries and often setting them to expire, to minimize the projected loss to federal revenues. Yet those credits are routinely extended on a temporary basis, creating a maddening dance for companies who struggle to plan and invest for the long term.Economists generally agree that the process is detrimental to companies and the economy. Expiring tax breaks give companies an incentive to plow money into lobbying to retain those preferences, rather than putting that money toward research and development, worker training or other investments that might improve their productivity. Free-market purists also contend that targeted tax breaks distort markets, propping up firms that otherwise might fail, just because they have government connections.But try as they might, policymakers in Washington cannot quit the short-term credit game.In 2005, President George W. Bush signed a law that created a 30 percent credit for investing in fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to create an electric current. Congress extended the credit twice after that. But it eventually set the credit, along with similar incentives for solar, wind and other clean energy sources, to expire at the end of 2016.Industry lobbyists worked hard to prevent the expiration, and in 2015, lawmakers extended some solar and wind credits but allowed the fuel cell credit to die as scheduled.The industries whose credits expired never stopped working to get them back. Some members of Congress took up their cause, such as Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York, who drafted a bill to reinstate \u2014 and gradually phase out \u2014 the energy credits that had been \u201corphaned\u201d by the 2015 bill.Mr. Reed nearly succeeded in getting those extensions attached to the sprawling tax bill that Republicans sped through Congress last fall. But his provision was dropped from the bill as it moved through the Senate, and thus never made it to Mr. Trump for his signature.The disappearance of the credit threatened the domestic expansion of Plug Power, a company founded in the late 1990s in the midst of the tech boom, whose stock briefly topped $1,000 a share. The bubble popped, the firm\u2019s shares sunk to single digits and the company burned through money, seeking a marketable use for its fuel cells, which cost more than conventional competitors but emit nothing but water as a byproduct. Mr. Marsh took over in 2008 and finally steered the firm into what has become a profitable niche: replacing the large batteries that power forklifts in warehouses.Forklifts that run on fuel cells do not need to swap out batteries every shift, like those that run on lead-acid batteries. They plug into a fuel station that looks like a gasoline pump, connect a few hoses and quickly fill up with hydrogen. Plug Power has found a growing market in selling or leasing those fuel cells to Amazon, Walmart, Kroger and B.M.W., among others, and it has begun piloting fuel-cell powered delivery trucks in China and around Albany.When the credit expired, Mr. Marsh said, the price of buying one of the company\u2019s fuel cells immediately jumped 30 percent for customers. Some of those customers, he added, have budgets set aside for alternative energy spending \u2014 and in those cases, solar and wind projects, which still were backed by credits, were suddenly more attractive.The recent tax law compounded the problem, because it made it more expensive for Plug Power to get financing. When the law was signed in December, Mr. Marsh said one of his lenders called and told him his borrowing costs were going up.\u201cWe just want a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Marsh said on Wednesday. He occasionally checked his phone for updates from his lobbying team in Washington. He loves the Albany region and hopes to expand here, he said, but he noted that China and Germany loomed as attractive markets, and said the company would more aggressively explore expansion there \u2014 and perhaps resource relocation \u2014 if the tax credit did not return.\u201cWe have a business plan if it goes one way, and a business plan if it goes the other way, and we\u2019ll execute what makes sense,\u201d Mr. Marsh said. \u201cI don\u2019t get paid to be nervous.\u201dIn Washington, the lobbying team had little ability left to sway the outcome. Trade groups representing Plug Power and other energy companies had pressed for two years to extend the credit, as had the lobbyists on contract for the company. They had lined up powerful allies for the measure, including Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the minority leader. The lobbyists spent Wednesday mostly trying to scare up news from the closed-door negotiations in the Capitol to see if their work had paid off.At midday, Mr. Marsh was told that the fuel cell credit was not yet in the bill, but discussions were ongoing. Around that time, executives decided to send Plug Power workers home to escape the snow.Word finally arrived from Washington later that day about the deal: The credit was in the budget deal, retroactive to 2017 and phased down through 2022. The industry had gotten exactly what it wanted \u2014 at least for now. Mr. Marsh, in an email, said that he was excited and thankful: \u201cIt is time for our sales team to let our customers know that our products are now available with the tax credit, and go push sales and growth in the U.S.\u201dMany conservative groups protested the inclusion. Several groups in the powerful Koch network sent a letter to congressional leaders, saying the budget deal had \u201copened the floodgates to massive increases in government spending and corporate welfare for powerful and well-connected special interests.\u201dSome of those interests fared better than others: Most of the 48 \u201ctax extenders\u201d tucked into the budget deal \u2014 including special tax treatment for race horse owners and timber companies \u2014 were one-year extensions retroactive for 2017 only. Congress will presumably take them up again in future negotiations.The deal passed the Senate and House early on Friday morning, after a brief but contentious debate. Mr. Marsh was off to Argentina for vacation, but he reported that the roads had been cleared around Albany, and the factory floor was humming again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is the Perfect Color Worth?", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureThat day, as the team decided on colors for Spring/Summer 2019, the theme was love. It was a balmy May morning, but Shah, with thin graying hair and glasses, was dressed in a navy blue buttoned sweater with a thick scarf wrapped loosely around his neck. He frequently interrupted with questions as the handpicked members of his team took turns presenting \u201cmood boards\u201d they had brought with them. Like oversize pages from a scrapbook, these displays included photographs, drawings, artworks, ribbons, textiles, paint samples, bits of plastic, lengths of rope, tourist tchotchkes and, in one instance, a piece of frilly lingerie.There were spirited, far-ranging discussions of art, film, music, theater, books, fashion, museum exhibitions and advertising \u2014 anything that might hint, even remotely, at where color was headed. Amid the clamor of voices, Shah asked an American forecaster in the room to give the view from across the Atlantic.\u201cWhat is the zeitgeist going on in the United States about color?\u201d Shah asked. \u201cAre they big colors? Are they strong colors? Prime colors?\u201d\u201cI think what\u2019s going on in the United States now is that it\u2019s all happening,\u201d the woman replied. \u201cIt\u2019s almost reflective of the conflict going on around us \u2014 where you\u2019re not having one definite color correction, but you\u2019re seeing examples in various areas. I think it\u2019s mostly about mixes.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s not about solids,\u201d Shah said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you put colors together?\u201d\u201cExactly, and different from what it\u2019s been before,\u201d the woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a counterculture type of a feeling \u2014 you deliberately use colors that would not ordinarily work together.\u201d\u201cAccidental colors,\u201d Shah said, coining a phrase.\u201cThat\u2019s a good way of putting it, yes,\u201d the woman agreed.The conclave broke for lunch, and Shah walked around the table alone, scratching his chin and muttering to himself while sorting mood boards into piles of similar colors \u2014 \u201cediting,\u201d he said. Occasionally he would wince at having mislaid a board, then pick it up again and set it down someplace else. He worked hurriedly, and by the time the others returned from their meals, he was finished, having arranged the materials into precise groups from which the winning shades could be selected. That afternoon, he and his collaborators finalized the palettes. In six weeks, the forecast would be available to anyone interested enough to part with $795.Color forecasters like Shah and his team at Pantone have tremendous influence over the visible elements of the global economy \u2014 the parts of it that are designed, manufactured and purchased \u2014 though their profession itself is all but invisible. If you\u2019re familiar with color forecasting at all, it\u2019s most likely thanks to a scene in the 2006 film \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d in which the fashion-magazine mandarin Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, explains to her young, fashion-skeptical assistant why the assistant, played by Anne Hathaway, happens to be wearing a sweater in a very particular shade of blue known as cerulean. Cerulean, Priestly explains, first showed itself a few years earlier in a collection by Oscar de la Renta and was soon adopted by a number of other influential designers before it \u201cfiltered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner, where you no doubt fished it out of some clearance bin,\u201d she says.\u201cThat blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sort of comical how you think that you\u2019ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you\u2019re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room.\u201d In reality, it was selected by Pantone. Six years before the release of \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d Pantone\u2019s forecasters named cerulean the company\u2019s first-ever Color of the Year.In the nearly two decades since then, as digital design and social media have expanded the ranks of color obsessives, Pantone has become not just a company but a sensation, its brand bestriding the globe like a behemoth. Its color forecasts, too, have retained their reputation as some of the most influential in the world, even as the field of competitors has grown crowded \u2014 not just with other companies but, thanks to the internet, with people on social-networking sites like Tumblr and Pinterest who have a knack for spotting color trends and enough followers to matter. For the class of fashion and industrial designers who make up Pantone\u2019s customer base, picking the right color \u2014 and exactly the right shade of that color \u2014 can feel like one of the most important decisions they\u2019ll make all year. Companies will pay almost anything to get it right, and the rarefied, vaguely mystical art of doing just that happens to be Pantone\u2019s business.More discoveries soon followed: magenta, Hofmann\u2019s violet, Lyons blue, malachite green, Bismarck brown and aniline black. By the 1880s, dye houses in Germany, which was by then the center of the chemical industry, and French textile mills were issuing seasonal color cards and ribbon samples of various synthetic shades. When the outbreak of World War I cut off the supply of German dyestuffs, threatening the color industry with collapse, a consortium of American mills and manufacturers formed the Textile Color Card Association, which developed the first industrywide color library and trend forecast, based solely on dyes that could be manufactured domestically. After the armistice, the group continued to be a hub for the best intelligence on color trends emanating from Europe\u2019s fashion capitals and, in 1955, renamed itself the Color Association of the United States. Similar organizations soon took form in other countries around the world.The modern color industry had arrived, if only in a confined sort of way. Born out of the fashion business, it remained rooted there for decades even as it exerted powerful influence on distant parts of the consumer economy, such as the automotive and home-furnishings sectors. But at the turn of the millennium, the color industry\u2019s center of gravity shifted seemingly overnight with a big bang in the field of industrial design: the release, in 1998, of Apple\u2019s iMac G3 desktop computer.Available in 11 translucent shades, from Bondi Blue to Tangerine, the iMac ushered in a new era in which consumers began to value everyday purchases not strictly, or even primarily, for their utility but as a form of self-expression. \u201cThat colorful plastic was everywhere in industrial design for the next several years,\u201d Virginia Postrel, the author of several books on aesthetics, told me. \u201cNot just consumer electronics but all sorts of ordinary objects like irons and trash cans. It was an easy and cheap way to make things look fun and fresh.\u201d Eventually, the enthusiasm faded; Apple itself shifted its palette to neutral whites, blacks and silvers. But the larger idea that the iMac inaugurated \u2014 namely that color choices are serious business and can determine the success or failure of any product in any industry \u2014 continues to ripple through the marketplace.Steve Jobs\u2019s revolution in commercial aesthetics would have been impossible without another one that occurred 35 years earlier. A nagging problem had troubled the color industry from its inception: how to communicate accurately the subtleties of perception. In his 1963 book, \u201cInteraction of Color,\u201d the Bauhaus artist and Yale professor Josef Albers wrote: \u201cIf one says \u2018Red\u2019 (the name of a color) and there are 50 people listening, it can be expected that there will be 50 reds in their minds. And one can be sure that all these reds will be very different.\u201d There are innumerable colors, he continued, but only about 30 names for them. And even if you could describe all of those colors, wouldn\u2019t your sense of them still differ from someone else\u2019s? As the British journalist Kassia St. Clair writes in \u201cThe Secret Lives of Color,\u201d \u201cYou could no more meaningfully secure a precise universal definition for all the known shades than you could plot the coordinates of a dream.\u201dThe man who came closest to doing just that was Lawrence Herbert. In 1956, Herbert, who had recently graduated with a degree in biology and chemistry from Hofstra University on Long Island, took a job as a press operator and color matcher at M\u2009&\u2009J Levine, a New York-based advertising firm and the parent company of a small printing concern called Pantone Press. As the company\u2019s founders turned to other lines of business, Herbert took over the printing division and in a few short years, pioneered a cheaper, more accurate printing method that allowed him to produce a full spectrum of colors from 10 basic pigments. Not long after that, he bought out the company\u2019s printing unit, along with its name, and in 1963 introduced the Pantone Matching System.Herbert\u2019s system was at once transformative and elegantly simple. It measured precisely the mixture of pigments necessary to produce a specific shade, each of which was assigned a reference number. Pantone then compiled the colors and numbers into books. Rather than provide inks directly, it sold the means by which a printer could faithfully and consistently reproduce any color in Pantone\u2019s library. In doing so, Herbert tamed color\u2019s mysterious nature and turned it into a commodity, in essence quantifying what had until then been unquantifiable.Pantone and its parent company, X-Rite \u2014 a maker of color-management systems and software that acquired Pantone in 2007 \u2014 now have 17 offices and production facilities around the world and offer products used by 10 million designers and manufacturers every day. Pantone\u2019s color library, which continues to grow by the year, contains roughly 10,000 unique shades. The company\u2019s expansion has been helped along by globalization and the offshoring of manufacturing. With designers in Europe, say, marketers in the United States and factories in China, a company can easily communicate color choices up and down the supply chain, so long as everyone involved references the same Pantone chip \u2014 Albers\u2019s 50 reds reduced to one.I met Beverly Bell, Pantone\u2019s manager of color and quality standards for textiles, in a dimly lit room adjacent to the factory floor. Nearby, an employee in a white lab coat was standing at a countertop light box, checking a fresh batch of cotton-based color standards for flaws. The box emits D65 light, which, Bell said, simulates the midday sun in Western Europe \u2014 supposedly the purest possible illumination and the industry standard for assessing color.Such exacting controls are in place at every stage of production. Cotton swatches, for example, after being dyed, are conditioned overnight in a machine that exposes them to D65 light and a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit at 50 percent humidity. Afterward, they are measured with a spectrophotometer, which compares colors against the Pantone standard with hyperaccuracy. If they pass inspection, the swatches are then hermetically sealed inside plastic, ultraviolet-resistant envelopes, which protect against fading. Colors applied to paper and plastic undergo similar testing.The final quality safeguard is the human eye. Every Pantone employee is required to pass an annual exam called the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Color Vision Test. The test taker has to arrange four rows of samples, 85 in all, into descending order based on their shade. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s actually working with color has to get a \u2018superior\u2019 rating,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo that means no more than three errors.\u201d That morning, trying my luck on a blue/purple row, I made only one mistake, and might have congratulated myself had Bell not already told me that Pantone\u2019s reigning color-test champion, a woman named Madlin Tadros, who works in the textiles department, has never erred in 21 years.The unremarkable appearance of Pantone\u2019s offices belies the excitement the brand engenders around the world. Designers, regardless of their industry, always seem to have Pantone\u2019s color books within reach, like some sacred text of a secret society. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you look at it,\u201d an interior designer told me. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine working with anything else.\u201d The company\u2019s color standards are often employed by exacting obsessives for decidedly off-label purposes too. A fish company recently enlisted Pantone to assist with a guide for sushi freshness. And Calvin Klein, according to Lisa Marsh\u2019s 2004 book, \u201cThe House of Klein,\u201d used to keep a Pantone chip taped to the wall next to the office coffee maker \u201cto ensure he\u2019d get just the right mix of coffee and milk every time.\u201dIn the past decade, Pantone has become a consumer brand in its own right: It now licenses clothes, shoes, cosmetics, kitchenware, furniture, cellphones, jigsaw puzzles, children\u2019s books, skateboards, key chains and thumb drives, in Pantone colors and bearing its logo. Pantone does not report financial information, but Fast Company wrote in 2015 that a full 15 percent of its millions of dollars in annual revenue now derives from commercial licensing.And the cult of Pantone extends far beyond the company\u2019s own merchandise. An online fan club of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for example, has taken to calling itself by the team\u2019s official shade of blue, Pantone 294. An authorized Pantone-themed boutique hotel in Brussels immerses its guests in a kaleidoscopic array of colors, right down to their bedspreads and coffee mugs. Several Instagram users, each with tens of thousands of followers, regularly pair their photographs with the corresponding Pantone chips, and a Brazilian photographer named Ang\u00e9lica Dass has made portraits of more than 3,000 people in 13 countries, all sorted by skin color according to the Pantone Matching System.This alchemy of color chips into cultural cachet is largely the work of Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, a small in-house consultancy, founded in 1986. A native New Yorker with shoulder-length brown hair, Pressman arrived at Pantone nearly 20 years ago, shortly after the color industry\u2019s iMac-inaugurated big bang, and since then has worked to make Pantone a household name. Her division produces several seasonal forecasts, as well as a magazine called Viewpoint Colour, which anticipate trends up to three years in advance. It has also helped brands \u2014 from Tiffany and Victoria\u2019s Secret to Barbie, Schweppes and the Royal Mail in Britain \u2014 develop proprietary shades. On the day I visited, Pressman showed me an uncut sheet of soon-to-be-released Pantone chips for Love Symbol No.2, a shade adapted from the purple paint on one of Prince\u2019s favorite pianos and commissioned by his estate after his death.That a company engaged in the manufacture of something so intangible \u2014 and, for most consumers, so useless \u2014 as color standards could develop a widespread and devoted following among people far removed from its intended clientele speaks to a larger cultural phenomenon: a growing popular enthusiasm for color in its own right and for its own sake, free of the constraints of form or function. Color\u2019s liberation owes much to the rise of the internet, particularly the explosion of photo sharing on social media. As this digital revolution took shape, Pantone found itself perfectly positioned to exploit it. \u201cPantone did not create desire for color,\u201d said Ellen Sideri, founder and chief executive of ESP TrendLab in the garment district in New York. \u201cIt has, though, facilitated the use of color globally by creating a common digital color language.\u201d A result is that \u201cour culture has become supervisual, and more than ever before. Color has become a definer of many things.\u201dEach December for nearly two decades, the Pantone Color Institute has tried to capture the moment in the form of its Color of the Year, which it has described as \u201ca color snapshot of what we see taking place in our global culture that serves as an expression of a mood and an attitude.\u201d This year\u2019s pick is Ultra Violet (18-3838), a bluish purple that, the company asserts, is associated with the counterculture, nonconformity, mindfulness and visionary thinking, and that \u201csuggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead and the discoveries beyond where we are now.\u201d The release of the Color of the Year occasions a media frenzy and, after it, a torrent of bandwagon-hopping service journalism: For months after this year\u2019s selection, Google Alerts continued to crowd my inbox with articles suggesting how I might use Ultra Violet to update my wardrobe, redecorate my living room, create floral bouquets or crochet a scarf. A Swedish art director created a recipe for an Ultra Violet-colored smoothie.Sometimes Pantone\u2019s pick validates an established trend, as Rose Quartz (13-1520) did for the shade popularly known as Millennial Pink in 2016 \u2014 about as risky a choice as the N.B.A.\u2019s picking LeBron James for Most Valuable Player. In other cases, like Ultra Violet, the company has treaded nearer to the leading edge, more a demonstration of power, perhaps, than astuteness. \u201cThe actual tones themselves I\u2019ve not loved,\u201d Jane Monnington Boddy, the London-based color director at WGSN, a tracker of global fashion trends, told me. But over all, she said, she was impressed with \u201cthe philosophy behind them and how they\u2019ve captured what\u2019s happening in life.\u201dThe Pantone Color Institute is less the elite unit its name implies than a loose network of specialists drawn from Pressman\u2019s contacts. They live in roughly 20 countries and travel the world, she told me, from the established fashion capitals of Europe to other \u201ctrend forward\u201d cities like Shanghai, Buenos Aires, Melbourne and Cape Town, scouring the fashion, technology, houseware, home-furnishing and automotive industries for glimmers of nascent color trends. \u201cI\u2019m very circumspect about who I bring in,\u201d Pressman told me. \u201cThat person has to be of a certain caliber.\u201dI visited Eiseman in July, when she was teaching her annual class on trend forecasting and color psychology at the Bainbridge Island Museum of Art, and she allowed me to sit in. When I met her at the museum, Eiseman, with her thick-framed glasses, jewelry and bobbed, sandy blond hair, bore more than a passing resemblance to Anna Wintour. Her long-sleeved shirt and patterned pants, precisely coordinated, offered an eye-catching blend of oranges, greens and blues, as if she meant her attire to double as a kind of couture business card.I sat in the back row of a classroom on the museum\u2019s second floor and watched her students file in. There were two dozen of them, most in their 20s or 30s, all but one of them women. Rami Kim, the founder of a color institute in Seoul who was on her third pilgrimage to Bainbridge, had brought along seven other South Koreans. Sitting to my right was a former nurse from South Africa, now an interior designer, who said she was hoping to learn more about color combinations, and to my left, a young woman who worked for a small family-owned party-supply company, who told me she was interested in the application of color to edible paper. The lone man in the class was a software engineer contemplating a change of careers to something \u201cmore creative.\u201d All the students paid $1,775 for the privilege of being there, and several of them spoke of their instructor with a respect bordering on reverence. \u201cThere\u2019s no one who can talk about color like she can,\u201d one of them told me.Promptly at 8 a.m., Eiseman switched off the lights and asked a student to close the blinds. \u201cThe colors will be more vibrant if we get more darkness,\u201d she said. For the next six hours, clicking through illustrative photographs from her travels to more than 60 countries, Eiseman delivered a cascade of assertions: Kids everywhere in the world gravitate to red, blue and yellow crayons; people living near the Equator tend to prefer brighter colors; readers have better recall if texts are printed in something other than black and white; gamblers place higher bets under red lights than under blue ones; there was no word for the color \u201corange\u201d in Europe until the fruit arrived sometime in the Middle Ages; blue shutters in the American southwest are meant to ward off evil spirits; many fire departments have begun painting their engines yellow-green because red, the traditional color, too often appears brown in twilight. At one point, when Eiseman paused to take questions, a young woman raised her hand.\u201cAre there people you can\u2019t teach color to, people who just don\u2019t get it?\u201d she asked.Eiseman thought for a moment, and said, \u201cYou get resistance from people when you\u2019re working, people who think that color is immaterial, not as important as everything else, but you can usually find something to talk about in their background, mostly coming out of their childhood, that will trigger a response.\u201dThe idea that colors exert powerful, often subliminal forces on the human mind is at once Eiseman\u2019s ardent belief and her professional stock in trade. As she wrote 18 years ago in \u201cPantone Guide to Communicating With Color,\u201d \u201csome experts believe that humans have an \u2018ancient wisdom,\u2019 that throughout eons of evolutionary history going back to the beginning of time, we have an associative memory concerning space, form, patterns and colors.\u201d Leveraging that wisdom and revealing the unspoken meanings and emotions conveyed by slight, almost imperceptible variations in color has been her life\u2019s work.Eiseman was born and raised in Baltimore. As a teenager, she dabbled in modeling and won a voice scholarship to the Peabody Institute, but turned it down after deciding against pursuing a career in music. A few years later she met Herb Eiseman, her future husband, a Hollywood talent agent who went on to lead the music publishing division at 20th Century Fox. The couple married and moved to the Los Angeles area, where Eiseman finished her bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology at Antioch University and, afterward, earned a counseling certificate from U.C.L.A. She and Herb had two children, and while they were in school, Eiseman began teaching classes part time at an occupational-training center for women in the San Fernando Valley.It was there that she began thinking systematically about color. \u201cThe concept that I developed was called the \u2018color clock,\u2019 and it was based on color as it appears in nature,\u201d she told me. \u201cHow Monet painted the haystacks, various things at various times of day, and how the color seemed to change because of the light.\u201d She applied the idea to women\u2019s clothes and cosmetics, \u201cusing my students as guinea pigs to see if it really held weight.\u201dIn 1983, she published a book called \u201cAlive With Color.\u201d Soon, she was fielding phone calls asking her to weigh in on the color of everything from living rooms to medical equipment. One caller was Pantone\u2019s Larry Herbert, who invited her to meet with him in New York. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know Pantone existed,\u201d she said. It turned out that Herbert, who\u2019d seen her book, was on the hunt for someone with expertise in the psychology of color, in part to help elevate his company\u2019s public profile. Eiseman jumped at the chance, and 33 years later, she\u2019s still Pantone\u2019s ambassador at large.Eiseman believes that our reaction to colors \u201cgoes beyond the psychological into the physiological\u201d and that colors carry inherent messages that all humans innately understand \u2014 the whispers of that \u201cancient wisdom.\u201d She doesn\u2019t deny the important influence of memory and social factors on color perception, but often, she says, \u201cour response is involuntary, and we simply have no control over it.\u201d As evidence, she points to word-association tests she has administered over the years during her work with Pantone. I asked to see a sample test and some results, but Eiseman refused and said they were proprietary. You can get a feel for her methods, though, from a 2015 interview she gave to Nautilus magazine. \u201cYou take a Pantone color chip and you ask, \u2018Give us the first word that pops into your mind when you look at this color,\u2019 and you see whether that corresponds to a positive, negative or indifferent response,\u201d Eiseman said. \u201cIf you show people a chip of Pantone Sky Blue, about 90 percent or more will respond in the same way: It\u2019s the color of the sky, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s a light color, it reminds you of that openness. It\u2019s a near-universal response that you get.\u201dYep, that\u2019s me down to the ground, I thought as I read it. But what about people who don\u2019t like blue? \u201cPerhaps you want to change your job, a relationship or even your life, and long for more excitement,\u201d Eiseman writes. \u201cYou wish that you were wealthy or brilliant (or both), because that would enable you to have all the good things in life without working so hard.\u201dAll that from a color? And the fortunetelling continues. Do you like green? \u201cYou are the good citizen, concerned parent, involved neighbor, the joiner of clubs and organizations.\u201d Have an aversion to red? You may be \u201cirritable, exhausted or bothered by many problems.\u201d Yellow? \u201cYou are optimistic, hopeful and encourage others to do their best.\u201d Perhaps strangest of all, though, is Eiseman\u2019s observation about those of us who dislike blue-green shades like turquoise or teal: \u201cA little voice inside you (was it your mother, your father or your roommate?) keeps telling you to clean up your room.\u201dThe flip tone of these pronouncements, combined with the lack of any grounding in scientific rigor or research apart from Eiseman\u2019s own observations, may tempt you to dismiss color psychology altogether, consigning it to the bin with other junk sciences, like phrenology or cold fusion. But a great many people take it seriously \u2014 so many, in fact, that for all my searching, I found only one person willing to question it. When I put Eiseman\u2019s assertions to David Comberg, a senior lecturer of design at the University of Pennsylvania, he scoffed and said that color preferences are highly subjective, unpredictable and, in his experience, \u201cprimarily influenced by culture and emotion and are not easily quantified.\u201d When we see red, for instance, are we reacting to the color itself or to a personal experience, perhaps buried in the subconscious, that we associate with it? \u201cAnd what about taste, smell and sound? Artificial intelligence and neuroscience may one day answer all this, but I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Comberg said. \u201cIt all seems subjective and irrational.\u201dBut among people in Eiseman\u2019s profession, as with the hordes of credulous color enthusiasts who populate the internet, her views are not only uncontroversial but well within the mainstream. \u201cWe are born to understand that green equals calming, because it\u2019s found in nature; red equals danger, because it\u2019s the color of blood,\u201d Jenny Ross, a creative- design manager in the footwear department at New Balance, told me. \u201cYellow equals energy, because it\u2019s the color of the sun.\u201d WGSN\u2019s Jane Monnington Boddy agreed, saying, \u201cPeople do have an inbuilt, preprogrammed understanding of colors, as animals do in nature.\u201d What else explains our instinct to recoil from red-and-black snakes, she asked, or from yellow-and-black flying insects?Ultimately, though, whether blue makes you think of the sky or Papa Smurf, by this point, color psychology may matter less to Pantone\u2019s success than something much less mysterious. \u201cHow do you sell color?\u201d David Shah had asked me rhetorically when I met him in London. \u201cYou can be 10 times cleverer than me. You can be much more intelligent, much more creative. But it\u2019s Pantone, with a million Instagram followers. If you\u2019re hidden away, even though your color is better, you don\u2019t win the argument.\u201dAt a certain point, Pantone\u2019s prognostications began to take on the weight of self-fulfilling prophecies. Much like investors who base financial decisions on the assessments of Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s, Pantone\u2019s clientele seems to understand that, for all the time and effort the company expends in identifying color trends, it\u2019s the judgments themselves, regardless of the research behind them, that matter most. \u201cBecause of our platform, we\u2019re able to promote,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s self-perpetuating \u2014 when people believe you\u2019re right, they buy you. You get to be right!\u201dWhen I brought up the Color of the Year, Shah trod carefully at first \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything about what I think about this, O.K.?\u201d \u2014 then went on: \u201cYou might go: \u2018Oh, my God! That\u2019s the most awful color in the world! Who would choose it?\u2019 And then you\u2019re like, \u2018I better be careful, because it\u2019s the Pantone Color of the Year, and everybody\u2019s looking at it, and if I don\u2019t, I could be left out.\u2019 When you\u2019ve got a platform like that, you can say it\u2019s the color of my toenails! Can I afford not to do it, even if I don\u2019t believe in it? It\u2019s a lot of smoke and mirrors.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the ownership of Pantone.

{"Headline": "Notes on European Recovery (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere in the English-speaking world, most of us in the econo-pundit business have been focusing a lot on the US economy post-Trump, and secondarily on the British economy post-Brexit. But once in a while we ought to look further afield. And there\u2019s a pretty big story that isn\u2019t getting much play in the US, at least: the significant recovery finally taking place in Europe.For years, the euro area drastically lagged the United States: where America began a sustained recovery in late 2009, Europe, buffeted by debt crises and the problems of misaligned costs among member nations, continued to suffer into 2013. Germany, of course, did well throughout \u2013 largely because its economy was supported by huge trade surpluses, largely at its neighbors\u2019 expense.Since 2013, however, we\u2019ve seen significant growth in Europe, with the fastest growth occurring in the areas (other than Greece) that were hardest hit by the euro crisis, especially Spain:So what turned around in Europe? One important answer was three words from Mario Draghi: \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d. The ECB\u2019s promise to buy government bonds if necessary almost instantly ended a panic in southern European bond markets, drastically narrowing the spread against Germany and setting the stage for growth:The other thing that happened was internal devaluation \u2013 that is, relative deflation by countries that had been left overvalued by massive capital inflows and inflation during the pre-crisis years. Spain, in particular, gradually squeezed down its labor costs relative to the euro area as a whole:This has in turn fueled a big export boom, especially in autos.So is all well that ends well? No. Southern Europe paid a terrible price during the crisis years. The fact that internal devaluation eventually works, after years of high unemployment, is neither a surprise nor a vindication of the huge suffering during the interim. If there was a surprise, it was political: the willingness of political elites to pay this price rather than break with the euro.Still, it\u2019s important to be aware that Europe 2018 looks very different from Europe 2013. For now, at least, Europe is back as a functioning economic system.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran, Deeply Embedded in Syria, Expands \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTactical advisers from Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps are deployed at military bases across Syria. Its commanders regularly show up at the front lines to lead battles. Iran has built and continues to back powerful militias with thousands of fighters it has trained in Syria. And it has brought in new technologies, like drones, to spy on enemies and perhaps to attack them from the sky.Both Israeli officials and Israel\u2019s enemies say that any new conflict between Israel and Iran, or any of its allies, could mobilize Iran\u2019s expanding network of militant proxies in multiple countries, what Iran refers to as \u201cthe axis of resistance.\u201d\u201cIf there is a war, it will be regional,\u201d said Kamel Wazne, the founder of the Center for American Strategic Studies, in Beirut, who studies the policies of the United States and Iran in the Middle East. \u201cAny confrontation will be with the whole resistance front against Israel and its backers.\u201dIran and its allies first intervened in Syria to defend the rule of President Bashar al-Assad against Syrian rebels after the civil war broke out in 2011, and later helped his forces against the jihadists of the Islamic State.\u201cThe ultimate goal is, in the case of another war, to make Syria a new front between Israel, Hezbollah and Iran,\u201d said Amir Toumaj, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who studies Iran. \u201cThey are making that not just a goal, but a reality.\u201dIranian leaders speak openly of their work to build this axis of resistance against Israeli and American influence. A key to Iran\u2019s strategy, analysts and officials say, is to rely not on conventional military hardware or control of territory, which Israel can easily bomb, but on building ties with local forces who share its goals and benefit from its financing and expertise.That approach has enabled Iran to amplify its power in the Arab world while decreasing the threat to its own forces and homeland. It has also created a problem for countries including the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia, who fear Iran\u2019s growing influence but have struggled to come up with ways to stop it.Some people in Israel have started referring to a potential \u201cFirst Northern War,\u201d meaning that Israel will have to fight across both the Lebanese and Syrian frontiers. And many Israelis say the danger is not just from the new Iranian-backed militias, but also from the Iranian efforts to give advanced, high-precision weapons capable of hitting sensitive infrastructure to Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s most powerful and experienced external force.Israeli officials have said that Iran and its allies are seeking to establish a land corridor from Iran to the Mediterranean, via Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, to ease the transportation of such weapons and to build underground factories to manufacture them in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has been bombing convoys in Syria that are believed to be carrying advanced arms to Hezbollah, but the group\u2019s covert nature makes it hard to determine which arms have slipped through and whether its arms factories are functioning.Such arms, coupled with heavy barrages from the more than 100,000 rockets and missiles without high-precision targeting capability that Israel says Hezbollah already has, could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses.\u201cIsrael will face not only quantity, but the threat to vulnerable strategic sites,\u201d said Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and now a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies. Referring to the combination of more precise weapons and a new front, he added: \u201cEach one is problematic; together, they are devastating.\u201dIran\u2019s moves in the region have alarmed the United States. \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly concerning is that this network of proxies is becoming more and more capable as Iran seeds more and more\u201d of its \u201cdestructive weapons into these networks,\u201d Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said at a security conference in Munich on Saturday. \u201cSo the time is now, we think, to act against Iran,\u201d General McMaster added.The war in Syria gave Iran a new opportunity to advance that project by linking its allies across the Levant together.Fighters from Hezbollah routed Syrian rebels near the Lebanese border and Iran sent advisers to help Mr. Assad\u2019s beleaguered forces during the early years of the war.But by 2013, Mr. Assad\u2019s forces were on the verge of collapse, and Iran intervened more forcefully, undertaking an extensive regional operation to train, arm and transport thousands of Shiite militiamen from abroad to Syria to fight the rebels and the jihadists of the Islamic State.Estimates of the number of Iranian military personnel in Syria today range from the high hundreds to the low thousands. While some directly participate in combat, most are trainers, commanders or experts who advise the Syrian military and oversee militias. It is these militias, which could have as many as 20,000 fighters, that give Iran its true muscle.Those fighters include about 6,000 from Hezbollah. Most of the rest of the militia members \u2014 who come from Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan and elsewhere \u2014 have been enticed to fight in Syria with money and appeals to their Shiite faith. Indeed, most see the war in Syria in religious terms, as a jihad against enemies of their religion.Ali Alfoneh, a researcher at the Atlantic Council who tracks reports of foreign militia fighters killed in Syria, said the number of deaths reported had decreased substantially as those fighting for Mr. Assad have gotten the upper hand in the war. But instead of leaving the country, he said, the militias appeared to be shifting their sights toward Israel.\u201cIran has realized that it is actually possible to maintain a front against Israel where there is no war but also no peace,\u201d Mr. Alfoneh said.In his research, Mr. Alfoneh said he had identified three main Iranian bases that oversee operations in large parts of Syria \u2014 one near Aleppo in the north and two south of the capital, Damascus \u2014 as well as seven smaller tactical bases near active front lines where Iran and its proxies have a presence.The idea of a permanent Iranian presence in Syria worries Israel, which fears that it could face a threat there similar to that posed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysts close to Iran and its proxies say that is exactly the idea.\u201cIt\u2019s like a replication of the Hezbollah model,\u201d said Ali Rizk, a Lebanese analyst who writes for Al Monitor, a news website focused on the Middle East. Iran is already training fighters in southern Syria, he said, so that if Hezbollah draws down its presence there, as its leaders have vowed to, it will leave behind a Syrian prototype.In recent months, at least two Iraqi militia leaders have visited the Lebanon-Israel border with Hezbollah, and militia members say the visits have included developing plans for how they might collaborate in a future conflict.Both sides say they do not want war, and the fear of extensive destruction and civilian deaths has deterred new hostilities since the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. But the more entrenched Iran\u2019s allies become, the greater the pressure Israeli leaders could face to launch a strike \u2014 and the greater the chances that a miscalculation or mistake by either side could provoke new hostilities.Some analysts have expressed hopes that Russia, which also intervened in Syria on Mr. Assad\u2019s behalf, could serve as a check on Iran\u2019s ambitions. Russia has cooperated with Iran during the war but also seeks to maintain good relations with Israel.Notably, Russia has not publicly complained when Israel has bombed convoys believed to be bound for Hezbollah. Others question to what degree the Syrian population will buy into Iran\u2019s ideological project, noting that only a tiny portion of Syrians share Iran\u2019s Shiite faith.Much remains unclear about Iran\u2019s intentions. Days after Israel destroyed the drone, Israeli military officials said they were still not sure whether it had been armed, had been sent on a surveillance mission or was merely a test of Israel\u2019s defenses.\u201cIt is very important for us to understand its mission,\u201d Brig. Gen. Tomer Bar, the chief of staff of the Israeli Air Force, told reporters. \u201cWe have to understand it and we will investigate it till the end.\u201dBen Hubbard and Anne Barnard reported from Beirut, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberals Wanted Fiscal Stimulus. Conservatives Delivered It.", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeft-leaning economists hate the timing and the composition. But the expansionary fiscal policy they sought is on the way.For years, many liberal economists have argued that a little more federal spending and a higher budget deficit would create a stronger economy.Now, they\u2019re getting their wish, or at least a fun-house mirror version of it. All it took was total Republican control of the government. The fiscal austerity that drove the budget deficit from around 9 percent of G.D.P. in 2010 to 3 percent in 2016 has, for practical purposes, been abandoned. First, Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax bill in December that sharply cut rates on businesses. Then last week they made a deal to undo budget caps demanded by the Republican House in 2011. President Trump signed that bill on Friday. This sudden reversal has the economists who have long argued we should run the economy a little hot \u2014 that is, stimulate it using the government\u2019s power to tax and spend \u2014 in something of a quandary.\u201cIt\u2019s a very weird and conflicted feeling,\u201d said Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who worked in the Obama White House. \u201cOn some level I should be happy, and I am sort of happy right now, but with some nontrivial caveats.\u201dHe and others in this boat don\u2019t at all like the composition of this particular easing of fiscal policy. It is focused on tax cuts for businesses, rather than on investment in roads and bridges or worker training. The latter would be the kinds of steps more likely to have long-term payoffs and to benefit working-class Americans, they believe. (A big chunk of the additional spending will go toward the military.)Liberal skeptics of this new age of anti-austerity also don\u2019t like the timing. Mr. Bernstein, no one\u2019s idea of a deficit hawk, notes that never in its modern history has the United States run deficits as large as those now on the horizon while the unemployment rate was as low as it is now. That creates the risk that the government will have less capacity to respond to future recessions.But those misgivings aside, this mix of budget-busting policies will provide the best test in years of some ideas that have percolated among economists, especially but not exclusively on the left. The former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, originally a George W. Bush nominee, spent years imploring Congress to spend more money in the near term to try to boost growth, to little avail.The case for a more expansionary fiscal policy varies depending on the individual, but arguments have included:For example, Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and former adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, has been a leading advocate of the idea that \u201csecular stagnation\u201d has taken hold. The idea is that the economy is in a self-reinforcing pattern of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates, and that overreliance on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies to try to spur growth has fueled financial bubbles. He argues now that the policies that the Trump administration and Congress have reached, while directionally the same as those he advocates, won\u2019t get the job done and carry risks.\u201cYes, I have favored more expansionary fiscal policy, and this is more expansionary fiscal policy,\u201d Mr. Summers said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the wrong kind of expansionary fiscal policy, and it\u2019s at the wrong time, at the rare moment when fiscal policy is likely to be almost entirely crowded out.\u201dExpect to hear that term, \u201ccrowded out,\u201d frequently in the economic debates of the years ahead.The decline in stock markets since Jan. 26, and the rise in Treasury bond yields, suggests investors are becoming wary of that happening in the coming years.Advocates of fiscal stimulus during the 2008 recession and the slow recovery argued that crowding out wasn\u2019t a valid fear during that time. Vast economic resources, including workers and machines, were sitting on the sidelines, so the government had room to stimulate without causing a rise in interest rates.A common refrain \u2014 and the baseline for negotiations between the Obama administration and Republicans in the House \u2014 was that any short-term boost to spending had to be accompanied by longer-term deficit reduction. It was on those terms, for example, that stiff budget cuts known as \u201csequestration\u201d were partly reversed \u2014 with offsets to avoid raising the deficit over the ensuing decade.\u201cRepublicans were very tough about that,\u201d said Jason Furman, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers until President Trump took office and is now at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. Now, a Republican Congress is agreeing to raise spending beyond those sequestration limits without other cuts to offset the increases. \u201cThis is very frustrating because it feels like one group of people are living by the rules, while another group is not living by the rules of economics or arithmetic.\u201dThe frustration of facing resistance to more expansionary fiscal policy during a period of high unemployment wasn\u2019t confined to liberals. As Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke urged Congress to pair a higher short-term fiscal boost with long-term deficit reduction.Still, even if it isn\u2019t designed as the stimulus that advocates would prefer, and even if its timing is the direct opposite of what Keynesian economics might recommend, this may be the best test of some of the theories on expansionary fiscal policy that will come along.

{"Headline": "Where Did Your Pay Raise Go? It May Have Become a Bonus", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA growing preference among employers for one-time awards instead of raises that keep building over time has been quietly transforming the employment landscape for two decades. But it was accelerated by the recession\u2019s intensity, which made employers especially cautious about increasing labor costs.The stream of companies announcing bonuses for their employees in the wake of the newly minted tax cuts is just the latest expression of the trend.There has been \u201ca continuing dramatic shift in the mix of compensation,\u201d Aon Hewitt, the human resources consulting firm, noted last summer in its latest annual survey of company pay practices.In 1991, for example, spending on temporary rewards and bonuses for salaried employees, known as variable pay, accounted for an average of 3.1 percent of total compensation budgets, while salary increases amounted to 5 percent.In 2017, one-time payments consumed 12.7 percent to those budgets; raises amounted to just 2.9 percent.\u201cPressure to increase productivity and minimize costs,\u201d the report concluded, had pushed employers to forgo raises and rely more on short-term awards \u201cas the primary means of rewarding for performance.\u201dOrdinarily, the jobless rate and wage growth are like two ends of a seesaw: When one drops, the other is supposed to rise. But that link seems broken, and like film-noir detectives, analysts have scrutinized hard-edge statistics and fuzzier psychological indicators for clues about why.In the recession that began a decade ago, the businesses most likely to survive tended to be the most conservative spenders, said Douglas G. Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae. That approach was rewarded and has now been reinforced, he said, helping to restrain the growth of full-time work forces and salaries.Aon Hewitt\u2019s annual surveys seem to bear that out. The practice of spending more on variable pay than on permanent raises took root in the 1990s, when growing competition from abroad increased pressure on companies to keep a lid on prices and production costs.Pay-for-performance and other bonuses increasingly functioned as a release valve. Companies could offer more money to attract talent or when profits were strong, and pull back when business was slow.After the recession, the trend accelerated.\u201cThe response in 2009 was unlike any prior response to a recession or depression in that organizations actually reduced salaries, they didn\u2019t just freeze them as a means of allegedly avoiding greater layoffs,\u201d said Ken Abosch, a partner at Aon Hewitt. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lesson learned from that.\u201d That lesson: Stay nimble.The tax overhaul has prompted hundreds of employers, including at least 40 members of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, to pass on savings to workers.The recessionary hangover encouraged employers to avoid adding fixed costs and to be as flexible as possible in staffing and compensation. The trend toward outsourcing work that was once handled in house as a way of saving money fits in with that story line.The percentage spent on salary increases never returned to its pre-2009 levels, the Aon Hewitt surveys show, while the percentage spent on bonuses and other short-term rewards climbed to new levels. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll see a long-term increase in real wage growth,\u201d Mr. Abosch said.Most bonuses still come in traditional forms: payoffs for executive-suite occupants and deal hunters, or sweeteners for newly hired employees. Certain industries, like finance and insurance, with their longer tradition of year-end and performance-based rewards, continue to have much bigger bonus budgets than sectors like retail.But the practice has expanded. In 1991, fewer than half of companies that Aon Hewitt surveyed had a broad-based rewards program. Last year, 88 percent did.\u201cIt\u2019s now widespread across all industry sectors, even some that were holdbacks such as utilities, health care, not-for-profits and government,\u201d Mr. Abosch said.Salaried workers, rather than hourly wage earners, remain much more likely to be the recipients of such extra payments.If given a choice, most workers would take a raise. When Aon Hewitt asked 2,079 American workers in a second, newly completed survey what they would like to see their employers do with their tax-cut windfall, 65 percent chose a pay raise \u2014 twice as many as any other option, including a bonus or a 401(k) contribution.\u201cIt was appreciated, but it doesn\u2019t fix the long term,\u201d Ms. Gower said of the bonus. \u201cWe need a livable wage that we can support our families off.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTNoam Scheiber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Built in 2006, it is part of a small gated development of 16 homes called Quintas do Coqueiral.The 4,300-square-foot house sits on about 1.2 acres covered in palm trees and grass. Visitors enter through two large wood doors, framed by pillars. The double-height foyer opens to a living room and covered patio. There is a pool and Jacuzzi in the back yard, with a wooden deck.The floors on the ground level are white marble concrete, a form of concrete with sand and marble grains mixed in, said Mike Smith, owner of Brazil Beach House, the company marketing the property. The doors and windows are trimmed in Brazilian hardwood, and the exposed beams and pillars are eucalyptus, Mr. Smith said.From the foyer, stairs lead to a mezzanine level currently being used as an office. There is an open-air deck off the mezzanine.All the bedrooms are on the ground floor. In one wing, there are two large bedrooms, each with a walk-in closet; the master has sliding glass doors that open to the pool deck. Two smaller bedrooms are in the other wing. All the bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms with marble counters.A dining room, television room and another bathroom are also on the ground floor. The kitchen is off the dining room, overlooking the pool area, and has two refrigerators, an electric drinking fountain and a six-burner stove.The maid\u2019s quarters, adjacent to the kitchen, include a bedroom, a bathroom and a small attached garage, large enough for a single car. There is also a detached two-car garage on the property.The furniture is not included in the asking price, but is available for an additional 100,000 Brazilian real (or about $31,000), Mr. Smith said.The property is about a half mile from the village of Maracaja\u00fa, a popular spot for diving. Natal, about a 45-minute drive from the house, is the capital of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, with a population of about 850,000. The closest airport is the Governador Alu\u00edzio Alves International Airport in S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Amarante, about 25 miles away, but most international flights are routed through Rio de Janeiro or S\u00e3o Paulo.MARKET OVERVIEWIn recent years, \u201csupply exceeded demand considerably,\u201d said Andreas Hahn, a senior partner with Hahn Consulting, in S\u00e3o Paulo. But lower prices and an improving economy are bringing buyers back to the market, he said. And Brazil\u2019s economy is expected to grow 1.9 percent in 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund.\u201cFor the first time in several years, the Brazilian real estate economy is returning to an equilibrium state,\u201d with supply and demand in better balance, Mr. Hahn said.Sales in the middle-price range were hardest hit by the downturn, said Marcello Romero, chief executive of Bossa Nova Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, in S\u00e3o Paulo. The lower end of the market was boosted by government subsidies, he added, while the high end was less affected.\u201cWe think that the worst moment is over,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cEspecially in the major cities, most of the developers are preparing their launches soon.\u201dAlthough there is no official data available on sales in the Natal area, agents said prices have fallen between 10 and 20 percent in the last three years.\u201cThe northeast is more of a holiday marketplace,\u201d said Steve Gallagher, owner of Brazil Overseas Property, and was therefore more vulnerable when the economy slowed. \u201cPolitical uncertainty,\u201d he said, also plays a major role in the market, as potential buyers await the results of the presidential elections later this year.\u201cI expect confidence to grow within the market at the beginning of 2019,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said. \u201cAnd we should see property prices increasing steadily from then on.\u201dThere are already signs the market is picking up, Mr. Smith said. \u201cThe last quarter of 2017 saw the first signs of growth.\u201dIn the Natal area, he added, homes in gated communities priced between $150,000 and $600,000 are the most popular with foreign buyers.WHO BUYS IN NATALThe northeastern coast primarily attracts \u201cnew buyers, mover-uppers and second-home buyers,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said.And foreigners make up about 25 to 30 percent of the buyers on the coast, said Mr. Smith, who primarily works with foreign prospects. Of his clientele, about 20 percent are from Portugal, he said, with buyers from Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada each making up about 10 percent of his business.International buyers represent about 10 percent of the Brazilian real estate market over all, Mr. Hahn said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Brazil, except in rural or border areas, said Juliano Ribeiro Lomonte, a real estate lawyer based in Natal. But foreigners do need to obtain a tax registration number, known as a CPF, to buy property.Buyers typically make a 20 percent down payment, and the final deed is signed in front of a notary. \u201cThe whole process normally takes between 30 to 60 days,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The transaction is straightforward, but buyers should hire a lawyer to oversee the process, agents said. \u201cA lot of times sellers don\u2019t know about the taxes or restrictions on the land,\u201d Mr. Lomonte said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESPortuguese; Brazilian real (1 real = $.31)TAXES AND FEESThere is local transfer tax of 3 percent on this property, and notary fees are usually about 2.5 to 3 percent of the sale price, Mr. Smith said. A lawyer might charge $2,000 to $5,000, he said, depending on the property and the lawyer.Agents\u2019 fees are usually about 6 percent of the sale price, Mr. Gallagher said, but they are paid by the seller.The annual property taxes on this home are 2,000 Brazilian real (or about $615), and there is a homeowners\u2019 association fee of 1,300 real (or $400) a month, Mr. Smith said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boom and Gloom: An Economic Warning for California", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo why is its longtime governor, Jerry Brown, issuing prophecies of doom?California has accounted for about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s economic growth since 2010, significantly more than its share of the population or overall output. But Mr. Brown, in his final year in office, has raised the question on the minds of those paid to think about the economy: How long can this last?For California and the nation, there is a long list of things that could go wrong. A surging budget deficit could stoke higher interest rates. And if the recent upheaval in stocks signals a longer-term decline, it would hurt California in particular because its budget relies heavily on high earners whose incomes rise and fall with the market. President Trump\u2019s moves to upend longstanding trade arrangements could be a setback for the state, home of the country\u2019s biggest port complex. And because the growth of the technology industry has played a huge role in California\u2019s recent boom, a drop in company valuations or in venture capital investments would reverberate swiftly through the state\u2019s economy and tax receipts.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to believe we are going to have a recession this year or the next year,\u201d said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm in Los Angeles, referring to Mr. Brown\u2019s grim forecast. \u201cHe\u2019s just pointing out the obvious, which is that things feel good now but there is going to come a time when all hell is going to break loose \u2014 and we better be ready for it.\u201dMr. Brown\u2019s statements highlight California\u2019s distinction as a state of high highs and low lows. From the recession of the early 1990s to the 2001 dot-com crash to the housing collapse of a decade ago, downturns often end up being more pronounced in the state than elsewhere. The next recession, whenever it comes, will almost certainly land harder here than it does in the rest of the country. And that boom-bust pattern is especially tough on California\u2019s budget \u2014 something that Mr. Brown, who was first elected governor more than four decades ago, knows well.In 2009, as the last recession took hold, California state revenue fell 19 percent, versus 8 percent for state revenues nationwide, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. There has been a strong rebound since then, but the gains are unlikely to last. That is because California\u2019s government relies on a heavily progressive income tax that generates most of its revenue from a relatively small number of wealthy taxpayers whose incomes are erratic.\u201cHis successor gets a world in which revenues are more volatile,\u201d without the option of raising taxes, said David Crane, a lecturer in public policy at Stanford University and a former adviser to Mr. Brown\u2019s predecessor, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. \u201cThat\u2019s a really tough world to operate in.\u201dA recession would also further expose problems that have festered for decades. Across California, cities and school districts are having trouble keeping up with ballooning pension obligations, squeezing teacher salaries and state services. In warning about budget troubles to come, Mr. Brown was making a case for adding more of today\u2019s surplus to the state\u2019s rainy day fund to cushion the blow of the next downturn.Still, economists generally agree that the state\u2019s long-term prospects are bright. It is home to many of the world\u2019s most valuable and innovative companies, and it attracts an outsize portion of the skilled work force and venture capital financing, helping it create new industries as old ones slow down or fade away.And recession forecasting is a tough business even for those whose livelihoods depend on it, like Ed Del Beccaro, a senior managing director in the Walnut Creek office of Transwestern, a commercial real estate brokerage. He manages a team of brokers and travels around the Bay Area giving speeches and forecasts to chambers of commerce and other business groups.\u201cTwo years ago I was predicting a recession in September of 2017, and in October I said we were going to have a recession at the end of 2018,\u201d he said. \u201cToday I think that unless we get bombed by North Korea, we will have a pretty amazing two years of growth.\u201dWith a sudden spurt in demand for office space, Mr. Del Beccaro said, he is hiring new workers and spending more on marketing to prospective clients. \u201cI was just authorized to go out and get more brokers and offer them incentives to hopefully get them to switch over from other companies,\u201d he said.But winter will come eventually, and when it does, Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel about planning ahead may help shape how California weathers it.Advertisement"}

In his fascinating new book, \u201cThe Wizard and the Prophet,\u201d Charles C. Mann notes that President Roosevelt \u2014 Teddy, not Franklin \u2014 called the \u201cimminent exhaustion\u201d of fossil fuels and other natural resources \u201cthe weightiest problem now before the nation.\u201d Prior to that, Mann adds, there were expert forecasts that the world would soon run out of coal. Later on, the world became fixated on the fear of running out of food in the face of explosive population growth.The wizard and the prophet of Mann\u2019s title are, respectively, Norman Borlaug and William Vogt, the former the agronomist widely credited as the father of the Green Revolution, the latter the founder of what Hampshire College\u2019s Betsy Hartmann calls \u201capocalyptic environmentalism.\u201d\u201cIn best-selling books and powerful speeches, Vogt argued that affluence is not our greatest achievement but our biggest problem,\u201d Mann writes. \u201cOur prosperity is temporary, he said, because it is based on taking more from than earth than it can give. If we continue, the unavoidable result will be devastation on a global scale, perhaps including our extinction.\u201dBorlaug and the Borlaugians take a different view. It\u2019s not that they see environmental threats as bogus: The world really would have suffered catastrophic famines if Borlaug hadn\u2019t developed high-yield, disease-resistant varieties of wheat. Oil is a finite resource, but whether reserves last 50 or 500 years will probably depend less on overall supply than on technologies to extract and use those reserves more efficiently.I fall in the Borlaugian camp. That\u2019s worth noting because one of the more tedious criticisms by the environmental left is that people like me \u201cdon\u2019t care about the environment.\u201d But imputing bad faith, stupidity or greed is always a lousy argument. Even conservatives want their children to breathe.It also misses the point. As Mann notes, Borlaugians are environmentalists, too. They simply think the road to salvation lies not through making do with less, but rather through innovation and the conditions in which innovation tends to flourish, greater affluence and individual freedom most of all.If environmental alarmists ever wonder why more people haven\u2019t come around to their way of thinking, it isn\u2019t because people like me occasionally voice doubts in newspaper op-eds. It\u2019s because too many past predictions of imminent disaster didn\u2019t come to pass. That isn\u2019t because every alarm is false \u2014 many are all too real \u2014 but because our Promethean species has shown the will and the wizardry to master the challenge, at least when it\u2019s been given the means to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anbang Takeover Sends Blunt Message: China Wants to Fix Its Debt Problem", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s top leader has a message for his country\u2019s biggest deal makers that could reverberate across the world: Get your debt under control \u2014 or else.For years, Beijing encouraged big Chinese companies to invest overseas, spreading the country\u2019s wealth and influence beyond its borders. The money transformed global markets and industries.Now, the government wants to rein them in, worried that the debt-fueled spending spree could curtail the country\u2019s growth. A concern is that the companies\u2019 big borrowing binge could weigh on the country\u2019s financial system.The action against Anbang shows China\u2019s companies, banks and other pillars of the country\u2019s economy that President Xi Jinping has embraced financial stability and is serious about curbing China\u2019s addiction to debt. As part of the move, the government also charged Wu Xiaohui, Anbang\u2019s high-flying and politically connected former chairman, with engaging in fraudulent fund-raising and taking company assets.\u201cAll of the animals have now witnessed Wu\u2019s pyre,\u201d said Brock Silvers, the chief executive of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai investment advisory firm, \u201cand everyone in the zoo now understands the message.\u201dBy moving aggressively and publicly, China\u2019s government may give regulators in other countries new reasons to question the political connections and financial backing of Chinese companies hoping to make overseas deals, lest Beijing emerge as an unwelcome new landlord should times get tough. Authorities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have already been ramping up their scrutiny of Chinese deals.Any slackening in the pace of buying could cool deal making and disappoint investors who have reaped windfalls thanks to profligate Chinese spenders.In recent years, Chinese money has helped drive up the prices of real estate, oil fields, hotels and just about any other asset that big companies buy and sell. The purchases have included the strategic (global agribusinesses and energy companies) and the prosaic (movie theaters and video games). Anbang\u2019s corporate empire includes major financial firms in South Korea and the Netherlands, as well as properties worth billions of dollars.In a statement, Anbang said it supported the takeover and would remain private, despite government oversight.\u201cOur business and operations are stable,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are confident that this stable operation will continue under the interim management working group and in the long term.\u201dChinese state media and other official channels provided little guidance on Friday about why Beijing had taken over Anbang or what government ownership might mean. Experts said such a drastic step would have required approval at the highest levels of government.Anbang is in some ways a fitting example of what might be called China Inc. Begun as a modest car insurance company in 2004, it used cheap debt and financial engineering \u2014 sometimes borrowing directly from individuals with promises of big returns \u2014 to build a juggernaut in just a few years. Risk may have built Mr. Wu\u2019s empire, but it also led to the company\u2019s downfall.Now, under official pressure, many of the companies \u2014 a group referred to as the \u201cgray rhinoceroses,\u201d big problems that are ignored until they start moving fast \u2014 are unloading assets. Dalian Wanda last year shed billions of dollars worth of property investments. HNA is paring properties amid analysts\u2019 questions about how it will meet its heavy debt obligations.As official skepticism of Anbang grew, so did public skepticism.But many Chinese regulators had been hesitant to act aggressively, and the pace of enforcing discipline had been slow. With Anbang, the Chinese government may have hoped to set an example, by seizing control rather than engineering a quiet injection of cash from a pliant state company.China\u2019s ambitions, though, are likely to attract renewed scrutiny. Regulators in the United States and elsewhere have been asking tough questions about the ownership and stability of acquisitive Chinese companies. Some lawmakers and White House officials support broadening the authority of regulators who review takeover offers.\u201cAnyone who knows anything about China knows the nature of the party and state and the opacity of company ownership,\u201d said Fraser Howie, a former banker in Asia and a co-writer of three books on the Chinese financial system. \u201cThere was never any excuse for not asking the difficult questions. A lot of foreign regulators just skipped over them and were far too relaxed in their approach.\u201dMore than $4 billion worth of deals by Dalian Wanda, HNA and Fosun, including some in China, await approval, according to Dealogic, a data provider.It is not clear what will happen to Anbang\u2019s overseas properties, including the Waldorf Astoria, which is undergoing an expensive renovation. Anbang spent $15 billion on high-profile overseas deals from 2009 to 2017, according to Dealogic. The acquisitions included well-known hotels in London, Manhattan, Mexico and Paris; insurance companies in South Korea and the Netherlands; and even a stake in Woori Bank, once among South Korea\u2019s largest lenders. Woori could not be reached for comment.A Vivat spokeswoman said that \u201cas for now,\u201d the government takeover of Anbang would \u201cnot affect Vivat or its clients.\u201d She added that the insurer was subject to Dutch laws and regulations and monitored by Dutch supervisory authorities.Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley reported from Beijing and Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Jerome Powell Is Sworn In as Federal Reserve Chairman", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell took the reins of the Federal Reserve on Monday with a depleted board and a list of challenges that has suddenly expanded to include a second day of stock market wobbles.Mr. Powell is unlikely to respond to the decline in stock prices unless it worsens dramatically. In remarks after his swearing-in as Fed chairman, he emphasized the health of the economy.The stock market declined 35 percent in the three months after Alan Greenspan became Fed chairman in August 1987, including the \u201cBlack Monday\u201d crash in mid-October. Mr. Greenspan responded by sharply cutting the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate and issuing a public statement declaring that the Fed was ready and willing \u201cto support the economic and financial system.\u201dThe intervention, which reversed the decline, was celebrated at the time, but it contributed to an expectation in financial markets that Mr. Greenspan would not allow stock prices to fall.The current downturn is much smaller. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 6 percent since Thursday. Mr. Powell said on Monday that the economy is in good health. With unemployment low, the Fed is focused on raising its benchmark interest rates to stay ahead of inflation.\u201cPowell could have done without a slump in the U.S. stock market, but unless the slump becomes a rout, he is unlikely to intervene,\u201d wrote John Higgins, an economist at Capital Economics.In addition to Mr. Powell, the members of the board are Randal K. Quarles, the vice chairman for supervision, and Lael Brainard.Mr. Quarles, who oversees financial regulation issues at the Fed, has recused himself from Wells Fargo-related business because he held significant investments in the firm before he joined the Fed last year. That leaves Ms. Brainard, the other member of the committee that oversees supervision, as the Fed\u2019s point person on the Wells case, although Mr. Powell would also participate in significant decisions.Mr. Trump has not announced nominees for the other three seats on the board.The regulators who directly supervise Wells Fargo are employees of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, one of the 12 regional banks that make up the Fed system. Before the 2008 financial crisis, the regional reserve banks exercised significant control over the institutions headquartered in their regions. But in 2010, the Fed centralized the regulation of large banks to improve the consistency of regulation and to take a broad view of issues affecting multiple banks.The judgment about Wells Fargo\u2019s progress will be made by a staff committee, the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, that is led by Michael S. Gibson, the Fed\u2019s director of supervision and regulation, in close consultation with the board of governors.Mr. Powell was sworn into office by Mr. Quarles, a longtime friend. When Mr. Powell worked as a senior Treasury Department official under President George Bush in the early 1990s, he hired Mr. Quarles as an assistant. Later the two men worked together at the Carlyle Group, a private equity investment firm.Mr. Quarles was selected by Mr. Trump as the Fed\u2019s point man for an overhaul of post-crisis financial regulations, which the president views as excessive. Mr. Powell on Monday reiterated his view that the financial system \u201cis now far stronger and more resilient\u201d as a result of increased regulation and \u201cwe intend to keep it that way.\u201d He added that there is room for improvement to make regulation \u201cefficient as well as effective.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Thought Explained: A New Ideology for a New Era", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina has a new official political doctrine.Officially known as \u201cXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,\u201d the ideology will soon be given an even more prominent platform: the preamble of China\u2019s Constitution.Boiled down, the doctrine is a blueprint for consolidating and strengthening power at three levels: the nation, the party and Mr. Xi himself.Since Mr. Xi became chairman of the Communist Party in 2012, he has vowed a \u201cgreat rejuvenation\u201d to restore China to its ancient prominence and glory.In recent decades, China has become the world\u2019s second largest economy and a powerhouse of global trade and investment. Xi Jinping Thought promotes taking the next step, making China not only prosperous but also politically powerful.Mr. Xi\u2019s nationalist message of China as a strong, highly respected world power resonates with many Chinese.But the promise of national glory comes with a catch: single-party rule.Xi Jinping Thought promotes the supremacy of the Communist Party to growing numbers of avid consumers, internet users and world travelers \u2014 a group fundamentally different from the workers and peasants who were supposed to be the soul of the Communist Revolution.Mr. Xi\u2019s philosophy teaches that the goal of a powerful, unified China can be achieved only if the Communist Party stays firmly in control of China. The party, he says, is the solution to China\u2019s problems, not their source.Harping on the importance of one-party rule is not new in China. But Mr. Xi has taken aggressive steps to revitalize the Communist Party\u2019s grip on business, the news media, the internet, culture and education. The influence of party permeates every corner of society \u2014 even rap music.Official news media routinely point to the corruption and failings they see in Western democracies. \u201cWhy question the Communist Party when the alternative is chaos and corruption?\u201d goes the message.The third piece of Xi Jinping Thought is Mr. Xi himself.Central to the doctrine is the idea that for China to continue its global rise, and for the party to maintain its rule, a decisive leader is needed at the helm. And the man for the job is Mr. Xi.Xi Jinping Thought was seen in action this week when the Communist Party announced it would abolish presidential term limits, allowing Mr. Xi to remain in power, perhaps indefinitely.Xi Jinping Thought still reveres the teachings of Mao and Karl Marx, but it also links Mr. Xi to even older Chinese traditions, especially Confucianism.Mao said he wanted to smash the grip of Confucius on China and ignite revolution. But Mr. Xi regularly quotes Confucius and other ancient sages, stressing their teachings on obedience and order, and promoting the idea that the party is the custodian of a 5,000-year-old civilization.Party propaganda now even equates Mr. Xi to a Confucian patriarch who runs the country as if it were his own family.And all good Confucian children must observe filial piety.Advertisement"}

Or maybe they\u2019re worried it is heating up and sparking inflation. Maybe President Trump\u2019s erraticism is finally worrying markets. Or maybe none of the above \u2014 and stocks have fallen because of what Paul Krugman calls \u201ca pure self-fulfilling panic.\u201dIt helps to go back a few years to understand what\u2019s happened in Pennsylvania. In the 2012 congressional elections, the Democratic candidates won a narrow majority of votes \u2014 just over 50 percent across the state\u2019s 18 House districts, compared with 49 percent for the Republican candidates.As their reward for winning more votes, however, the Democratic candidates won only five of the 18 House seats. That\u2019s the brutal math of gerrymandering, in which 50-plus percent of the popular vote can equal 28 percent of political power.It\u2019s important to note that both parties have abused gerrymandering in recent years. Democrats have done so in Illinois and Maryland. Republicans have done so in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, among other places. Republicans have been able to do more gerrymandering mostly because they control more state governments \u2014 not because Democrats are above gerrymandering.But I think that this shared blame should make the problem easier to address. In some states, less gerrymandering would benefit Democrats. In other states, it would benefit Republicans. In almost all states, less gerrymandering would make the electoral system fairer. It wouldn\u2019t solve all of our political problems, or anywhere close to all of them, but it would represent progress worthy of celebration.Next up in Pennsylvania: Either the state legislature or the courts will draw a new map. Next up nationwide (and even more consequential): The Supreme Court is likely to issue rulings on cases from Maryland, North Carolina and Wisconsin, which could eventually affect the entire country. It probably won\u2019t be in time for this year\u2019s elections, though.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Profits Drove a Stock Boom. Did the Economy Pay a Price?", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneStocks are too expensive.This is not a market forecast. I wouldn\u2019t be particularly surprised if the Dow shrugged off its recent turbulence and continued its long upward thrust. What I contend is that if the American economy behaved in the way that most economists say market economies should, stocks would in all likelihood be cheaper.It is a grim proposition. Wall Street\u2019s titans might welcome the fact that equity prices have grossly exceeded what a well-functioning, competitive economy should deliver. But for almost everybody else, it amounts to a disaster. From wage stagnation to the depressed investment rates that are holding back long-term economic growth, many of the fault lines running through the American economy can be traced back to the same root cause powering the rise of America\u2019s overpriced stocks.What makes this particularly puzzling for scholars reared on the classical models of competitive economies is that all this happened despite a persistent decline in real interest rates. In a more orthodox economy, declining rates on corporate bonds would encourage a surge in corporate investment. As companies invested more and more capital, the returns on investments would gradually decline until companies\u2019 returns matched their cost of capital: the interest rate they pay to borrow.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.In a nutshell, the United States has built an economy where businesses don\u2019t invest even though it has rarely been cheaper to finance investment. Still, they reap spectacular profits that warrant runaway share prices.What happened? It turns out that there is one straightforward reason for the American economy\u2019s unorthodox behavior. As Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues argue, the standard economic theory based on competitive markets cannot apply when markets are not competitive. And competition, in the United States, is shriveling.The scholars argue that the American economy is afflicted by \u201crents\u201d \u2014 returns in excess of what investments would yield in a competitive economy, where fat margins are quickly whittled away by competition.These rents don\u2019t fall from the sky. Companies free of competitive pressures, with the power to set prices more or less at will, squeeze them from their customers and their workers. They pad corporate profits and send stock prices sky high.Global inequality, after widening for decades, has stabilized. The share of the world\u2019s income captured by the top 1 percent has shrunk since its peak on the eve of the financial crisis.Executives love it. The critical question is what these rents hold in store for the rest of us.Still, there are good reasons to worry about rising rents, no matter where they come from. Mr. Shapiro argues that while some measures of market concentration may not be meaningful, persistently high profits are of themselves a cause for concern.Profits as a share of output have risen by half over the last 30 years. Combined with evidence that large corporations are accounting for an increasing share of revenue and employment, Mr. Shapiro writes, \u201cit certainly appears that many large U.S. corporations are earning substantial incumbency rents, and have been doing so for at least 10 years, apart from during the depths of the Great Recession.\u201dThis is particularly true in the tech sector, where a handful of dominant companies \u2014 you know the ones I\u2019m talking about \u2014 have sustained spectacular profits for years. Their sky-high stock prices suggest that investors expect high profits to continue as well.\u201cThey probably are geniuses; what they are doing is wonderful,\u201d Mr. Shapiro told me. \u201cStill, you would expect competition to erode away the excess profits over time.\u201dHere is why we should worry.Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues built an alternative model of the American economy by doing away with the assumption of perfect competition. They contend that there are barriers to entry that stop competitors and allow rents to persist.In this economy, stock prices don\u2019t just reflect the future stream of normal economic returns that would accrue to a company\u2019s capital investment. They also include a claim to a stream of rents that generate \u201cpure profits.\u201d These profits can\u2019t be replicated by another company\u2019s capital investment. They are owned by a specific company.Rents interfere with incentives in a big way. Companies will spend more time and effort trying to preserve those rents \u2014 often by working to block rivals from their markets. Rivals will fight to grab a share of those rents for themselves, perhaps through lobbying. Amid all this jockeying, investment in productive capabilities will most likely be neglected as a secondary consideration.And inevitably, inequality will rise: The owners of the shares in the powerful corporations capturing the economy\u2019s growing monopoly rents will peel further and further away from the average Jane and Joe, who own little but their labor.This is not the kind of economy proposed by classical economic theory. It is not the kind of country portrayed by evangelists of the American dream. But it looks as if we are stuck with it, regardless of what the stock market does tomorrow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ignore the Stock Market. The Economy Looks Fine.", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic data and the bond market are painting a more optimistic picture than the Dow Jones average.What is the stock market telling us with its precipitous drop over the last several days? In all likelihood, not much of anything.That\u2019s because the stock market, though crucial in the long run for individuals accumulating wealth and companies raising capital, is so erratic as to be useless in providing information about the short run. The 8.5 percent drop in the S.&P. 500 through Monday\u2019s close (before a 1.7 percent rebound on Tuesday) could signify the onset of a global recession. But it could just as well mean only that some trading algorithms at a big hedge fund collided in weird ways.For what really matters \u2014 the well-being of the economy and the ability for individuals and companies to prosper in the years ahead \u2014 look first to fundamental economic data, especially those that tend to be leading indicators. Second, look to the bond market and other financial market indicators that are more reliable measures of investors\u2019 expectations than stock prices.There is good news on both fronts, as both point to a global economy that will continue growing steadily in the months and years ahead, perhaps with inflation that is a bit higher than in the recent past. That contrasts this market sell-off with drops in 2011, 2015 and 2016, which coincided with pessimistic signals in both economic data and the bond market.The stock market can, when looked at in concert with these other indicators, provide some useful insight. Right now it appears to be more noise than signal.The bond market is also looking optimistic about the future, with prices suggesting that continued growth \u2014 without inflationary overheating \u2014 is the most likely future.The stock market has lost ground since the start of the year, thanks to the sharp sell-off Monday. But the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds is up in that span, from 2.4 percent to 2.8 percent at Tuesday\u2019s close. That suggests bond investors think that continued steady recovery will allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates gradually.Bond investors are pricing in higher inflation than the United States has experienced in recent years, but roughly in line with the 2 percent the Federal Reserve aims for. Prices for inflation-protected bonds imply 2.09 percent annual inflation over the coming decade, up from 1.98 percent at the start of the year.Other market indicators that might signal global economic troubles, like the price of oil, instead point to a steady-as-she-goes global economy.None of this makes a case for economic complacency. There are plenty of things that could go wrong in the world, from conflict on the Korean Peninsula or in the Middle East to destructive trade wars. But if the stock market was actually giving us any insight into the likelihood of those outcomes, we would expect to see moves in bond and commodity markets that just aren\u2019t happening.Think of it this way. The economy is like a horse race \u2014 and what we really care about is which horse wins, places or shows. The bond market is the equivalent of the people betting directly on the race. And while of course gamblers get it wrong sometimes, the market is efficient enough that there\u2019s a fairly direct relationship between the odds a horse pays and its probability of victory.The stock market, by contrast, is like a weird side game in which people bet one another on which gambler is going to have the best day. It\u2019s erratic, volatile and a couple of degrees removed from the underlying horse race on which it is all based.And that\u2019s why the best way to make sense of the drop in the stock market is to think of it as a sideshow to the broader trajectory of the United States and global economy, which for now look perfectly fine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Environmental Rollbacks Were Fast. It Could Get Messy in Court.", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the head of the federal agency controlling billions of acres of public lands and waters, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has spent the past year making bold policy proclamations to advance President Trump\u2019s energy agenda: He would open coastal waters to drilling, shrink national monuments, lift Obama-era fossil fuel regulations and reduce wildlife protections.But legal experts say many of the moves were made without fully considering the laws and procedures governing changes like these, making them vulnerable to legal challenges that could delay or block them. They say many of the proposals may follow the fate of other bold and hasty moves by the Trump administration, such as the attempts to limit travel from countries with sizable Muslim populations on security grounds.\u201cThey\u2019re acting in a hurry, appealing to the base, and trying to seem decisive,\u201d said Patrick Parenteau, a professor of environmental law at Vermont Law School. But, he added: \u201cThey\u2019re not following the prescribed steps of the law. They\u2019re creating errors for themselves as they go, sowing the seeds for the legal attacks.\u201dIt is not unusual for major policy changes to be hit by lawsuits from opponents. The Obama administration\u2019s own environmental regulations were sometimes controversial because they relied on creative interpretations of decades-old laws to rein in smokestack pollution or stop oil, gas and coal exploration.Some Obama-era rules have been blocked or delayed by courts. But there is one big difference, Mr. Parenteu said. Even though some rules \u201cpushed the edges of legal authority,\u201d the Obama administration mustered a stronger defense by assembling \u201cthousands of pages of support and technical analysis, laid out in mind-numbing detail,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, you have much more ad hoc, knee-jerk decision-making.\u201dA spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the legal foundations for Mr. Zinke\u2019s moves.The Trump administration\u2019s initial plan to open up the Atlantic, Pacific and Alaskan coasts to drilling, though controversial, largely adhered to the requirements of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which governs opening waters to offshore drilling. But the decision to exempt Florida, without holding legally required public hearings or providing a scientific justification, may have thrown the broader drilling plan into question, experts say.Lynn Scarlett, who served as deputy Interior Secretary under George W. Bush, said that the Florida reversal could well result in other coastal states successfully making the case that they should also be exempt from drilling, thus closing off many of the waters that Mr. Trump intended to open to drilling.\u201cThere\u2019s the phrase, \u2018haste makes waste,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Ms. Scarlett. \u201cIn policy decisions like this, doing your homework, carefully following the legal procedures, strongly enhances the prospect that the changes one is seeking will prevail.\u201dThe Florida exemption, she said, was \u201cout of sync with the approach that\u2019s delineated in the law.\u201dGov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina said that his state would sue the Trump administration if it did not receive an exemption. \u201cIf you base it on the criteria for Florida, you\u2019re going to get the same result when it comes to North Carolina,\u201d Mr. Cooper, a Democrat, said in an interview.Trump administration policymakers \u201chave the legal right to open up the entire coast to drilling, if they follow the process,\u201d said David Hayes, the deputy Interior Secretary under the Obama administration. \u201cHis lawyers must be cringing,\u201d he said of Mr. Zinke. \u201cThey may have shot themselves in the foot.\u2019Privately, oil executives who are pleased with Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to strip away regulations have expressed frustration at the Interior Department\u2019s methods, worrying that they could bog down the efforts in a legal morass. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is, let\u2019s step back and go back to regular order, and let the process run its course,\u201d said Jack Gerard, head of the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies on behalf of oil companies.James Connaughton, a senior White House environmental official in the George W. Bush administration, said it was typical for new administrations to stumble over the byzantine legal requirements of environmental policy in its early days. \u201cIt\u2019s just taking longer in this administration, because of delays in getting appointees in place, and delays in meaningful engagement with career civil servants,\u201d he said. \u201cIt requires the force of individuals that know what they\u2019re doing, to check the boxes of legislation and regulation,\u201d he said.Ms. Scarlett noted that haste may also undermine or delay the Interior Department\u2019s proposal to change an Obama-era plan to protect the habitat of the sage grouse, a bird that roams millions of acres in 11 states, including areas potentially rich in oil and gas deposits.The Obama-era plans \u201chad been exhaustively developed, with lots of input, including by governors,\u201d Ms. Scarlett said. \u201cBy going back to the drawing board, even if the idea is to benefit economies of states, it\u2019s just injecting more delay and uncertainty into the picture.\u201dOn other moves, Mr. Zinke may have bypassed requirements of the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, which requires that federal-agency decisions that could have an environmental impact on the nation\u2019s air, water, or pristine wildlife habitats must include a scientific analysis detailing the effects.Last week, Mr. Zinke approved a land swap allowing the construction of a long-contested road through Alaska\u2019s Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, reversing a decision made under the Obama administration. The earlier decision was based on a four-year scientific analysis concluding that the road would irreparably harm critical waterfowl habitat.In reversing the decision, Mr. Zinke offered no new public scientific analysis supporting the change. Traditionally, findings like those would be publicly available.Speaking to reporters last week, Mr. Zinke said, \u201cWe looked at everything,\u201d adding: \u201cThere is no significant issue the Department of Interior has found environmentally.\u201d Asked for a copy of the findings, Mr. Zinke suggested making a Freedom of Information Act request.A lack of new scientific analysis could provide an opening for opponents to challenge the road. \u201cTo take action to start building the road requires an environmental-impact statement,\u201d said Sally Jewell, the Interior Secretary in the Obama administration, who opposed the road based on the Obama-administration environmental findings. \u201cThe law requires the analysis, and they haven\u2019t done one.\u201d\u201cThe agency will have to justify its changes to the courts,\u201d said Jeffrey Lubbers, a professor of administrative law at American University. \u201cIf the previous action by the Obama administration was made based on findings of fact,\u201d he said, then reversing it \u201cwill have to be justified by saying, \u2018those facts are no longer true.\u2019 And that will be difficult to do.\u201dExperts say that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back protections on national monuments could hit legal roadblocks as well. Last year Mr. Trump announced that, based on a recommendation by Mr. Zinke, he intends to slash the size of two Utah monuments, Bears\u2019 Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, by about two million acres, partly to allow mining.Legal experts say that the language of the Antiquities Act is unclear on whether a president can shrink a monument created by a predecessor. But there are clear legal restrictions on opening the monument up to mining, said Mark Squillace, an expert on natural resources law at the University of Colorado Law School.In the case of Grand Staircase, he said, a land management plan approved under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 specifies that \u201cmining and mineral leasing is not allowed under the original boundaries of the monument,\u201d he said \u2014 the key words being, original boundaries. That language could ultimately prevent mining on lands there, Mr. Squillace said.Last week, California filed a lawsuit against the Interior Department over its plan to undo an Obama-era regulation on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, on public lands. The rule requires fracking companies, which extract oil and gas by injecting a cocktail of chemicals into the ground, to follow stricter standards on cleaning up waste and to disclose at least some of the chemicals they use.California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, said the rollback violated the law by failing to consider the environmental impacts of fracking, such as the possible contamination of underground water tables. \u201cThey\u2019re making moves that are big and bold, and they\u2019re breaking the law,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in an interview. \u201cThe rules have to go through a process. You can\u2019t just unwind them by fiat.\u201dLisa Friedman contributed from Washington and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Has Turned Nasty. It Was Long Overdue.", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesUntil this month, the scariest thing about the stock market was its uncanny calm and stability. Like the opening sequences of a classic horror movie, the market last year was relentlessly and unnaturally cheerful.The scariest thing about the market right now is the shocked response of traders who had become accustomed to the unsustainably placid conditions that have been unceremoniously swept away.The precise timing of the market plunge was a surprise, and it has evidently unnerved some investors. But while it may seem harsh to say so, after so many months of fizzy profits, a downturn was long overdue.\u201cThe movements we\u2019ve been having the last couple of weeks may not be pleasant but they are entirely normal, on a historical basis, \u201c said Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist for LPL Financial.Based on the historical record, \u201cnormal\u201d in the stock market includes unsettling conditions of the kind we have been experiencing lately. More of the same is likely in the months ahead: gut-wrenching swings down as well as up, rather than the steady gains that evidently lulled some investors into complacency.That is not a declaration that the market is in deep trouble. Far from it. I don\u2019t know where stocks are heading in the weeks ahead, but I assume, based on history, that they will eventually rise. \u201cEventually\u201d is a word with a lot of wiggle room, however. Markets tend to overshoot, up and down, and they could certainly plunge much further.That said, a good argument can be made that the underlying stock market fundamentals today are better now than they were a few months ago. After all, the economy appears to be fairly strong in the United States and in much of the rest of the world, and corporate earnings have been rising. Higher earnings and cheaper stock prices are an appealing combination. Using classic definitions, stock valuations have markedly improved in just a few months.Still, the current downturn is a harsh reminder: The stock market entails risk, pain and losses, and it isn\u2019t for everyone. Whatever \u201cnormal\u201d is, it is nothing like the benign stock market of late 2016 or 2017.Mr. Mehta\u2019s view, which I share, is that a stock market decline of the kind we have been experiencing was overdue and that there is probably even greater volatility ahead. My own admittedly hopeful perspective is that declines now may reduce and postpone extreme speculative excesses later. Such excesses eventually lead to big market crashes and real pain for the broader economy.Consider that since the election in November 2016 through January, stock returns, including dividends, increased every month. That was the longest such streak since 1928, when reliable records began to be kept, Mr. Detrick says.And it\u2019s not just that stocks moved up every month. They did so on a daily basis in the gentlest and steadiest of fashions. The average daily change in the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for all of 2017 was a mere 0.30 percent up or down. That is the lowest number \u2014 and the most stable market, based on that metric \u2014 since 1964.No wonder the stock market seems so unsettling in 2018. Through Thursday, the average daily change, up or down, was 0.84 percent. That is a big increase. Yet going back to 1928, the average has been 0.75 percent. The current market, which has been depicted as wildly disruptive is, basically, just an average one, Mr. Detrick said.There have been major losses in the broader market, however. Through Thursday, the stocks in the S.&P. 500 had lost $5.2 trillion from the index\u2019s peak on Jan. 26, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. That is a staggering amount, but even with those losses, the S.&P. 500 through Thursday had swollen by $3.55 trillion since the 2016 election.Bear markets in stocks \u2014 defined as downturns, from peak to trough, of at least 20 percent \u2014 rarely occur without a recession, and, at the moment, none is visible. That\u2019s one reason for Mr. Detrick\u2019s belief that the market is \u201cprobably getting fairly close to its bottom now.\u201dWhile that history is comforting, the 20 percent threshold for a bear market is arbitrary, and the link between recessions and the stock market is not ironclad. The bear market of 1987 occurred without a recession, for example. And who would really be surprised if the unusual political conditions in the United States today fostered unexpected patterns in the economy and stock market?What is safe to say is that the market has entered a new, troubling phase. The current turmoil may turn out to be blissfully brief, but it makes sense to be ready for the worst.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Trade Sanctions Aimed at China Could Ensnare Canada", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 China is the main target of possible tough new United States trade measures against low-priced imports of steel and aluminum. But the sanctions threaten to ensnare America\u2019s closest allies, particularly Canada.President Trump could choose to accept one of the Commerce Department\u2019s recommendations or fashion his own remedy. Either way, the issue highlights the difficulty the Trump administration faces as it seeks to limit imports in a world where companies routinely make, ship and sell products across borders.The Defense Department \u201ccontinues to be concerned about the negative impact on our key allies regarding the recommended options within the reports,\u201d Mr. Mattis wrote. He urged the administration to consider tariffs targeted at specific countries and to focus on what he described as the underlying problem \u2014 Chinese overproduction.Yet the United States could face a challenge in crafting trade sanctions that circumvent allies and target China. It has already imposed a variety of restrictions on Chinese aluminum and steel. But American steel and aluminum producers argue that China still harms them indirectly by routing goods through third countries, as well as depressing global prices to a level where American manufacturers cannot compete.Although China has promised to cut its steel and aluminum capacity, it has made only slow, modest progress. That is why some American metal makers have argued for broader protections.Canada accounted for more than half of American imports of aluminum in 2016, followed distantly by Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Canada also made up the largest share of American steel imports in 2016 \u2014 17 percent \u2014 followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey. China did not rank among the top 10 suppliers of either metal.\u201cFrom a defense perspective, it makes no sense to limit imports from Canada in the future,\u201d said Alf Barrios, the chief executive of Rio Tinto Aluminum, which exports aluminum from Canada to the United States. \u201cCanada is a longstanding, reliable supply for any needs the United States might have.\u201dKathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, said the recent level of animosity and trade tensions with the United States had surprised Canadians. \u201cWe see ourselves as close friends,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unexpected that we would stand to be damaged by the United States, and vice versa.\u201dKen Neumann, the national director of United Steelworkers, struck a similar note. \u201cThere is no justification to include Canada with countries that systematically violate trade laws and engage in the dumping of illegally subsidized aluminum and steel,\u201d he said after the release of the Commerce Department report.Canada is one of several allies that could be affected. Britain, Australia, Europe and Japan would also be included under the kind of blanket tariff or quota recently floated by the Commerce Department.The measures could fall particularly hard on South Korea, which was named as one of the countries that would face a 53 percent tariff on its steel exports, along with China, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey and six others, under one potential scenario in the report.Including countries like Canada could lead to unintended ramifications for the United States military and economy.Many products made in America use foreign metals, including the Ford F-150, a classic American truck that is consistently ranked as one of the most \u201cmade-in-America\u201d vehicles in an industry known for sourcing parts from around the world.The truck\u2019s engine and transmission are American-made, and the truck is assembled in plants in Dearborn, Mich., and Claycomo, Mo. Even so, the truck is made of Canadian aluminum, some of which comes from Rio Tinto\u2019s aluminum works in Quebec \u2014 an area with plentiful hydropower, which is needed for the energy-intensive process of producing aluminum.From Quebec, some aluminum travels to a plant in upstate New York owned by Novelis, which combines it with recycled aluminum and rolls it out into wide sheets for Ford.Another 15 percent of the value of the truck\u2019s components come from Mexico. Its window wipers come from a factory in Matamoros, some of its wheels from Chihuahua, and some of the pistons in its engine from Ramos Arizpe.The auto industry says this web of North American suppliers allows it to produce cars and trucks at a quality and a price to compete with products made around the world. Ford exports the truck back to Canada, and last year it announced that it would begin exporting vehicles to China as well.The same trends are true in the steel industry. In mid-February, 15 American industry associations that buy steel to make their products wrote a letter to Mr. Trump arguing that, by raising the price of steel, restrictions on imports could do more harm than good. They said they represented more than one million jobs in the United States, compared with about 80,000 jobs in primary steel production.Other economic forces are driving aluminum smelting from the United States. Aluminum manufacturing is extremely energy intensive, so it has tended to go to parts of the world with cheap excess energy, like the Middle East, Iceland and Canada. Smelters in the United States must compete with other, more profitable businesses for electricity, like computer server farms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Good Health Care Deal, but Only for Some", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHere\u2019s the good news about the announcement this week that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase are forming a new company to cover health care for their employees: If you\u2019re one of the million-plus people who work at these companies, or a family member of one, you\u2019re likely to get cheaper, better health care pretty soon.Here\u2019s the bad news: If you\u2019re one of the approximately 300 million other Americans, you might not see savings for a long time, if ever. And in the short term at least, you could be hit by bigger medical bills.Together, these three behemoth corporations will be able to wrest great deals and discounts in their negotiations from hospital systems, drug manufacturers, medical device makers and doctors\u2019 groups. These are likely to be better deals than what lesser companies can wrangle.Now, with Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon forming a new health care company, employers will have an intimidating proxy warrior in their battles over the $3 trillion United States health care market.Medicare, by law, is not allowed to negotiate discounts on drug prices. But you can bet Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire will. Millions of American companies do not have the power, knowledge or data to drive down prices charged by labs or hospitals. But this new company most likely will.Recent history shows that when the medical system loses income from one sector (in this case, three huge corporations), it is adept at making up for it in another. As the Goliaths wrestle over how much they should pay or be paid, the Davids \u2014 small companies, individuals who purchase their own insurance and the uninsured \u2014 are often left footing the bill.Those bills can be astronomical, like $5,000 for an M.R.I. scan or $100,000 for knee replacement surgery. Hospital systems argue that they have to charge such prices because government insurers \u2014 Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 don\u2019t pay enough to cover their costs. Medicare disputes that. And \u201ccovering their costs\u201d is a fungible calculation that can include multimillion-dollar executive salaries.Commercial insurers negotiate down from those high prices. But while good negotiators can get great deals, others will miss out. And the uninsured often get bills \u2014 and collection notices \u2014 asking them to pay the highest prices of all.The pharmaceutical industry knows it will need Amazon to deliver drugs. Hospitals might want Chase to finance equipment purchases. And who would dare alienate Warren Buffett, who has called health care costs \u201ca hungry tapeworm on the American economy\u201d? The three titans are also likely to insist that the best hospitals \u2014 the Sloan Ketterings and Cleveland Clinics \u2014 be available to their workers.Yes, they may use technology in smarter ways to benefit patients. This might include home monitoring of heart rhythms and blood sugar; diagnosing via telemedicine and iPad; delivering prescription medicines to doorsteps; and bringing medicine into the 21st century with online billing and payment. They may also be able to provide employees some degree of pricing transparency so that they can make better choices.In doing so they will probably be able to reduce the high administrative costs associated with our health care system, an estimated 25 percent of hospital spending, and give patients more control of their care.How can the rest of us get in on the deal? If the new health care company permits outside firms and individuals to buy into whatever they create, that could set off a revolution. That new company would, essentially, become a novel insurer \u2014 although one that is cheaper, more efficient and patient-friendly. And that could be good for the entire health care system.But what if the three corporations try to turn their health care company into a profit center? This week\u2019s announcement said the new company is \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d That doesn\u2019t quite say \u201cnonprofit.\u201d If the long-term game plan of the Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire offshoot is to function as a business that is sold to the rest of us to please shareholders, then we may end up pretty much back where we started. And that is not where we want to be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Trump Rips Up Nafta, Canada May Shrug, Not Shudder", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 Nothing has reshaped Canada\u2019s modern economy more than free trade with the United States.But that doesn\u2019t mean the country is staring at economic ruin if the current negotiations over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement collapse, and the agreement is scrapped.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is just one among many Canadians who have suggested that the trade deal is far from critical to the country\u2019s economic survival.The prime minister\u2019s remarks may have been a negotiating tactic. But many trade experts say the changes to the world\u2019s trading system that have come about since Canada and the United States opened their mutual border in 1989 mean that an end to Nafta would not be a devastating blow to the world\u2019s 10th largest economy.Trade policies dating back almost to Canada\u2019s founding meant that aside from automobile and car part plants \u2014 which had been under a limited free trade agreement since 1965 \u2014 many Canadian factories were relatively small and inefficient. They largely owed their existence to the high tariffs that kept out imports from the United States and elsewhere.At the same time, tariffs in the United States made Canadian exports a tough sell for many industries.While much is unclear about exactly what would happen if Nafta comes to an end, there is universal agreement that the factories that closed \u2014 like a Hershey chocolate plant that moved from Smiths Falls, Ontario, to Mexico after that country joined Nafta in 1994 \u2014 are not coming back.Also not returning are the high tariffs that created and sustained many factories, both in the United States and Canada.The agreement that created the World Trade Organization in 1995 means that, in the worst-case scenarios, Canadian companies would be facing duties of about 5 percent on shipments to American customers, and closer to 3 percent on many auto parts.While those duties are not exactly negligible, Canadian companies have successfully dealt for years with much larger percentage swings in the exchange rate between the American and Canadian dollars.\u201cThere would be difficulties adjusting to the disappearance of Nafta, but it would not be a catastrophe,\u201d said Lawrence L. Herman, a trade lawyer in Toronto and a former Canadian diplomat. \u201cCanada would continue to do business with the United States \u2014 maybe just not as efficiently.\u201dGus Van Harten, a professor of international investment law at the Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in Toronto, has long criticized Nafta for allowing American and Mexican companies to sue if they feel they have been treated unfairly by Canadian laws and regulations. These complaints (which can also be filed by Canadian companies over practices in the other two Nafta countries) are heard by arbitrators, not courts, and the decisions cannot be reversed.With or without Nafta, geography means that the United States will continue to be Canada\u2019s largest customer.Such entry into new global markets will not be possible for every industry. Philip Cross, the former chief economic analyst at Statistics Canada, a government agency, said that, for example, it is unlikely that Canadian auto parts will make their way to Japan or Europe. \u201cSo we\u2019d better stay on good terms with the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Cross, now a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a research group in Ottawa.But some major Canadian industries have weaned themselves off a near-total reliance on Nafta markets for their exports.Even if Nafta disappears, Susan Yurkovich, the president of the B.C. Lumber Trade Council, an industry group, said she doesn\u2019t anticipate that access to the United States would be significantly affected, even if what would succeed it is not clear.\u201cI\u2019m very curious to see how you put the genie back in the bottle,\u201d she said.Several Canadian agricultural groups have followed the lumber industry to Asia with success.Richard Davies, the senior vice president of sales and marketing at Olymel, a pork and poultry producer based in Montreal, said that some of the growth in overseas sales was driven by making more efficient use of animals. Parts like pig\u2019s feet, which have a relatively small market in North America, can fetch premium prices in Asia.But, Mr. Davies added, the search for new markets also came out of concerns about relying too heavily on a single customer. During the early 1990s, the United States took more than three-quarters of Canada\u2019s pork exports. Today, Mr. Davies said, it accounts for less than 30 percent at Olymel.Given all the uncertainty surrounding Nafta, Mr. Davies said it is not practical to try to plan for its demise. But he added: \u201cI would have had a lot more anxiety in 1992 than I have today about potential trade disruptions.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Peter Navarro, a Top Trade Skeptic, Is Ascendant", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump could soon promote Peter Navarro, a trade policy adviser, to a more powerful position in the White House, elevating a longtime trade skeptic who has found himself sidelined by more pro-trade voices inside the White House.Mr. Navarro\u2019s ascendance may signal that the balance of power is shifting toward those who have backed Mr. Trump\u2019s get-tough approach to trade policy and away from those who have sought to restrain it.The president has agreed to promote Mr. Navarro to assistant to the president from his current role as deputy assistant, giving him more access to top strategy meetings, said two trade experts close to the White House, who requested anonymity to discuss plans that weren\u2019t yet public.The White House said then that reorganization was part of an effort to streamline protocols in the West Wing, but it was widely viewed as sidelining the influence of Mr. Navarro, once a primary adviser to the president. With Mr. Navarro\u2019s promotion, the White House is again considering making his Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy independent from the National Economic Council.Amid the tumult, Mr. Navarro has been able to leverage a close personal relationship with the president to gain more access, a third trade expert close to the White House said.It is unclear what new responsibilities Mr. Navarro\u2019s promotion could bring, or whether the president could change his mind. But the biggest change for Mr. Navarro is that he may once again gain more access to top meetings \u2014 and to the president himself.Mr. Navarro presided over an early period on the campaign trail and in the White House, during which President Trump appeared poised to fulfill his most aggressive promises on trade, including ripping up trade deals that he had criticized as bad for American companies and workers and imposing tariffs on imports.The president did sign another directive authored by Mr. Navarro, pulling the United States out of a multinational trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But other efforts by Mr. Navarro to impose tariffs on steel imports and withdraw from a free-trade agreement with South Korea were blocked, leading some to question whether the president had abandoned his promise to take a more aggressive approach to trade than his predecessors.As Mr. Kelly imposed order on the White House by limiting the president\u2019s access to some advisers, Mr. Navarro\u2019s influence was reduced. Mr. Navarro was required to copy Mr. Cohn, his new superior, on all emails. He was absent from some high-level strategy meetings on trade, as well as the president\u2019s trip to China, a focus of Mr. Navarro\u2019s.Supporters and opponents of Mr. Navarro describe this as a concerted effort by more pro-trade factions to keep the president from hearing Mr. Navarro\u2019s views, which could have goaded Mr. Trump into more aggressive action.Mr. Navarro is a Ph.D. economist and a former professor at the University of California, Irvine, but some of his ideas on trade have been criticized by mainstream economists. While most economists say Nafta has benefited the United States economy on the whole, Mr. Navarro has sharply criticized the deal. He has denounced some foreign investments as \u201cconquest by purchase\u201d and argued for retracting global supply chains back within the United States\u2019 borders.From a nearby post in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Navarro spent months focusing on trade measures that were less in the spotlight, including expanding provisions that require the government to buy American goods, and carrying out a government-wide review of the defense industry.In an expanded post, Mr. Navarro may be particularly influential on combating China. Mr. Navarro has authored books including \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d which advocated the type of aggressive trade stance toward China that is now widely echoed by officials in the Trump administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Big a Bang for Trump\u2019s Buck? (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe most convincing evidence on multipliers, in my view, has always come from natural experiments: cases in which we know from the historical political record that governments were imposing large changes in taxes and/or spending, and we can see the effects of these fiscal shocks on growth relative to what was previously expected. (Attempts to use fancy statistical techniques to extract fiscal shocks have worked much less well.)So now we have a stimulus from tax cuts and spending increases in an economy already down to 4 percent unemployment, where the Fed is already raising rates to head off potential inflation. That is, we\u2019re looking at normal monetary conditions, where we\u2019d expect a smallish multiplier.I\u2019m having a hard time figuring out exactly how big a stimulus we\u2019re looking at, but it seems to be around 2 percent of GDP for fiscal 2019. With a multiplier of 0.5, that would add 1 percent to growth.That said, I\u2019d suggest that this is a bit high. For one thing, it\u2019s not clear how much impact corporate tax cuts, which are the biggest item, will really have on spending. Meanwhile, unemployment is only 4 percent; given Okun\u2019s Law, the usual relationship between growth and changes in unemployment, an extra 1 percent growth would bring unemployment down to 3.5%, which is really low by historical standards, so that the Fed would probably lean especially hard against this stimulus.So we\u2019re probably looking at adding less than 1 percent, maybe much less than 1 percent, to growth. This isn\u2019t trivial, but it\u2019s not that big a deal.Advertisement"}

The elevators were out of order, the stairwells dark. Built in stages beginning in the 1940s on Chicago\u2019s Near North Side, Cabrini-Green consisted of barracks-style rowhouses and 23 towers. When Ricks arrived, more than a third of the 3,600 units were vacant. The Chicago Housing Authority said it couldn\u2019t afford to do the repairs to ready them for occupancy, and not just at Cabrini. The C.H.A. had a stock of 42,000 apartments, but the number in use had fallen to fewer than 33,000.The vacant fifth-floor apartment Ricks entered looked like a crypt. Plywood covered the windows. The kitchen cabinets dangled or were missing altogether. Ricks surveyed the surroundings, counting four bedrooms. There was a full bathroom on one side of the unit and a half bath on the other. The front room was large enough for a dining table and a sofa, and it was connected to the kitchen, which (she checked) had a working stove and refrigerator. The ceilings were high, the walls made of seemingly indestructible cinder block. Ricks had freckles that wandered the bridge of her nose and reached her high cheekbones, which now sharpened to points as she smiled. What she saw looked like a home.Ricks lived at Cabrini-Green for the next 21 years. She worked as a teacher\u2019s aide in the local schools that most of her own (eventual) 13 children attended. She babysat, ran an after-school program and served free lunches out of the field house by her high-rise. She moved her aging mother in with them, and Ricks\u2019s grown children found jobs in construction, home health care, retail and at a new residential complex built atop the old Madison Street \u201cskid row,\u201d an area refashioned into the \u201cWest Loop.\u201d Ricks didn\u2019t leave Cabrini after one of her nephews was hit with several bullets through her apartment window \u2014 his heart stopped twice before he survived. She stuck it out as the city demolished every other public-housing high-rise in Chicago not reserved for the elderly, including all the towers at Cabrini-Green save hers. After the start of this civic remodeling, in 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley said that breaking up the severe concentrations of poverty of high-rise public housing would finally imbue long-neglected neighborhoods with vitality; the mostly black residents who lived there in social and economic isolation would be able to reap the rewards of the resurgent city. \u201cI want to rebuild their souls,\u201d Daley declared. But Ricks believed her soul was doing all right on its own. She refused to go, in 2010, even as every neighbor remaining in her building took whatever replacement housing was offered them. She outlasted them all. \u201cI\u2019m the last woman standing,\u201d Ricks liked to declare.Ricks held firm to a belief that if she followed the rules, if she kept up her part in an agreement, then she was entitled to all that was promised her. Her three youngest children \u2014 Reggie, Rose and Raqkown \u2014 were still on her lease, along with two of her nearly 40 grandchildren. She wasn\u2019t in her apartment illegally, she contended. She paid her rent on time. No one caught her with drugs or guns. So how could the C.H.A. just assign her a new unit? But the city took her to court, and a federal judge gave her 10 days to vacate the building. That was that. \u201cI had to go,\u201d she conceded. \u201cEither that or be homeless again.\u201dAs it had the day she arrived at Cabrini-Green, snow covered the ground on the December morning in 2010 that she left. A crowd of reporters jostled the last high-rise tenants of what had been the city\u2019s and the country\u2019s most well-known public-housing project. \u201cAn inglorious end to an infamous era,\u201d as one news outlet put it. Another described Cabrini-Green as \u201cthe housing development that came to symbolize the squandered hope of them all.\u201d Deonta Ricks lugged a cardboard box filled with his mother\u2019s most prized possessions: the trophies he and his siblings had won for basketball tournaments and perfect attendance and the one he was awarded for being valedictorian of the school that was still there, an empty field away. The Cabrini-Green neighborhood, only a few blocks west of the ritzy Gold Coast, had a new library and police station, new shopping and upscale housing. The school, too, had been renamed and given a makeover, and it now served only those students who tested in, ranking it among the best elementaries in Illinois. Rose, then 17, rolled a suitcase with a \u201cRoute 66\u201d sticker on it. \u201cI\u2019ve been here basically my whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cLike it\u2019s hard leaving when you\u2019ve got so much memories of it. You knew everyone. You felt safe.\u201dWhen the trophies were stowed and the furniture loaded onto a truck, Annie Ricks ducked into a sedan the same off-white color as her high-rise. The car spun its wheels on the snow and gained traction, and she was gone.Then, as now, the idea of government-run housing was maligned as anticapitalist and socialist; it clashed with a national ethos wrapped up in visions of the frontiersman and the self-made entrepreneur. When the Housing Act of 1937 was being debated, it was opposed by real estate trade groups and property owners\u2019 associations, by builders, suppliers, the U.S. Chambers of Commerce and the departments of the Interior and the Treasury. Although the subsidy was reserved for only stable families with modest incomes \u2014 the \u201cdeserving poor\u201d \u2014 the ceiling on what qualifying residents could earn was said to discourage hard work, acting as a sap on initiative and pluck. Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d dramatized the backlash against Roosevelt\u2019s call for a deeper social contract of shared responsibility: The hero of the 1943 novel is an architect of a public-housing complex who becomes enraged when he returns from a trip to discover that his bare-bones high-rise has been compromised to include \u201cthe expense of incomprehensible features\u201d like balconies, a gymnasium, extra doorways and decorative brickwork. In an act portrayed as a valiant defense of his convictions, he dynamites the entire building. Maybe most telling, the same Depression-era legislation that funded the first public-housing complexes also created the federally insured private home loan. With this revolution in home financing, buyers were able to put down as little as 10 percent of a house\u2019s cost and pay off their mortgages in small increments over an unprecedented 30 years. Even today, the federal government devotes three times as much each year to mortgage-interest deductions and other subsidies to the speculative real estate market \u2014 essentially public housing for homeowners \u2014 than to the entire annual budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.The first public-housing developments were often simple and unadorned brick rowhouses or duplexes. They were required to be built to minimum standards, so as not to compete with the private rental market, and the overall populations were diverse, in part because federal rules dictated that public housing couldn\u2019t change the existing racial makeup of a neighborhood. In the 1950s, cities began to build massive complexes of clustered towers encircled by plots of land closed off to through streets. It was a purity of modernist city planning, influenced by the avant-garde \u201ctowers in the park\u201d urban reimagining of the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. The density and nearly identical stripped-down designs of the high-rises were also believed to cut down on costs while meeting greater demand.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I died and went to heaven,\u201d one of the first tenants of a development in Chicago recalled years later. J.S. Fuerst, the former head of research and statistics at the C.H.A., collected this testimonial and dozens of others like it from early occupants of the agency\u2019s properties for a 2003 book titled \u201cWhen Public Housing Was Paradise.\u201d Even though these were low-income communities of thousands of people crammed together on isolated plazas, many families still found a modest home to be somehow divine after the damnation of the cold-water flats they left behind. There, they had been afraid of fires and sickness and eviction. Public housing, by contrast, was new and orderly. All the families went through a screening process. The buildings had teams of janitors on call around the clock. Groundskeepers maintained the gardens and lawns. There was a city agency responsible for answering calls. The C.H.A.\u2019s first executive director, Elizabeth Wood, worried not that the new developments might be too large and come to define an area as low-rent, but rather that they wouldn\u2019t be large enough to counteract the damaging effects of poverty and disrepair around them. \u201cIf it is not bold,\u201d she said in 1945, \u201cthe result will be a series of small projects, islands in a wilderness of slums beaten down by smoke, noise and fumes.\u201dAcross the entire country, a majority of public housing remained in low-rises; there were eventually more than 3,000 local authorities, most with fewer than 500 units. But large housing \u201cprojects\u201d came to dominate urban landscapes and symbolize for many the unruliness and otherness of the \u201cinner city\u201d in decline. The towers-in-the-park design was only ever partly to blame. In Chicago, as elsewhere, high-rise developments were built intentionally in neighborhoods that were already segregated racially; rather than apportioning the working poor across a number of areas and helping to diversify cities, public housing had the effect of solidifying racial and economic boundaries in superblocks detached from the street grid, in towers of concrete and steel. Yet they were also perennially underfunded and perilously mismanaged. The developments were allowed to deteriorate as maintenance and repairs lagged. And as the broader fortunes of cities declined \u2014 diminishing populations and disappearing jobs, spiking poverty and crime and drug use \u2014 public housing bore the worst of those effects.Soon, those same broad trends were used to justify abandoning the basic democratic idea of providing shelter for all. In 1972, when the 33 Pruitt-Igoe towers in St. Louis began to be imploded a mere 18 years after the complex fully opened, the televised image, with its mushrooming cloud of dust and debris, defined the popular notion of the public-housing experiment: It needed to be destroyed.For other cities, demolition still remained a political and practical impossibility. In previous decades when slums were cleared, those displaced were sent into public housing. Now where could tens of thousands of people from the projects be sent? But the aversion to social safety-net programs only came to root more deeply in the American mainstream. After retaking Congress in 1994, Republicans said they planned to scrap the federal housing agency entirely. President Clinton, promoting his cuts to the welfare system and proclaiming \u201cthe era of big government is over,\u201d pre-emptively reorganized HUD. The agency promised to \u201cinfuse market discipline\u201d into public housing. The anti-urban impulse that had sent middle-class families to the suburbs had reversed itself, and young professionals were flocking to city centers near their jobs and one another.In 1990, Chicago\u2019s population started to tick up for the first time in 40 years; the area surrounding Cabrini-Green added 4,000 white residents during the previous decade, and vacant lots that had sold for $30,000 a few years earlier were being snapped up for five times that amount. As the fortunes of cities changed once again, public housing experienced a new pressure. HUD began to award municipalities tens of millions of dollars in grants to tear down their public-housing high-rises and replace them with much smaller developments that mixed public-housing families with higher-income renters and market-rate owners. Proposals to preserve some of the towers, filling in the cleared land around them with a variety of housing types, were rejected. Many low-rise developments in rejuvenating areas were targeted as well. A majority of the relocated public-housing residents were given Section 8 vouchers to rent from landlords in the private market. Nationwide, 250,000 public-housing units have been demolished since the 1990s. Atlanta, Baltimore, Columbus, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Tucson \u2014 just about every American city got in on the action. But no city knocked down as many as Chicago.Ricks wanted to remain upbeat about the move. But when violence broke out at her new home, the longtime Wentworth residents said it was the fault of the newcomers, the outsiders from Cabrini-Green, a number of whom had been moved there. An elderly woman announced for Rose to hear that she didn\u2019t like the Cabrini people and wanted them gone. When Reggie and Raqkown tried to play basketball at the courts beside their apartment, the guys there threw elbows and fists, trying to turn the game into a brawl. A group of boys jumped Reggie in the courtyard. Other former Cabrini residents who ended up there had guns pulled on them. \u201cPeople at Wentworth think you\u2019re stepping on their turf,\u201d Ricks said. \u201cThis is not your turf. This is C.H.A.\u2019s turf. You can\u2019t run me from my home. Because I do pay rent.\u201dShe often made the trip to visit her friends at the remaining strip of rowhouses at Cabrini-Green. She went to the jazz concerts held in the nearby park. Like many relocated families, she felt safer in the vestiges of the old neighborhood. When Raqkown, Ricks\u2019s youngest, left his high school most days, he traveled to the field house at Cabrini. The principal at the neighborhood elementary school said two-thirds of his students were former Cabrini families who took the bus and train long distances to get there. Several Cabrini-Green Facebook pages formed, people reporting job opportunities and business ventures, sharing words of inspiration and announcements of deaths in the Cabrini family. Oftentimes a post showed a photo of one of the disappeared high-rises \u2014 \u201cWho can say what building this is?\u201d \u2014 leading to long threads of competing memories.On an airless Saturday night in the summer of 2012, Ricks stepped outside into the Wentworth courtyard. She\u2019d been confined to her apartment all day taking care of grandchildren and wanted to relax. She set up a small table, placing atop it a transistor radio and a can of bug spray. She popped open a bottle of iced tea she bought at the gas station and tuned the radio to a gospel station. Then she was startled by screaming in the distance. She recognized the voice before she saw him: Reggie. He came racing toward her out of the darkness with Raqkown sprinting beside him. A mob of men were at their heels. Her sons dashed past her and up the stairs to their apartment, their pursuers rushing past as well. Rose, who was inside, opened the door for her brothers, and the Wentworth guys charged in behind them, colliding into her. Ricks ran up the stairs after them. \u201cHome invasion!\u201d she cried.In the cramped apartment, one invader knocked a television off the wall and stomped his foot through it. They pushed over a chest of drawers and threw chairs. Reggie, who was bleeding from his head, lifted a cooking pot off the stove and swung it to fend off blows. Rose armed herself with a mop. Their mother usually carried a fist of keys with her, and she now punched with it. She held the aerosol can of bug repellent as well, and she sprayed it into any face close by. \u201cI\u2019m just going to say it like this,\u201d Ricks said later that night, \u201cwe did whatever we had to do to get their asses out of our house.\u201dFor the next two weeks, Ricks stayed with a son in the Cabrini rowhouses. One of her older daughters put up Reggie and Raqkown. Rose moved in temporarily with another sibling in the western suburbs. A social-service provider asked Ricks if she wanted to go to a shelter. She didn\u2019t. A shelter wasn\u2019t any place to live. \u201cThat\u2019s like giving up,\u201d Ricks said. With the home invasion, her old stubbornness returned. No way was she going to be cheated out of a four-bedroom again. Not this time. She was going to keep her family together.She put in for a transfer to a different C.H.A. development along the lakefront, and she documented every time she phoned the agency to get an update. She checked in with a pro bono lawyer who agreed to take her case, asking when she should expect to move.\u201cJust trying to get them to confirm that you\u2019re eligible to be on the wait list for a four-bedroom,\u201d he told her.\u201cSo how long will that be?\u201d\u201cI wish I knew. I think they\u2019ll respond to me. I\u2019ll bother them until they do. I think this is going to be taken care of. It\u2019s not going to be done quickly.\u201d\u201cIt should be quickly, because you\u2019re my lawyer,\u201d Ricks said.\u201cI may be a lawyer; however, I\u2019m not a magician.\u201dShe ended up cutting ties with him. He\u2019d been emailing the C.H.A. since July, but three months later, her situation remained the same. \u201cI\u2019m not prejudiced,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I\u2019d have been white, he\u2019d have moved me the very same day. He doesn\u2019t have to live in Wentworth Gardens, in the ghetto, as they say.\u201dMany more families were like the Rickses, people who went from run-down public housing to rehabbed public housing, albeit still in areas of concentrated poverty. The same proved true for those who moved with a voucher. The C.H.A. currently oversees 16,000 units of occupied public housing, more than a third of which are designated for the elderly, and 47,000 vouchers in the private market. The combination of the two exceeds what the agency\u2019s total supply of housing was in the \u201990s. Nationally, the number of families using a Section 8 rent subsidy has doubled over the last 25 years, to 2.3 million. In theory, a voucher gives a family the choice to live anywhere. But the rents the federal government pays to Section 8 landlords are generally not enough for a home in a diverse neighborhood with strong schools and low crime; most landlords taking vouchers aren\u2019t in \u201copportunity\u201d areas but in poor and racially isolated ones not so different from the razed government-run high-rises. In 2003, an independent monitor of the C.H.A.\u2019s first years of relocations offered a bleak assessment: \u201cThe result has been that the vertical ghettos from which the families are being moved are being replaced with horizontal ghettos, located in well defined, highly segregated neighborhoods.\u201dThe families that were dispersed from Chicago\u2019s demolished public housing have been blamed for the city\u2019s recent surge in gun violence, as well as for crime in the suburbs, the greater Midwest and even parts of the South. Several studies have shown that C.H.A. residents did not spread disorder wherever they settled, as if they carried an infectious disease. But these families were moved primarily to areas of Chicago that were already hollowed out of population, schools, occupied homes, jobs and resources. In South Shore, which took on more Section 8 renters than any other neighborhood in the city, 3,700 apartments were caught up in foreclosures, one out of every five rental units. The problems of concentrated poverty and isolation, which the demolitions were supposed to solve, persisted \u2014 and relocated families now found themselves in strange territory without their former support networks. People in public housing had, by necessity, bartered services, shopped together, shared food, stepped up when a neighbor lost a loved one. Annie Ricks\u2019s oldest daughter, Kenosha, left Cabrini-Green when she was in her 20s and moved with her family to a block on the West Side. \u201cI\u2019ve been out here almost a decade, and I know three or four of my neighbors,\u201d she told me recently. \u201c\u2009\u2018They from the projects,\u2019 people say. But they don\u2019t know me. They weren\u2019t raised how we were raised. We were raised to stick together. If you\u2019re a neighbor, you let the next neighbor know what\u2019s going on. They don\u2019t do that out here.\u201dDevelopments like Cabrini-Green did in fact need to be made safer and more livable, and maybe even torn down. But the public had an obligation as well to ensure that those who lived there didn\u2019t lose out when the high-rises were replaced. Virtually no new public housing has been built in the country in decades. There\u2019s still a stock of over a million units nationwide, down from a peak of 1.4 million. Much of it is at risk. A HUD-commissioned study in 2010 found a $26 billion backlog in repair and maintenance needs, a figure estimated to have ballooned since then to more than $50 billion. Each year, some 10,000 to 15,000 units are lost solely because of neglect. The New York City Housing Authority had long avoided the failings that troubled authorities in other big cities. Towers in New York are the norm; maintenance and management remained strong, and high demand for housing allowed for renters with a greater range of incomes. But the city\u2019s 2,500 buildings, home to 400,000 New Yorkers, now need $17 billion in unmet repairs. The problem is often worse in small cities and less-urban areas, because there is no other supply of low-income rentals once dilapidated public housing is shuttered. HUD, rather than trying to replenish its dangerously insufficient capital fund, submitted a 2018 budget that would slash it by another two-thirds.All of this comes amid an affordable-housing crisis that is as urgent as it is unheeded. Today, only one of every five families poor enough to qualify for a housing subsidy actually receives one. A quarter of all renters nationwide pay more than half their income in rent. Families are forced to make harmful choices between rent and food, doctor\u2019s visits and education costs. In their search for what public-housing agencies had promised as the minimal requirement of a \u201cdecent, safe and sanitary home,\u201d the poor have been pushed farther from the economic activity and opportunities of city centers. The current head of the Chicago Housing Authority, Eugene Jones Jr., has envisioned a remedy, albeit an unlikely one, coming in the form of an infrastructure bill that would fully fund housing assistance, coupling the subsidy with the wraparound services \u2014 health care, day care, job training and transportation \u2014 that residents need to thrive. \u201cI\u2019m not a Republican, but we\u2019re trying to transform our residents out of public and assisted housing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe end game is that you\u2019re moving off subsistence.\u201d It\u2019s a noble goal. But there simply is no adequate supply of housing at that next step up. In 2014, when the C.H.A. opened a lottery just to make it onto the waiting list for either a voucher or public-housing unit, 280,000 families entered their names, a quarter of all the households in Chicago.Around the old Cabrini-Green and other expensive urban real estate markets, close-cropped towers are again being built. These are high-end private developments, although they occasionally set aside a number of subsidized apartments for an allotted period of time in exchange for tax breaks and building rights. The common sentiment is that the people who can afford the luxury high-rises have created their own good fortune; the generous government benefits they receive are rightfully earned. For those in Wentworth Gardens or Chicago\u2019s distant South Side or any impoverished neighborhood in the country, no political will exists anymore for the government to step in and transform the blocks that have been left to decline. Affordable-housing advocates are by no means pushing for a return to large public-housing high-rise developments, but some have noted that a few towers mixed in here and there with the luxury condos wouldn\u2019t stand out.There are calls to again mobilize the country\u2019s resources. The Bipartisan Policy Center has endorsed a universal voucher program that would guarantee rental assistance to the country\u2019s 11.4 million extremely low income households. Several studies by the Urban Institute and other research organizations show that such an endeavor would recoup much of its cost in reduced homelessness and also ease health problems and other consequences of instability that are ultimately paid for by governments. Several organizations in recent years have proposed tax credits for cost-burdened low-income households. And a bill introduced numerous times by the Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison sets out to cut the mortgage-interest deduction for wealthier homeowners and use the $200 billion in savings over 10 years to close the affordable-housing deficit. Congress did, in fact, cut the mortgage-interest deduction as part of last December\u2019s tax bill, though by much less than low-income housing proponents had wanted. The savings went not to creating affordable housing but to offsetting the tax benefits that Republicans doled out to corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Seventy years into our test as a country to provide housing for those who have too little, we are hardly any closer to passing.Rose and her toddler daughter remained in the apartment at Wentworth Gardens. Her brothers slept there less and less frequently. With their mother gone, their lives became more itinerant. They stayed with girlfriends or with other siblings scattered around the city and the surrounding suburbs. Wentworth hadn\u2019t become any safer for them. Reggie, in his early 20s, was arrested there after another fight. A group of guys at the development pounced on Raqkown and broke a bone in his neck. But it wasn\u2019t clear where they would be better off. Raequonn Ricks Williams, a 19-year-old relative, was shot on the West Side, one of the 762 people murdered in Chicago in 2016. Reggie and his mother had squabbled before her death. He\u2019d been turned down at more than a dozen job interviews, and Annie Ricks berated him for giving up. He racked up arrests. \u201cWhen Reggie left Cabrini, he felt his whole family was gone,\u201d Kenosha said of her younger brother. \u201cHis immediate family plus everybody he was in, like, preschool with.\u201dRose left finally for an apartment building 25 blocks farther south. She had got her daughter into a school near there, and she had also come to feel haunted at Wentworth, always expecting to see her mother emerge from one of the bedrooms. Back in 2014, at her mother\u2019s funeral, Rose had been unable to speak through her tears. A hundred former Cabrini-Green residents showed up at the West Side church to pay their respects. Rose\u2019s siblings talked about their mother\u2019s stubbornness, her determination to provide for them: \u201cWhat she didn\u2019t have, she made sure we had it,\u201d one said. Reggie said he didn\u2019t care that he had a terrible singing voice, and he started in on an R. Kelly song: \u201cDear Mama, you wouldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019m goin\u2019 through/But still I got my head up just like I promised you.\u201d Kenton, Ricks\u2019s fourth of nine sons, said they all learned from her example. \u201cBe strong, take care of the kids, take care of family,\u201d he repeated. She made them all better people. \u201cShe\u2019d do anything for anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just love.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cash-Strapped Chinese Giant Taps a New Money Source: Its Workers", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Just before payday, an email went out to employees from top executives: Give us your money, and we\u2019ll make it worth your while.It was one of many pitches by HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate struggling under an estimated $90 billion in debt accumulated during a global shopping spree that included buying stakes in multinationals like Hilton Hotels and Deutsche Bank.The company, in an email, advertised an \u201cemployee treasure\u201d product with an 8.5 percent return if workers handed over $1,500. A similar one dangled 9 percent. A third mentioned a return as high as 40 percent if employees ponied up $15,000.These pitches, more than a dozen of which were reviewed by The New York Times, were not part of an employee stock program. Instead, they appear to be high interest loans, with the company as borrower and its workers as lenders.It is unclear how much money HNA has raised from employees. The company has long offered such investments to its employees as a way to incentivize them and to share in the company\u2019s success, Thomas A. Clare, an attorney for HNA, said in an email.\u201cHNA has never approached the offering of these products and opportunities as a financing mechanism, as the amounts contributed by HNA employees to these opportunities are a very small percentage of the funds raised,\u201d he said.Companies around the world allow employees to buy stock or provide other ways for workers to invest in the business. But the HNA pitches do not offer direct ownership stakes in the business.The offers reviewed by The Times had similar hallmarks, namely high returns for funding certain operations.In an email dated Jan. 4, one HNA unit told employees that it needed nearly $8 million to fund a duty free business. It advertised a 9.8 percent annualized interest rate. One week later, HNA\u2019s media and entertainment arm said it was looking to raise nearly $80 million from employees, pledging strong returns and a plan to build up the business.Some emails have asked for big investments, while others emphasized how little employees have to invest to be eligible for hefty returns. One email, dated Jan. 17, offered commissions to employees who referred friends and family.\u201cIf you successfully invite someone else to invest in fixed-term wealth management products,\u201d the email told employees, \u201cyou can get a high commission.\u201d The email did not elaborate.In one seven-day period in January, an HNA employee received seven separate pitches. Mr. Clare said any increase would be the result of trying to incentivize more employees.Chinese companies have often turned to individual investors or their own workers to raise money. But such moves, according to some China finance experts, can signal problems.\u201cIt\u2019s a desperation measure when companies really have no other source of financing and they are stuck,\u201d said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research, a corporate research firm.\u201cInternal funding is a common way for companies to raise funds,\u201d said Sun Lijian, an associate professor at the China Center for Economic Study at Fudan University in Shanghai.\u201cBut employees shouldn\u2019t be forced to contribute and they should be informed of all the details of the project including the risks,\u201d he added.Raising money from workers is legal in China if an employer clears regulatory hurdles, experts say, particularly permission from the country\u2019s central bank. The People\u2019s Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment.Companies raising money directly from Chinese investors must obtain licenses from securities, insurance or banking regulators. The HNA pitches reviewed by The Times did not say whether they were reviewed by regulators.Mr. Clare, HNA\u2019s attorney, said that the offerings comply with all laws and referred questions to the various Chinese regulatory agencies, which did not respond to requests for comment.HNA sometimes directed employees to Jubaohui, its online investment portal, which is generally open to Chinese investors. The portal also has an employees-only area. Publicly, HNA often positions itself as a major player on the move, with talented leadership and vast resources at its disposal.Jubaohui has had trouble paying back some investors, according to an email sent to an investor and reviewed by The Times. It promised to pay later at a higher interest rate, after it was unable to make the final payments of two investments at the end of last year.Mr. Clare, the attorney for HNA, said, \u201cAbsent specific evidence that Jubaohui was actually late in making a required payment, there is no basis for any such statement or speculation.\u201dAs HNA has faced more questions about its operations by both the local and foreign media, the company has issued groupwide emails urging employees to not speak to reporters.

{"Headline": "1.5 Million Retirees Await Congressional Fix for a Pension Time Bomb", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe deal creates a select congressional committee to craft what could effectively be a federal rescue of as many as 200 so-called \u201cmultiemployer\u201d pension plans \u2014 in which employers and labor unions band together to provide retirement benefits to employees.Many of these plans are hurtling toward insolvency in the coming decade, with benefits owed to retirees projected to swamp what the plans can afford to pay. The 16-member, bipartisan committee will have to come up with a solution and legislation by the end of November, which the full Senate would need to vote on by the end of the year.Select congressional committees have long struggled to produce results, like one during the Barack Obama administration meant to reduce the growth of the national debt. This committee\u2019s work will be complicated by disagreements over whether companies, retirees or taxpayers should bear the brunt of the cost for shoring up pension plans that would otherwise run out of money.Pension plans across the nation are facing shortfalls, with both corporate plans and those for public employees like teachers and firefighters owing more to retirees than the investment funds can possibly pay. But the looming collapse of the multiemployer pension system is significant given the sheer number of people affected and the potential for a devastating economic ripple effect: retirees losing the pension checks that keep them afloat and a potential wave of bankruptcies among the companies that once employed those workers.The situation has been brewing since the 2008 financial crisis, as investments plummeted, leaving many plans in the red. The slow economic recovery and recent stock market rally have not been sufficient to reinvigorate the plans, which are jointly funded by labor unions and employers whose workers participate in them.\u201cWe want the system stabilized and fixed in the long term because we\u2019re in so many plans and we have a lot of employees in the plans,\u201d said Chris Langan, vice president of finance at U.P.S. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is not wise to wait on.\u201dNow, Congress must decide whether to rescue these funds with low-cost loans, force them to cut benefit payments or let the funds go bankrupt and wipe out retirees\u2019 entire pensions.Ms. Wong and other advocates of congressional action say they are optimistic that the committee can achieve rare bipartisan success. Members of Congress across the aisle, they say, are coming to grips with the cost of doing nothing.\u201cThis committee forces Congress to get serious,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, a longtime champion of unions who represents many retirees covered by the pension plans, and who fought for the committee\u2019s creation in the spending bill. \u201cIt forces us to come together and work out differences.\u201dIf the multiemployer pension plans go broke, the federal safety net created to protect retirees will not have enough money to make good on the promised benefits, leaving workers with little to no retirement benefits.\u201cIt\u2019s an urgent problem that needs to be fixed,\u201d said Alicia H. Munnell, a management professor at Boston College and the director of its Center for Retirement Research. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s an ideological divide \u2014 do you bail these people out or not?\u201d\u201cNo one wants to see old, poor people penniless in retirement,\u201d she said.Mike Walden, a retired Teamster and the president of the National United Committee to Protect Pensions, has led fellow retirees to Washington for several years to pressure members of Congress to fix the problem. Retirees, already squeezed by living on a fixed income, are frustrated at the prospect of seeing their benefits reduced or eliminated if Congress does not act, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand, when they take money away from us, how much they\u2019re going to hurt the economy.\u201dMr. Walden called the creation of the committee a \u201cmeaningful step\u201d to soothe nervous retirees. \u201cIt\u2019s been way too long \u2014 just talk, talk, talk, talk,\u201d he said.To succeed, the committee must navigate Washington\u2019s aversion to anything that resembles a bailout, particularly as the government is running large deficits that are projected to grow $7 trillion over the next decade \u2014 and when many Republicans see unions as political enemies.And Congress has already tried to help these plans, with little success. In 2014, the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act was enacted to help funds develop rescue plans, including by reducing benefits to retirees. In 2015, Central States submitted such a plan to the Treasury Department, but it was rejected the following year on the grounds that the proposed benefit reductions were unlikely to help the fund avoid insolvency.\u201cThis is beyond party affiliation, this really cuts to the root of what retirement is going to look like,\u201d said Mr. Neal, who will be a member of the special committee and has been working to recruit more House Republicans to support his proposal.The Trump administration has been largely quiet on the situation, but when asked about it at a congressional hearing last week, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, noted that it was a \u201csignificant\u201d issue and promised to offer technical assistance to support any solution that lawmakers find.As congressional negotiators homed in on a spending deal early this year, Mr. Brown pushed Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, to attach his pension language to the larger budget agreement. The bill establishes a process to ensure that if the commission produces a bill supported by a majority of its Democratic and Republican members, the Senate will vote on that bill before a new Congress convenes next year.If concern over retirees is not enough to get lawmakers to act, those who represent pension funds hope that concern about the broader economy will. Michael D. Scott, executive director for the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, projects that if all of the pension plans that are in \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201ccritical and declining\u201d condition go broke, the federal government would face a half trillion dollars in lost tax revenue over the next decade because of the taxes that the active funds currently pay.\u201cI think ultimately the government is going to look at how much tax revenue it is going to lose without a solution,\u201d Mr. Scott said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do Trump\u2019s \u2018Approval\u2019 Numbers Tell Us About Him, or About Us?", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsEvery few weeks, an email arrives from the Republican National Committee, requesting my attention to a matter of great national consequence. \u201cApproval Poll Response: PENDING\u201d is the subject line of the latest. \u201cThe President has asked us to reach out to some of our top supporters for a one-question poll,\u201d it begins. \u201cThe President\u2019s job performance has been ...\u201d There are four possible responses: \u201cgreat,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cO.K.\u201d or \u201cother.\u201d\u201cThank you for your input, Friend,\u201d the email concludes. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sure to pass it along to President Trump.\u201dHe is not the first modern president to obsess over these ratings, but the nature of his obsession is different. Presidents from Lyndon Johnson to George W. Bush spoke bluntly about approval as a means to an end. For Trump, approval seems to be the end. His primary pre-presidential business was, quite literally, being popular, and now that he is in the White House, mass approval is the one thing that is consistently denied to him. There is something oddly poignant about the R.N.C. email polls; they\u2019re like the birthday card that a middle manager hustles the hourly employees to sign for a company president who everyone knows has just gone through a rough divorce.What\u2019s most bizarre about this particular manifestation of Trump\u2019s exhausting, relentless need for external affirmation, though, is how ill placed it is. No president has ever been so publicly consumed with his approval numbers. And no president has ever had less reason to care about them.We have George Gallup, the originator of the Gallup poll, to thank for this ambiguity. An Iowa-born journalism professor and advertising consultant, Gallup spent years pondering what question might best assess presidential performance \u2014 separating it, in the minds of poll respondents, from considerations like voting preference and personal affinity \u2014 before arriving in 1945 at the wording Gallup and other pollsters have used ever since. Frank Newport, Gallup\u2019s current editor in chief, explains that the \u201capprove or disapprove\u201d question is expansive by design. \u201cWhen you vote, you have an up or down choice on a candidate, right?\u201d he told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a nuanced choice.\u201d Or, as Gallup himself put it in 1940, in a sort of civics-class koan, \u201cthe limitations and the shortcomings of the polls are the limitations and shortcomings of public opinion itself.\u201dThis rankled Daniel J. Boorstin, the conservative historian and social critic, who criticized Gallup in his 1962 book, \u201cThe Image.\u201d Boorstin described public-opinion research as \u201ca kind of pseudo-event, forced into existence for the primary purpose of being reported\u201d \u2014 an unreal thing with real consequences. What \u201capproval\u201d measures in a presidency may be hard to pin down, but what it gets you is not: Higher numbers have historically meant more effective dealings with Congress \u2014 whose leaders read approval polls as a measure of their leverage with the president \u2014 and better chances of re-election.And yet there is a wealth of research showing that \u201capproval\u201d is largely, if not entirely, beyond a president\u2019s control. In 2002, the political scientists Robert S. Erikson, Michael B. Mackuen and James A. Stimson found that more than half of the variance in a president\u2019s approval ratings could be explained by either the performance of the national economy or by big events like international crises, assassination attempts and scandals \u2014 factors over which a president may not exert much influence at all. Jimmy Carter gained 20 points when Iranian student demonstrators occupied the United States Embassy in Tehran. Ronald Reagan picked up seven after being shot.None of this has dissuaded presidents from trying to influence their own approval ratings. Reagan was the first to bring a public-opinion expert, Richard Wirthlin, onto the White House team. Wirthlin\u2019s firm went on to test public opinion for George H.W. Bush in the lead-up to the Persian Gulf war; Dick Cheney, at the time Bush\u2019s defense secretary, would later grumble in his memoirs that Colin Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \u201cseemed more comfortable talking about poll numbers than he was recommending military options.\u201d As the war approached its conclusion, crowds of supporters were ushered onto the White House lawn with signs trumpeting Bush\u2019s approval rating: \u201cWE \u2665 GEORGE \u2014 91%.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How South Vietnam Defeated Itself", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam '67In the early hours of Jan. 30, 1968, the first Communist rockets struck provincial capitals across South Vietnam. A nationwide ground assault followed, and by morning the next day, much of the urban South was besieged, including Saigon\u2019s radio station, the South Vietnamese military headquarters and even the American Embassy. What local papers dubbed the \u201cYear of Sand\u201d \u2014 referring to the ubiquitous sandbags appearing in front of the nation\u2019s doors and windows \u2014 was well underway.In the United States, the attacks, which came to be known as the Tet offensive, are remembered as a psychological turning point, the moment when President Johnson is said to have lost the faith of CBS broadcaster Walter Cronkite \u2014 and by extension, the public at large. Indeed, though Communist forces suffered substantial losses in manpower and morale, the contradiction between American officials\u2019 buoyant promises and weeks of astonishing televised carnage was never reconciled. But Tet\u2019s political impact in South Vietnam proved equally significant, and no less critical, in determining the outcome of the war.As a result, a moment that could have been a turning point for the country became the beginning of the end. When the government finally surrendered to Communist tanks in April 1975, the South\u2019s political fate had long since been sealed.South Vietnam may appear, in hindsight, to have been a doomed political experiment. But in the wake of Tet, its supporters felt a new sense of urgency. In spite of the devastating violence, the South\u2019s response to the Tet attacks represented the zenith of anti-Communist nationalism in the country.Cast for the first time into the forefront of the war, urban anti-Communist political observers were roused to action, and they reached across deep-seated political, regional and religious divides. They channeled their newfound energy into a series of broad-based umbrella groups, including the National Social Democratic Front and the National Salvation Front (or the \u201cLi\u00ean Minh,\u201d \u201cThe League\u201d). This unprecedented outburst of collective action was propelled by a dawning awareness that the South\u2019s arcane factions were no match for the Communist political machine.Beyond these uncharacteristic expressions of camaraderie, the post-Tet groundswell also breathed life into the South\u2019s new constitutional system, hitherto scorned or dismissed after the previous year\u2019s rigged presidential election. With the country reeling from the bloodshed, fledgling institutions like the revived National Assembly provided a blueprint for political cooperation, and a forum for republican constitutionalists who, whatever their reservations about the military regime, saw no future for themselves under one-party Communist rule.Infuriated by the violence, longtime government critics hastened to denounce the Communist attacks. Even the An Quang Buddhist group, whose 1963 and 1966 rebellions had brought the state to its knees, now cast its lot with the new constitutional system. Shaken by the ferocity of the onslaught in central Vietnam, An Quang ruled out accommodation with the Communists. Though there was little love for the South Vietnamese military, the group\u2019s lay leaders opted to take their chances under Saigon\u2019s uneven authority, which they judged far less capable than Hanoi of fulfilling its authoritarian aspirations.To that end, An Quang raised eyebrows in 1970 by embracing and prevailing in the Senate elections, securing a third of the contested seats. More remarkably, as the political situation deteriorated in subsequent years, An Quang refrained from actively challenging the state, even as traditionally loyal parties took to the streets in anger. An Quang\u2019s unexpected restraint was a critical if overlooked factor in prolonging South Vietnam\u2019s survival, and a symbol of the constitutional system\u2019s squandered potential.Meanwhile, heartened by the post-Tet spirit of determination and solidarity, the South\u2019s urban civil society implored the state to capitalize on that spirit by carrying out much-needed reforms.Phan Quang Dan, an opposition leader admired for bravely enduring torture by government henchmen, was one of many who leapt at the newfound possibilities. Dan proclaimed Tet to be \u201ca tremendous opportunity to turn a temporary military success into a decisive political victory \u2014 if it is seized upon by the South Vietnamese government to move forward fast, reorganize the military and the administration, wipe out corruption, carry out sweeping land reforms, mobilize active popular participation and achieve national unity.\u201dThis was, to be sure, a tall order. Still, as the military\u2019s cocksure vice president, Nguyen Cao Ky, observed during a March 1968 radio interview, \u201cI know that they\u201d \u2014 Saigon residents \u2014 \u201cstill don\u2019t like us very much, but on the other hand, at least I\u2019m now sure they also detest Communists.\u201dWithin Ky\u2019s characteristically glib remarks, however, lay an uncomfortable truth for Saigon\u2019s ruling generals: Waves of anti-Communist anger after Tet were no assurance of loyalty to the much-reviled military regime.Hue residents, meanwhile, were incensed by Communist kidnappings and executions \u2014 but also by indiscriminate American firepower. They reserved special contempt for the South Vietnamese military, which had fled at the first sign of trouble only to pillage the city\u2019s remains once the dust settled.In this regard, Hue\u2019s experience was not atypical. Flight followed by looting was a recurring pattern for the South Vietnamese military, which repeated its Hue performance in Soc Trang, Da Lat and Vinh Long, among other provincial towns. The garrison at Tuy Hoa, the capital of Phu Yen province, vanished before a shot was fired. Reinforcements eventually arrived, but only after the Communists left of their own accord. The troops, nonetheless, staged an elaborate victory procession followed by a comprehensive sacking of the town. \u201cThe army didn\u2019t defeat the Communists, it defeated us,\u201d a local civilian lamented.American responses were likewise roundly condemned. Hoping to dislodge Communist resistance, American air and artillery strikes leveled the city of Nha Trang, while over 3,000 houses were destroyed in Saigon\u2019s District 8 alone. Nearby Gia Dinh province, meanwhile, saw an estimated 20,000 residents left homeless during the first few weeks of the campaign.The nationwide barrage fueled a spiraling anti-American backlash. By the early 1970s, United States personnel were subject to routine street confrontations, and increasingly confined to remote bases. All the while, conspiracy-minded Vietnamese devoured rumors of C.I.A. collusion in the Communist attacks, an apparent pretext for accelerating American withdrawal. Responding to the outcry, the Lower House of the National Assembly issued a formal complaint, and government mouthpieces like the newspaper Cong Chung (The Public) charged the United States with destroying Hue.In the cities, the initial shock inspired renewed determination, but the offensive was a severe psychological blow in much of the countryside. Having witnessed the military\u2019s cowardice, exploitation of civilian misery and inability to resist the initial attacks, rural constituents lost faith in the state\u2019s ability or desire to protect them.Moreover, contrary to the notion that Tet marked an irrevocable defeat for the southern communists, the aftermath was a fluid and protracted affair. Through much of 1968, the Communists strengthened their position in large swathes of the countryside, pinning American and South Vietnamese ground troops in bases and cities. Initial losses were balanced by ramped-up infiltration from the North, albeit at the cost of mounting regional tensions within the ranks. Only the following year, after an American counterattack characterized by indiscriminate firepower and heavy civilian casualties, did the military balance gradually turn \u2014 and even then, the Communist retreat was tactical as much as imposed.Responding to waning civilian morale after their promises of imminent victory proved hollow, Communist partisans ruthlessly applied the stick, intensifying conscription and assassinating those who dared side with the Saigon regime. But they also took care to dangle carrots. In Phuoc Tuy province, for instance, cadres went door-to-door collecting lists of required medications, which they procured on the black market and distributed to grateful villagers.In part through such efforts, the Communists\u2019 political network stayed intact even as the military laid low. Income taken in by the South covered barely 30 percent of expenses, but Communist tax collection continued apace. After Tet, the C.I.A. reported, the Communists remained able to \u201cmobilize from within South Vietnam most of the funds and nonmilitary supplies needed to support the Communist insurgency.\u201d The Viet Cong \u201cexercise considerable control over the production, processing and movement of many commodities essential to South Vietnam\u2019s economy,\u201d while its \u201ctax system draws revenues from virtually every segment of the\u201d South\u2019s economy. Even France\u2019s Michelin rubber plantations, clustered in the nearest province west of Saigon, made regular payments to Communist coffers.Years after the attacks, the Communist presence around the capital remained formidable. In Long An province, immediately south of Saigon, American intelligence conceded that nearly half of the Communists\u2019 village-level revolutionary committees were as effective as the South Vietnamese state in supplying goods and services. The Viet Cong, it went on, \u201chave been able to organize regular schools in certain areas and have even staged public spectacles.\u201dFighting a losing political battle, the South Vietnamese government acknowledged that sweeping reforms were required if it was to stand any chance of wooing the disaffected rural majority. But as usual, progress was delayed for years by perennial political infighting.President Thieu\u2019s archrival, the flamboyant Vice President Ky, seized on Tet as a chance to turn the tables on his nemesis. Ky charged Thieu with inaction, promising dramatic responses of his own, including the liberation of the North by force. Behind the scenes, he worked to assemble backing for a military coup. But when word of Ky\u2019s plotting reached the American Embassy, he was summoned for a dressing-down, with the deputy ambassador, Samuel Berger, pounding his fists on the table in frustration.Assured of American backing, Thieu quietly made his move, relieving Ky\u2019s military loyalists of their duties, including some of the army\u2019s most capable commanders.Paranoid and reclusive, Thieu continued lashing out at rivals, real and imagined, including Tran Ngoc Chau, an esteemed counterinsurgency specialist. Chau\u2019s unconstitutional arrest, however, provoked howls of protest in the National Assembly, which retaliated by delaying Thieu\u2019s signature Land Reform program for well over a year.To his credit, Thieu was the driving force behind that initiative, called \u201cLand to the Tiller,\u201d overcoming American reservations through the tireless efforts of his agriculture minister, Cao Van Than. But while South Vietnam\u2019s proponents then and since have seen land reform as a panacea for the government\u2019s enduring unpopularity, the results at the time were far more mixed.The breakthrough came from Saigon\u2019s de facto recognition of the Communists\u2019 own wildly popular land redistribution efforts, implemented across the South years or even decades earlier. To avoid eruptions of animosity when absentee owners attempted to reclaim requisitioned land, the government sagely bestowed legal title to beneficiaries of previous Communist land reform campaigns.However sound a policy, this approach enraged the government\u2019s beleaguered rural loyalists, who accused the state of betrayal for rewarding those who had backed the other side. Military veterans, often forced to abandon their land after impressment, also greeted the news with dismay.Worse still, implementation proved slow, uneven and plagued by corruption. For years to follow, pockets of farmers continued paying rent on land that neither the government nor former landlords deigned to inform them they now owned. Refugee beneficiaries complained that their allotments were inaccessible or unsafe due to military disinterest in providing security, while communities in arid Central Vietnam bemoaned land valuations based on those of the more fertile Mekong Delta. Loans for sorely needed farm equipment were all too often siphoned off by unscrupulous local officials, and recipients among the country\u2019s ethnic minorities despaired at systematic Vietnamese encroachment.While land reform was a welcome effort that achieved some qualified success, it did little to diminish Communist influence, or alleviate soaring inflation and corruption. In areas once held by the Communists, the impact was titular rather than transformative, with farmers awarded title to lands they assumed they had already long since owned. If anything, absentee landlords were the primary beneficiaries, granted generous American-subsidized compensation for property they had little prospect of recovering.Back in the urban centers, meanwhile, the burst of post-Tet solidarity gave way to anger over plummeting living standards and corruption. Starved of government attention, let alone funding, pan-religious coalitions like the nominally state-backed National Social Democratic Front descended into scheming and bickering, while provincial enthusiasts waited in vain for leadership from the capital. In fact, as President Thieu\u2019s private secretary later revealed, covert C.I.A. subsidies to the N.S.D.F. were instead pocketed for personal use by high-ranking officials. Absent official backing, these promising stabs at political unity died on the vine.Instead, fresh from re-election after his opponents withdrew in protest, Thieu was busy preparing his own decidedly unpluralistic political vehicle: \u201cthe Democracy Party.\u201d In reality, the party was anything but democratic, with its compulsory civil service participation and clandestine military cells earning unfavorable comparisons with the Communist Party. But Thieu, who had long since tired of opposition and resistance to his agenda, envisioned the Democracy Party as a means of binding anti-Communists together from above. Ramming through decrees that all but proscribed any other party, he then coerced bureaucrats and military officers into joining Democracy Party ranks.But rather than rallying southern society behind his rule, as Thieu had implausibly gambled, the Democracy Party further alienated the country\u2019s most committed anti-communists, who instead pledged to uphold their previous allegiances. The political party decrees also dealt a death blow to the Senate, by now the South\u2019s last independent political institution. In 1967, a new generation of sincere, enthusiastic politicians had won seats; by 1973, when Thieu replaced the Senate with his own handpicked politicians, the institution\u2019s resistance had been broken.On the eve of the Senate\u2019s 1973 replacement, an onlooker recorded the despondent remarks of a departing member: \u201c\u2018The noble experiment at constitutionalism launched in 1967 was turning sour.\u2019 He had been surprised in 1967, [the senator] said, \u2018at the number of qualified people who engaged themselves enthusiastically in the experiment by running for office that year\u2019 \u2026 \u2018These good people are retreating once again,\u2019 the senator concluded, \u2018once more waiting for some watershed before engaging themselves.\u2019\u201dDuring the final years of the war, even ferociously anti-Communist northern Catholic groups, long the state\u2019s staunchest proponents, lost faith in the state\u2019s ability to address the nation\u2019s cascading crises. The prevailing sense of dread was a far cry from the energy and purpose that had invigorated the anti-Communist South after Tet. And it took its toll on the military, whose rank and file likewise lost faith in the country\u2019s unresponsive leaders. Drained of discipline and confidence by the spring of 1975, the South\u2019s lavishly equipped military was once again set on its heels by the first Communist skirmishes, with retreating soldiers commandeering frantic civilians\u2019 escape crafts.Still, belief in the notion of a non-Communist-led South Vietnam was always substantial, if also fragmented and disorganized. For all its flaws, the state was no mere puppet, and as a generation of American statesmen discovered, control of Saigon\u2019s purse-strings in no way bestowed control over its politics. Far more than any decision in Washington, it was the government\u2019s own failure to unite and inspire core constituents, or to secure a rural base, which provided the knockout blow.Sean Fear is a lecturer in international history at the University of Leeds.Advertisement"}

Guess Again", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTake a deep breath and relax.A whopping 84 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households. And that includes everyone\u2019s stakes in pension plans, 401(k)\u2019s and individual retirement accounts, as well as trust funds, mutual funds and college savings programs like 529 plans.There was a move toward democratizing stock ownership in the 1980s and 1990s, with the advent of individual retirement accounts, but the busts of 2001 and 2007 scared off some middle-class investors.But the day-to-day impact on most people\u2019s overall wealth is minimal.A look at some fundamentals may provide a clearer perspective.Roughly half of all households don\u2019t have a cent invested in stocks, whether through a 401(k) account or shares in General Electric. That leaves half the population with some exposure to financial market whims, but as Mr. Boshara said, \u201csome exposure can be 100 bucks.\u201d\u201cIf you look at where the money is really held, it\u2019s among the top 10 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you break it down by age, race and education and parental education, you\u2019ll see the disparities are even larger.\u201d Parents who lack a four-year degree and, later on, their children are much less likely to have a direct stake in the stock market than college graduates; blacks and Hispanics are much less likely than whites.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad such a small percentage of the population has any real or meaningful ownership stake in equities, given their historic and current growth,\u201d Mr. Boshara said.For 9 out of 10 households, even a shift in value of 10 percent \u2014 enough to qualify as a \u201cmarket correction\u201d \u2014 would \u201cat most, have a 1 or 2 percent impact on their wealth holdings,\u201d Mr. Wolff said.Still, valuations of assets and the country\u2019s economic health \u2014 as determined by productivity, employment, investment, spending, housing values, production capacity, growth and more \u2014 are two different kettles.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.\u201cOlder people can buy less stock,\u201d and fewer goods and services, because they are living off their investments rather than accumulating them, Mr. Steuerle said. But younger people can better afford to buy stock while it is cheap, which sets them up for bigger gains down the road.Advertisement"}

Tronc is likely to use the sale proceeds to pay down its debt.\u2014 Sydney EmberAfter days of sometimes wild moves in stock markets, investors on Wall Street refocused on the ongoing strength in the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A sometimes-panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated through the day, and the S.&P. 500 ended Tuesday\u2019s session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs.Investors appeared to reassess whether the previous day\u2019s violent decline\u2014the S.&P. suffered its worst decline since August 2011\u2014reflected actual fundamentals or was merely a long-overdue outbreak of investor jitters.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk higher, as measures of volatility\u2014the ups and downs of stock prices\u2014hit historically low levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop in which growth and inflation remained lackluster, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But the peaceful climb ended over the past week amid worries that solid economic growth in the United States and abroad could be showing early signals of growing inflation pressure. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data\u2014such as the U.S. jobs report on Friday\u2014showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.The Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became the latest prominent company to report solid earnings amidst the market turmoil. The strong numbers support the belief that plunging stock markets do not reflect weakness in the real economy.Disney made $1.89 per share in the last three months of 2017, after excluding a tax benefit. That number is 22 percent higher than the $1.55 per share earnings in the same period of 2016. It is also well in excess of the $1.61 per share that Wall Street analysts had forecast for the latest quarter.Disney did best in its parks and resorts business, which reported $1.35 billion of operating income, which was 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period. The earlier period\u2019s results were somewhat depressed by the impact of Hurricane Matthew, Disney said. In its press release, the company noted that higher profits at its domestic parks and resorts were driven by an increase in guest spending and an increase in attendance, which underscores consumers\u2019 willingness to spend more. On the other hand, the company said parks and resorts are dealing with higher labor costs and other expenses. That may not be lost on investors who are starting to see inflation as a threat to stock prices.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Numbers\u2022 Snap reported revenue rose 72 percent to $285.7 million, easily exceeding the $252.9 million expected by analysts.\u2022 The company lost 13 cents per share, below estimates of 16 cents a share.\u2022 Snap added 8.9 million daily active users for a total of 187 million, compared to the 184.2 million estimated.The ContextSnap\u2019s shares have struggled since its initial public offering in March 2017. The stock fell below its I.P.O price of $17 a share last summer and has remained below that level since. If Snap\u2019s after-hours gains hold up on Wednesday, the stock will be on the cusp of crossing back over its I.P.O. level.The stock market\u2019s slide over the past week has given investors plenty of anxiety.Stocks have lost roughly $4 trillion in value. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 endured their worst point declines in their histories Monday and their largest percentage drops since 2011. C.B.O.E. Volatility Index surged more than 100 percent Monday, the biggest increase in its history.But there are reasons investors shouldn\u2019t get too concerned.Strategists over at Goldman Sachs wrote:\u201cThe stock market correction appears to be more technical and positioning-driven rather than fundamentally-based.We believe the fundamental drivers of the equity market remain intact and reiterate our S&P 500 year-end 2018 forecast of 2850.\u201dHere\u2019s a video of the launch:When stock markets are plunging, sober-minded investors try to gauge the underlying strength of bellwether companies, to see whether all the selling is justified.That is why many eyes will be on the earnings of the Walt Disney Company, which reports after the close of regular trading Tuesday. If the company releases stronger-than-expected results for the three months through the end of December, it will reinforce a general sense of optimism about corporate America .Stellar results from Disney would add to a strong earnings report on Tuesday from General Motors, which helped push the company\u2019s shares 3 percent higher. Micron Technology, a large maker of computer chips, on Monday upped its outlook for the current quarter. Its shares soared 7.7 percent on Tuesday.Though Disney is not a high growth company, its results offer insight into the strength of consumer spending. As a result, if the company reports earnings that are below the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, it may add to the unease among investors..Of course, a lot more companies are going to have to report strong earnings to convince investors to jump back into the stock market. One of the reasons that stocks rallied in recent months is that analysts are expecting a 20-percent plus jump in profits in 2018, an eye-popping rise. The more large companies that hit their numbers in this earnings season, the more likely the stock market will find a floor.\u2014 Peter EavisAt a hearing of the Senate banking committee on Tuesday, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama asked the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the market turmoil.\u201cIs this perhaps more than an ordinary correction?\u201d Mr. Shelby asked.Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C. said that he could not tell what had caused the big declines, but he said that the market infrastructure had held up well under the strain of heavy trading.\u201cAs I sit here today, there\u2019s nothing that came out of this that concerns me,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the C.F.T.C. said that his staff had a late night on Monday checking in with all the exchanges, and had not heard anything that concerned them.\u201cThe system worked as it was designed to do,\u201d he said.\u2014 Nathaniel PopperFollowing a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that he has been in touch with market participants this week and that they are reacting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems. He said it was possible that algorithmic trading was partially responsible for the recent volatility in the stock market.\u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said.Despite that volatility, it does not appear that the Trump administration is ready to give up on the stock market as a measure of its success.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been looking at the long-term impact of the stock market, it\u2019s still up over 30 percent since the election and we continue to think American is a great place to do business,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with companies\u2019 response with more and more investments in the U.S.\u201dAsked about the roiled stock market at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the Trump administration was not concerned and that it remains focused on the long-term trajectory of the economy.\u201cWe are very focused on long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we have enacted, including tax reform are very positive for long-term economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He said that he was closely monitoring for orderly market functioning and that there were \u201cno systemic issues\u201d that were reported to him.\u201cI\u2019m happy to report I got the green lights,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The Treasury secretary said that given how much the market has rallied in the last year, he does not think the recent drop in prices raises financial stability concerns.Asked if the Trump administration will take the blame for the recent drop in stocks after taking credit for the rally, Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\u201cI think we\u2019ll still claim credit for the fact that it\u2019s up over 30 percent since the election,\u201d he said of the stock market.\u2014 Alan RappeportWhen stock markets sell off as they have the past two trading sessions, there is often more than one cause. But one popular trade is taking a lot of blame for Monday\u2019s plunge: short volatility.Investors had piled money into exchange-traded products designed to rise when the C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, falls. The VIX, known as the market\u2019s fear gauge, measures how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead. Those wagers paid off handsomely, rising 180 percent last year as the VIX plumbed historic lows.That quickly reversed Monday. The VIX surged 117 percent in its biggest one-day jump on record and two short volatility exchange-traded product \u2014 VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange Traded Note, XIV, and Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Inverse ETN \u2014 endured heavy selling.From Barclays:\u201cIn our opinion, the significant spike in the VIX index and futures yesterday was technical in nature and does not necessarily indicate a true increase in risk perception.\u201dFrom Morgan Stanley:\u201cThe near bankruptcy of the inverse VIX ETPs will be a very negative headline, and the several billion dollar loss for holders, largely retail, will scare some out of the market or force liquidations of other products to raise cash.\u201dFrom Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research:\u201c Assuming volatility-related ETFs really are a market structure \u201cAchilles heel\u201d, this will take days if not weeks to play out, and there could be other problems waiting in the wings.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u2022 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 5 percent.\u2022 Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 4.7 percent.\u2022 The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was down 2 percent.\u2022 Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d the VIX, is at its highest level in two and a half years.More from Ben White of Politico:\u201cThis is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,\u201d said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. \u201cUntil now, Trump\u2019s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed. Now she\u2019s out the door and volatility is back.\u201dInvestors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down.\u201cCryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,\u201d said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThe combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large.\u201dExpect more give-and-take between the two sides of Congress:\u201cI think everyone understands that this will probably end up being a Ping-Pong situation, and we\u2019ll see where the ball lands,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida.Elsewhere in policyMore from Alex Sherman of CNBC:An unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney\u2019s bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox\u2019s Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox\u2019s assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast.Elsewhere in the deal world\u201cI talked to women engineers at Uber who were getting invited to strip clubs and bondage clubs in the middle of the day. The middle of the day! And often they would go because that\u2019s just what everyone was doing.\u201dThe misconduct flyaroundThe venture firm, which has invested in the likes of Groupon, Dollar Shave Club and Nutanix, has closed both its 12th venture fund, at $800 million, and its latest side fund for later-stage deals, at $450 million.

In just a few years, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have a million truck drivers out of work who are 94 percent male, with an average level of education of high school or one year of college.\u201d\u201cThat one innovation,\u201d he continued, \u201cwill be enough to create riots in the street. And we\u2019re about to do the same thing to retail workers, call center workers, fast-food workers, insurance companies, accounting firms.\u201dDespite its popularity among left-leaning academics and executives, universal basic income is still a leaderless movement that has yet to break into mainstream politics. Mr. Yang thinks he can sell the idea in Washington by framing it as a pro-business policy.\u201cI\u2019m a capitalist,\u201d he said, \u201cand I believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue.\u201dMr. Yang, a married father of two boys, is a fast-talking extrovert who wears the nu-executive uniform of a blazer and jeans without a tie. He keeps a daily journal of things he\u2019s grateful for, and peppers conversations with business-world catchphrases like \u201ccore competency.\u201d After graduating from Brown University and Columbia Law School, he quit his job at a big law firm and began working in tech. He ran an internet start-up that failed during the first dot-com bust, worked as an executive at a health care start-up and helped build a test-prep business that was acquired by Kaplan in 2009, netting him a modest fortune.He caught the political bug after starting Venture for America, an organization modeled after Teach for America that connects recent college graduates with start-up businesses. During his travels to Midwestern cities, he began to connect the growth of anti-establishment populism with the rise of workplace automation.\u201cUniversal basic income is an old idea,\u201d Mr. Yang said, \u201cbut it\u2019s an old idea that right now is uniquely relevant because of what we\u2019re experiencing in society.\u201dMr. Yang\u2019s prominent supporters include Andy Stern, a former leader of Service Employees International Union, who credited him with \u201copening up a discussion that the country\u2019s afraid to have.\u201d His campaign has also attracted some of Silicon Valley\u2019s elites. Tony Hsieh, the chief executive of Zappos, is an early donor to Mr. Yang\u2019s campaign, as are several venture capitalists and high-ranking alumni of Facebook and Google.Mr. Yang, who has raised roughly $130,000 since filing his official paperwork with the Federal Election Commission in November, says he will ultimately raise millions from supporters in the tech industry and elsewhere to supplement his own money.And although he said he was socially liberal, he admitted that he hadn\u2019t fully developed all his positions. (On most social issues, Mr. Yang said, \u201cI believe what you probably think I believe.\u201d)The likelihood, of course, is that Mr. Yang\u2019s candidacy won\u2019t end with a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Still, experts I spoke with were glad to have him talking about the long-term risks of automation, at a time when much of Washington is consumed with the immediate and visible.Erik Brynjolfsson, the director of M.I.T.\u2019s Initiative on the Digital Economy and a co-author of \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d praised Mr. Yang for bringing automation\u2019s economic effects into the conversation.\u201cThis is a serious problem, and it\u2019s going to get a lot worse,\u201d Mr. Brynjolfsson said. \u201cIn every election for the next 10 or 20 years, this will become a more salient issue, and the candidates who can speak to it effectively will do well.\u201dMr. Yang knows he could sound the automation alarm without running for president. But he feels a sense of urgency. In his view, there\u2019s no time to mess around with think-tank papers and \u201csuper PACs,\u201d because the clock is ticking.\u201cWe have five to 10 years before truckers lose their jobs,\u201d he said, \u201cand all hell breaks loose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republicans Have Become the Party of Debt", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSo much for all that sanctimony about fiscal responsibility. Forever and always, it can now be said that Republican lawmakers care about the federal deficit only when they want to use it to bash Democratic presidents.\u201cIf you were against President Obama\u2019s deficits, and now you\u2019re for the Republican deficits, isn\u2019t that the very definition of hypocrisy?\u201d Senator Rand Paul said as he held up passage of the budget bill for a few hours \u2014 perhaps until he realized that the definition fit him, too, since he had voted for the tax cuts that will blow up the deficit.Deficit spending can be an indispensable tool \u2014 to revive an ailing economy, invest in productive infrastructure, rebuild after natural disasters and pay for unavoidable wars. And it was vital for the government to run large deficits after the financial crisis, when the country was tumbling into the worst recession since the Depression.But the Republican leaders who opposed stimulus spending in 2011 and 2012, when many Americans were struggling to find jobs and the economy was in the doldrums, are now making the absurd argument that the government ought to do more to fuel the economy at a time when the unemployment rate is about half what it was back then and corporate profits have soared.Dilapidated roads, bridges, railways and water systems need to be upgraded and repaired. Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida still need help recovering from last year\u2019s hurricanes and making themselves more resilient to future storms. Lawmakers also must spend more to end the opioid epidemic and increase access to substance abuse treatment. The budget bill only partly addresses many of these and other needs.Democrats went along with this budget. They\u2019re the minority party and have limited leverage, and at the moment they are not deploying it very effectively, as has been demonstrated by their failure thus far to clarify their priorities or win protection from deportation for the Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Placeholder Prime Minister Departs. What Comes Next?", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsMr. Hailemariam came to power in 2012 after the death of Meles Zenawi, who had presided over the country since 1991 with an iron fist. Mr. Hailemariam was largely seen as an ineffective placeholder and from the outset, he faced difficulties, lacking a political base of his own. Hailing from a small minority group in the south of the country, the Wolayta, he quickly fell out with Ethiopia\u2019s three dominant ethnic groups \u2014 the Oromo, the Amhara and the Tigrayans.Mr. Hailemariam eventually became a man without allies; his resignation was hardly a surprise, it just came earlier than anticipated. He was widely expected to be replaced later this year when the E.P.R.D.F. holds its congress.Still, the transition is unlikely to be straightforward, as the imposition of a new state of emergency vividly demonstrates. The E.P.R.D.F. Council, which has the power to choose Mr. Hailemariam\u2019s replacement, is expected to meet shortly to pick a successor. The Constitution stipulates that the prime minister be a member of the federal Parliament. This could be a source of further complication: Mr. Lemma isn\u2019t a member of Parliament. There would have to be a snap election or an extraordinary political decision to facilitate his rise. That is unlikely in the short run, but not impossible \u2014 if the party so chooses.Regardless, the winds of change sweeping across Africa have arrived in Ethiopia. The country\u2019s future is shrouded in so much doubt and uncertainty, but it is impossible to imagine business as usual. The status quo is no longer tenable. And Ethiopia\u2019s allies, including the United States, its biggest donor, can help mitigate these risks by pressing the regime to choose the correct path.The E.P.R.D.F. can\u2019t do it alone. In his televised address on Thursday, Mr. Hailemariam emphasized the need for a national consensus, but consensus is not a single-party affair. The country\u2019s next leader must chart an inclusive transition that encompasses good-faith negotiation with the opposition. Otherwise Ethiopia is staring at years of instability.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why We Need a New \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 44______Pedro Almod\u00f3var shapes how we think of Spain. England will forever be \u201cMonty Python\u201d and \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d for many of us, while the American extremes \u2014 optimism, violence, humor and despair \u2014 are all visible via Hollywood.So what does \u201cCrocodile Dundee\u201d say about Australia?I watched the movie again last night, for the first time since its release in 1986. I was just a kid then and thought nothing of laughing at Paul Hogan\u2019s knife or his cluelessness about escalators and elevators in New York.Now, though, it\u2019s all a bit jarring.Dundee is still the highest-grossing Australian film of all time. He\u2019s the character many Americans most associate with this country, and yet the depiction of Australia (not to mention New York and journalism, given the reporters in limos) needs some serious updating.I was one of many who saw the clips and got excited. Joining Danny McBride as the son of Dundee were Australia\u2019s biggest stars, including Margot Robbie, Chris Hemsworth, Russell Crowe, and Hugh Jackman.The trailer\u2019s premise \u2014 the foolish Americanized son of an Australian legend returns to the bush \u2014 also suggested a chance to poke fun at Americans and American assumptions about Australia. Bring it, I thought.But what looked like a summer film was actually a setup for a Super Bowl ad. Tourism Australia duped us all, aiming directly at America\u2019s love for the Dundee story, with the goal of exploiting it.And it seems to be working.\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying to North America is you\u2019re welcome in our country and we want you to visit,\" he said. \u201cThat character really does bring that to the fore in a way that no other character has really done before.\u201dPerhaps. It\u2019s true that Dundee is quite welcoming to the visiting American reporter played by Linda Kozlowski (Hogan ended up marrying her in real life) and there\u2019s clearly something deeper going on with Dundee and Aussie identity.More than anything else, he seems to represent the newly proud Australian, the man who doesn\u2019t apologize for not being born English, who relishes his own, very pronounced accent and vocabulary, and who celebrates skepticism and the old, frontier values, more or less simultaneously.Regardless, here\u2019s a related question: Is there a \u201cCrocodile Dundee\u201d for today? A character or story that embodies how Australia sees itself now?It\u2019s one thing to use Dundee to reintroduce Americans to Australia. Good on ya for that, especially if it means gaining a deeper understanding of the place through visiting.But ad-driven nostalgia is a sticky wicket. In the actual movie, I saw quite a bit more than what many Americans and Australians might recall.Hogan\u2019s performance, closely observed, is unlike what he did for Tourism Australia as a spokesman before the film \u2014 he\u2019s not just a breezy larrikin.His Dundee in America is more complicated, revealing in his facial expressions a fair amount of anxiety and awkwardness as he wanders through New York.The Australia that he embodied in the \u201980s was not yet a middle power, or middle-power plus as Australia is sometimes known today. It was a young country far away, lacking urgency, trying to figure out a fast-paced, competitive world and just how much it wanted to get involved with all that ambition.To some degree that\u2019s still Australia. To some degree it\u2019s not.Australia in 2018 is more confident, far richer, more diverse, more urbanized and less unified politically. It\u2019s a beach lifestyle brand, not a Foster\u2019s ad. But it\u2019s still not sure what role it wants to play globally.So what would a new Dundee reveal?Assuming we can cast Chris or Liam Hemsworth \u2014 or perhaps the role belongs to Russell Crowe or Hugh Jackman, who are roughly the same age as Hogan was for Dundee \u2014 what would a tale of Australia and the world tell us about the country today?Where would the film be set, whose stories would it capture, and what would make it resonate with today\u2019s Australians?Send me your thoughts and script ideas \u2014 and I\u2019ll find a way to get them to Aussiewood and Screen Australia \u2026 or at least to next week\u2019s newsletter.Now here\u2019s more from this week in The Times and in Australia, followed by a recommendation for another Aussie film that I\u2019ve come to love.\u201cThe complicated feeling I have about Harvey is how bad I feel about all the women that were attacked after I was,\u201d she said, explaining an array of experiences with candor and frustration.One reader commented: \u201cMs. Thurman embodies everything I\u2019ve ever wanted to be.\u201d______You may think of augmented reality as simply Pokemon Go.

{"Headline": "\u2018A Bomb on the Doorstep\u2019: Venezuela Fishermen Fight an Oil Giant", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmuay JournalAMUAY, Venezuela \u2014 The aging fisherman \u2014 his sandals sinking into the sand, his optimism unflagging \u2014 looked out across the water and took the measure of his long, losing battle.At his toes was Amuay Bay, and the life-giving fish stock it supported: That\u2019s what he was fighting for. Way over on the opposite shore, beyond the wind-kicked whitecaps, sat his adversary: the hulking, state-run oil plant and its failing machinery.\u201cThe company hates this man,\u201d said the fisherman, Esteban S\u00e1nchez, a calloused index finger pointing at his own chest. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll continue denouncing them.\u201dFor generations, Amuay\u2019s fisherman have pulled snapper, mackerel, sardines, clams and crabs from these waters to feed their families and sell to wholesalers who cart the catch to markets and restaurants elsewhere.But the plant, part of the largest refinery complex in Venezuela, has from time to time spewed contaminants into the bay and the adjoining Caribbean Sea, threatening the livelihood of families living in this poor fishing village of several thousand on the country\u2019s northwest coast.With each spill \u2014 scores of them over the past three decades, residents say \u2014 fishermen have been forced to suspend their work as plumes of contaminants turned the water\u2019s surface into a shimmering toxic kaleidoscope, poisoned fish and waterfowl, killed mangroves and soiled the town\u2019s beaches.The fishermen and their families have been able to do little, as if trapped in the worst of forced marriages, the population lashed to the refinery by the bay they share.Village residents said the company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa, sent personnel to take a look at the damage but did not initiate a cleanup or compensate the fishermen for the lost fishing days. Pdvsa did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cIt\u2019s like a bomb on the doorstep of the house,\u201d said Francisco S\u00e1nchez, a fisherman and cousin of Esteban S\u00e1nchez.The village \u2014 with its rudimentary one-story concrete-block houses, four churches, one school and a community center \u2014 is arrayed along partly paved roads on a small peninsula between the bay and the sea. Life, lived so close to the elements, has always been rugged here, but it has become even more so amid the nation\u2019s economic decline.As with the rest of the nation\u2019s beleaguered population, the communal will in Amuay to protest seems to have declined amid the country\u2019s economic collapse, and most seem resigned to suffer Pdvsa\u2019s indignities quietly.But not Esteban S\u00e1nchez, 70, an Amuay native who, like several generations of relatives before him, has fished the waters around Amuay his entire life. As other voices of protest have fallen away, he has maintained his at full volume.He professes a nuanced view of the refinery: He respects its economic importance to the nation but criticizes its conduct.\u201cYou know that this is a development that benefits the country, and we aren\u2019t egotists,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cWe don\u2019t like when they look at us like a tick on a dog.\u201dMr. S\u00e1nchez began his environmental crusade in 1996 when he filed his first formal complaint with the Venezuelan authorities after a series of spills in the bay.At the time, he said, the Amuay fishing lobby was more unified, with two fishing associations representing the town\u2019s several hundred fishermen. He was president of one, the Association of Artisanal Fishermen of Amuay Bay. The other represented fishermen who primarily worked in the Caribbean Sea.Mr. S\u00e1nchez kept his association alive, even though it remained outside the government funding stream, because it provided an independent platform from which to agitate against Pdvsa.But he also found himself increasingly going it alone. The government, he contended, bought the submission of the two fishermen\u2019s councils with equipment, even while Pdvsa continued to neglect the underlying problems in the plant that were causing the contamination.\u201cThe people remain quiet,\u201d concurred Adrian Cosi, 47, a member of one of the two fishermen\u2019s councils and a former member of Mr. Sanchez\u2019s association. \u201cThe fisherman never says things the way they should be said.\u201dOther residents, however, say that while they respect Mr. Sanchez\u2019s single-minded focus, they\u2019ve chosen their battles more carefully. Some even accuse him of exaggerating the environmental impacts to create more noise \u2014 and bring more attention to himself.His cousin, Francisco, 57, who serves as a spokesman for one of the two fishermen\u2019s councils, said Esteban was \u201cthe tip of the spear\u201d in the village\u2019s efforts to protect the environment.But he also suggested that his cousin might sometimes take his campaign too far.\u201cHe is a fighter for society, but sometimes it\u2019s time to leave it behind,\u201d he said, before expressing support for the administration of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and the assistance it had given his council.Elio Coromoto Reyes Cuauro, 67, a retired university professor and owner of a small inn in Amuay, said the fight for justice had suffered from the political divisions among the fishermen. If they were more unified, he argued, more benefits might accrue to the village from Pdvsa, including much-needed improvements in public services like roads, schools and electricity.\u201cIf the people don\u2019t fight together, there isn\u2019t any force and you can\u2019t achieve the shared objectives,\u201d he said.The archives of Mr. Sanchez\u2019s 21-year struggle are stuffed haphazardly in two briefcases in the small, green-and-mustard-colored cement home where he lives with his wife, 100 yards from the bay.\u201cThis is why Pdvsa doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d he declared on a recent morning, smiling impishly, as he reached into one of the briefcases and started yanking out fistfuls of dog-eared and creased documents \u2014 formal complaints, legal papers, newspaper clippings, photographs. He spread them out on a glass table, which filled up quickly, then he grabbed the other briefcase and emptied its contents \u2014 more of the same \u2014 on a couch.He was dressed that morning in pinstripe slacks several sizes too big, cinched tight with a belt, and a well-worn collared shirt. He was planning to press his latest complaint at the state attorney general\u2019s office in Coro, the capital of the state of Falcon. These trips were rare, but only because they usually took an entire day traveling by public transport and cost a crippling percentage of his monthly income.In Coro, an assistant district attorney invited Mr. S\u00e1nchez to sit down and explain his business. Pop music was playing on the lawyer\u2019s computer.Mr. S\u00e1nchez revisited the October spill and cited statutes it violated, and recounted the long history of Pdvsa\u2019s neglect of Amuay. \u201cWe feel kind of humiliated, but I\u2019m a man of patience,\u201d he said.As the fisherman spoke, the lawyer tapped away on his phone, which periodically emitted assorted beeps, as if he were playing a video game. He rarely looked up from his screen.Afterward, Mr. S\u00e1nchez seemed pleased. The lawyer had given him far more time than usual. \u201cWe did well,\u201d he said cheerily.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Economists Are Worried About International Trade", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewSmith argued that trade among nations is like trade among people. No one feels compelled to sew his own clothes and grow his own food simply to keep busy. Instead, we find employment doing what we do best and rely on other people for most goods and services. Similarly, nations should specialize in producing what they do best and freely trade with other nations to satisfy their consumption needs.Ricardo used England and Portugal as an example. Even if Portugal was better than England at producing both wine and cloth, if Portugal had a larger advantage in wine production, Portugal should export wine and import cloth. Both nations would end up better off.The same principle applies to people. Given his athletic prowess, Roger Federer may be able to mow his lawn faster than anyone else. But that does not mean he should mow his own lawn. The advantage he has playing tennis is far greater than he has mowing lawns. So, according to Ricardo (and common sense), Mr. Federer should hire a lawn service and spend more time on the court.By the way, Ricardo was not merely a theorist. He was also a successful stock trader and a member of Parliament. During his political career, he fought for free trade, notably, by opposing the Corn Laws, which imposed tariffs on grain imports.A skeptic might say that all this is just theory. Where\u2019s the evidence?These results, while suggestive, come with a caveat. Trade restrictions often accompany other government policies that interfere with markets. Perhaps these other policies, rather than trade restrictions, impede growth.For example, New Zealand is disadvantaged compared with Belgium because it is farther from other populous countries. Similarly, landlocked nations are disadvantaged compared with nations with their own seaports. Because these geographic characteristics are correlated with trade, but arguably uncorrelated with other determinants of prosperity, they can be used to separate the impact of trade on national income from other confounding factors.After analyzing the data, Mr. Frankel and Mr. Romer concluded that \u201ca rise of one percentage point in the ratio of trade to G.D.P. increases income per person by at least one-half percent.\u201d In other words, nations should take the theories of Smith, Ricardo and Melitz seriously.To be sure, expanding trade hurts some people in the short run, especially those in import-competing sectors who have to find new jobs. That fact may call for a robust safety net and effective retraining. But it does not undermine the conclusion that free trade raises average living standards.N. Gregory Mankiw is the Robert M. Beren professor of economics at Harvard University. He was an adviser to President George W. Bush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Wells Fargo and Federal Reserve Struck Deal to Hold Bank\u2019s Board Accountable", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a Thursday evening in mid-January, a group of top Wells Fargo executives sat down for dinner in an upscale surf-and-turf restaurant near the White House. At nearby tables, power brokers ate seafood on ice and sipped cocktails out of copper mugs.The Wells Fargo executives \u2014 including the chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, and the finance chief, John R. Shrewsberry \u2014 enjoyed their crab legs, but they were in Washington on unpleasant business. The Federal Reserve planned to impose tough sanctions on the San Francisco-based bank for years of misconduct and the shoddy governance that allowed it.The executives\u2019 mission, according to three people directly involved in the negotiations, was to avoid further shaking investor confidence in the bank and its management team.Officials at the central bank had a different goal, according to people familiar with their thinking. They wanted to send a message to the Wells board that it would be held responsible for the company\u2019s behavior.As part of the announcement on Friday, the Fed and Wells said the bank would replace four members of its 16-member board, although the changes were not mandated under the so-called consent order.The settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.Ms. Yellen\u2019s successor, Jerome H. Powell, was the top Fed official overseeing the negotiations with Wells Fargo, and he is likely to maintain the Fed\u2019s emphasis on holding bank boards accountable.This account is based on interviews with six people involved in or briefed on the negotiations, representing both the bank and the Fed, who were not authorized to speak publicly about regulatory matters.In early January, Wells officials heard from the Fed that the central bank planned to impose stiff new penalties. Executives were furious that the proposed sanctions seemed more draconian than those imposed on banks that nearly cratered the global economy a decade earlier, according to people familiar with the thinking of top bank executives.Then, on conference calls and face-to-face sessions in Washington, the negotiations began.One crucial participant was Wells\u2019s general counsel, C. Allen Parker. His advantage was that he was new to Wells, not part of what one bank adviser called the \u201cancien r\u00e9gime.\u201d He joined last spring after more than two decades at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the white shoe law firm where he had been the presiding partner.The lead officials for the Fed were its general counsel, Mark E. Van Der Weide, and Michael S. Gibson, the director of supervision and regulation.After an opening round of talks, Wells concluded that the Fed was not likely to budge on its central demand: that the bank put the brakes on any growth until it proved that its governance was substantially improved. That meant the bank would not be able to increase the assets \u2014 like loans or investments \u2014 it was holding above its current level of about $2 trillion.Wells wanted wiggle room. Executives negotiated to have the assets calculated over a rolling two-quarter average. That meant they could swell above $2 trillion at times, as long as they dropped lower at other times.The top priority for Wells was that the order be lifted quickly, said participants in the talks. The bank\u2019s negotiators wanted the Fed to commit to a speedy timetable for reviewing its progress. The Fed responded that it wanted Wells to move quickly, which Wells officials interpreted as meaning the Fed would act swiftly, too.The future of the bank\u2019s board was a thornier issue.Wells had already replaced about half of its scandal-era directors.The Fed wanted more change, according to people familiar with the central bank\u2019s thinking. The regulators had taken notice of public anger about the government\u2019s past practice of taking actions against corporations without holding people responsible. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, had met twice with Ms. Yellen last year to push the Fed to force out Wells\u2019s directors, according to a participant in the meetings. Ms. Warren also made the argument to Mr. Powell, the incoming Fed chairman.While not adopting Ms. Warren\u2019s suggestion, Fed officials emphasized to Wells the importance of \u201crefreshing the board,\u201d said people who participated in the negotiations.Bank executives responded that they already planned to replace four more directors. That would leave no more than three directors who had been around during the misconduct.That appeared to satisfy the Fed.The central bank also alerted Wells that Mr. Gibson, the Fed\u2019s top regulator, planned to write public letters to two former Wells chairmen, scolding them for their inadequate oversight. Wells officials pushed Mr. Gibson not to be too harsh, according to a person familiar with the matter.The two sides reached a rough agreement early last week. It blocked Wells\u2019s assets from going beyond their current level, adopting Wells\u2019s request for assets to be calculated using a rolling average, and required the bank to submit a cleanup plan. It also established a timetable for the Fed to review the bank\u2019s progress, leaving Wells executives hopeful that the handcuffs would come off within a year.The replacement of the four directors wasn\u2019t part of the written agreement, which still needed signoffs from the boards of both the Fed and Wells.Friday was Ms. Yellen\u2019s final working day as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman. It wasn\u2019t clear if that accelerated the settlement talks, but that morning, Wells\u2019s directors held a conference call and voted to sign the consent order, said people close to the bank. A bank executive phoned Mr. Van Der Weide at the Fed to tell him.On Friday afternoon, Ms. Yellen went to the PBS NewsHour studios to tape an interview, not expecting the Wells deal to come to fruition on her watch.The Fed\u2019s announcement described the consent order. The headline of its news release announced the pending departures of four Wells board members.When they saw that, Wells officials were irate, said the people familiar with executives\u2019 thinking. They thought it sounded like the boardroom changes were being done at the Fed\u2019s instruction.The bank\u2019s own announcement of the consent order had mentioned the pending boardroom departures only in passing. The bank had hoped to make the changes without assigning blame to the departing board members.In a hastily convened conference call on Friday night, Mr. Sloan, Wells\u2019s current chief, tried to reassure analysts and investors that the bank would be able to maneuver around the asset cap by selling certain assets and continuing to lend to customers.He estimated on the call that the Fed\u2019s order could shave up to $400 million off the bank\u2019s 2018 profits. That represents less than 2 percent of what Wells earned last year.An earlier version of this article misstated when Elizabeth A. Duke became Wells Fargo\u2019s chairwoman. It was in January, not last summer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Iran, Environmentalists Are Now Seen as Spies", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe official, Kaveh Madani, the deputy head of the Department of the Environment, was arrested on Saturday, interrogated, and apparently released on Monday by intelligence agents affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. His department posted an image of him on Twitter during a meeting on Monday with the German ambassador to Iran, Michael Klor-Berchtold.The arrest of Mr. Madani, 36, an American-educated academic on leave from London\u2019s Imperial College, was particularly embarrassing for President Hassan Rouhani, who had recruited him as a sign the country is ready to welcome back expatriate Iranians.It was consistent with a series of actions taken by hard-line groups in recent months to publicly humiliate and undermine Mr. Rouhani, analysts say. They are accused of instigating the protests that shook the government around the New Year in an effort to show that Mr. Rouhani\u2019s promises of economic growth were failing. That backfired when the protests spread to 80 cities and anger quickly turned against the Islamic establishment.The hard-liners had been incensed by Mr. Rouhani\u2019s decision to leak a sensitive government budget document showing generous payouts to support military adventures and conservative clerical organizations while cutting subsidies for the poor and middle class.\u201cI have never seen the fight between these two factions so open here in Iran, the government versus those who are nonelected,\u201d said Farshad Ghorbanpour, an analyst with close ties to the Rouhani government. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if solutions are not found, we might see escalation and even clashes in the near future.\u201dWith the arrests of Mr. Madani and several environmental activists including Kavous Seyed Emami, the Iranian-Canadian, the fight seems to have expanded into the environmental arena as the government confronts growing fears of water shortages this summer. The activists, some critical of the government for long-term mismanagement of water supplies, have been accused by the Revolutionary Guards of spying.The spokesman said that the family had been told that he killed himself in prison after having confessed to spying. The family denies the allegation of spying and doubts he committed suicide, but the prison authorities have so far refused to return Mr. Seyed Emami\u2019s body to the family for a proper autopsy. He was to be buried on Tuesday, and it remained unclear if the family\u2019s wish for an independent autopsy would be granted.Also unclear is where the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, comes down in the feud between the hard-liners and Mr. Rouhani. Mr. Khamenei has long sought to balance opposing factions to preserve his power, and analysts said he would be unlikely to take a strong stand on one side or the other until he felt he had no choice. On major decisions, like the nuclear agreement and seeking better relations with the international community, he has supported Mr. Rouhani, if grudgingly.On Sunday, Mr. Rouhani struck back at his opponents, warning the Revolutionary Guards, the judiciary and the clerical councils that his government is considering organizing a referendum to break the deadlock between those who want change and those who want to hold it back.\u201cAnywhere we may have differences,\u201d he said in a speech at the 39th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, \u201cwe should refer to the vote of the people and a referendum.\u201dWhile there is little chance of that plan succeeding, analysts say, suggesting a referendum could perhaps help Mr. Rouhani regain popularity among the middle classes who have become cynical over his inability to deliver on years of promises of a more open and transparent economy and greater personal freedoms.\u201cMr. Rouhani insists on diverting attention away from his failing economic policies,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line political analyst. \u201cThe government is not allowed to initiate referendums on everything, only in the case of a stalemate between separate powers. These are just disputes.\u201dSince the New Year\u2019s protests, the pressure on the two sides has only increased, with the economy dragging and the national currency, the rial, falling sharply in value against the dollar and the euro. The government is having trouble attracting desperately needed foreign investment, because of unilateral United States sanctions and uncertainty over the fate of the nuclear agreement.In an apparent victory for Mr. Rouhani, the minister of defense, Amir Hatami, said in January that Ayatollah Khamenei had ordered both the regular army and the Revolutionary Guards to sell off economic assets to the private sector. But the arrests and pressures indicate there will be no smooth transition, if any, analysts said.\u201cThis country is in deadlock. I think last month\u2019s so-called-protests were incited and encouraged by government opponents, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government. \u201cI think the opponents of Rouhani want to show their teeth after the president has made clear he wants to harness the power and influence of the nonelected parts of the state, including the Guards.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Powell Takes Over as Fed Chief as Economy Starts to Show Strain", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell was sworn in on Monday as the Federal Reserve\u2019s 16th chairman, stepping into his new role as a half-decade of economic tranquillity is beginning to show some signs of strain.Mr. Powell, charged with keeping the economy in the safe space between overheating and recession, arrives on that high wire as a relative unknown. He is a lawyer by training and an investor by trade in a role reserved almost exclusively for economists in recent decades.It is harder to predict how he would respond to faster growth \u2014 or to a financial crisis.But Mr. Powell, who turned 65 Sunday, arrives in the job with a deeper knowledge of financial markets than his recent predecessors, and what friends describe as strong political instincts.\u201cI worry not at all,\u201d said Seth Carpenter, who worked with Mr. Powell at the Fed and is now the chief United States economist at UBS. He said that Mr. Powell, in his early days at the Fed, would pull staff members aside after meetings with long lists of questions. In time, the lists got shorter.\u201cIt got increasingly deep and increasingly technical and increasingly sophisticated to the point where I think that this idea that he\u2019s not a real economist is just bunk,\u201d Mr. Carpenter said.Mr. Powell also has well-established views on financial regulation, a crucial issue as the Trump administration seeks to loosen the strictures imposed on the industry after the 2008 crisis.In the fall of 1991, Mr. Powell, then an assistant Treasury secretary, was summoned before Congress to explain how the government had failed to prevent an elaborate scheme by a bond trader at Salomon Brothers to corner the market in some Treasury securities.Under sharp questioning, Mr. Powell resisted demands for a regulatory crackdown. He pressed for Salomon executives to lose their jobs, and he favored changes to prevent any recurrences. But he cautioned Congress against meddling with a market that mostly worked.\u201cRegulation should always take into account the impact that it has on markets \u2014 a balance that must be constantly weighed,\u201d he said. \u201cMore regulation is not the best answer to every problem.\u201dMr. Powell has emphasized the importance of oversight by bank boards of directors, and the Wells action criticized the company\u2019s board for failing to do its job. The Fed also published harshly critical letters to the last two chairmen of the Wells board, holding them accountable for the problems.Mr. Powell is a lifelong Washingtonian. He went away to college at Princeton but came back to law school at Georgetown. He went away to work on Wall Street but came back in the early 1990s to take a job under Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who had also been his boss at the white-shoe investment bank Dillon Read.Mr. Powell has the calm and unassuming manner of a person confident in his abilities. Mr. Carpenter said the only time that he had seen Mr. Powell show irritation was when he persisted in addressing Mr. Powell as \u201cGovernor Powell\u201d rather than \u201cJay.\u201dJohn Dugan, a longtime friend who worked for Mr. Powell at Treasury, said Mr. Powell\u2019s success owed much to playing well with others. \u201cHe has a tremendous sense of humor, but not an unkind one,\u201d said Mr. Dugan, a former comptroller of the currency.The Salomon scandal began with a routine phone call. At the time, Wall Street firms wrote bids on scraps of paper stuffed into a wooden box. The New York Fed policed the process by calling a small selection of buyers to verify bids. In the spring of 1991, a staff member reached a surprised supposed bidder. A quiet investigation found that Salomon was bidding in other peoples\u2019 names. No firm was allowed to buy more than 35 percent of a given debt issue; at one auction in May 1991, Salomon bought 94 percent, allowing the firm to resell at a premium.After leaving Treasury, Mr. Powell remained in Washington and made a fortune as a private-equity investor at the Carlyle Group. By 2010, he was looking for a new challenge, and he joined the Bipartisan Policy Center for an eight-week project simulating a state\u2019s insolvency. He was not paid.Searching for an encore, Mr. Powell recognized, earlier than most, that the Tea Party Republicans who arrived in Congress in January 2011 were genuinely opposed to raising the nation\u2019s borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling. Since he had been in charge of government borrowing, he also understood, better than most, that default would cause a crisis.Working by hand, he modeled the government\u2019s cash flows, calculating when Treasury would run out of money. He called it the \u201cX date,\u201d coining a term that remains in common use. He published his analysis online and, for several weeks, no one paid any attention. Then, quite suddenly, he found himself in the spotlight. Treasury had published its own calculations but the media \u2014 and congressional Republicans \u2014 wanted an independent source of information. All the better that Mr. Powell was himself a Republican.\u201cJay was somebody who they could trust, who could help get facts into the discussion.\u201d said Shai Akabas, the director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, who worked for Mr. Powell as an analyst at the time. \u201cHe likes to earn your respect by working hard. It\u2019s not about saying, \u2018I\u2019m here to help.\u2019 It\u2019s showing them that you\u2019re really there constructively.\u201dMr. Powell started briefing individual members of Congress about the need to raise the debt ceiling and in mid-June briefed the entire House Republican caucus, explaining that failing to act would cause a lot of pain for a lot of people.When Republican leaders met with Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, to negotiate a deal, they mentioned that Mr. Powell\u2019s presentation was a crucial reason they would be able to rally the necessary votes to raise the ceiling.Mr. Powell, who lives in Chevy Chase, Md., with his wife, Elissa Leonard, a filmmaker, is now preparing for a new challenge. One looming test: He has often commuted to the Fed on his bike, an eight-mile ride. He is trying to persuade his new security detail to let him stay in the saddle.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

A former top aide to Netanyahu agreed this week to serve as a witness against him. Press reports suggest a man clinging to power.Besides, Bibi has been, for Israelis, a pretty good prime minister. Some indicators:None of this makes much of an impression on non-Israelis. Diaspora Jews were infuriated last year by the government\u2019s backtracking on a plan to let men and women pray together at the Western Wall. Israel\u2019s bad decision to forcibly deport African migrants has stirred additional, and warranted, indignation.And then there are the Palestinians. The central complaint of Netanyahu\u2019s critics is that he has failed to make good on the promise of his 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University, where he claimed to accept the principle of a Palestinian state. Subsidiary charges include his refusal to halt settlement construction or give former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad a sufficient political boost.It should go without saying that a Palestinian state is a terrific idea in principle \u2014 assuming, that is, that it resembles the United Arab Emirates. But Israelis have no reason to believe that it will look like anything except the way Gaza does today: militant, despotic, desperate and aggressive. Netanyahu\u2019s foreign critics are demanding that he replicate on a large scale what has failed catastrophically on a smaller scale. It\u2019s an absurd ask.Specifically, it is the consequence of Israel\u2019s internalization of the two great lessons of the past 30 years. First, that separation from the Palestinians is essential \u2014 in the long term. Second, that peace with the Palestinians is impossible \u2014 in the short term. The result is a policy that amounts to a type of indefinite holding pattern, with Israel circling a runway it knows it cannot yet land on even as it fears running out of gas.The risks here are obvious. But it\u2019s hard to imagine any other sort of approach, which is why any successor to Netanyahu will have to pursue essentially identical policies \u2014 policies whose chief art will consist in fending off false promises of salvation.There\u2019s a long Jewish history of this. For all of his flaws, few have done it as well as Bibi, which is why he has endured, and will probably continue to do so. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saving Winter Is About More Than Snow. It\u2019s About Jobs.", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEver since I took my first turns on a snowy golf course on Cape Cod, my life has revolved and evolved around snow. As a professional snowboarder, I\u2019ve ridden the steepest mountains in the world and spent weeks outside on foot-powered expeditions. Today I live in Truckee, a mountain town tucked into California\u2019s Sierra Nevada, where I share my love of mountains with my wife and children. When we watch the Olympics, it still makes me joyous, but these days I also feel a little wistful.While a big snow season\u2019s economic boost is helpful, research shows that low snow years are disproportionately devastating, causing a combined annual revenue loss of $1 billion and 17,400 fewer jobs. These mountain towns are also the training grounds for American Olympians.All you have to do is watch the downhill race at Pyeongchang to know that snow-sports athletes don\u2019t just sit on their hands when faced with obstacles. That\u2019s why thousands of professional athletes, outdoor industry leaders, people who live in the mountains and those who live to ski and ride are joining forces.In person, through social media, in the streets and on Capitol Hill, we are letting our representatives know that believing in job creation and local economies means stepping up on legislation that supports renewable energy and places a price on carbon dioxide emissions. About 20 million people participate in winter sports every year. And many of them vote.Senators in states with vital mountain economies love to talk about jobs. These people include Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Dean Heller of Nevada, both Republicans, along with representatives of congressional districts that include mountain towns, like Greg Walden of Oregon, Scott Tipton and Mike Coffman of Colorado, and my district\u2019s representative, Tom McClintock \u2014 Republicans as well.The fossil fuel economy that they are voting to subsidize at substantial expense, both financial and environmental, won\u2019t last, and the sooner we move to renewable energy technologies, the better off we\u2019ll be. Our mountain economies still have a fighting chance, and we will fight for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Deep Is the Hole the Stock Market Just Stepped In?", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPothole or abyss?After the Dow Jones industrial average index shed 1,175 points on Monday, extending a rout that began in earnest last week, investors will be wondering what size hole the market has just fallen into.Of course, it\u2019s impossible to tell exactly where a bottom is, but there are ways to assess whether a sell-off will gather steam or burn out.Nearly all the economic news has been good in recent weeks, but in the often-neurotic world of investing, the news has perhaps been too good. Two reports last week that wages are growing at a solid pace, for instance, helped prompt the latest selling.Investors fear that an increase in wages, especially at a time of low unemployment, might lead to higher inflation, which in turn could prompt the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly than expected. The higher borrowing costs would then crimp companies\u2019 investment plans, leading eventually to lower economic growth over all. There is no evidence that this chain reaction has begun, but when the stock market is in a skittish mood, it does not wait around for the next economic release.The market will stop sliding when investors start to see bargains and start buying in earnest. But on certain measures, stocks are still expensive.One way to value companies on the stock market is to compare their share prices with their earnings. If, say, a company made a dollar per share last year and its stock trades at $20, it has a price-to-earnings multiple of 20. As the market kept rising in recent months, investors were willing to pay a high price for companies\u2019 earnings. And even after Monday\u2019s plunge, stock valuations still look demanding. At its peak in January, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index traded at 23 times the 2017 profits of the companies in the benchmark. That multiple was well above the average of 19 times for the past five years. If the S.&P. 500 traded at 19 times 2017 earnings, it would be 10 percent lower than Monday\u2019s closing level of 2,649.But there is a more optimistic approach that looks at what companies will make in the future. Now, earnings expectations are bullish, with Wall Street analysts expecting companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase their profits by more than 20 percent. Applying a valuation of 19 times expected 2018 earnings suggests that the market has already sold off too much. But the danger with that approach is that it depends on companies actually delivering those stellar profits. And any sign of a widespread earnings disappointment could set off more selling.Steep and prolonged stock market sell-offs become particularly dangerous when they spread fear through other markets and weigh on the financial system and the wider economy. On that front, it is worth noting that a closely watched index of the S.&P. 500\u2019s volatility, a gauge of fear known on Wall Street as the Vix, more than doubled on Monday. Bond markets have also been hit by selling. At times like this, professional investors, especially those using borrowed money to make their bets, can report shock losses, adding to the climate of fear. And consumers, long buoyed by the rising value of their stock investments, may cut back spending.But there are some grounds for optimism. The financial system has far more protection against losses than it had in 2008, which means it can withstand hits itself and should have the strength to keep serving clients through a rocky period.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Files to Go Public on the New York Stock Exchange", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpotify has already won over the music industry, and listeners worldwide, with an online streaming service that makes millions of songs instantly available. Now, it is ready to test its business model on Wall Street.On Wednesday, the company filed a prospectus to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange, an indication of the imminent arrival of one of the most anticipated technology stocks in years. It was also a signal of the maturation of the streaming market that has already begun to revive the long-struggling music industry.Instead of a traditional initial public offering, Spotify will, as expected, pursue a direct listing of its shares, an unusual process in which no new stock is issued \u2014 and therefore no money is raised. However, existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market.But because Spotify is eschewing Wall Street banks to manage the raising of new capital, the listing could face a rockier reception in the markets. Those banks typically spend weeks assessing investor demand for a company\u2019s shares and try to match the amount that hits the market to ensure the shares are supported.According to the prospectus, investors trading Spotify\u2019s shares in private transactions have valued the company as highly as $23 billion. Spotify\u2019s shares will be traded under the ticker symbol SPOT, but there is no indication of when that will begin.The company, showing no shortage of ambition, said that its mission was \u201cto unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators.\u201dFor the music industry, Spotify \u2014 and the streaming model it has championed \u2014 has been a powerful engine. After more than a decade of decline, the global music market began to turn around in about 2015, just as streaming began to take hold.In the United States, for example, streaming now accounts for about two-thirds of recorded music revenues, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and SoundCloud have become the new outlets where stars develop and hits are minted.Spotify\u2019s prospectus is the most detailed disclosure the company has given about its business.According to the filing, Spotify, which began its streaming service in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States three years later, had nearly $5 billion in revenue in 2017, up 38.6 percent from the year before. In 2016, it had grown by 52 percent.By the end of 2017, Spotify, whose full name is Spotify Technology, had 159 million active users, including 71 million who pay for subscriptions; the rest, using the \u201cfreemium\u201d model that has become Spotify\u2019s marketing hallmark, get free access to music but are subjected to advertisements.As quickly as Spotify has grown, though, so have its losses. Last year, it had a net loss of $1.5 billion, up from about $650 million the year before. Its largest expense, by far, is the cost of licenses from record companies and music publishers.The prospectus also highlights Spotify\u2019s successes, and its value to the music industry. Through the end of last year, the company had paid more than $10 billion in music royalties since its inception, and its \u201cchurn\u201d \u2014 a measure of how many paying users cancel each month \u2014 has been steadily declining, to 5.5 percent in 2017 from 7.7 percent in 2015.The largest stakes are owned by its two founders: Daniel Ek, the chief executive and the company\u2019s public face, and Martin Lorentzon, who holds no executive position. In addition to their shares, they also have \u201cbeneficiary certificates\u201d granting them extra voting rights. In total, Mr. Ek has 37.3 percent voting power over the company, and Mr. Lorentzon 43.1 percent, according to the prospectus.The major record labels also own minority stakes in the company, as a result of licensing deals struck over the years. Sony has the largest, with 5.7 percent; the others were not disclosed.The market for public offerings has been robust so far this year. Through late February, 30 companies listed their shares publicly on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.At least some of the highly valued, privately held technology companies, known as unicorns, could move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity and sell shares publicly.But to convert that paper wealth into actual cash at top dollar, early-stage investors, company founders and employees with stock options need receptive public markets to buy their shares.If the public investors do not think the companies are worth as much as the small number of deep-pocketed investors who dominate the private markets, it could mean the large amounts of paper wealth could be vaporized once the company\u2019s shares start trading.That\u2019s effectively what happened last year, when some prominent public offerings fizzled once the shares were trading publicly. Shares of Snap, the start-up behind the popular Snapchat app, surged when it went public last March, but it has since had difficulty staying above its offering price of $17 a share. And the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June, is now trading at less than $3 a share.Given that it involves a direct listing, Spotify\u2019s debut on the public markets has the potential to be even more volatile.Matt Phillips contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He was 86.His death was confirmed by Budd Burton Moss, Mr. Gavin\u2019s former agent and the manager of Mr. Gavin\u2019s wife, the singer and actress Constance Towers. He did not specify a cause but said Mr. Gavin had been ill for months.They took one look at Mr. Gavin at Universal-International Pictures and saw the next Rock Hudson. Tall, dark-eyed, with a mellow baritone voice and the face of a heartbreaker, he was cast opposite leading actresses \u2014 Lana Turner in \u201cImitation of Life\u201d (1959), Sophia Loren in \u201cA Breath of Scandal\u201d (1960), Susan Hayward in \u201cBack Street\u201d (1961) and Katharine Hepburn in \u201cThe Madwoman of Chaillot\u201d (1969).But in a score of films, including parts as Janet Leigh\u2019s lover in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s classic \u201cPsycho\u201d (1960), Julius Caesar in \u201cSpartacus\u201d (1960) and Julie Andrews\u2019s singing boss in \u201cThoroughly Modern Millie\u201d (1967), critics often found his performances wooden, and he achieved only modest success.He migrated to television, starring in movies and episodes of the western series \u201cDestry\u201d (1964) and the war drama \u201cConvoy\u201d (1965). But talk of another Rock Hudson faded, as did Mr. Gavin\u2019s opportunities.He was slated to play James Bond in two movies \u2014 \u201cDiamonds Are Forever\u201d in 1971 and \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d in 1973 \u2014 but lost out to Sean Connery and Roger Moore. He later made guest appearances on \u201cThe Love Boat,\u201d \u201cFantasy Island\u201d and other television series.As his entertainment career ebbed, Mr. Gavin became increasingly involved in inter-American political affairs. In the 1960s and early \u203270s, he was a special adviser to the secretary general of the Organization of American States, which fosters democracy and regional security. He also undertook assignments promoting American and Latin American film production for the Alliance for Progress, established by President John F. Kennedy.Mr. Gavin was president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1971 to 1973.He was named ambassador to Mexico when Ronald Reagan, a like-minded conservative Republican who had also been president of the actors guild, entered the White House in 1981. Mr. Gavin had been active in Reagan\u2019s 1980 presidential campaign.Amid complaints from veteran diplomats that American embassies were still being turned over to financial backers and unqualified amateurs, the selection of an actor and friend of the president for one of the nation\u2019s most sensitive diplomatic posts was met with dismay in Mexico. Officials there sardonically jested about sending the comedian Cantinflas to Washington in retaliation.Mr. Gavin was chiefly known in Mexico at the time as the tuxedoed spokesman for Bacardi rum in television commercials. He had some qualifications for the assignment, however. His mother was Mexican, he spoke fluent Spanish, he had extensive travel and business experience in Latin America and he had a degree in Latin American economic history from Stanford University.But his tenure as ambassador in Mexico City, in charge of an embassy with more than 1,100 American and Mexican employees, became extremely contentious, despite a close relationship between President Reagan and President Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo and his successor, Miguel de la Madrid.Mr. Gavin pressed Mexico to limit the flow of illicit drugs and illegal immigrants into the United States, and voiced Washington\u2019s belief that the revolutionary Sandinista government in Nicaragua posed dangers to the security of Mexico and Central America. Mexico was cool to many of Washington\u2019s concerns, even when Mr. Gavin relayed intelligence that implicated Mexican officials in corrupt activities.The ambassador feuded regularly with the Mexican press. Journalists who tracked his movements called him an absentee envoy who had been out of Mexico for 142 of his first 438 days on the job, traveling frequently to Los Angeles. Mr. Gavin insisted that his trips were work-related.Mr. Gavin was denounced by Mexican business and labor leaders, politicians and academics after he appeared in a 1982 ABC television special, \u201cMexico: Times of Crisis,\u201d in which he spoke of fears that Central America\u2019s economic and political troubles could \u201cspill over\u201d into Mexico. President L\u00f3pez Portillo did not comment, but there were wide demands for Mr. Gavin to resign or be declared persona non grata.In 1984, after Mr. Gavin had a casual lunch with leaders of the opposition National Action Party, the head of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, which had long controlled political life in Mexico, accused him of interfering in Mexican politics and of insensitivity to Mexican traditions.And Mr. Gavin sometimes put his foot in his mouth. In 1985, after earthquakes toppled buildings and killed thousands in Mexico, he told reporters \u201cwe have been extremely fortunate\u201d that more Americans had not been killed or injured, a circumstance he explained by saying, \u201cThe types of hotels that fell down were not the types normally frequented by citizens of the United States.\u201dMr. Gavin quietly resigned in 1986 and went on to a successful business career. In retrospect, American business executives gave him high marks for fostering trade, and he was credited with helping Mexican businesses obtain foreign loans as the economy worsened.He was born Juan Vincent Apablasa in Los Angeles on April 8, 1931, to Juan Apablasa and Delia Diana Pablos. His father was of Chilean descent, and his mother was from an influential family in Sonora, Mexico. His parents divorced when he was a young child; his mother later married Herald Golenor, who adopted him and changed his name to John Anthony Golenor. He attended St. John\u2019s Military Academy in Los Angeles and Villanova Preparatory School in Ojai, and graduated from Stanford in 1952.In the Navy over the next three years, he served as an intelligence officer aboard the aircraft carrier Princeton in the Korean War theater and was an aide to Adm. Milton E. Miles in the Panama Canal Zone.After his ambassadorship, Mr. Gavin joined the Atlantic Richfield Company as a public relations executive. In 1987 he became president of Univisa Satellite Communications, which at the time was the parent of the Spanish-language television network Univision. He later became a director of various capital investment and financial consulting companies.He married the actress Cicely Evans in 1957. They had two children, Cristina and Maria, and were divorced in 1965. He had been married to Ms. Towers since 1974. She had two children from a previous marriage, Michael and Maureen McGrath.Besides Ms. Towers, his survivors include his children and stepchildren and several grandchildren.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misstated Mr. Gavin\u2019s birth name and misidentified his father. He was born Juan Vincent Apablasa, not John Anthony Golenor, and his father was Juan Apablasa, not Herald Golenor. (His mother later divorced his father and married Herald Golenor, who adopted him and changed his name.)Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Job and Wage Gains Deliver a Promising Start for the Year", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew data on Friday suggested an answer: It is here, and it is now.\u201cPeople have been wondering when the wages are going to start to rise,\u201d said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job marketplace ZipRecruiter. \u201cI think that over the first six months of this year, we\u2019re really going to start to see the wages rise.\u201dAverage hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.But there is reason to think that pay gains will prove more durable this time around. Job growth has been steady \u2014 employers added 200,000 jobs in January, modestly more than in December \u2014 and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. That is forcing companies to compete harder for workers, a recipe for pay increases.\u201cIt\u2019s as tough as it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Michael Mabry, president and chief operating officer of Mooyah Burgers, Fries and Shakes, a 100-restaurant chain based in Texas, said of the current hiring environment.Mr. Mabry said that in some parts of the country, workers would walk off the job knowing that they could find another restaurant hiring down the street. Still, he said, Mooyah can\u2019t just raise pay across the board \u2014 the burger industry is \u201ca pennies business,\u201d Mr. Mabry said, and wage increases quickly eat into profits.Instead, Mr. Mabry said, he is looking for ways to make restaurants more efficient by reducing turnover, improving morale and cross-training workers for various jobs. The goal, he said, is to be able to pay higher wages to fewer workers.Mooyah is also trying to recruit untapped sources of talent. The company recently started a program to help franchisees expand their marketing efforts by hiring at-home parents and others who had not been in the labor force. The jobs are meant to appeal to people who might not be looking for traditional work: They do not require being at an office every day or having a traditional schedule. Mr. Mabry said that kind of flexibility made sense when filling full-time slots with experienced workers was harder than ever.\u201cWhy do I have to be pigeonholed into a particular r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or a particular experience?\u201d Mr. Mabry said of his recruitment approach. \u201cI\u2019m sure there is someone out there who can bring something different to the team. It\u2019s just having an open mind.\u201d\u201cPeople who are marginally employable suddenly become highly employable in a period like this,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM, a financial consulting firm.There were some notes of caution in Friday\u2019s report. The total number of hours worked \u2014 a measure that combines the number of jobs and the average hours worked on those jobs \u2014 fell slightly, a sign that demand for labor might not be as strong as the headline job-growth figures suggest. And the unemployment rate for African-Americans, a figure highlighted by Mr. Trump after it fell to its lowest recorded level in December, jumped nearly a full percentage point, to 7.7 percent. The unemployment rate for white Americans fell to 3.5 percent.Taken together, the data paint a picture of an economy that is not just creating jobs but that is increasingly creating good ones.\u201cEmployers don\u2019t simply raise wages when the labor market gets tighter; they may also raise the quality of the job to get people to come on board,\u201d Ms. Barrera said.\u201cI hear my clients saying the tax bill gave them more confidence in the pro-business economy,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a staffing firm. \u201cThere\u2019s confidence coming from D.C. that they\u2019re not going to get in the way.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the nature of Grant Thornton\u2019s business.

{"Headline": "With Xi\u2019s Power Grab, China Joins New Era of Strongmen", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 There was a time, not so long ago, when a Chinese leader setting himself up as ruler for life would have stirred international condemnation for bucking the global trend toward greater democracy. Now, such an action seems fully in keeping with moves by many countries in the other direction.There are many reasons for such moves by Mr. Xi and others \u2014 including protecting their power and perks in an age of unrest, terrorism and war amplified by new technologies \u2014 but a significant one is that few countries have the standing or authority, morally or otherwise, to speak out \u2014 least of all, critics say, the United States.\u201cI mean, who is going to punish him internationally now?\u201d asked Susan L. Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Program at the University of California, San Diego.She and other experts described this \u201cauthoritarian reversion\u201d as a global contagion that has undermined the abiding faith that forging liberal democracies and market economies was the surest path to prosperity and equality.\u201cNobody is making that argument today,\u201d he added, \u201ccertainly not Trump.\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s administration on Monday brushed off questions about Mr. Xi\u2019s move. \u201cI believe that\u2019s a decision for China to make about what\u2019s best for their country,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cBut as you know, the president\u2019s talked about term limits in a number of capacities during the campaign. It\u2019s something that he supports here in the United States, but that\u2019s a decision that would be up to China.\u201dAlmost no one would have described China as genuinely democratic before the latest move, which was announced without fanfare on Sunday; the country remains a one-party state with extensive control over political, social and economic life.Even so, Mr. Xi\u2019s gambit ended a period of collective and term-limited leadership begun by Jiang Zemin, who held the same post as Mr. Xi from 1993 to 2003, that many had hoped was leading China toward greater rule of law and openness. This shift confirms a growing view that those expectations were probably na\u00efve, some say.\u201cWe\u2019re deluded in our conviction that everybody is going to become a democracy like us,\u201d said Merriden Varrall, the director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.Mr. Xi, who will be 69 when his second five-year term ends in 2023, is not simply following the example set by Mr. Putin or other leaders, she and other experts said. His motivations are unique to Chinese history and politics. Yet, they are deeply shaped by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and collapse of the Soviet Union two years later.Those historical milestones ushered in an era of expanding political and economic freedoms. Mr. McFaul said that for nearly a quarter of a century autocratic leaders \u201chad to play defense\u201d against the democratizing trend that seized the post-Cold War order.Even the Russia that emerged from the ruins of the Soviet Union adopted a democratic constitution and instituted free elections. Whatever the chaos of Boris N. Yeltsin\u2019s era in the 1990s, democracy was taking root when Mr. Putin came to power \u2014 in a relatively free and fair election, no less.The rumination of Francis Fukuyama, the scholar, has come up repeatedly. In a famous essay titled \u201cThe End of History?\u201d (note the question mark), he argued that Western liberal democracy had become recognized as \u201cthe final form of human government.\u201d\u201cThe end of history is no more,\u201d Brad W. Setser, a Treasury official during the Obama administration who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a message after news emerged of Mr. Xi\u2019s move.In hindsight, Mr. Putin was the vanguard of what Mr. McFaul called the \u201cilliberal international,\u201d a new version of the Communist International founded by Lenin to spread communism around the world.The trend toward authoritarianism, while specific to each country\u2019s history, is rooted in insecurities and fears afflicting the world today: globalization and rising inequality, the stunning and scary advances in technology, the disorienting chaos and extreme violence of civil wars like Syria\u2019s, separatism and terror.The institutions of the post-Cold War \u2014 which reflected the bedrock values of Western liberalism \u2014 no longer seem able to cope. Countries that once were beacons for others are consumed by the same anxiety and weakness, and internal strife.Mr. Putin has long cited such flaws to shore up his power at home; the campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election in the United States seemed intended, in the first place, to discredit American democracy still more.From China\u2019s perspective, the end of the Cold War was hardly an inspiration, having led to the toppling of one-party dictatorships. The \u201ccontagion\u201d of 1989, which saw popular protesters bring down Communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe, infected China, too. A few months before the Berlin Wall came down, Chinese students massing in Tiananmen Square posed what officials in Beijing viewed as an existential threat, a legacy that continues to color everything the government does to this day.\u201cIf anything gives Xi Jinping and the party nightmares, it is perestroika and the fall of the Soviet Union,\u201d Ms. Varrall said, referring to the reforms the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S.

In last fall\u2019s Communist Party congress, Mr. Xi even presented China as a new model for the developing world \u2014 a thinly veiled argument that the United States and Europe were no longer as attractive as they once were.The need for a strong grip appears to be a long-held conviction of Mr. Xi\u2019s. According to a 2009 diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeaks, an old associate told the American ambassador in Beijing at the time, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., that as a son of one of China\u2019s communist revolutionary leaders, Mr. Xi was an elitist who believed deeply in the unwavering authority of the party.\u201cOne cannot entirely escape one\u2019s past,\u201d the associate said. \u201cXi does not want to.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing, and Mark Landler from Washington.Advertisement"}

A bottom-feeding website, perhaps tied to Russia, \u201csurfaces\u201d video of a sex scene starring an 18-year-old Kirsten Gillibrand. It is soon debunked as a fake, the product of a user-friendly video application that employs generative adversarial network technology to convincingly swap out one face for another.It is the summer of 2019, and the story, predictably, has stuck around \u2014 part talk-show joke, part right-wing talking point. \u201cIt\u2019s news,\u201d political journalists say in their own defense. \u201cPeople are talking about it. How can we not?\u201dThen it is fall. The junior senator from New York State announces her campaign for the presidency. At a diner in New Hampshire, one \u201clow information\u201d voter asks another: \u201cKirsten What\u2019s-her-name? She\u2019s running for president? Didn\u2019t she have something to do with pornography?\u201dWelcome to the shape of things to come. In 2016 Gareth Edwards, the director of the Star Wars film \u201cRogue One,\u201d was able to create a scene featuring a young Princess Leia by manipulating images of Carrie Fisher as she looked in 1977. Mr. Edwards had the best hardware and software a $200 million Hollywood budget could buy. Less than two years later, images of similar quality can be created with software available for free download on Reddit. That was how a faked video supposedly of the actress Emma Watson in a shower with another woman ended up on the website Celeb Jihad.Programs like these have many legitimate applications. They can help computer-security experts probe for weaknesses in their defenses and help self-driving cars learn how to navigate unusual weather conditions. But as the novelist William Gibson once said, \u201cThe street finds its own uses for things.\u201d So do rogue political actors. The implications for democracy are eye-opening.The conservative political activist James O\u2019Keefe has created a cottage industry manipulating political perceptions by editing footage in misleading ways. In 2018, low-tech editing like Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s is already an anachronism: Imagine what even less scrupulous activists could do with the power to create \u201cvideo\u201d framing real people for things they\u2019ve never actually done. One harrowing potential eventuality: Fake video and audio may become so convincing that it can\u2019t be distinguished from real recordings, rendering audio and video evidence inadmissible in court.A program called Face2Face, developed at Stanford, films one person speaking, then manipulates that person\u2019s image to resemble someone else\u2019s. Throw in voice manipulation technology, and you can literally make anyone say anything \u2014 or at least seem to.The technology isn\u2019t quite there; Princess Leia was a little wooden, if you looked carefully. But it\u2019s closer than you might think. And even when fake video isn\u2019t perfect, it can convince people who want to be convinced, especially when it reinforces offensive gender or racial stereotypes.Another harrowing potential is the ability to trick the algorithms behind self-driving cars to not recognize traffic signs. Computer scientists have shown that nearly invisible changes to a stop sign can fool algorithms into thinking it says yield instead. Imagine if one of these cars contained a dissident challenging a dictator.In 2007, Barack Obama\u2019s political opponents insisted that footage existed of Michelle Obama ranting against \u201cwhitey.\u201d In the future, they may not have to worry about whether it actually existed. If someone called their bluff, they may simply be able to invent it, using data from stock photos and pre-existing footage.The next step would be one we are already familiar with: the exploitation of the algorithms used by social media sites like Twitter and Facebook to spread stories virally to those most inclined to show interest in them, even if those stories are fake.It might be impossible to stop the advance of this kind of technology. But the relevant algorithms here aren\u2019t only the ones that run on computer hardware. They are also the ones that undergird our too easily hacked media system, where garbage acquires the perfumed scent of legitimacy with all too much ease. Editors, journalists and news producers can play a role here \u2014 for good or for bad.Outlets like Fox News spread stories about the murder of Democratic staff members and F.B.I. conspiracies to frame the president. Traditional news organizations, fearing that they might be left behind in the new attention economy, struggle to maximize \u201cengagement with content.\u201dThis gives them a built-in incentive to spread informational viruses that enfeeble the very democratic institutions that allow a free media to thrive. Cable news shows consider it their professional duty to provide \u201cbalance\u201d by giving partisan talking heads free rein to spout nonsense \u2014 or amplify the nonsense of our current president.It already feels as though we are living in an alternative science-fiction universe where no one agrees on what it true. Just think how much worse it will be when fake news becomes fake video. Democracy assumes that its citizens share the same reality. We\u2019re about to find out whether democracy can be preserved when this assumption no longer holds.Henry J.

{"Headline": "Philadelphia\u2019s First Step to a Platform of Innovation", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetPHILADELPHIA \u2014 On the west side of this city\u2019s main Amtrak station sits an empty lot. But soon, it will be transformed into a public park filled with lawns, walkways and even redwood trees, in the first stage of one of Philadelphia\u2019s biggest real estate projects.The 1.3-acre park, to be known as Drexel Square, kicks off a 20-year, $3.5 billion development that aims to create a hub for technology and life-sciences companies called Schuylkill (pronounced SKOO-kul) Yards. Not only will the project fill in an underused section of real estate, it is also intended to develop business opportunities for research coming out of Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania, both just a few blocks away.The developer of Schuylkill Yards, named after the river that separates it from Philadelphia\u2019s central business district, plans to convert 14 acres occupied by parking lots and older buildings on land adjacent to the rail yards into an innovation community. It will eventually include seven million square feet of office, laboratory, retail and residential space within walking distance of downtown businesses, attributes that may be attractive to Amazon, which has named Philadelphia as one of 20 finalists in its search for a second headquarters.The development will include 2.8 million square feet of office space, 1.6 million square feet of apartments, one million square feet of lab space and more than 100,000 square feet of retail in buildings that will combine new and refurbished construction. Much of the land is owned by Drexel, whose main campus abuts the site. The university has leased the ground to the developer, Brandywine Realty Trust.Its scale and location will give further impetus to the University City district, a neighborhood in West Philadelphia that houses a complex of academic and research institutions, including Drexel, Penn and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Recent investment in research facilities and student housing in the district has already created one of the fastest-growing areas of the city, said Brandywine\u2019s chief executive, Gerard H. Sweeney.\u201cOur hope was that we could connect the city, eliminating the river as a historic dividing point,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said. \u201cWe hope Schuylkill Yards is going to move the physical perception of the city west.\u201dThe park is a linchpin of the project, Mr. Sweeney said, because the overall intent is to create a livable neighborhood that will attract an educated work force, one that increasingly demands walkable access to offices, shops and homes in a dense urban environment.\u201cSome people think you put a big tall building here right outside the train station,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said during a visit to the park construction site. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to create a platform for excellence, and the way you do that is you invest in public space. You create a place where people want to be.\u201dThe first tenant will be Spark Therapeutics, a five-year-old gene therapy company that has adapted expertise developed at University City\u2019s rich intellectual resources.John Fry, president of Drexel, called Spark\u2019s participation \u201ca major win\u201d for Schuylkill Yards.\u201cHaving Spark as our first tenant signals to everyone that we are going to favor life-sciences companies and high-tech companies,\u201d Mr. Fry said. He added that Spark planned to move into the first renovated building in the new complex in 2018.Mr. Fry said the project differed from innovation districts in other cities by combining the resources of a major university with a major developer. But the real draw was its proximity to a deep talent pool at Drexel, Penn and the University City Science Center, a nonprofit organization that provides resources to entrepreneurs.\u201cThere\u2019s an aggregation of talent in the fastest-growing employment center in the city, and Schuylkill Yards is right in the middle of that,\u201d Mr. Fry said.Bruce J. Katz, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has studied the development of University City, agreed that the project\u2019s proximity to transportation and top research facilities in the heart of a major city was an unusual combination that was likely to attract the significant investment sought by the developer.\u201cThis is an unparalleled opportunity, and very distinct from other innovation hubs,\u201d Mr. Katz said.Many cities have research institutions that are miles from downtown, but Philadelphia has them within walking distance, he said. Because of that, the development project is well positioned to create a nexus of research and commerce that will become a major growth engine for the local economy.\u201cThis parcel is going to be an enormous catalyst for broader-scale regeneration,\u201d Mr. Katz said.He said the attributes of Schuylkill Yards could also be attractive to Amazon, the Seattle-based behemoth. The development would fulfill many of Amazon\u2019s requirements for a second headquarters, including access to transportation, availability of skilled workers and an urban location, Mr. Katz said.But even if Amazon does not choose Schuylkill Yards or two other Philadelphia sites that the city has proposed, the new development is well placed to meet the demands of the businesses that it seeks, he said.\u201cWhat the innovation economy wants is this kind of proximity and density, and Philadelphia is giving it to them, and now they are leveraging it,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cThis whole area where Schuylkill Yards is going to be located is really the platform for that innovative economy.\u201dAn influx of new workers in West Philadelphia would help strengthen the city\u2019s economy. But some critics say it could also drive up real estate prices in adjoining low-income neighborhoods, which have already suffered from gentrification because of demand for housing from college students.Hoping to address those concerns, Brandywine has agreed to help fund affordable housing in local communities, and it is linking local businesses with existing vendors in an attempt to create jobs, Mr. Sweeney said.In addition, the developer has started an apprenticeship program for local people, who will be invited to take courses to meet trade union standards so they can become eligible for employment by Brandywine.Brandywine will provide $5.6 million to community organizations in the first phase of the development, a spokeswoman said. The outreach will also include support for education, housing preservation and minority business development.One of the groups, the Mount Vernon Manor Community Development Corporation, expects to share $3.1 million of the total, said its executive director, Michael Thorpe. Sixty percent of the money will be spent on affordable housing in a neighborhood where housing is already under pressure from the nearby student population.\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing a great deal of pressure for market-rate development, not for affordability,\u201d Mr. Thorpe said. \u201cPeople could be potentially pushed out if we don\u2019t create a program to offset some of that stress.\u201dMr. Sweeney said he hoped that the development\u2019s benefits would spread broadly to a city that for decades was seen by outsiders, and by some of its own people, as an inferior location.\u201cWe were losing population, we weren\u2019t growing jobs, we weren\u2019t attracting young people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look at the attributes that a company should look for to cement its growth for the next 50 years, it\u2019s right here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tyranny of Convenience", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConvenience is the most underestimated and least understood force in the world today. As a driver of human decisions, it may not offer the illicit thrill of Freud\u2019s unconscious sexual desires or the mathematical elegance of the economist\u2019s incentives. Convenience is boring. But boring is not the same thing as trivial.In the developed nations of the 21st century, convenience \u2014 that is, more efficient and easier ways of doing personal tasks \u2014 has emerged as perhaps the most powerful force shaping our individual lives and our economies. This is particularly true in America, where, despite all the paeans to freedom and individuality, one sometimes wonders whether convenience is in fact the supreme value.As Evan Williams, a co-founder of Twitter, recently put it, \u201cConvenience decides everything.\u201d Convenience seems to make our decisions for us, trumping what we like to imagine are our true preferences. (I prefer to brew my coffee, but Starbucks instant is so convenient I hardly ever do what I \u201cprefer.\u201d) Easy is better, easiest is best.Convenience has the ability to make other options unthinkable. Once you have used a washing machine, laundering clothes by hand seems irrational, even if it might be cheaper. After you have experienced streaming television, waiting to see a show at a prescribed hour seems silly, even a little undignified. To resist convenience \u2014 not to own a cellphone, not to use Google \u2014 has come to require a special kind of dedication that is often taken for eccentricity, if not fanaticism.For all its influence as a shaper of individual decisions, the greater power of convenience may arise from decisions made in aggregate, where it is doing so much to structure the modern economy. Particularly in tech-related industries, the battle for convenience is the battle for industry dominance.Americans say they prize competition, a proliferation of choices, the little guy. Yet our taste for convenience begets more convenience, through a combination of the economics of scale and the power of habit. The easier it is to use Amazon, the more powerful Amazon becomes \u2014 and thus the easier it becomes to use Amazon. Convenience and monopoly seem to be natural bedfellows.Given the growth of convenience \u2014 as an ideal, as a value, as a way of life \u2014 it is worth asking what our fixation with it is doing to us and to our country. I don\u2019t want to suggest that convenience is a force for evil. Making things easier isn\u2019t wicked. On the contrary, it often opens up possibilities that once seemed too onerous to contemplate, and it typically makes life less arduous, especially for those most vulnerable to life\u2019s drudgeries.But we err in presuming convenience is always good, for it has a complex relationship with other ideals that we hold dear. Though understood and promoted as an instrument of liberation, convenience has a dark side. With its promise of smooth, effortless efficiency, it threatens to erase the sort of struggles and challenges that help give meaning to life. Created to free us, it can become a constraint on what we are willing to do, and thus in a subtle way it can enslave us.It would be perverse to embrace inconvenience as a general rule. But when we let convenience decide everything, we surrender too much.Convenience as we now know it is a product of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when labor-saving devices for the home were invented and marketed. Milestones include the invention of the first \u201cconvenience foods,\u201d such as canned pork and beans and Quaker Quick Oats; the first electric clothes-washing machines; cleaning products like Old Dutch scouring powder; and other marvels including the electric vacuum cleaner, instant cake mix and the microwave oven.Convenience was the household version of another late-19th-century idea, industrial efficiency, and its accompanying \u201cscientific management.\u201d It represented the adaptation of the ethos of the factory to domestic life.However mundane it seems now, convenience, the great liberator of humankind from labor, was a utopian ideal. By saving time and eliminating drudgery, it would create the possibility of leisure. And with leisure would come the possibility of devoting time to learning, hobbies or whatever else might really matter to us. Convenience would make available to the general population the kind of freedom for self-cultivation once available only to the aristocracy. In this way convenience would also be the great leveler.This idea \u2014 convenience as liberation \u2014 could be intoxicating. Its headiest depictions are in the science fiction and futurist imaginings of the mid-20th century. From serious magazines like Popular Mechanics and from goofy entertainments like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d we learned that life in the future would be perfectly convenient. Food would be prepared with the push of a button. Moving sidewalks would do away with the annoyance of walking. Clothes would clean themselves or perhaps self-destruct after a day\u2019s wearing. The end of the struggle for existence could at last be contemplated.The dream of convenience is premised on the nightmare of physical work. But is physical work always a nightmare? Do we really want to be emancipated from all of it? Perhaps our humanity is sometimes expressed in inconvenient actions and time-consuming pursuits. Perhaps this is why, with every advance of convenience, there have always been those who resist it. They resist out of stubbornness, yes (and because they have the luxury to do so), but also because they see a threat to their sense of who they are, to their feeling of control over things that matter to them.By the late 1960s, the first convenience revolution had begun to sputter. The prospect of total convenience no longer seemed like society\u2019s greatest aspiration. Convenience meant conformity. The counterculture was about people\u2019s need to express themselves, to fulfill their individual potential, to live in harmony with nature rather than constantly seeking to overcome its nuisances. Playing the guitar was not convenient. Neither was growing one\u2019s own vegetables or fixing one\u2019s own motorcycle. But such things were seen to have value nevertheless \u2014 or rather, as a result. People were looking for individuality again.Perhaps it was inevitable, then, that the second wave of convenience technologies \u2014 the period we are living in \u2014 would co-opt this ideal. It would conveniencize individuality.Consider the man of the early 1980s, strolling down the street with his Walkman and earphones. He is enclosed in an acoustic environment of his choosing. He is enjoying, out in public, the kind of self-expression he once could experience only in his private den. A new technology is making it easier for him to show who he is, if only to himself. He struts around the world, the star of his own movie.So alluring is this vision that it has come to dominate our existence. Most of the powerful and important technologies created over the past few decades deliver convenience in the service of personalization and individuality. Think of the VCR, the playlist, the Facebook page, the Instagram account. This kind of convenience is no longer about saving physical labor \u2014 many of us don\u2019t do much of that anyway. It is about minimizing the mental resources, the mental exertion, required to choose among the options that express ourselves. Convenience is one-click, one-stop shopping, the seamless experience of \u201cplug and play.\u201d The ideal is personal preference with no effort.We are willing to pay a premium for convenience, of course \u2014 more than we often realize we are willing to pay. During the late 1990s, for example, technologies of music distribution like Napster made it possible to get music online at no cost, and lots of people availed themselves of the option. But though it remains easy to get music free, no one really does it anymore. Why? Because the introduction of the iTunes store in 2003 made buying music even more convenient than illegally downloading it. Convenient beat out free.As task after task becomes easier, the growing expectation of convenience exerts a pressure on everything else to be easy or get left behind. We are spoiled by immediacy and become annoyed by tasks that remain at the old level of effort and time. When you can skip the line and buy concert tickets on your phone, waiting in line to vote in an election is irritating. This is especially true for those who have never had to wait in lines (which may help explain the low rate at which young people vote).The paradoxical truth I\u2019m driving at is that today\u2019s technologies of individualization are technologies of mass individualization. Customization can be surprisingly homogenizing. Everyone, or nearly everyone, is on Facebook: It is the most convenient way to keep track of your friends and family, who in theory should represent what is unique about you and your life. Yet Facebook seems to make us all the same. Its format and conventions strip us of all but the most superficial expressions of individuality, such as which particular photo of a beach or mountain range we select as our background image.I do not want to deny that making things easier can serve us in important ways, giving us many choices (of restaurants, taxi services, open-source encyclopedias) where we used to have only a few or none. But being a person is only partly about having and exercising choices. It is also about how we face up to situations that are thrust upon us, about overcoming worthy challenges and finishing difficult tasks \u2014 the struggles that help make us who we are. What happens to human experience when so many obstacles and impediments and requirements and preparations have been removed?Today\u2019s cult of convenience fails to acknowledge that difficulty is a constitutive feature of human experience. Convenience is all destination and no journey. But climbing a mountain is different from taking the tram to the top, even if you end up at the same place. We are becoming people who care mainly or only about outcomes. We are at risk of making most of our life experiences a series of trolley rides.An unwelcome consequence of living in a world where everything is \u201ceasy\u201d is that the only skill that matters is the ability to multitask. At the extreme, we don\u2019t actually do anything; we only arrange what will be done, which is a flimsy basis for a life.We need to consciously embrace the inconvenient \u2014 not always, but more of the time. Nowadays individuality has come to reside in making at least some inconvenient choices. You need not churn your own butter or hunt your own meat, but if you want to be someone, you cannot allow convenience to be the value that transcends all others. Struggle is not always a problem. Sometimes struggle is a solution. It can be the solution to the question of who you are.Embracing inconvenience may sound odd, but we already do it without thinking of it as such. As if to mask the issue, we give other names to our inconvenient choices: We call them hobbies, avocations, callings, passions. These are the noninstrumental activities that help to define us. They reward us with character because they involve an encounter with meaningful resistance \u2014 with nature\u2019s laws, with the limits of our own bodies \u2014 as in carving wood, melding raw ingredients, fixing a broken appliance, writing code, timing waves or facing the point when the runner\u2019s legs and lungs begin to rebel against him.Such activities take time, but they also give us time back. They expose us to the risk of frustration and failure, but they also can teach us something about the world and our place in it.So let\u2019s reflect on the tyranny of convenience, try more often to resist its stupefying power, and see what happens. We must never forget the joy of doing something slow and something difficult, the satisfaction of not doing what is easiest. The constellation of inconvenient choices may be all that stands between us and a life of total, efficient conformity.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Comes to the Olympics", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSince the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, announced on Jan. 1 that he was interested in sending a delegation to the Games, there has been a flurry of inter-Korean agreements.The international news media has been buzzing about the new prospects for a secure peace on the Korean Peninsula, but not everyone in the South is happy about the welcome the North is receiving. And this time it\u2019s not just the usual South Korean conservatives who are moaning.The idea that people in the South belong with their Northern brethren isn\u2019t universal, especially among the young. The exigencies of daily life \u2014 jobs, housing, income inequality \u2014 are far more pressing than uniting with what may as well be an alien country. Unification increasingly sounds like an abstract ideal, taught only in school and repeated ad nauseam by the political class.President Moon Jae-in appears to be paying a heavy political price for the rapprochement. Engagement to foster peace is worth exploring. But pulling out all the stops to accommodate Pyongyang on the basis that the two Koreas are one \u201cminjok\u201d (nation) \u2014 as Mr. Moon seems to be suggesting \u2014 comes across as outdated and out of touch.After all, we have seen this before.More hopeful years followed under the so-called Sunshine Policy of President Kim Dae-jung, the first progressive politician to take power since the adoption of a democratic Constitution in 1987, who held office from 1998 to 2003. The two Koreas marched together at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, flying the Korean Unification Flag. Cooperative economic ventures, limited to some border areas, were next.No matter who shoulders the blame for the North\u2019s nuclear status and the tensions that have arisen as a result, the fact remains that Pyongyang is a difficult regime to deal with, one that is quick to take offense and doesn\u2019t hesitate to rain artillery fire on the South. Young South Koreans, who have little sense of connection to the North, tend to see only these current realities.To be clear, the Moon administration is playing nice with Kim Jong-un for strategic reasons. Yet the president\u2019s government is doing a poor job persuading those who say it\u2019s unfair to give North Koreans spots on the women\u2019s ice hockey team at the expense of South Korean players who trained hard. Nor does the government appear to have a credible strategy for when Pyongyang acts out.Mr. Moon needs to do a better job explaining why it matters to court Pyongyang at this time. It\u2019s for the safety and well-being of all Koreans, not because of the shared blood between the two countries.Se-Woong Koo is the publisher of Korea Expos\u00e9.Advertisement"}

This sudden burst of pragmatism from an avowed nationalist showed what a difference a year can make. Denouncing the \u201cfalse song of globalism\u201d during his presidential campaign, Trump, on his third full day in office, canceled the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade deal with Japan and 10 other countries. He then denounced Canada, Germany and South Korea for exporting more to the United States than they import. He promised to renegotiate trade pacts with Europe, Canada and Mexico and get a better deal for American workers. In Davos, however, he reached out with conciliatory words to the very free-trading and globalizing elites he has consistently maligned.Clearly, Trump\u2019s views on trade and globalization have evolved since his insurgent campaign. This may well be because of the rapid gains in the past year of a country he did not mention by name. In fact, Trump chose in Davos to affirm that \u201cAmerica is open for business\u201d because it was in these same Alpine heights, three days before Trump was inaugurated as president, that China seized the opportunity to claim leadership of the global economy. With the United States seemingly in a protectionist crouch, China had become, despite all its problems, indispensable. \u201cIn a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to China,\u201d Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, said last year while introducing his guest, the Chinese president and general secretary of China\u2019s Communist Party, Xi Jinping.As the usual gaggle of hedge-funders, Silicon Valley executives and government officials looked on, Xi rose to defend free trade and globalization against the relentless attacks of Trump. \u201cSome people blame economic globalization for the chaos in our world,\u201d Xi said. \u201cOne should not retreat to the harbor when encountering a storm, for this will never get us to the other shore of the ocean.\u201d Xi then confidently quoted Dickens. \u201c\u2009\u2018It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\u2019 These are the words used by the English writer Charles Dickens to describe the world after the Industrial Revolution. Today, we also live in a world of contradictions.\u201dNever mind that Dickens was actually describing the world before the French Revolution. Xi\u2019s claim of openness was, to say the least, riddled with contradictions of its own. It is increasingly difficult for foreign companies to do business in China; Beijing\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d industrial policy aims to increase \u201cindigenous innovation\u201d and self-reliance. When Trump, a year later in Davos, denounced such \u201cunfair economic practices\u201d as \u201cindustrial subsidies and pervasive state-led economic planning,\u201d there was little doubt which nation he had in mind.Yet Xi is entitled to some of his rhetorical point-scoring. The financial crisis of 2008 greatly weakened the American economy, but it left China relatively unscathed. More important, China, whose share of world trade in the mid-1970s was less than 0.5 percent, is today the world\u2019s leading exporter \u2014 the hub of new and increasingly dense transcontinental trading networks that bypass the United States. \u201cWhen the United States grows, so does the world,\u201d Trump claimed in Davos. But America\u2019s status as the linchpin of the global economic order is now endangered. The trading system China dominates has reduced the long dependency of Latin American and sub-Saharan African countries on American and European markets. China is now bringing to a close the first phase of globalization, begun by Europe and the United States in the 19th century. In the process, it is making East Asia the new center of the world economy.The economic success of East Asian countries like Japan in the 20th century had already invalidated the article of faith invoked by Trump in Davos: that nations can advance only by eliminating barriers to the free movement of goods and capital and by minimizing the role of government in the economy. But these historical lessons have long been obscured by economic orthodoxy, one that Trump\u2019s \u2014 and China\u2019s \u2014 unexpected ascents have now exposed to critical scrutiny.In his most recent book, \u201cStraight Talk on Trade,\u201d the Harvard professor Dani Rodrik castigates fellow economists for holding fast to a simple-minded view of free trade and globalization, one that he believes has caused economic chaos and political backlash across the West. \u201cAre economists,\u201d he asks, \u201cresponsible for Donald Trump\u2019s shocking victory in the U.S. presidential election?\u201d This might be overstating the case. But it is true that the argument that free markets equal progress was most eloquently and influentially advocated by the American economist Milton Friedman.The paradoxes of China\u2019s rise today are best illuminated by Friedman\u2019s querulous visit to the country in 1980, when China was desperately poor. The Nobel laureate from Chicago was then cementing his reputation as an apostle of free markets. He had just published \u201cFree to Choose,\u201d a book that was written with his wife, Rose, and later turned into a television series featuring, among others, Ronald Reagan, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Donald Rumsfeld. Friedman\u2019s argument, that \u201cthe world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests,\u201d would shape American economic policy for decades to come. He helped disparage the idea, exemplified most vividly by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, that government had a legitimate, and often indispensable, role to play in advancing economic development and protecting the vulnerable. As his keen disciple Reagan famously put it, \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201dFriedman\u2019s fervent advocacy of free trade and the efficiency of unregulated markets gave intellectual ballast to the so-called Washington Consensus. Free markets, the thinking went, not only generated wealth for all nations but also maximized consumer choice, reduced prices and optimized the use of scarce resources. Friedman\u2019s faith in the efficiency of markets came to constitute what John Stuart Mill referred to as \u201cthe deep slumber of a decided opinion.\u201dFriedman was the most influential proponent of free trade since Adam Smith declared it, in 1776, the basis of the wealth of nations. But in 1980, few people in China, including the academics who invited Friedman to a lecture tour, knew that their American guest was an impatient, even volatile, ideologue.A series of (often comical) misunderstandings ensued. Friedman complained about the Chinese man with a \u201cterrible body odor\u201d who received him at the Beijing airport; the man turned out to be one of his academic hosts. Friedman\u2019s lectures in praise of free markets were met with bewilderment. His assertion that capitalism was superior to socialism disturbed the Chinese greatly. Some of the more agitated Chinese economists went in a delegation to Friedman\u2019s hotel to lecture him about the achievements of their regime.Friedman, who (erroneously) saw Japan and South Korea as brilliant examples of open, competitive markets, was understandably impatient in China; the country embodied everything that was wrong with government planning. Indeed, China in 1980 was just lurching out of Mao Zedong\u2019s calamitous experiments. Deng Xiaoping\u2019s government was trying to improvise new solutions to the country\u2019s economic backwardness, which officials thought had exposed China to humiliation in the 19th and early 20th centuries. \u201cDevelopment,\u201d Deng said, \u201cis the only truth. If we don\u2019t develop, we will be bullied.\u201d And national development, in Deng\u2019s view, could be achieved by a variety of means. His flexible attitude was summed up by a much-popularized Chinese maxim: \u201cCross the river by feeling for the stones.\u201dThe Chinese couldn\u2019t help bristling at Friedman\u2019s blunt dismissals of their government. Despite horrific disasters, the Chinese state had drastically raised literacy and life-expectancy levels. Also, the Chinese were then seeking a third way: They looked to Japan and Singapore rather than the United States for economic models that would accelerate growth without endangering the authority of the Communist Party. The Chinese saw little of value in an American proponent of laissez faire. Friedman left China, angrily claiming that his hosts were \u201cunbelievably ignorant about how a market or capitalist system works.\u201dAs bewildered (and appalled) as Friedman would most likely have been by Trump\u2019s demonization of free trade, he would have found it still harder to explain why China, run by a Communist Party, has emerged as central to the global capitalist economy. For the Chinese regime achieved this not by liberating its 1.4 billion citizens to maximize their private interests in unfettered markets but by controlling its currency, owning large businesses and intervening heavily in investment decisions by private companies.Indeed, economic history reveals that great economic powers have always become great because of activist states. Regardless of the mystical properties claimed for it, the invisible hand of self-interest depends on the visible and often heavy hand of government. To take only one instance, British gunboats helped impose free trade on 19th-century China \u2014 a lesson not lost on the Chinese. Britain was protectionist before it was a free-trading nation. The United States itself was, while industrializing, the \u201cmother country,\u201d as the economic historian Paul Bairoch wrote, \u201cand bastion of modern protectionism.\u201d Its average tariffs in the late 19th century were nearly as high \u2014 45 percent \u2014 as the steepest ones Trump has slapped on imports of washing machines. The philosophical father of economic protectionism is, in fact, Alexander Hamilton, the founder of the American financial system, whose pupils included the Germans, the Japanese and, indirectly, the Chinese.No story is as instructive as that of the Japanese, arguably the most diligent of Hamilton\u2019s disciples. Post-1945 Japan preceded China as the hub of regional and intercontinental trade networks. Soon after its disastrous part in World War II, Japan helped revitalize Asia and by the mid \u201990s was the biggest investor and exporter in most East Asian countries; it gave more foreign aid and sent more tourists to them and was the biggest buyer of their raw commodities. What\u2019s more, it offered a model for development that combined a market economy with state intervention \u2014 one that China was even then beginning to learn from.How did Japan, a country devastated by a world war that had few natural resources of its own, achieve economic primacy in Asia? Friedman\u2019s explanation in \u201cFree to Choose\u201d was that \u201cfree trade set off a process that revolutionized Japan and the lives of its people.\u201d Francis Fukuyama, who proclaimed the end of history in 1989, credited Japan\u2019s success to \u201ceconomic liberalism\u201d of the kind espoused by Adam Smith. But the Japanese followed a very different model, one adopted from Hamilton.Japan learned early the political risks of economic stagnation. At the height of 19th-century imperialism, it signed a humiliating treaty that subjected its trade policy to the control of five Western powers, deprived it of the right to impose tariffs, set radically low import duties and gave foreign residents in trading ports extraterritorial status. Smarting from such insults, the conservative Meiji rulers of Japan became obsessed with regaining their sovereignty and protecting themselves from foreign tormentors.In this endeavor, they looked to Germany. Unified in 1871, Germany was scrambling to catch up with industrialized Britain. To do so, it borrowed from recipes of national development proposed by Hamilton soon after the Americans broke free of their British overlords. In his \u201cReport on the Subject of Manufactures,\u201d submitted to Congress in 1791, Hamilton used the potent term \u201cinfant\u201d industries to argue for economic protectionism. Hamilton\u2019s father was Scottish. Born in the West Indies, then a British colony, Hamilton was keenly aware of how the British practiced protectionism: preventing colonies from competing while selling their own goods around the world. In his view, infant nations needed room to maneuver before they could compete with established industrial powers. The United States embraced many of Hamilton\u2019s recommendations; the beneficiaries were, first, the textile and iron industries and then steel.It was Hamilton\u2019s formula, rather than free trade, that made the United States the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy in the 19th century and into the 1920s. And that formula was embraced by other nations coming late to international economic competition. Hamilton\u2019s most influential student was a German economist named Friedrich List, who lived in the United States from 1825 until the 1830s and wrote a book titled \u201cOutlines of American Political Economy.\u201d On his return to Germany, List attacked the free-market gospel preached by Britain as sheer opportunism. In his view, the British could afford to kick away the ladder of protectionism they had climbed to the summit of global industry and manufacture. He was all for free trade, but only after young industries had been nurtured in a protective environment. Applying List\u2019s lessons, Germany moved with spectacular speed from an agrarian to an industrial economy.The stakes were higher for Japan. There was hardly a country in Asia that had not been forced by Britain, Holland and France into unequal trade agreements. Economic liberalism was not a feasible option. The visible hand \u2014 the state rather than the market \u2014 was needed to guide development. Closely following Germany\u2019s example, Japan heavily subsidized its first factories, copied British design and imported foreign machinery and engineers. It not only protected many of its businesses from excessive competition but also guaranteed them a minimum profit.When World War I disrupted Europe\u2019s monopolies in its Asian colonies, Japanese companies moved in with their textiles, bicycles and canned foods. Following Europe\u2019s free-trading imperialists, Japan had invaded and occupied Taiwan and then Korea, turning them into protected markets for its small industries. In a further refinement, the Japanese state bribed and coerced manufacturing companies. It gave them subsidies to export more, which in turn helped the companies fund innovations and become internationally competitive.World War II proved only a brief interruption in Japan\u2019s policy of protection. Utterly devastated, Japan still managed to rid Asia of its European competitors. It was during the American occupation, as the historian John Dower notes, that Japan instituted what an economist described as the most \u201crestrictive foreign-trade and foreign-exchange control system ever devised by a major free nation.\u201dGiven unlimited powers by their American occupiers to get the country going again, the bureaucrats of Japan\u2019s Ministry of International Trade and Industry laid the foundations of a world-class manufacturing economy. Nationalism was a great stimulus. As Dower put it, \u201cNational pride \u2014 acute, wounded, wedded to a profound sense of vulnerability \u2014 lay behind the single-minded pursuit of economic growth that created a momentary superpower a mere quarter-century after humiliating defeat.\u201d But Japan would have struggled had war not erupted on the Korean Peninsula in 1950 and made Japan the main source of American procurements. The path of Japan\u2019s protectionist state was now set \u2014 the country\u2019s prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida, would call the destructive Korean War a \u201cgift of the gods.\u201dBecause the United States saw Korea, Taiwan and Japan as a buffer against Communism, it helped promote such neomercantilist strategies \u2014 a mix of import substitution and export-oriented industrialization. American cold warriors also gave their strategic allies unhindered access to U.S. markets while tolerating the closure of their own to American investment. By the time the United States realized that its biggest Asian ward had grown too big, it was too late. Japan had taken many products invented in the United States (automobiles, consumer electronics) and manufactured them more cheaply and with superior quality. By the 1980s, Japan had supplanted the United States in aid and investments in East Asia. When the United States sought to limit Japanese exports, the Japanese responded by deepening their investment in Asia, moving factories and improving industrial skills and technology wherever they went.India, following a model of import-substitution growth, barely participated in world trade. Its factories produced shoddy goods that you bought only because there were no alternatives. And so I was dazzled by what was on offer in Southeast Asia. The emblems of pop American culture \u2014 Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald\u2019s, Madonna \u2014 were everywhere. But the most seductive consumer goods were almost invariably Japanese: Sony, Sanyo, National, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Fuji.Feeling inadequate before East Asia\u2019s progress, many middle-class Indians longed for what Chalmers Johnson, in a book about Japan\u2019s unique growth, called the \u201ccapitalist developmental state.\u201d In such states, skilled bureaucracies led by authoritarian leaders promoted a project of national development (while either paying lip service to, or ignoring, democratic norms). Private entrepreneurs made socially beneficial investments; government policies helped build their comparative advantage while also facilitating social stability with land reforms, education and other efforts to address income equality.The \u201cdevelopmental state\u201d assumed that market failures were to be expected and that the state played a necessary role in designing industrial and financial policy. These included not only trade protection and government subsidies but also, as the political economists Robert and Jean M. Gilpin wrote in \u201cGlobal Political Economy\u201d in 2003, \u201cselective credit allocation and deliberate distortion of interest rates in order to channel cheap credit to favored economic sectors.\u201d Governments were, in fact, very much part of the solution, as even the World Bank, beholden to the Washington Consensus, grudgingly acknowledged in its well-known 1993 report, \u201cEast Asian Miracle.\u201d The high-performing Asian economies, it noted, \u201chave achieved unusually low and declining levels of inequality, contrary to historical experience and contemporary evidence in other regions.\u201dThe hero of many middle-class Indians was the authoritarian leader of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, whose success in turning Singapore from an economic backwater into one of the world\u2019s major commercial cities was much admired by Deng Xiaoping. We might have also revered, had we known more about him, South Korea\u2019s technocratic despot Park Chung-hee, who accomplished economic goals with the help of highly trained managers, and who also appeared to reduce inequality and build what we in India sorely lacked: social cohesion.But little did I know that Hamilton (and List) would achieve their greatest influence in post-Mao China. \u201cThe rise of China resembles that of the United States a century ago,\u201d the Chinese scholar Hu Angang writes. He is not exaggerating. Friedman may have been right that the Chinese Communists were hopelessly ignorant of how free markets work, but ending state intervention in the economy was never on the agenda. After Mao, Chinese leaders looked to Japanese and other East Asian developers, just as the East Asians had once looked to Germany.The first investments in China in the 1980s came from Japan as well as from transnational Chinese business networks based in East Asia. China benefited from the market networks, management and technical know-how that accompanied these investments. Encouraged by the Clinton administration, it entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 and quickly seized the opportunity \u2014 limitless export markets \u2014 opened by American insistence on free trade.The success of China\u2019s state-led economy presents, in many ways, the same economic (and ideological) quandary that Japan unexpectedly threw up before the United States when, in the 1980s, it became the world\u2019s leading creditor. A regional trading system dominated by China will make Asian countries less likely to enlist in American geopolitical objectives. Locked into boundary disputes with its neighbors, China has accelerated the militarization of the South China Sea, acquiring more than 3,200 acres of land on reefs and outcrops and installing runways, ports and hangars. But it has also abandoned its abrasive attitude, making determined efforts to pivot Asia away from Trump\u2019s America. And it seems to be succeeding.With China offering generous infrastructure deals to the former American territory of the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that \u201cit is time to say goodbye\u201d to the United States \u2014 previously he threatened to ride a jet ski to a Chinese man-made island in the South China Sea and plant his country\u2019s flag there. Other rival claimants to parts of the South China Sea \u2014 Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei \u2014 have also moved closer to Beijing since Trump\u2019s election. Smaller countries like Cambodia and Laos now resemble Chinese client-states. China is also trying to repair long-strained relations with Japan by inviting investments by Japanese multinationals.These attempts to win over major American allies in Asia complement Xi\u2019s ambitious One Belt, One Road initiative, which aims to put China at the center of global affairs through a network of trade links and infrastructure projects stretching from Asia to the Middle East to Africa and Europe. Investing more than $1 trillion in more than 60 countries \u2014 ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, high-speed railways in East Africa, gas pipelines in Central Asia \u2014 the initiative can claim to be the largest overseas investment drive ever undertaken by a single country. The 11 European Union members and five non-E.U. Central and Eastern European countries that have joined the China-led political and commercial group called 16+1 have all signed major infrastructure deals with China, enhancing Beijing\u2019s influence in the E.U. The remaining 11 members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have gone ahead without the United States; they are expected to sign a final agreement in March.By pulling out of the TPP and threatening trade sanctions, Trump encouraged Japan to seek a deal with Europe that shuts out the United States. Britain, another stalwart American ally, is considering joining the TPP. China, meanwhile, is hectically negotiating more than a dozen trade agreements in Asia while proposing its own alternative to the TPP, a trade agreement called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. China has also intensified efforts to build alternatives to such Western international institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 2014, China inaugurated, against staunch American opposition, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, whose members now include all Asian states except Japan.There is little doubt that Beijing is presenting itself as a benign alternative to the United States. In a speech just before his second term as the party\u2019s general secretary, Xi claimed that there were more takers internationally for Chinese \u201cvalues.\u201d China, he said, offers \u201ca new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.\u201dIt was always wildly optimistic to suppose that China would eventually be integrated into an American-dominated order and persuaded, if not forced, to adopt its norms. A postcolonial Indian like myself, who traveled to China and read in its modern history and literature over the last decade and half, could only be skeptical of such claims. It was never less than clear to me, whether in the suburbs of Lhasa, Tibet (demographically altered by Han immigration), or in the bookstores of Shanghai (stacked with best sellers with titles like \u201cChina Can Say No\u201d), that the quest for national sovereignty and regained strength defines China\u2019s party state and its economic policies.Belying predictions of doom, China has again demonstrated the power of what Dower, speaking of Japan, called \u201cnational pride \u2014 acute, wounded, wedded to a profound sense of vulnerability.\u201d The United States never knew this single-minded ambition of the historical loser to avenge his losses; American leaders now reckon with it at home, in the wake of a nationalistic backlash against free trade and globalization. Some confused policies and mixed signals have accordingly defined the American position on China. During the American presidential campaign in 2016, all the main candidates, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton as well as Trump, opposed the TPP, which was intended to contain China in its own region. Then, in Trump\u2019s chaotic first year, the United States seemed to be forced back by Hamilton\u2019s shrewd East Asian disciples into its historical role as the mother country of protectionism. Trump now says that America first does not mean America alone, and he is open to rejoining the TPP. There may be more such reversals ahead. For Trump is only just beginning to acknowledge, after a year of bluster, the formidable challenge of China and the arduous effort needed for the United States to match its most determined and resourceful rival yet.Advertisement"}

Between 2013 and 2016, the gross annual bookings of full-time yellow-taxi drivers in New York, working during the day when fares are typically highest, fell from $88,000 a year to just over $69,000. Medallions, which grant the right to operate a taxi in New York City, were now depreciating assets and drivers who had borrowed money to pay for them, once a sound investment strategy, were deeply in debt. Ms. Desai was routinely seeing grown men cry and she had become increasingly concerned about the possibility that they would begin taking their lives.Implicit in his testament was the anger he felt over the de-professionalization of his life\u2019s work. Mr. Schifter had driven more than five million miles throughout his tenure, through five hurricanes and 50 snowstorms. He had chauffeured celebrities and worn a suit. He was not driving a car to supplement the income he was getting from his crepe business and he was not trying to make a little extra money for a gym membership. He was not a participant in the gig economy; he was a casualty of it.For at least a century, the suicide as spectacle, prompted by a reversal of fortune, has typically been the practice of the wealthy. In the months after Wall Street\u2019s crash in 1929, four people threw themselves out windows in New York (leading to the folklore that there had been many, many more such deaths). Decades later, Bernie Madoff\u2019s son Mark hanged himself from a dog leash in his SoHo apartment. In 2016, Sanjay Valvani, a hedge fund manager accused of insider trading, slashed his throat in the bedroom of his Brooklyn townhouse, to much sensation in the tabloid and financial press. Poverty too often kills you without making you try.In response to Mr. Schifter\u2019s death, Mayor de Blasio showed little sensitivity to the psychic harms of economic deprivation. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, for someone to commit suicide there\u2019s an underlying mental health challenge,\u201d he said. Uber did not respond to a request for comment.For taxi drivers staring down an even bleaker future of driverless cars at a moment when Washington considers a weekly paycheck bump of $1.50 an occasion to break out the layer cake, it is hard to see where the metaphoric Prozac will come from.The problems facing the city\u2019s taxi drivers have become so bad, Ms. Desai said, that even on New Year\u2019s Eve many complained that they roamed around unable to pick up fares. At about that time she had received a call from a woman who runs a community radio station in the Bronx, with an audience made up mostly of Dominican livery drivers. Two drivers that the host knew of had killed themselves and other drivers were on the show talking about the isolation and fear they saw all around them.In the days preceding his death, Mr. Schifter wrote about his decreasing faith in our politics and about his commitments to his spiritual life. \u201cForget the clich\u00e9 you only live once it is not true,\u201d he said in a Facebook post. \u201cThe clues are all about you if you take the time to seek them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of Woke Capital", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are not two stories, though; they\u2019re different aspects of the same one. Corporate activism on social issues isn\u2019t in tension with corporate self-interest on tax policy and corporate stinginess in paychecks. Rather, the activism increasingly exists to protect the self-interest and the stinginess \u2014 to justify the ways of C.E.O.s to cultural power brokers, so that those same power brokers will leave them alone (and forgive their support for Trump\u2019s economic agenda) in realms that matter more to the corporate bottom line.Over time, though, free trade and globalization and deindustrialization made that postwar system less economically viable; the decline of labor and the collapse of the New Deal coalition made it less politically necessary; and the cultural revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s made its implicit moral values (heteronormativity for workers, a kind of penny-pinching puritanism for bosses) seem less congenial and more oppressive. And so we entered a period of corporate hegemony in both political parties, with fewer political compromises required for doing business.But there are other ways to compromise besides on wages, and at an accelerating pace our corporate class is trying to negotiate a different kind of peace, a different deal from the one they struck with New Deal liberalism and Big Labor. Instead of the Treaty of Detroit we have, if you will, the Peace of Palo Alto, in which a certain kind of virtue-signaling on progressive social causes, a certain degree of performative wokeness, is offered to liberalism and the activist left pre-emptively, in the hopes that having corporate America take their side in the culture wars will blunt efforts to tax or regulate our new monopolies too heavily.Much of this signaling is sincerely motivated. I\u2019m sure that lots of people in the corporate ranks at Delta or Alamo sincerely abhor the N.R.A., just as most of the people who demanded James Damore\u2019s firing from Google or Brendan Eich\u2019s ejection from Mozilla regarded both men as beyond-the-pale bigots.\u201cAs much as we fear corporations gone wild,\u201d Poulos concludes, \u201cwe love corporations that love us.\u201d And in a rich society people may prefer that their #brands prove this love by identifying with favored social causes rather than through the old-fashioned expedient of paying their workers a little bit more money.Or some people may prefer it, at least \u2014 the professional classes, blessed with material comfort, and those groups designated as being on the official winning side of history. For others, though, the Peace of Palo Alto has rather less to offer. It confirms the blue-collar suspicion that liberalism is no longer organized around working-class economic interests, and it encourages cultural conservatives in their feeling of general besiegement, their sense that all the major institutions of American life, corporate as well as intellectual and cultural, are arrayed against their mores and values and traditions.Between them these trends and sentiments will help sustain the Republican Party even as it lurches deeper into demagogy and paranoia \u2014 by making a vote for the G.O.P. the only way to protest a corporate-backed liberal politics that seems indifferent to the working man and an ascendant cultural liberalism that has boardrooms as well as Hollywood and academia in its corner.But of course so long as this same Republican Party remains itself pro-corporate in its economic ideology \u2014 as the Trumpified G.O.P., despite his populist forays, has determinedly remained \u2014 the corporate interests themselves stand to lose little from these polarizing trends. Their wokeness buys them cover when liberalism is in power, and any backlash only helps prop up a G.O.P. that has their back when it comes time to write our tax laws.The win-win scenario for woke capitalism can\u2019t last forever.

It outlined the Chinese government\u2019s aggressive plan to treat A.I. like the country\u2019s own version of the Apollo 11 lunar mission \u2014 an all-in effort that could stoke national pride and spark agenda-setting technology breakthroughs.\u201cIt is remarkable to see how A.I. has emerged as a top priority for the Chinese leadership and how quickly things have been set into motion,\u201d said Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security who helped translate the manifesto and follows China\u2019s work on artificial intelligence. \u201cThe U.S. plans and policies released in 2016 were seemingly the impetus for the formulation of China\u2019s national A.I. strategy.\u201d\u201cWe are still waiting on the White House to provide some direction\u201d on how to respond to the competition, said Tim Hwang, who worked on A.I. policy at Google and is now the director of the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative, a new organization created by the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and others to fund ethical research in artificial intelligence.American companies like Amazon and Google have done more than anyone to turn A.I. concepts into real products. But for a number of reasons, including concerns that the Trump administration will limit the number of immigrant engineers allowed into the United States, much of the critical research being done on artificial intelligence is already migrating to other countries, including tech hot spots like Toronto, London and Beijing.To China\u2019s growing tech community, driving the industry\u2019s next big thing \u2014 a mantra of Silicon Valley \u2014 is becoming a tantalizing possibility.\u201cThanks to the size of the market and the rapid experimentation, China is going to become one of the most powerful \u2014 if not the most powerful \u2014 A.I. countries in the world,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft and Google executive who now runs a prominent Chinese venture capital firm dedicated to artificial intelligence.The 2016 A.I. reports were shepherded by President Barack Obama\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy.The O.S.T.P., which has overseen science and technology activities across the federal government for more than four decades, is now run by the deputy chief technology officer Michael Kratsios. He had worked as a Wall Street analyst before serving as chief of staff for an investment fund run by Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist who supported Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential run. The administration has yet to name an office director or fill four other assistant posts.In a recent interview, Mr. Kratsios was adamant that any concerns over the administration\u2019s approach to A.I. were unfounded.\u201cArtificial intelligence has been a priority for the Trump administration since Day 1,\u201d he said. Mr. Kratsios added that the administration was particularly concerned with the development of A.I. in national security and as a way of encouraging economic prosperity.Many staff members in Mr. Kratsios\u2019s office are exploring issues related to artificial intelligence, he said. Mr. Kratsios also meets with a committee, set up by the Obama administration, that coordinates A.I. policy across the government.\u201cThe key thing to remember is that the front line of A.I. policy is at the agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House is a convener and a coordinator.\u201dIn an echo of plans laid out by the Obama administration, China\u2019s government said it intended to significantly increase long-term funding for A.I. research and develop a much larger community of A.I. researchers.There are several ways to do that, according to the Obama administration and China. First, educate more students in these technologies. Second, recruit experts from other countries.At the same time, both policy statements urged companies to share more technology and data. Huge pools of data are need to \u201ctrain\u201d A.I. systems, and in the United States much of this is locked up inside companies like Facebook and Google. Mr. Lee said China already has an enormous advantage here because its large population will generate more data and its companies are more willing to share.Artificial intelligence has been a focus of Chinese technologists for some time. By 2013, China was already producing more research papers than the United States in the area of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the main technology driving the rise of A.I., according to the Obama reports. Deep learning, which allows machines to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, is one of the main technologies driving the rise of artificial intelligence.It is unclear how much China as a whole is spending. But one Chinese state has promised to invest $5 billion in A.I., and the government of Beijing has committed $2 billion to an A.I. development park in the city. South Korea has set aside close to $1 billion of its own. Canada, already home to many of the top researchers in the field, has also committed $125 million to, in part, attract new talent from other countries.It is also difficult to say just how much the government of the United States is spending. Government organizations like the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation continue to fund new research in universities and the private sector. According to an O.S.T.P report, the federal government spent about $1 billion a year in 2015. The Trump administration says that spending jumped to $3 billion in 2017. But the current administration said that was not an apples-to-apples comparison to the 2015 tally, because it was not certain how the Obama administration made it calculations.\u201cWe may have a bunch of small initiatives inside the government that are doing good, but we don\u2019t have a central national strategy,\u201d said Jack Clark, a former journalist who now oversees policy efforts at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab co-founded by Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is confusing that we have this technology of such obvious power and merit and we are not hearing full-throated support, including financial support.\u201d\u201cThey are headed in precisely the wrong direction,\u201d said Thomas Kalil, who led O.S.T.P\u2019s Technology and Innovation Division under President Obama. \u201cThat is particularly concerning given that China has identified this as a strategic priority.\u201dGoogle operates another important lab in Montreal. Its London lab, DeepMind, may be home to more top-notch A.I. researchers than any other lab on earth. And Google recently unveiled new labs in both Paris and Beijing. Facebook, after creating its own lab in Canada, recently pumped 10 million euros, or more than $12 million, into its existing operation in Paris. And Amazon is opening a lab in Germany.Inside these facilities, researchers still create technology for their American employers. As the labs grow and the products get better, some employees can be expected to leave to start their own companies and hire their own employees.Google\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s work in China has already led to Chinese start-ups like Malong, which is building image recognition systems, and a major A.I. investment fund run by Mr. Lee.\u201cWhen it is close to you, something like Microsoft Research has real economic value,\u201d said Mr. Clark, of OpenAI.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Xi Tightens His Grip on China, U.S. Sees Conflict Ahead", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A few weeks after Stephen K. Bannon left the White House in August, he was invited to a dinner at the Council on Foreign Relations to discuss American policy toward China. With his unbridled China bashing and dark talk of a looming conflict in the Pacific, Mr. Bannon expected to be roughed up by the group, which included China scholars, writers and veterans from past Republican and Democratic administrations.Mr. Bannon\u2019s hosts were hard on him, but not in the way he expected. Rather than faulting him or his former boss, President Trump, for their hostile approach, they pressed him on why Mr. Trump had not followed through with his tough talk about trade and North Korea. \u201cI walked out of there thinking, \u2018Something has changed with the elite,\u2019\u201d he recalled.Gone is a widespread agreement among diplomats, scholars and businesspeople that China is gradually converging with the United States and, therefore, that Americans should work to manage any flare-ups between the two countries. With China now unabashedly charting its own course \u2014 one that diverges rather than converges with the liberal democracies and market economies of the West \u2014 conflict, many say, is inevitable.\u201cEven those who are the most optimistic, hopeful and in some ways romantic about the U.S.-China relationship have been forced to confront a new China,\u201d said Kurt M. Campbell, who, as an assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, was an architect of the Obama administration\u2019s policy of pivoting toward the East.Mr. Xi\u2019s power grab has thrown this new China into stark relief, \u201cexacerbating the fault line that already exists between China and the liberal democracies of the world,\u201d said Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society.The disillusionment with China, he said, began setting in long before Mr. Xi cemented his grip on the Politburo. Be it saber-rattling in the South China Sea, proselytizing on American college campuses, theft of corporate secrets or censorship of the web, China has alienated one constituency after another in the United States.\u201cThe military is gone, the press is gone, the intellectuals are gone, civil society is gone and now the businessmen are gone,\u201d said Mr. Schell, who arranged the dinner for Mr. Bannon and has deep ties to China. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking the long view, you\u2019d have to say we\u2019re on diverging pathways.\u201dBeyond a general spike in tensions, however, the results of this widening divide are difficult to predict, experts and former officials said, because it is occurring against a backdrop of uncertainty in Beijing and Washington.Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of China reflects not only his protectionist trade agenda and America First foreign policy, but also his reluctance to antagonize Mr. Xi personally \u2014 a peculiar deference that prompted the tough questions directed at Mr. Bannon over dinner.For all his thunderous criticism of China as an economic predator, Mr. Trump has yet to impose a sweeping trade sanction against it. He declined to label China a currency manipulator last year because he said the timing was bad: Mr. Xi had agreed to help the United States press North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile programs.\u201cChina, we probably lost $504 billion, last year, on trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Monday at a meeting with governors, a day after Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to lead indefinitely became public. But he added: \u201cI think that President Xi is unique. He\u2019s helping us with North Korea.\u201dThe White House is preparing tariffs on steel and aluminum that would target China and other exporters. It has conducted an investigation into China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, which could result in restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and retaliatory measures against its consumer electronics products.Domestic politics, in a year of midterm elections, may drive Mr. Trump to take a harder line. Democrats, who are historically closer to Mr. Trump on trade than most Republicans, have signaled that they will use the president\u2019s tough-on-China stance against him if he does not act soon.\u201cNow that it\u2019s clear that President Xi isn\u2019t going anywhere, getting tough on China is even more of an imperative,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cIf President Trump and Congress don\u2019t crack down on their rapacious trade practices,\u201d he added, \u201cChina will continue eating our lunch for years to come.\u201dCorporate America has long acted as a lubricant for the relationship, prodding the United States to bring China into the World Trade Organization and lobbying against punitive trade practices. But after years of struggling to break into the Chinese markets, suffering the theft of their corporate secrets, many American companies are exhausted.\u201cYou\u2019re hearing businesses that work in China use words like reciprocity and retaliation far more than you ever have,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. \u201cFolks are increasingly frustrated and wrestling with how best to deal with it.\u201dThe frustration is not across the board: Manufacturers tend to be more fed up than Wall Street, which continues to do lucrative investment-banking business with the Chinese government. Technology companies have soured on China, though the market is so vast that they are still willing to consider concessions they would make nowhere else in the world.The Trump administration reflects those fissures. Advisers like Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who both worked at Goldman Sachs, have persuaded Mr. Trump to hold off on tough trade measures against China in the past.On the issue of national security, the administration enshrined a harsher stance toward China in the president\u2019s National Security Strategy. The report characterized China in Cold War-like terms, as a revisionist power that will try \u201cto erode American security and prosperity.\u201dBy itself, some former officials said, Mr. Xi\u2019s move to stay in power should not augur greater conflict with the United States. He is expected to elevate Wang Qishan to vice president and give him a major role in managing the relationship. And he dispatched a senior economic adviser, Liu He, to Washington this week to meet with the administration. Both men are respected in the United States.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s something inherent in dictatorships and one-man rule that causes clashes with U.S. interests, other than, of course, the conflict in values,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Barack Obama.For some China hands, the wave of disillusionment reflects unrealistic hopes about how much China was ever going to converge with the United States. John L. Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs president who has taught at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that in a chaotic world, the two countries should focus on what unites, rather than what divides, them.\u201cAt one end of the spectrum is order and at the other end is disorder,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. \u201cChina and the United States are clearly on the same end of the spectrum.\u201dAna Swanson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The company\u2019s revenue surged by 40 percent in 2016.Dropbox will have to convince investors that it can add new paying users at a fast clip. It had 11 million paying users in 2017, up 25 percent from 2016. But that was a significantly slower pace than the 35 percent increase in 2016.In theory, Dropbox could squeeze more revenue out of each user, but it has not managed to do that in recent years.

But an alternative way to view the tensions is that so much trade goes on between Britain and the bloc, and others ties are so deep, that both sides will ultimately strike a new relationship that retains much of the existing one. As analysts at Nomura wrote earlier this week:In terms of the bespoke deal issue, we think it is not credible to say the U.K. can only take an off-the-shelf Norway / Switzerland / Turkey / Ukraine / Canada / Mexico deal. They were all bespoke deals when they were made. The idea that the world\u2019s seventh largest economy, an ex-member and a country that will still have strong institutional, economic and geographic ties to the E.U. should not get a bespoke deal is not reasonable, in our view.The paper, produced by the Belgian government for a meeting of diplomats last week, will prove a huge boost to British negotiators and gives new insight into E.U. thinking.\u2014 Peter EavisPresident Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda seems to have met its match in the obscure world of international financial regulation.A big reason the Treasury held back: The concerns of foreign regulators.Further, these judges, once designated, could engage in planning and coordination exercises, including cross-border efforts (e.g., the crisis management groups discussed above).Instead, fearing higher costs for United States banks, the Treasury apparently gave the concerns of foreign regulators considerable weight and took an internationalist approach.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Chinese manufacturer has built up a $9 billion stake, or just under 10 percent, in the German automaker and parent of Mercedes-Benz.From Bloomberg:The investment in the parent of Mercedes-Benz furthers Hangzhou-based Geely\u2019s foray into the European premium automotive market and ends months of speculation.

{"Headline": "United States Will Hit Debt Limit Sooner Than Expected Because of Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that the United States is expected to bump up against its borrowing limit a month earlier than previously expected, a function of last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut, which is resulting in less revenue for the Treasury Department.The reason for the change stems from the tax cuts, which went into effect in January and are expected to translate into less revenue for the federal government.The Trump administration has said that faster economic growth spurred by the tax cuts will eventually allow the cuts to pay for themselves. Mr. Mnuchin has acknowledged that the additional revenues will be backloaded over the 10-year budget window and that he does not expect to see an increase in government revenues this year.Congress suspended the debt limit last September as part of a deal brokered by Mr. Trump that was intended to help clear a path for the tax legislation to pass.Agreement this time around will probably be more complicated, as lawmakers are also battling over a broader deal about the budget and immigration legislation. Government funding is currently set to expire on Feb. 8.Some lawmakers have proposed abolishing the debt ceiling, arguing that it has failed as a tool to control government spending because it is routinely raised. Mr. Mnuchin, speaking at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday, said that Mr. Trump would be open to changes to the debt ceiling.Democrats seized on the Congressional Budget Office debt limit report on Wednesday as new evidence that the Republican tax bill was fiscally reckless.\u201cWith full control of the House, Senate and White House, Republicans have revealed their contempt for fiscal responsibility and their utter incompetence in governing,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.On Monday, Treasury said that the United States will need to borrow $441 billion in privately held debt this quarter, the largest sum since 2010, when the economy was emerging from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s in the White House Budget Request?", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat deal, which briefly forced a government shutdown, increases military spending by $195 billion over the next two years and increases nondefense spending by $131 billion over that period. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal calls for a different approach and says Congress should not spend all of those additional nondefense funds. The proposal ultimately calls for spending $57 billion less than the new congressionally-mandated nondefense caps for 2019.The White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, in a letter to Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, said the administration is worried about the federal deficit and \u201cdoes not believe these nondefense spending levels comport with its vision for the proper role and size of the federal government.\u201dBut the Trump administration\u2019s proposed budget would still bloat the federal deficit, adding $7 trillion over the next decade. That\u2019s despite proposed cuts to domestic programs like Medicare and welfare and slashing agency budgets up and down the government.Here\u2019s a look at some of what the administration is proposing:The budget includes more than $3 trillion in proposed reductions to federal spending over a decade. Nearly half of that comes from a sort-of gimmick: The \u201ctwo penny plan,\u201d which would cut nondefense discretionary spending by 2 percent a year, every year. That compounds to roughly a 40 percent cut. It would be an aggressive \u2014 and largely politically unrealistic \u2014 number in any circumstance, but it appears especially so this year, because Congress just reached an agreement, which Mr. Trump signed, to raise spending caps for nondefense discretionary programs by 10 percent.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan could easily result in much larger federal deficits.The administration made its calculations using assumptions about the nation\u2019s economic trajectory that are more optimistic than the consensus among private-sector forecasters, or the assumptions used by other parts of the government.The forecasts in Monday\u2019s plan are also significantly more optimistic than the Trump administration itself used in its budget calculations last year.There is a similar gap in the projections of long-term growth. If the less optimistic forecasts were correct, the government would collect significantly less revenue. By its own estimates, the result would be another $3 trillion in federal debt.The administration attributed the difference to the expectation that the president\u2019s policies would significantly increase productivity growth.Jason Furman, the former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, calculated that productivity growth would have to reach the highest level in any decade since the immediate aftermath of the World War II. Productivity growth was 1.1 percent over the last decade; it would have to reach 2.5 percent.\u2014Jim TankersleyMr. Trump\u2019s 2019 budget proposal requests $63.2 billion in discretionary spending at the Education Department, a reduction of $3.6 billion, or 5 percent, from 2017 spending levels.The proposal calls for a $1.5 billion \u201cschool choice\u201d program, which includes taxpayer-funded scholarships for private schools and a vast expansion of charter schools. However, the budget would eliminate or cut 39 programs including two staple programs in public schools that provide teacher training and after-school programs to low-income children.The Department\u2019s budget also funds initiatives that Mr. Trump has given lip service to in the last year, calling for $43 million in \u201cSchool Climate Transformation\u201d grants to help fight the opioid epidemic in schools, and $200 million in new grants to improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics education.\u2014Erica A. GreenThe proposal indicates that the work of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, could last another year and a half. It allocates $10 million to his office from October 2018 through the end of September 2019.Documents released last year by the special counsel\u2019s office, which is part of the Justice Department, provided a view into its expenses. Those documents showed that between the time the office was opened in May and the end of September it racked up $3.2 million in costs. The largest portion of that money \u2014 $1.7 million \u2014 went to personnel, compensation and benefits. The second highest cost was for the \u201cacquisition of equipment\u201d at $733,969.The Justice Department\u2019s $28 billion proposed budget overall is relatively flat from last year, with notable increases in spending to combat violent crime and drug use as well as house more prisoners. The department wants to increase its immigration enforcement efforts and add 75 immigration judges and support staff. The department counts more than 117,000 employees.To offset the spending increases, the Justice Department plans to close two of its six Bureau of Prisons regional administrative offices and two of its seven minimum security prisons.\u2014Katie Benner The president\u2019s budget singles out abortion providers and would prohibit Health and Human Services funding, including money used for family planning, from going to any clinic or health care facility that also offers abortion services.The two-year budget agreement reached by Senate leaders would contribute hundreds of billions of dollars to federal deficits.Though the language is broadly written, its intended target is Planned Parenthood, which relies on government funding to offer a variety of services to women other than abortion. The budget would help achieve the longstanding goal of social conservatives to cut off Planned Parenthood from federal assistance.\u2014Jeremy W. PetersThe White House is proposing a significant change for a low-income food program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. The White House proposes to cut funding for the program by about $213 billion \u2014 or 30 percent \u2014 over a decade. It also wants to change how SNAP recipients get their food, replacing a portion of the benefits that allow SNAP recipients to go to a grocery store to purchase food with a package of \u201cnutritious\u201d American-grown food delivered to SNAP households.The White House says the proposal is \u201ca bold new approach\u201d to administering SNAP that combines traditional benefits with \u201c100-percent American grown foods provided directly to households.\u201dThe Department of Homeland Security would receive $46 billion, a $3.4 billion increase over the enacted 2017 budget, all part of the administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and build a wall on the border with Mexico. The request calls for $18 billion for border security, including $1.6 billion to build about 65 miles of the wall in South Texas. The request also calls for the department to hire 2,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 750 Border Patrol agents.While most of the budget increases focus on illegal immigration and border security, the administration also requested funding to hire 450 new agents for the chronically-short staffed Secret Service, $1 billion for the department\u2019s cybersecurity efforts and $71 million for new scanning technology for the Transportation Security Administration. The new budget request would provide $1.9 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s grant program to state and local communities, $800 million less than the $2.7 billion funded in 2017.\u2014Ron NixonMr. Trump\u2019s second federal spending plan proposes steep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency, despite Congress\u2019 rejection of a similar plan last year to dramatically shrink the agency\u2019s budget.The fiscal 2019 budget blueprint would pare the E.P.A. by $2.8 billion or 34 percent from its current level, while eliminating virtually all climate change-related programs. It also would cut the agency\u2019s Office of Science and Technology nearly in half, to $489 million from its current $762 million.In outlining the budget, the administration said the E.P.A. is refocusing on what it called \u201ccore activities\u201d and eliminating \u201clower priority programs.\u201d That list includes a program to promote partnerships with the private sector to tackle climate change; environmental education training; and an effort to protect marine estuaries.The White House estimated cutting those programs and others will save taxpayers $600 million compared to 2017 levels.\u2014Lisa FriedmanMr. Trump\u2019s budget proposes once again to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act and to eliminate the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. More than 30 states have expanded Medicaid under the law. Republican efforts to dismantle the law failed in Congress last year.As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump said there would be \u201cno cuts\u201d to Medicare or Medicaid if he won the election. But his 2019 budget request is full of proposals to squeeze savings out of the two programs, which together provide health insurance for more than 100 million Americans.Proposed savings in Medicare total more than $490 billion over 10 years, or about 5 percent of Medicare spending expected under current law.The budget would cut $69.5 billion over 10 years in projected Medicare payments to hospitals for \u201cuncompensated care.\u201d It would cut more than $95 billion over 10 years from nursing homes and home health agencies, and $22 billion from Medicare Advantage plans, which manage care for about one-third of Medicare beneficiaries.In addition, the budget would cut $48 billion over 10 years in Medicare payments to teaching hospitals for graduate medical education,The budget includes several proposals intended to reduce out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries by requiring insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to share at least one-third of the discounts and price concessions they receive from drug manufacturers. The budget would also establish a limit on beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs covered by Medicare.\u2014Robert PearThe Treasury Department plan calls for continuing to cut the budget of the Office of Financial Research, which was set up in the wake of the financial crisis to help federal agencies stay ahead of financial risks. The office, which provides analysis and research to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, has previously been targeted for both funding and personnel cuts. \u201cThe Budget reflects continued reductions in O.F.R. spending commensurate with the renewed fiscal discipline being applied across the Federal Government.\u201dThe D.E.A. would receive an addition $41 million to specifically combat the opioid crisis, and the agency would also take over the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, which is currently run by the White House drug czar\u2019s office.\u2014Ali WatkinsAt the State Department and USAID, the president\u2019s budget proposes a base budget of $25.8 billion, a $9 billion decrease in funding from the 2017 enacted budget. This is a 26 percent decrease in funding, similar to the president\u2019s budgetary intentions last year.Notably, the president\u2019s new budget aims to shift $12 billion from Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding to the base budget. The OCO is traditionally used for United States presence in turbulent regions like Syria and Iraq.The addendum provides an additional $1 billion to USAID\u2019s International Disaster Assistance account for use in humanitarian crises as well as an additional $400 million for the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\u2014Emily BaumgaertnerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Necessary Immigration Debate", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe argument-ending rejoinders ran as follows: Trump is a racist, Miller is a racist, and making major deals with them normalizes presidential bigotry. Since I agree that Trump\u2019s race-baiting is disgraceful, I respect that rejoinder, and I don\u2019t think my own arguments are likely to dislodge people from a firm point of moral principle.But another kind of response is worth disputing. Instead of making a moral judgment, it purports to make an empirical one, implying that the serious case for immigration restriction is all but nonexistent, and that negotiating with restrictionists is therefore like negotiating with flat-earthers.I want to challenge this view by expanding on two points that I mentioned last week, both of which offer reasons to regard immigration as a normal policy question with costs as well as benefits to any course you choose.\u2026 And they do so out of sight and mind for the winners in this system, who inhabit a world where they only see their fellow winners and their hard-working multiethnic service class. Which in turn encourages them toward mild contempt for their fellow countrymen who don\u2019t want to live under a cosmopolitan-ruled caste system, who feel alienated from the Californian or Parisian future.In both cases there\u2019s a fantasy of replacement that\u2019s politically corrosive, and that\u2019s one reason why Donald Trump is president and Jeb! and Hillary are not.Now all of the foregoing is one-sided. It leaves out the real advantages of immigration, economic and humanitarian, which are part of the policy calculus as well \u2014 as is the recent decline in illegal immigration, and the fact that the problems I\u2019ve identified are more manageable in America than Europe. Hence my own view that keeping current immigration levels while bringing in more immigrants to compete with our economy\u2019s winners and fewer to compete for low-wage work represents a reasonable middle ground.But the calculus is not simple, a middle ground is actually worth seeking, and recent immigration plays a role not only in America\u2019s greatness, but in our divisions and disappointments as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Volatile Again. Get Used to It.", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fear generated by Wall Street\u2019s sharp fall in recent days had been greatly magnified by the calm that preceded it. Before the 8 percent decline in United States stocks over the past week \u2014 which was followed by a bounce back of nearly 2 percent on Tuesday \u2014 the S. & P. 500 had gone two years without suffering a drop that large. Spoiled by this unnaturally placid stretch, many Americans had forgotten what a routine market setback even looks like.They better get used to this. In a typical year, according to data going back three decades, the market experiences a correction of about 10 percent. What Americans are witnessing now is thus a return to normal market behavior, which has never followed a straight line.This year could be pivotal, because the conditions that underpinned the steady upward march of stock prices are now likely to deteriorate. In the United States and around the world, stocks have been buoyed by the trifecta of accelerating global growth, low inflation and loose central bank policies, all of which are now poised to turn against the bubbly market.This looming shortage of workers is now putting upward pressure on wage growth, which has been steadily rising in recent months. And historically, wage growth has been a strong driver of inflation, as workers use their expanded paycheck to bid up prices for goods and services.The scale and timing of a turn in the markets is likely to be decided by the third leg of the trifecta: easy money. Central banks have been printing money like never before, holding interest rates at record lows for extended stretches. Investors have used this cheap liquidity to drive up prices for everything from stocks and bonds to Bitcoin and fine art. The United States stock market is now around 25 percent higher than it would have been had it grown at its historic average pace.Stock values have rarely risen so high, yet many seasoned investors had come to believe that these nosebleed valuations could be justified as long as the Federal Reserve Board kept interest rates low. When investors are worried about the future, they move money into cash, and today their cash balances are at record lows. In other words, complacency was arguably at a record high when the correction began last week.In the past, whenever the stock market has been this expensive, an increase in interest rates has brought it back down to earth. In recent years, the swelling size of the stock market has magnified the potential economic impact of a correction. If the stock market suddenly reverts to its long-term trend, implying a fall of almost 25 percent, it could push the American economy close to recession.All eyes are now on the central bank. Confidence that the idyllic economic conditions of the past year will last indefinitely has been rattled, particularly as wage growth begins to signal a return of inflation. Many investors are fretting that the Fed may be compelled to raise rates faster than anyone had expected, just the kind of negative surprise that could deflate sky-high prices in all assets, and not only for stocks. The year 2018 may be remembered as the time when the moody market beast returned to its natural state.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Debt Problems Lurking Below the Surface?", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA decade ago, concerns that companies and individuals had borrowed too much money toppled the stock market from what was then its all-time high.Now, with stocks again tumbling from record levels, are debt problems rumbling beneath the surface of what seems like a strong economy? The short answer is that, in most places in the world, the reckless borrowing that led up to the financial crisis of 2008 does not seem to have reoccurred. Still, when a long period of low interest rates ends, as appears to be the case now, all the borrowers and lenders who have grown used to cheap credit may retrench in ways that may not be initially obvious. In other words, debt has a propensity to bite the economy on the behind just when it least expects it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Bell Pottinger, P.R. Firm for Despots and Rogues, Met Its End in South Africa", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "The British firm Bell Pottinger, hired by three brothers now caught up in a nationwide corruption scandal, helped drive racial tensions to levels not felt since apartheid.Supported byThis is ironic because Bell Pottinger always seemed defiantly beyond shame. During its 30 years in the upper echelons of Britain\u2019s spin doctoring game, it sought to polish the image of dictators (Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus), repressive regimes (Bahrain and Egypt, to name two) and celebrities accused of despicable crimes (the Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius after he was charged with murder).As the power of the Guptas and their holding company, Oakbay Investments, gained attention, the family wanted the public relations equivalent of a stun grenade \u2014 a distraction that would draw attention away from them and onto their many enemies.So Bell Pottinger was retained, and given an assignment that initially sounded benign enough: grass-roots political activism intended to help poor blacks.By the following year, Bell Pottinger was embroiled in a national maelstrom. In TV reports, editorials and public rallies, it stood accused of setting off racial tensions through a furtive campaign built on Twitter bots, hate-filled websites and speeches. All were pushing a highly toxic narrative, namely that whites in South Africa had seized resources and wealth while they deprived blacks of education and jobs. The message was popularized with an incendiary phrase, \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201dHow Bell Pottinger went bankrupt is a tale of corporate skulduggery that seems lifted from \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the P.R. edition. During the Gupta disaster, a vicious boardroom struggle unfolded, one that pitted a co-founder, Tim Bell, against James Henderson, 53, who ran the firm in the years before it went under. Their conflict centered on the perennials of business potboilers, namely power and money.The scandal has engulfed the nation. Mr. Zuma is a member of the African National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela and post-apartheid comity. His alliance with the Guptas, and their exploitation of racial animosity, has underscored just how far the party has wandered from its roots after winning its first election in 1994.Though the only corporate fatality, Bell Pottinger is just one of the companies tainted by the Guptas. A small coterie of multinationals is now under investigation by South African authorities, including local units of three companies, McKinsey, KPMG and the software giant SAP.The Guptas\u2019 most devastating legacy is the harm they did to the cause of economic reform. With so many blacks in South Africa mired in poverty, the topic is urgent, but discussion about it has been debased by its association with a notorious and self-serving P.R. campaign.In the midst of that campaign, racial tensions rose to levels that had not been felt since apartheid. \u201cWhite monopoly capital,\u201d a phrase that for years had been confined to left-wing academic circles, was suddenly unavoidable. A political group with reported links to the Guptas warned of a coming civil war.When Bell Pottinger\u2019s role became public, protesters rallied against the company, both in South Africa and outside the firm\u2019s London office. A subsequent investigation by the Public Relations and Communications Association, a trade group in Britain, ended with the ejection of Bell Pottinger.\u201cIn my years of running the P.R.C.A., I have never seen anything worse, never seen anything equal to it,\u201d Francis Ingham, director general of the trade association, said in an interview. \u201cThe work was on a completely new scale of awfulness. Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201dWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.London is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.It was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\u201cMorality is a job for priests,\u201d he deadpanned in a recent interview, between puffs of an ever-present cigarette. \u201cNot P.R. men.\u201dWith the company co-founder, Piers Pottinger, Mr. Bell conceived a \u201cgo anywhere, do anything\u201d ethos, as they called it. When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.Bell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.This included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.After two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.When the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.In fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.The Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.Fret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201dMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201dBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201dThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201dThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201dSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.The corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.The billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201dBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.Mr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.For his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201dThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.More than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.There were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.As the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.An atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201dNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201dFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\u201cMe and others felt that there was something strange going on under the surface of this onslaught,\u201d said Pieter-Louis Myburgh, author of \u201cThe Republic of Gupta.\u201d \u201cLong before Bell Pottinger\u2019s role became known, we smelled a rat.\u201dThe campaign coincided with a period in which the Guptas badly needed a makeover. The brothers had moved to South Africa from Uttar Pradesh in India in 1993 at the behest of their father, who thought the end of apartheid was a terrific business opportunity. The Guptas befriended a variety of A.N.C. luminaries, including Mr. Zuma.Relationships with politicians were soon producing results, said Mr. Myburgh. In 2016, South Africa\u2019s Sunday Times listed Atul Gupta as the seventh richest man in the country, with a net worth equivalent to more than $700 million.The brothers had operated in relative obscurity until 2013, when a jet filled with some 200 guests attending the four-day wedding of a Gupta niece was given permission by a highly placed official to land at an air force base that ordinarily barred commercial traffic. The public was incensed.From there, the publicity would only get worse. Politicians described being summoned to the Gupta compound and offered ministerial jobs and, on occasion, multimillion-dollar bribes.In March 2016, a onetime A.N.C. member of Parliament named Vytjie Mentor wrote on Facebook, and later in a sworn affidavit, that the Guptas said she could become minister of public enterprises, though only if she helped cancel the India route flown by South African Airways. (The Guptas had links to a rival.) When she declined, Jacob Zuma ambled into the room and told her, in Zulu, \u201cIt\u2019s OK, girl. Take care of yourself,\u201d according to the affidavit.Bell Pottinger\u2019s work for the Guptas was not widely known until November 2016, when a video interview of Ajay Gupta, arranged by the company, leaked to the media. The content of the interview was largely banal. It was proof, though, that one of Britain\u2019s most famous P.R. firms was helping the brothers.The leak alarmed Mr. Henderson because the video resided exclusively on the company\u2019s servers. Mr. Henderson hired Pelican Worldwide, a corporate intelligence firm, to determine whether someone had hacked Bell Pottinger\u2019s system. When no signs of hacking were found, suspicion inside the company fell on Jonathan Lehrle and Darren Murphy, two executives who would depart in December 2016 and start a new P.R. firm with Mr. Bell.Both men deny involvement.Bell Pottinger\u2019s links to the Guptas went full-on radioactive in March of last year, when a mysterious 21-page report was posted on the website of the South African Communist Party. Written anonymously and without any cited sources, the report laid out the history of Bell Pottinger\u2019s work for the Guptas, tagging the firm as the brains behind Twitter hashtags, like #HandsofftheGuptas and an array of bogus social media accounts.Mr. Henderson issued a news release asserting the report contained statements that were \u201cwholly untrue.\u201dHe had a point.Instead, the role of Bell Pottinger was to keep a close eye on social media related to the Guptas and their enemies. A cache of some 200,000 internal documents, christened the GuptaLeaks, that wound up in the media last summer, includes a Bell Pottinger presentation titled \u201cGupta Family online landscape briefing document.\u201d It tracks mentions of the Guptas and a list of hashtags and keywords, some pro-Gupta, some anti-Gupta.\u201cSentiment is more positive in conversations online compared to yesterday,\u201d the report states.Likewise, there is scant evidence that Bell Pottinger promoted \u201cwhite monopoly capital,\u201d the phrase that helped doom it. A law firm report commissioned by the company later concluded that employees of the firm had used the phrase \u201con occasion.\u201d That is more often than is defensible, though it hardly explains the term\u2019s sudden vogue.The 21-page document had credibility, however, because it contained details that only insiders could have known, some of which were utterly gratuitous. Like the cost to rent the Italian villa for the wedding of Victoria Geoghegan, the Bell Pottinger executive who led the South African team.A few days after the report went public, an anti-Zuma demonstration in South Africa included anti-Bell Pottinger placards. One showed a photograph of Ms. Geoghegan with blood dripping from her lips and the words \u201cGupta\u2019s Girl\u201d over her head. A demonstration in front of Bell Pottinger\u2019s London office soon followed.In April, Bell Pottinger canceled its deal with the Guptas, citing \u201cincreasingly strong social media attacks on our staff and our business.\u201d It didn\u2019t help.Nor did Mr. Henderson\u2019s \u201cunequivocal and absolute apology\u201d in July, or his resignation in September the day before Britain\u2019s P.R. trade group tossed out Bell Pottinger. The company suffered \u00a38 million worth of client losses in 48 hours and layoffs began soon after.Other companies linked, both directly and indirectly, with the Guptas are just beginning to deal with fallout of their own. The South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission is pursuing criminal complaints that emerged from an investigation into state contracts and the Gupta-Zuma nexus, which have ensnared KPMG, SAP and McKinsey.A spokeswoman for KPMG said in a statement that apologies have been made \u201cto those affected,\u201d adding that nine senior partners at the company had departed. SAP issued a statement in October apologizing \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d and noting that three staff members had been placed on leave. McKinsey has denied involvement in acts of bribery or corruption and issued a statement saying, \u201cWe are sorry for the distress this matter has caused the people of South Africa.\u201dFor its part, Bell Pottinger never shook allegations that it ran that vitriolic social media campaign, nor that it was responsible for injecting \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d into the national dialogue.Clearly, Bell Pottinger was not an innocent bystander, and for a crisis management firm, it did a terrible job of managing this crisis. At least a dozen chances were missed to avert calamity.\u201cAs chief executive at the time, I take culpability for not closing down the account in the early stages,\u201d Mr. Henderson said in an interview. \u201cWhilst I was not involved at any time in any way in the account, I should have taken action earlier.\u201dIts errors notwithstanding, the company ended up being blamed for an even greater number of misdeeds than it actually committed, and it is worth asking how that happened.Former employees contend that they were the target of \u2014 what else? \u2014 a furtive P.R. campaign.Inside Bell Pottinger, it was widely believed that Mr. Bell wanted to damage the company just enough to weaken Mr. Henderson and compel a change of leadership.\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, who stated that he had nothing to do with the 21-page report. At the same time, he readily acknowledges that he started plans to take control of Bell Pottinger as soon as he left it. He hoped to line up investors and buy up enough shares to force out Mr. Henderson. He said he abandoned the plan after deciding that the firm was beyond saving.The Gupta-Bell Pottinger campaign backfired on just about everyone, especially the Guptas. In an August statement, the brothers said they intended to sell all of their South African holdings by the end of 2017.Mr. Zuma could soon be removed by his party over issues of corruption and the stagnant economy. His term was supposed to end in 2019, but Cyril Ramaphosa, the man who became head of the A.N.C. in December, has called for Mr. Zuma to step down. A judicial inquiry was recently announced to investigate \u201cstate capture\u201d and the president\u2019s relationship to the Guptas.A spokesman for the Guptas did not return emails. President Zuma has repeatedly denied all accusations of corruption.Mr. Henderson lost everything when the firm failed, starting with his reputation. He became known as the guy in charge of a public relations company that perished in a public relations fiasco.The British media reported that he lost his entire life\u2019s savings when Bell Pottinger evaporated and for a time, he also seemed to have lost his fianc\u00e9e. The American socialite Heather Kerzner had invested a sizable chunk of her personal wealth in Bell Pottinger four months before it went under. The wedding was originally scheduled for November. Mr. Henderson said the couple hoped to marry.\u201cThat\u2019s our intention,\u201d he said.But arguably the greatest casualty of the Gupta-Bell Pottinger campaign is the very cause it nominally championed, helping impoverished blacks. Like most propaganda, the ideas promoted by the Guptas contained kernels of truth. The economic advancement of blacks postapartheid has indeed been painfully slow.The topic is now exponentially more fraught, given its association with the Guptas, who tried to use it as a way to enrich themselves and expand their power. For a young democracy that is grappling with a history of institutionalized racism and trying to spread wealth more evenly throughout the country, the results have been tragic.\u201cThe damage done by this campaign is not over,\u201d said Sipho Pityana, a businessman who headed the Department of Labour under the Mandela administration. \u201cIt shapes the discourse about inequality in South Africa to this day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In South Africa, One Question Dominates: How Much Longer Should Zuma Stay?", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 It is, in South Africa\u2019s political parlance, the season of the two centers of power.And now the single question driving the politics of South Africa has become one of timing. When will Mr. Zuma cease to be South Africa\u2019s president?As that question hangs in the air, the people around the two men have to decide which one to back, how strongly and when. It is as if an older sun has lost its gravitational pull to a newer one \u2014 and the orbiting planets, in some confusion, have been realigning themselves.Under South Africa\u2019s Constitution, the Parliament elects the president. That leaves the A.N.C., which dominates the legislative body, with two options if it wants to recall Mr. Zuma before the end of his term in 2019: Order him to step down and avoid bringing the matter to Parliament; or allow the anti-Zuma camp to join forces with opposition lawmakers to impeach him.Among Mr. Zuma\u2019s supporters, the reaction has been more complicated. A few high-profile former allies of the president, including the finance and police ministers, have leapt into Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s camp with head-spinning speed.Others have dug in, clearly hoping to extend Mr. Zuma\u2019s presidency \u2014 and their own power \u2014 as long as they can.\u201cWe should never do it in a way that is going to humiliate President Zuma,\u201d said Mr. Ramaphosa, who has been the nation\u2019s deputy president since 2014.Even as negotiations over Mr. Zuma\u2019s departure continue, power has begun to shift in real ways. Mr. Ramaphosa led the nation\u2019s delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, effectively acting as South Africa\u2019s leader on the world stage.More significantly, there have been domestic developments that would have been highly unlikely before Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s election as party leader in December.At some state enterprises, which have been the source of much public corruption in recent years, Mr. Zuma\u2019s allies have been quickly replaced by respected officials chosen by Mr. Ramaphosa. State prosecutors have begun investigating some senior political allies of the president, along with the Guptas, a powerful family with close business ties with Mr. Zuma\u2019s relatives and his inner circle.Mr. Zuma\u2019s fate now lies with the A.N.C.\u2019s top leadership, which remains divided, with an edge in Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s favor, political analysts said.He spoke at a rally in Mr. Zuma\u2019s home province, KwaZulu-Natal, where loyalists voiced strong support. The province, which is the A.N.C.\u2019s biggest source of votes nationally, remains one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s strongest cards in his negotiations with Mr. Ramaphosa \u2014 as does the party\u2019s youth league, which held the rally.Mandla Shange, the youth league\u2019s spokesman in KwaZulu-Natal, dismissed any talk of removing Mr. Zuma.\u201cThat\u2019s not a decision you just take,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere must be a transition plan between President Zuma and President Ramaphosa. That is why President Zuma\u2019s term of office ends in 2019, so we expect President Zuma to continue to be president until 2019.\u201dBut analysts say that because of the survival instinct of the A.N.C., which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, it is unlikely that Mr. Zuma will be allowed to serve out his full term. The longer Mr. Zuma stays in power, the harder it will be for Mr. Ramaphosa to rebuild the party\u2019s brand before next year\u2019s elections.How and when Mr. Zuma leaves office, experts say, will influence how much Mr. Ramaphosa can reinvent the A.N.C. before next year\u2019s elections.\u201cThe A.N.C.\u2019s continued, foolhardy inability to remove President Zuma clearly indicates that the A.N.C. cannot be trusted and cannot be relied upon to bring about the changes promised by its newly elected leadership,\u201d Bantu Holomisa, leader of the opposition United Democratic Movement, said in a news conference.He was disappointed that the A.N.C.\u2019s top leaders had not tried to remove Mr. Zuma at their first meeting in January. But he was impressed by prosecutors moving against some of Mr. Zuma\u2019s political and business allies, and the thought of returning to the A.N.C. was no longer inconceivable to him.\u201cOnce Ramaphosa gets rid of Zuma and all those corrupt guys are taken to task, perhaps then I can have another way of thinking \u2014 but only then,\u201d Mr. Zitha said. \u201cZuma must be toothless. But right now he still has teeth. He can chew whatever he wants to chew.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paroling the Spanish Prisoner (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnyway, one of the issues that came up was the recovery in Europe, which is real and in some ways a bigger story for the world economy than the continuation of the Obama expansion here. An obvious question, which Anil raised, was whether this recovery calls for a reconsideration by Euroskeptics like myself. And my answer is no and yes: No, the economics of the euro look about as bad as we expected. Yes, we underestimated the political cohesion of the single currency, the willingness of political elites to suffer enormous economic pain in order to stay in the monetary union.I think I can illustrate all of these points with the case of Spain, which is in some ways at the heart of the euro story. During the good years money poured into Spain, fueling a huge housing bubble. This fed inflation that made Spanish industry uncompetitive, leading to a huge trade deficit. When the music stopped, Spain saw unemployment soar; it then went into a painful process of \u201cinternal devaluation,\u201d slowly squeezing down unit labor costs while costs in northern Europe gradually rose. And eventually this worked: Spain resumed fairly rapid growth, boosted by surging exports of autos and other manufactured goods.But even if we take the IMF estimate at face value, it says that over the period 2008-2018 Spain suffered an enormous cumulative loss of output it could have produced: 33 percent of potential G.D.P. That\u2019s as if the U.S. were forced to pay a price of more than $6 trillion to, say, remain on the gold standard. Not all of this loss can be attributed to the necessity of achieving competitiveness through relative deflation rather than simply devaluing, but surely much of it can.So the economics of the euro have been as bad as critics warned they would. Spain in effect spent years as the economic prisoner of the single currency, and the fact that it eventually received parole doesn\u2019t change that fact. Remarkably, however, Spain stayed the course, paid the price, and is now more or less back to where it needs to be. So the politics of the euro have been far more robust than we Anglo-Americans could have imagined.Advertisement"}

It sits defenseless, all but surrounded by encroaching basins of water. Just two miles north is the jagged tip of a fortresslike levee, a primary line of defense for greater New Orleans, whose skyline looms in the distance. Everything south of that 14-foot wall of demarcation, including the gritty little town of Jean Lafitte, has effectively been left to the tides.This three-part special report about the ecological crisis facing Louisiana\u2019s vanishing coast, and the people who live there, is the\n        product of a partnership between The New York Times\n        and NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune of New Orleans.Jean Lafitte may be just a pinprick on the map, but it is also a harbinger of an uncertain future. As climate change contributes to rising sea levels, threatening to submerge land from Miami to Bangladesh, the question for Lafitte, as for many coastal areas across the globe, is less whether it will succumb than when \u2014 and to what degree scarce public resources should be invested in artificially extending its life.One sweltering evening last July, almost everyone from around Lafitte gathered near dusk at the bayou\u2019s edge to celebrate the expenditure of nearly $4 million of those scarce public resources. There were shrimpers and crabbers, tug captains and roughnecks, teachers and cops. All had come for the ribbon cutting for a grand new seafood pavilion, the latest gambit by the longtime mayor, Timothy P. Kerner, to save the town from drowning.Free beer sloshed in plastic cups as folks ambled about the cavernous, open-sided shed, sampling shrimp r\u00e9moulade and alligator-stuffed mushrooms. Once the politicians had finished flattering one another from the podium, a Cajun band, fronted by a fiddler in a shimmery blue dress, cranked up a rollicking fais-dodo.Amid the celebration, a fireplug of a man in crisp jeans and a starched white shirt cheek-kissed and bro-hugged his way through the crowd. This was Timmy Kerner\u2019s party. In his third decade as mayor, Mr. Kerner had managed to persuade the parish, state and federal governments to pay for his signature showcase at the entry to town.It might seem counterintuitive to keep building on land that is submerging. But Mr. Kerner did not see it as his job to take a 10,000-foot view. In the years since Hurricane Katrina, he had grown weary of being rebuffed in his quixotic campaign to encircle Lafitte with a tall and impregnable levee. He could rhapsodize all he wanted about preserving his community\u2019s authentic way of life. The cost-benefit calculus \u2014 more than $1 billion to protect fewer than 7,000 people \u2014 always weighed against him.So he had set out to change it. His strategy was to secure so much public investment for Jean Lafitte that it would eventually become too valuable to abandon. In a decade, he had built a 1,300-seat auditorium, a library, a wetlands museum, a civic center and a baseball park. Jean Lafitte did not have a stop light, but it had a senior center, a medical clinic, an art gallery, a boxing club, a nature trail and a visitor center where animatronic puppets acted out the story of its privateer namesake.Some of the facilities had been used sparingly, and many at the grand opening questioned whether the seafood pavilion would be much different. To the mayor that was largely beside the point. What mattered was that the structure existed, that its poured concrete and steel beams made Lafitte that much more permanent.\u201cDo we lose that investment, or do we protect it?\u201d Mr. Kerner asked, barely audible above the din. \u201cI hope people will see that, hey, not only are we fighting hard to exist, but, you know, maybe this place is worth saving.\u201dThe sky began to dim over the bayou. \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful place, and it\u2019s getting prettier by the day,\u201d he said, ticking off his improvement projects. \u201cThis is just another step at building the community. It sends a message that we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201cNo matter what, we\u2019re not leaving.\u201dLouisiana\u2019s \u201cworking coast\u201d is dotted with communities that, like Lafitte, may not outlast the people who currently live there: Cocodrie, Delacroix, Dulac, Grand Isle, Isle de Jean Charles, Kraemer, Leeville, Paradis, Pointe-aux-Chenes, Venice.Since prospectors first discovered oil in Louisiana 117 years ago, 57,465 wells have been drilled in 10 coastal parishes, according to the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources. Thousands of miles of canals have been dredged through marshes for access. They broaden each year from erosion caused by boat traffic and storm currents, even as their spoil banks block natural water flow. A 50,000-mile thicket of pipelines connects rigs to refineries and tank farms across the state.After years of laissez-faire regulation, some consequential finger-pointing has begun in the courts, where parish governments and private landowners are for the first time suing energy companies to rebuild their land. To date that burden has fallen mostly on taxpayers, even when the property being repaired is owned by oil and gas interests, an examination of state records shows.The impact extends far beyond Louisiana\u2019s shoreline.Last year, Louisiana officials acknowledged for the first time that even with a vast restoration program, even with tens of billions of dollars they do not have, they no longer believed they could build land fast enough to offset the losses. Plotted on a map, their projections show 40-mile swaths, encompassing Jean Lafitte and everything below it, splashed in red to denote that, without action, they will disappear within decades. The crisis has become existential, with policymakers confronting choices about which communities they can afford to rescue.Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, insists that his state is \u201cnot in full retreat mode,\u201d that \u201cthe science shows there is a window of opportunity\u201d to sustain portions of the coast. But in a state not known for fiscal oversight, concerns linger about whether good money will be thrown after bad.\u201cPeople argue that if you make the investments appropriately it will be fine, and it could be,\u201d said Mitch Landrieu, the outgoing mayor of New Orleans. \u201cBut nobody really ever has the appetite to have a conversation about cutting off your arms so you can still walk.\u201dThe sputter and thrum of boat motors announces the morning along Bayou Barataria well before sunup. Burly men in rubber boots load ice and bait into trawlers moored behind their houses and prepare to push off in the dark.On a clear day out on the Pen, a four-mile lake that was farmland a century ago, the silhouettes of New Orleans office towers and the Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery are visible to the north and east. Lines of crab traps stretch across the flat water, buoyed with floats painted in their owners\u2019 signature colors, like jockeys\u2019 silks. Alligator snouts skim the surface of nearby canals, and a boat\u2019s approach sends a blue heron flapping into labored flight.The people of Lafitte have lived off the water for generations \u2014 trapping and skinning muskrats and other marsh dwellers, fishing, crabbing, oystering, building and repairing boats, ferrying workers and supplies to offshore rigs. Many accept the irony that the water may eventually destroy the economy it built.Jean Lafitte is laid out for six linear miles along a two-lane road that curves around the east bank of the bayou. Newer houses on land subdivided from a 19th-century sugar cane plantation were built atop six-foot mounds to keep the water at bay. Many older structures have been elevated hydraulically and placed on pillars 10 feet or higher, a process that can cost nearly as much as the house is worth. While government programs pick up some of the expense, there is not enough funding, and some homeowners cannot afford their share, which often exceeds $100,000.Yet many cannot imagine living anywhere else. They complain that the bloodless cost-benefit formulas determining which communities get protection give little weight to the qualities that make Lafitte desirable (the name Lafitte is used to refer to the town and its adjacent unincorporated areas). Children, they point out, still spend barefoot summers tubing and fishing and training bird dogs to leap off docks. And when they graduate from high school, three-fourths will have been together since prekindergarten.The policymakers \u201cdon\u2019t place value on anything but the money, not the longevity of these communities, not the culture,\u201d said Tracy Kuhns, 64, a longtime resident of the Barataria community across the bayou from Jean Lafitte. \u201cOne of the problems in this country is that people don\u2019t have any connection to where they live. People really want that. Why would you take it away from people who already have it?\u201dMs. Kuhns, the president of Louisiana Bayoukeeper, an advocacy group for water quality and clean fisheries, pointed out that she did not lock her door (which flies open all day as her 17 grandchildren come and go). There have been but two murders in Jean Lafitte in the past 20 years, compared with 3,829 in New Orleans.At the center of town sits St. Anthony Catholic Church, which sponsors the Blessing of the Fleet Festival when brown shrimp season opens each spring. The first catch fills the freezers of cousins and neighbors before anything left is sold to Nunez Seafood and other dockside wholesalers.After a long day on the water, some may wet their whistle with $2.75 Budweisers at Mitch Martin\u2019s Welcome Inn, where a swamp-pop band plays on Wednesday nights and gray-haired ladies line dance.The tavern is run by Timothy and Thomas Wiseman, brothers better known as White Boy and Zabo. Almost everybody in Lafitte has a nickname, some more self-explanatory than others: Skinny Boy, Sandbags, Lunch Meat, Pink Cow. When Tom Wiseman, 52, was a child, someone decided he looked like another guy nicknamed Zabo. \u201cForty years it has followed me now,\u201d he said.The Wisemans find that the absence of levee protection reinforces the sense of Lafitte as a place apart, for better and worse. \u201cWe\u2019re outside the line, and they don\u2019t care about us,\u201d Tim Wiseman, 54, said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like that.\u201d\u201cNow we just expect water and damage every five years,\u201d his brother said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life.\u201d\u201cAnd you know what? It still does not make us want to leave,\u201d Tim said. \u201cAre we economically feasible? Hell no. But this place will survive. If we end up living on rafts, there will be people living here.\u201dAlthough only two feet above sea level, Lafitte rarely experienced significant damage from hurricanes until 2005. That year, Katrina\u2019s 120-mile-per-hour winds stripped roofs off houses; a month later, Rita sent enough water coursing through lower Jefferson Parish to dislodge whitewashed tombs from graveyards. Homeowners in Lafitte found skulls and an artificial hip among the debris. Together, the storms forced the demolition of more than 150 houses.\u201cThe first time, I sat on the sofa and just watched it come in,\u201d remembered Chris Dufrene, 73, whose house flooded three times before he had it elevated eight feet three years ago. \u201cWorst feeling I\u2019ve ever had. Nothing you can do about it.\u201dShrimpers and guides had been noticing astonishing changes out on the water for years. Shambles of fishing cabins sat stranded on pilings, more distant from shore each season. Duck blinds had dissolved into muck. Land bridges no longer bridged.\u201cI\u2019ve been out here since 1981, and the beaches are eroding, the salt water\u2019s intruding and all the islands in Barataria estuary that were protecting the land are washing away,\u201d said Troy Schultz, 54, who trawls and crabs with his son, Troy Jr., 28. \u201cBig Island is gone. Cat Island is gone. St. Mary\u2019s Island is gone. They were miles long. Now it\u2019s so open that every time you get squalls and storms it pulls up the marsh grass.\u201dThese days, the main road through Jean Lafitte floods almost any time a gusty storm blows in from the south. A mere sideswipe from Tropical Storm Cindy last June pushed several feet of water into streets and yards. The merciless hurricane season of 2017, with Harvey followed by Irma, Maria and Nate, made clear that the town\u2019s days may be numbered.After Katrina left 1,833 dead in 2005, local, state and federal governments spent more than $20 billion to redesign failed and inadequate levees and pumps for metropolitan New Orleans. Even those improvements may not be sufficient to spare the area\u2019s more than 1.3 million residents from another monster storm.But in Lafitte, only 25 miles south, the hurricane defense system consists mainly of Mr. Kerner and whichever men he can employ to sling tens of thousands of 25-pound sandbags, often for days on end.The mayor feels the threat viscerally, like many with deep roots here. His family settled in Lafitte in the early 1800s. He married a local girl at 18 (Darla Kerner was 16), and worked as a commercial fisherman, barkeep and tax collector before assuming his place as heir to one of the country\u2019s most enduring political dynasties.Mr. Kerner has been mayor for 26 of his 58 years. With a gap of only eight years in the 1950s, a Kerner has held Lafitte\u2019s top office since 1888, when his great-grandfather became justice of the peace. His father, Leo E. Kerner Jr., spearheaded the effort to incorporate Jean Lafitte in 1974 and became its first mayor, serving 17 years.Leo Kerner had been a welterweight champ in the Navy, and taught his boys how to spar, in politics as in the ring. The current mayor is known in Jefferson Parish, Baton Rouge and Washington as a single-minded scrapper who fights best from a defensive crouch. He can be quick to lose his temper when he feels Lafitte is being disrespected, but is also fast to apologize and hug it out.Paradoxically, perhaps, some of the funding \u2014 including about a third of the cost of the seafood pavilion \u2014 has come from federal recovery grants that flow south each time the town is bludgeoned by a storm.As the water creeps closer, Mr. Kerner has increased the value of Jean Lafitte\u2019s physical plant sevenfold in a decade. And yet, on his central mission to ensure his town\u2019s future, he considers himself a failure.\u201cWhen I ran for this office,\u201d Mr. Kerner said, \u201cI ran to provide a levee. That was my dream. I guess I haven\u2019t done a very good job so far, because we don\u2019t have one.\u201dIf Lafitte has a chip on its shoulder, it is not without cause.That left Mr. Kerner to devise his own plan, and find a way to pay for it. His concept was to phase in the construction of a chain of 10 linked ring levees, 65 miles in all, that would enclose each populated sector of Lafitte. Cost dictated that the walls of dirt, steel and concrete would be seven-and-a-half feet high at the outset, enough for protection from modest storms but not from a major hurricane. A levee of at least twice that height is typically needed to meet the standard of \u201c100-year protection,\u201d meaning it should withstand flooding from a hurricane with a 1 percent chance of occurring in a given year.For a while, the corps encouraged the mayor to pursue small federal grants to build segments of the system. In 2003, with about $10 million, construction began on the first link, which will eventually contain the town\u2019s schools and municipal buildings.Then came Katrina, producing storm surge that overwhelmed portions of the New Orleans-area levee and flood wall system. In addressing the damage, Congress raised standards for the height and strength of the levees that the Corps of Engineers would build, effectively disqualifying the Lafitte project.Mr. Kerner also found little support locally, where the regional levee authority with jurisdiction over Lafitte was focused on protecting areas closer to New Orleans. In 2007, David J. Bindewald Sr., then the president of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority \u2014 West, told Mr. Kerner explicitly that there would be no money for his levees.Instead, he sent Mr. Kerner a letter offering \u201cseveral thousand un-filled sand bags and sand sufficient to fill the bags\u201d along with \u201ca quantity of shovels.\u201dThe furious mayor figured he could do better than that on his own, and persuaded allies in the Legislature to create the Lafitte Area Independent Levee District. Funded by a small property tax, the levee authority pays Mr. Kerner $12,000 a year as its president, on top of his mayoral base salary of $79,538, according to legislative audits.Mr. Kerner\u2019s power play did not instantly change the essential dynamic. In 2009, after Hurricane Gustav, the corps began studying options for a new levee that would span a stretch of the lower coastal zone. Only one of several routes under consideration would have protected Lafitte. But at a levee board meeting in 2011, corps officials announced their determination that none of the proposed alignments could be justified economically.\u201cWhat do you suggest we do?\u201d an exasperated Mr. Kerner asked Mark Wingate, the corps engineer managing the project.Mr. Wingate said he suggested studying nonstructural options, including relocation.\u201cYou\u2019re reading my mind,\u201d Mr. Kerner responded, \u201cbecause when I saw that map the first thing I thought was that I wanted to relocate your jawbone.\u201d He nodded at Mr. Wingate\u2019s two associates. \u201cAnd your jawbone and your jawbone.\u201dIn the parking lot after the meeting, the corps officials stiffened when they saw the pugilistic mayor striding purposefully toward them. But he was only coming to apologize.Bruised but not defeated, Mr. Kerner thought there might be another way.Over the past decade, the authority has grabbed money from a bag of sources to undertake 135 projects at a cost to the state of more than $2.4 billion (with another $2 billion budgeted for the next three years). Sixty-five square miles of land have been built or improved, along with 297 miles of levee and 60 miles of barrier islands and berms, according to the authority.The coast these days is awash in ambitious engineering projects. Near Jean Lafitte, for instance, more than 1,000 acres of marsh have been created in and around Bayou Dupont in an $82 million state-managed project that pumped sand from the Mississippi up to 13 miles away. Where open water stood in 2009, there is now walkable land, thick with saplings and shrubs.That made the worst-case scenario in the 2012 master plan the best case for 2017 and led to a startling reversal: Louisiana could slow the submergence of the coast, but not arrest it. Even if the plan was somehow fully funded, and the state succeeded in adding or maintaining 800 square miles of wetlands over 50 years, there would still be a net loss of at least 400 square miles and possibly as many as 3,300.That recalibration necessarily shifted the state\u2019s approach. \u201cOnce you accept the diagnosis that much of south Louisiana is going to disappear, you still have to have a strategic retreat,\u201d said David Muth, director of the National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Gulf Restoration Program. \u201cHow do you plan this shrinking of the footprint, which is complicated by socioeconomics and by real questions about how fast sea level will rise and how fast you can build wetlands?\u201dTorbj\u00f6rn E. T\u00f6rnqvist, a Tulane geologist who is an authority on subsidence, warned that decisions about places like Lafitte would be \u201ca piece of cake compared to what\u2019s coming \u2014 because a little down the line we\u2019re going to be talking about communities not of 2,000 people but of much bigger things.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s the matter of where to find the master plan\u2019s aspirational $50 billion \u2014 twice the entire state budget.The state and its coastal parishes have been counting on about $176 million a year from federal offshore oil leases under a revenue-sharing law passed in 2006. But steep declines in prices and drilling have lowered those projections.All told, even under the rosiest circumstances, the $50 billion master plan, which many experts consider inadequate, lacks at least $30 billion in revenue.\u201cAll of us believe our citizens deserve more than probably we can deliver,\u201d said Bren Haase, the authority\u2019s chief of planning and research.For its 2017 revision, the authority split its theoretical budget between hopeful restoration efforts, like rebuilding marshes and barrier islands, and defensive risk-reduction projects like raising levees and elevating houses. It re-evaluated proposals with a refined formula that weighed each project\u2019s cost against the flood damage it would avert.The price tag for the Lafitte ring levees had risen to $1.2 billion, equating to more than $170,000 per resident. Despite Mr. Kerner\u2019s efforts to rebalance the cost-benefit calculus, the annual savings amounted to less than a tenth of that, placing it near the bottom on the state\u2019s list. When the authority published its draft in January last year, the mayor found that his ring levees, his lifeline for Lafitte, had been discarded.The mayor and his constituents felt betrayed once again. \u201cIt just makes all your fears justified,\u201d said Ray Griffin, the manager of Cochiara\u2019s Marina. \u201cWhen they make a decision like that they just basically slap you in the face and say bye.\u201dIn an ecosystem as multifaceted as the Louisiana coast, the protection of one habitat may pose a mortal threat to another, or at least be perceived that way. Flood control is a zero-sum game. The water has to go somewhere.So there is natural suspicion in Lafitte about the most audacious engineering proposal in the state master plan, the $1.4 billion Mid-Barataria sediment diversion. The experimental project, which is under design, would carve a gap in the levee on the Mississippi\u2019s west bank just southeast of Lafitte. When the river is high, floodgates could be opened to redirect sediment-rich water into adjoining marshland at up to 75,000 cubic feet per second.This occasional freeing of the river may build land more gradually than the continual pumping of dredged sand. But environmental groups argue that it will do so in a self-sustaining way at comparatively low cost. The state estimates that the diversion will deposit enough sediment over 50 years to fill the Superdome more than 22 times.\u201cWe know we need benefits now,\u201d Mr. Haase said, \u201cbut if we\u2019re not doing anything to fundamentally change the causes of our land loss, then we\u2019re perhaps not investing our dollars wisely.\u201dIn Lafitte\u2019s fishing community, there is deep concern, with some scientific backing, that flushing fresh water into brackish marshes and bays will imbalance the salinity needed to nurture shrimp, oysters and crab. Scientists argue that salinity will change with or without the diversion, but seafood industry groups have threatened to sue if it is built.\u201cIt will completely kill these fishing communities,\u201d said Clinton Guidry, a Lafitte resident who once presided over the Louisiana Shrimp Association. \u201cIs that the trade-off you want? If you lose shrimp fishermen for one generation, they\u2019re gone forever.\u201dFor Tim Kerner, the Mid-Barataria diversion provided a bargaining chip. After his 100-year levees were axed from the master plan, he continued to push for funds to complete the ring system at lower height. The state owed Jean Lafitte, he argued, because the diversion would make the town even more vulnerable.Things came to a head in January last year when Mr. Kerner made his case, loudly, at a meeting with state officials. Seated nearby was his great benefactor in Baton Rouge, State Senate President John A. Alario Jr., a soft-spoken power broker whose district includes Lafitte.\u201cYou know,\u201d Mr. Kerner told Johnny Bradberry, the chairman of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, \u201cif I was a senator or a state rep from my area sitting at this table, I would be very upset. You have projects all along the coast, and this area, where the Senate president is from, you have nothing but a sediment diversion that nobody really wants.\u201dHe reminded the officials of all of the money the state had been spending in Lafitte \u2014 the bridges, the civic center, the seafood pavilion. \u201cIt\u2019s so inconsistent for C.P.R.A. to say we\u2019re not worth saving when other government agencies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s throwing away the investment of tax dollars you already put in this place.\u201dWhen the final master plan was presented to the Legislature in June, language had been inserted that the state and the Lafitte levee authority would be \u201cfocused on securing nearly $308 million\u201d for the lower tidal protection levees and flood walls. The plan also called for spending $200 million in Lafitte over 30 years to elevate 1,237 houses, flood-proof nine businesses and buy out two property owners. (Coastwide, the master plan calls for spending a theoretical $6 billion over 50 years to elevate, improve or buy out 26,200 properties.)The question now is how quickly money will materialize. Mr. Kerner believes the levees can be completed for considerably less than the $308 million estimate. Regardless, the state has budgeted only $35.5 million for them over the next four years.\u201cThose 2,000 folks down there would like very much for us to be committed to a $1 billion ring levee,\u201d said Mr. Edwards, the governor. \u201cWell, we just can\u2019t do that. But we haven\u2019t given up on them either.\u201dProspects seem dim for a federal bailout to shore up Lafitte and the rest of Louisiana\u2019s coast. Preserving the state\u2019s wetlands is a tough political sell because many Americans do not appreciate the magnitude of their self-interest there. Increasingly, Louisiana faces competition from more populous coastal zones that also are at grave risk, like South Florida, metropolitan New York and the Texas Gulf.The only other pockets deep enough to fill the financial gap belong to oil and gas. Even in a time of retrenchment, the energy industry remains among Louisiana\u2019s most vital employers, revenue generators and civic and political donors. But with drilling in decline and the BP oil spill a fresh memory, Louisianans seem newly receptive to holding the industry accountable for the consequences of its activities.In a recent poll of 565 Louisianans by NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune, 72 percent said the oil and gas industry should help pay for coastal restoration along with the government. (Mr. Kerner happens to agree.) Another 18 percent said the industry should bear the cost alone. Only half said they were willing to pay higher taxes to redeem the coast.In 2013, with the political landscape shifting, the levee authority charged with flood control in New Orleans sued 97 oil and gas companies, presenting a novel claim.There is considerable documentation of advance knowledge. Scientists and conservationists have sounded alarms since the 1920s about the loss of land to oil exploration. Documents uncovered through discovery show that the industry\u2019s own studies began making the connection nearly 50 years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s that old saying \u2014 you don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, also a Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t say they have no effect, the canals, but I think it\u2019s a money grab against an industry that has been very good to Louisiana.\u201dIn 2016, when the governor\u2019s office changed parties, Mr. Edwards reversed Mr. Jindal\u2019s stance and intervened in support of the parish cases. \u201cOil and gas is a huge component of our economy, and we want them to be successful,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cBut we also want them to act responsibly when they explore for and produce hydrocarbons.\u201dOil and gas industry leaders acknowledge that their potential exposure is substantial. They warn they will not roll over to trial lawyers who they believe are extorting them for a global settlement.\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight every single last issue because we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve done anything wrong,\u201d said Gifford Briggs, vice president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, which represents independent producers and service companies.Chris John, a former Democratic congressman who presides over the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, said the lawsuits failed to recognize numerous other causes of coastal degradation and would not be settled. He said that \u201cthe energy industry has conducted its operations in accordance with government-issued permits and applicable federal, state and local regulations.\u201dMr. Briggs echoed that defense. \u201cYes, if you dig a canal or build a slip, is there technically a loss of marsh or land? Sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s done through permit. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s any additional liability or responsibility beyond fulfilling the obligations of the permit.\u201dJean Lafitte has not yet reached the tipping point when bankers and insurers perceive that the lifetime of their loans and obligations could exceed the lifetime of the town. Indeed, real estate values are relatively high, if only because there is so little to be had.But there are early signs of an exodus, particularly among younger residents. The population of the area declined by 21 percent between 2000 and 2010, although estimates suggest it has rebounded slightly this decade. Enrollment at the two public schools dropped 27 percent from the peak before Katrina and Rita, but has risen by 10 percent since.Mr. Kerner believes the declines reflect temporary dislocations. But some, like Buttercup Mancuso, have left for good. She, her husband and three of their children evacuated their rental house in lower Lafitte before it flooded during Hurricane Isaac in 2012. They returned to find mold sprouting two feet up the walls.The family abandoned their belongings except for their photographs. \u201cLosing everything once was enough for me,\u201d Ms. Mancuso, 43, said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t do it again.\u201d They moved to the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, and eventually to North Carolina.Travis Johnson, 70, a retired Army and commercial helicopter pilot who moved to Barataria in 2000, said that at his age he would gladly take a government buyout for his waterfront house.\u201cI drove out of here during Hurricane Rita with water flowing over the hood of my Jeep,\u201d he said. \u201cShould one delay evacuation, it is not possible to escape. I don\u2019t want a lot of complications.\u201dBut Lafitte\u2019s lifers, for the most part, seem resigned to wait things out. The centuries spent fishing and trapping have built a resilient and self-reliant culture. More than 250 years since the Acadians were expelled from Nova Scotia, there remains a deep resistance to another forced exile.\u201cPeople that don\u2019t understand it say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just move away?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Kuhns, the Louisiana Bayoukeeper president, who refuses to join her daughter, Ms. Mancuso, on the other side of the levee. \u201cThe people who are connected to these communities don\u2019t think that way. It\u2019s a whole culture that\u2019s connected to the earth and the water. You can\u2019t replicate it.\u201dAnd so the men sandbag. Last hurricane season, they stacked them by the thousands in anticipation of Tropical Storm Cindy, then unstacked them when the floodwater receded. They did it again for Hurricane Harvey and once more for Nate.The mayor supervises up and down the road from his white Ford Expedition, crossing himself as he passes the Catholic church. He pitches in long enough to let his back start aching, then carps that it\u2019s because the young guys today don\u2019t know how to properly swing and catch.He remembers each storm as a fight, tallying them as wins and losses. In the old days, they would stack 200,000 sandbags. \u201cIt was like being in a war zone,\u201d Mr. Kerner said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t go to bed for two or three days at a time.\u201dWith sections of two of the ring levees complete, the men got by with only 20,000 sandbags when Nate narrowly missed Lafitte last October. \u201cEach time you just have to be ready and fight it as if it\u2019s going to be the worst thing that ever happened,\u201d Mr. Kerner said. \u201cAnd then you may have to do it again a week later.\u201dThe mayor has developed a sixth sense for the telltale signs of whether Lafitte will flood. As Cindy moved in last June, he watched the tide rising near the Goose Bayou bridge: \u201cThat water won\u2019t quit,\u201d he cursed. \u201cLook at the whitecaps. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t want to see.\u201d Soon the water was lapping at his tailpipe.Four months later, on the night Nate landed near Biloxi, Miss., he divined better news from the bayou\u2019s outward flow, indicating that the leading edge had curled in harmlessly from the north. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dAs he drove home, eyelids drooping, Mr. Kerner could not help feeling annoyed that the town had expended so much effort for no reason. Then he remembered that no one had been hurt, no one had been washed out of his or her home or stranded in distress. \u201cSuch a relief,\u201d he thought.He eased into bed, bone-weary and sore, like an aging boxer, and lost himself in reveries of shiny new buildings and 16-foot levees \u2014 whatever might spare Jean Lafitte from the water, for now.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the federal grant to relocate residents of Isle de Jean Charles. It is $48 million, not $43 million.Reporting was contributed by Tristan Baurick, Mark Schleifstein and Sara Sneath of NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune.Designed and produced by Danny DeBelius.Last year, The New York Times and NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune of New Orleans agreed to collaborate to bring attention to the impact of climate change on land loss in one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable and vital regions. The approach made sense because the future of Louisiana\u2019s coast, which is critical to the energy, seafood and shipping sectors, should be of great concern to those who live there as well as to those who merely benefit from its bounty. At a time of intense financial pressure on local news coverage, it was reasoned that readers of both publications would be served by joining the long expertise of NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune with the resources and skills of The Times\u2019s reporting, video, photography, graphics and design staffs.The result is this package of articles and graphic illustrations, 10 months in the making, timed to coincide with this year\u2019s tricentennial of New Orleans. The lead article tells the story of the intrepid mayor of a threatened Louisiana fishing village who is fighting to save his town from encroaching seas. Another examines the expenditure of billions of dollars to repair and improve the New Orleans levee system after Hurricane Katrina, and questions whether it is nearly enough to protect the city through its next 100 years. A third introduces readers to the latest threat to Louisiana\u2019s coast, an aphid-like insect that, along with nutria and feral hogs, is destroying the vegetation essential to keeping the wetlands from dissolving.Together, they depict a losing race against time, one likely to be replicated in coastal zones around the world as sea levels rise.

To judge from furious street protests that have swept the nation, the party devolved in the eyes of many into a patronage network enriching a well-connected few.It will not be easy.Roughly half the country lives in poverty. The official unemployment rate sits above 27 percent. And in the townships ringing cities, where the apartheid-era government forced black people to live, as many as two-thirds of young people are jobless. There, families hunker down in shacks lacking toilets and clean water, enduring rampant violent crime.\u201cThe crucial issue for South Africa is jobs and growth,\u201d said Ian Goldin, who served as a senior economic adviser to Nelson Mandela when he was president of South Africa, and is now a professor of globalization at the University of Oxford in Britain. \u201cBoth have been palpably dismal in recent years.\u201dLonger term, the challenges confronting the incoming administration are enormous.For decades, a succession of governments led by the A.N.C. have sought to bridge inequality with programs targeted at improving the lives of black South Africans. Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.These programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.They have also been riddled with corruption.At local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.The new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.Still, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.Some doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201dAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.Beyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.International sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.The result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201dIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.His success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning. But the jury is out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Asked for Patience. Remarkably, Wall Street Complied.", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAllen Gillespie is one lonely stock analyst.Of the dozens of Wall Street analysts covering Amazon, he is the only one tracked by Bloomberg who recommends that investors sell the company\u2019s shares.Mr. Gillespie, a partner at FinTrust Investment Advisors, a wealth management firm in Greenville, S.C., questions whether Amazon deserves such a stratospheric share price.\u201cEverybody thinks I am crazy,\u201d said Mr. Gillespie, who also serves on the board overseeing South Carolina\u2019s pension fund. \u201cI have had people I\u2019ve never met email me to ask if I was serious.\u201dIt is a bold call indeed. Since Mr. Gillespie put a sell rating on the company last July, Amazon\u2019s shares have increased 37 percent, to $1,429. On Friday, one day after Amazon reported the biggest quarterly profit in its history, Amazon\u2019s market value briefly crossed the $700 billion mark, and its share price increased 3 percent even as the Dow fell 2.5 percent.For most analysts, the end is not yet in sight. When the investment firm D.A. Davidson & Company predicted last month that Amazon\u2019s shares could rise to $1,800, Morgan Stanley upped the ante the next day, forecasting a possible $2,100 share price.\u201cIt\u2019s an infatuation,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern business school, who recently published a book about Amazon, Google and other tech giants.How that infatuation developed is the story of a company that figured out how to tame Wall Street. In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along.Over its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway.\u201cI think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn\u2019t deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,\u201d said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon.In part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn\u2019t appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years.In a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company\u2019s ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them.\u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Long Term.\u2019\u2019Mr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.And its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year \u2014 hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see.Yet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.It may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true.\u201cIf Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,\u201d said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.)The reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street\u2019s old rules, which demand consistent profit growth.It wasn\u2019t always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys.But like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon\u2019s shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival.Mr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days. But it took many years for investors who had been burned by the dot-com crash to give Amazon a second chance.For long stretches from 2002 to 2006, Amazon\u2019s stock price languished, while it invested in researching and developing new technologies and businesses.Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets, looked at the company\u2019s slipping profit margins during that period and warned investors to stay away.Mr. Mahaney said he failed to realize \u201cthat all that spending on R.&D. was a bullish sign for the future.\u201d He has had a buy rating on the company for more than a decade.Those long-term investments, which Amazon didn\u2019t detail at the time, eventually gave rise to some of the company\u2019s most profitable businesses, like its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services.The success of the cloud computing business proved a tipping point. If investors allowed Amazon to spend time and money investing, patience would pay off.By now, Wall Street has been well trained to believe that Amazon has a strategy for Whole Foods and it will take time to carry it out.\u201cWhat the market finally figured out is Amazon is extremely good at investing those dollars,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the investment officer at Miller Value Partners.Ultimately, much of the investor confidence in Amazon reflects a belief in its future opportunity \u2014 what investors frequently call a company\u2019s \u201caddressable market.\u201dFor Amazon, the addressable market in retail is roughly $5 trillion in the United States and many times that globally, Mr. Miller said. And that\u2019s not even including the traditional information technology market that Amazon Web Services is attacking. \u201cI asked Jeff what the addressable market is for A.W.S.,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018Trillions and trillions.\u2019\u201dEven Mr. Gillespie, the skeptic, acknowledges that Amazon is \u201coperating extremely well.\u201d But he questions whether years of low interest rates have helped inflate Amazon\u2019s value because investors are so starved for return, they are willing to overlook some of the risks.Those risks, he said, include regulators deciding the company is growing too large or not paying its fair share in taxes.\u201cPeople tend to assume away these things,\u201d he said.Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Worried About Inflation. Should It Be?", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs the economy at risk of overheating? The answer will depend on what really drives price increases, and what the Fed does.To the degree the recent wild swings in the stock market are rooted in economic fundamentals, these are the fundamentals to fear: that the already strong economy may overheat, inflation may spike, and the Federal Reserve may then raise interest rates more aggressively to try to combat that higher inflation.The kernel of evidence that supported those fears was a report Friday that average hourly earnings for American workers rose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ended in January, the highest since the economic expansion began nine years ago.It\u2019s only a single data point, and an erratic one at that. But when paired with a rock-bottom unemployment rate and some signs of acceleration in economic growth, it suggests that overheating/inflation is a meaningful risk for the United States economy in 2018 in a way it hasn\u2019t been for a decade.What does it all mean and how real is the risk? To answer the question, it helps to start with some basics.Inflation is when the buying power of a currency falls over time. When inflation is 2 percent, a basket of products that cost $100 today would cost $102 a year from now.But people buy lots of different things, some prices are always rising and others falling, and the exact mix of items I buy is different from the mix of items you buy.That\u2019s why government statisticians and mainstream economists focus on indexes created to try to capture the full range of goods and services people consume, weighted by how much an average household spends on each.It\u2019s both. High inflation can be disastrous. In Venezuela right now, in Zimbabwe a few years ago, in Weimar Germany in the early 1920s, inflation was so extraordinarily high that the currency essentially ceased to be a useful medium of exchange, leading to a barter economy and breakdown of the country\u2019s financial system.But when inflation turns negative \u2014 that would be deflation, meaning the purchasing power of a currency rises over time \u2014 it can also be disastrous. Debts become more onerous over time, and consumers and businesses have incentive to hoard cash rather than spend or invest it.That\u2019s what the United States and other countries experienced during the Great Depression, and it has been experienced in milder forms by Japan over much of the last 20 years and Europe since 2010.It might seem inherently bad to have the purchasing power of a falling dollar. But having a bit of inflation seems to grease the wheels of the economy while not distorting economic decisions too much. It helps cushion against deflation, and gives the Fed room to cut interest rates and stimulate the economy during a downturn, helping keep the economy on an even footing.Over the last couple of decades, central bankers around the world have mostly settled on 2 percent per year as the optimal level of inflation that they aim for. It\u2019s a level low enough that the purchasing power of their currencies is fairly stable and people don\u2019t have to worry about inflation all that much in doing business with one another, while also keeping a buffer to prevent deflationary effects from taking hold.The important thing is arguably less the exact level of inflation and more that it is fairly stable over time. It is big swings that tend to be most disruptive, favoring either debtors (inflation) or creditors (deflation), and generally contributing to lack of faith in a country\u2019s financial system.For now, though, 2 percent is the goal.Under the inflation measure that the Federal Reserve most focuses on, prices rose only 1.5 percent in 2017, below the target. That\u2019s based on the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy (the logic being that commodity prices can swing wildly for reasons unrelated to underlying inflation trends).That\u2019s not far from the 2 percent target. But the numbers have been undershooting that target continuously since 2012. That undershooting has been a key rationale for the Fed\u2019s keeping interest rates low \u2014 its aim is to boost economic growth and thus help get inflation up to the 2 percent target.The answer is more uncertain than you might think. A central component of the models that mainstream economists have used for decades is that the inflation rate is shaped by the amount of \u201cslack\u201d or unused capacity in the economy, especially unemployment.The intuition goes like this: When the unemployment rate is high, there are lots of workers available for any employer that wants to hire them. So employers don\u2019t need to compete for workers by paying higher wages. But if the unemployment rate is low, companies have to pay more to get employees, driving up wages. Higher wages in turn mean more money coursing through the economy chasing finite goods and services, creating inflation.That basic relationship between unemployment and inflation is known as the Phillips Curve. It did a pretty good job explaining inflation trends from the 1950s to the 1980s, and still forms the underpinnings of how many policymakers think about where inflation comes from: that inflation is essentially evidence that the economy is running too hot, producing goods or services at a level that is not sustainable.It is a little like revving a car. Once a car is already at top speed, if you push the accelerator harder, you won\u2019t go any faster, but you may overheat the engine. Inflation, in this model of how the world works, is the evidence of overheating.That\u2019s not at all clear.For one thing, the Phillips Curve relationship hasn\u2019t been working quite right in the last decade. The unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in late 2009 to 4.1 percent today, and yet wages have been rising at a modest rate, between about 2 and 2.5 percent, throughout that time (at least until the January 2.9 percent gain).Even as wage gains start to emerge, the relationship between higher wages and overall inflation isn\u2019t ironclad, either. For example, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure dipped through the first eight months of 2017 despite a low unemployment rate and steady wage gains.You can imagine a lot of factors that affect inflation that are unrelated to the domestic labor market. Perhaps in a modern, globalized world, when there is a shortage of American workers, companies are better able to outsource service work and import manufactured goods, rather than bid up wages.If low unemployment spurs new investment in productivity-enhancing machinery, wages could rise without broader inflation breaking out, because higher worker pay would result in higher output, not just more money chasing the same goods.Or maybe employers have so much power in the labor market now that they can keep wages depressed despite low unemployment, rather than get in bidding wars with one another.The traditional overheating story might be right. But the recent evidence is hardly definitive.The unemployment rate is already low, and the new tax cut may push economic growth even higher. Wall Street knows that if Fed officials think inflation is poised to exceed its 2 percent target, they will raise interest rates to try to stop that from happening.If the Fed \u2014 under new leadership, as Jerome Powell became chairman this week \u2014 believes it can let the economy roar ahead without inflationary pressure, it will probably continue its recent practice of low interest rates and gradual rate increases, which in turn is good news for stocks.But if the overheating/Phillips Curve narrative is coming true, the Fed will have to raise interest rates to try to cool the economy, which would make capital more costly for businesses and dampen consumer spending. That\u2019s all bad news for stocks.What happened Friday was that a wage number was published that was consistent with the overheating/Phillips Curve story of how the economy works, which is a big reason markets sold off.For the last decade, the Fed has been more focused on trying to get inflation higher rather than lower, so in some sense the possibility of finally breaking out of that low-inflation, low-growth, low-interest-rate pattern would be welcome.Right now, prices in the bond market suggest that the Fed is in a sweet spot \u2014 that inflation will indeed hover around 2 percent in the years to come. As recently as August, inflation-protected bond prices implied that prices would rise only 1.6 percent a year over the next five years; that is up to 2 percent now.But there are risks on both sides of that forecast.One month\u2019s wage number doesn\u2019t definitively mean that the first step of the overheating story is happening \u2014 low unemployment translating into higher pay for workers. And it definitely doesn\u2019t mean that the second step is happening \u2014 higher wages translating into higher overall price inflation.Seeing how things evolve in 2018 and beyond will be fascinating not just for watchers of the stock market and the Federal Reserve, but also for all those who would like to see a bigger paycheck, or who dread what higher inflation might do to their savings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Immigrants Are Pushed Out, Who Will Care for the Elderly?", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by The New Old AgeIn Dallas, a 93-year-old is worried about the woman who, for years, has come to her house four days a week to help with shopping, laundry, housecleaning and driving. \u201cShe\u2019s just a wonderful person, someone I feel I can trust completely,\u201d said the older woman.But because her helper is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, both women increasingly fear that she\u2019ll be detained and deported. (I\u2019m withholding their names for that reason.)\u201cIf this woman gets pulled over today, who will help my mother tomorrow?\u201d said her daughter, an attorney in Oakland, Calif.In Brooklyn, Mary DiGangi, the human resources director at the Menorah Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing Care, recently asked local employment agencies to find 20 to 25 new nursing assistants and practical nurses.It\u2019s a typical request, and usually, she said, \u201cI\u2019m flooded with applications the next day.\u201d This time, she saw only five applications over a month.She thinks the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies and rhetoric have discouraged potential workers. Menorah, part of MJHS Health System, draws heavily on immigrants for its 3,500 employees.\u201cEmployees have told me they know it\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d Ms. DiGangi said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re convincing me or themselves.\u201dIn the so-called gray market, where consumers hire home care workers directly and often pay them under the table, the proportion is likely far higher.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a growing work force shortage in direct care,\u201d said Robert Espinoza, vice president of policy for P.H.I. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting the entire industry, and it\u2019s affecting older and disabled people and their families.\u201dThe shortage stems partly from a growing economy, said Robyn Stone, a veteran researcher at Leading Age, whose nonprofit members include long-term care providers.When employers are hiring, she explained, \u201cthese folks are likely to look down the street at a hospital that pays more, or another industry like fast food, and leave.\u201dBut the population of working-age women, who typically provide care both paid and unpaid, has shrunk \u2014 and they have more career options than they once did.So providing care for older people, in their homes or in facilities, has become the classic example of a job native-born Americans would rather not take.Their advocates have long argued for ways to improve these jobs, with more training and higher pay. For now, though, what P.H.I. calls the \u201ccaregiving gap\u201d has been filled by immigrants.The number of immigrants in direct care ballooned from 520,000 in 2005 to approximately one million in 2015, including those who work independently through state home care programs, P.H.I. estimates. In New York, California, New Jersey and Florida, more than 40 percent of direct-care workers are immigrants.If large numbers of immigrants become unable to work or fearful of attracting unwanted attention, \u201cthis is going to create tremendous strain,\u201d Dr. Stone said. Already, \u201cwe\u2019ve heard of nursing homes that have shut down, or stopped admissions, because they could not hire enough people.\u201dExcluding the gray market, the majority of aides and nursing assistants are American citizens. But P.H.I. has calculated that nearly 35,000 come from Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras, whose immigrants have had temporary protected status in the United States.The administration has so far terminated T.P.S. status for Haitians, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans; other nationalities may follow. Immigrants from Sudan, whose T.P.S. status was also terminated, will have to leave the United States as early as this fall.Another nearly 11,000 direct care workers come from largely Muslim countries affected by the Trump travel ban and might leave if family members can never join them. An unknown number of workers are DACA recipients who might eventually be forced to leave.Even when workers are legal residents, though, they may consider moving when relatives are deported. Whole neighborhoods and communities feel targeted.\u201cJust the scrutiny is casting a pall,\u201d Dr. Stone said. \u201cIf they\u2019re afraid, if they won\u2019t apply for jobs, we could see more shortages.\u201dAs that happens, the effects ripple through nursing facilities and home care agencies. \u201cWhen we struggle to fill positions, the people already working here are working harder,\u201d Ms. DiGangi pointed out. They may take more shifts, or become responsible for more patients.Eventually, especially in rural areas where home care workers have to travel long distances to clients, older adults (and younger ones with disabilities) may not be able to hire people who can help them remain in their homes. In cities and suburbs, older immigrants who want assistance from those who speak their native language could be similarly at a loss.In the San Fernando Valley in Southern California, a home care worker named Norma, who fled El Salvador with her family almost 20 years ago, assists her 91-year-old disabled neighbor under a state program. She works every day from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., helping her client bathe, dress, eat, and circle the block in a wheelchair.While she worries for herself and her husband \u2014 and her two daughters, who are DACA recipients \u2014 she also fears for her client.\u201cIf one day I don\u2019t show up to work, nobody will be there to get her out of bed and change her,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be my own mom, who would be alone one day if nobody came to help.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lower Oil Prices Force Saudis to Widen Their Circle of Friends", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe changing nature of the energy industry \u2014 the oil production boom in American shale fields, the persistence of lower crude prices, and the rise of natural gas \u2014 has transformed the geopolitical equation.While Saudi Arabia is still a major energy producer, it must compensate for its lost revenue. And the United States, China and Russia are all circling in hopes of gaining a financial advantage.Russia, smarting from Western sanctions and lower oil prices, is moving to embrace Saudi Arabia for energy deals despite their rivalry in Syria, where the two countries support competing sides. China, with its domestic oil production in steep decline, seeks a stable flow not just of Saudi oil but of Saudi investment in its growing petrochemical and refinery industries.And Washington is willing to overlook those flirtations in the hope that Saudi Arabia will continue to be a strategic bulwark against Iran.The desires of all three superpowers fit neatly into Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategy to find new investment partners as part of a broader push to diversify its oil-dependent economy, trim large budget deficits and secure the future of both the kingdom\u2019s welfare state and its monarchy.For Mr. Putin, it was an audacious embrace of an American ally as he moved to expand his nation\u2019s energy riches despite the current sanctions. For Mr. al-Falih, it was a chance to discuss future gas sales, attract investment in Saudi Aramco and coordinate efforts to prop up global oil prices.\u201cIf we continue to work the way we do, we will turn from rivals to partners,\u201d Mr. Putin told Mr. al-Falih at the public ceremony. The Saudi official readily agreed.The ultimate success of the Saudi Aramco public offering and the entirety of the kingdom\u2019s economic reform remain in question, and progress so far has been mixed. Nevertheless, American, Chinese and even Russian financiers are entwined in a complex dance around the initial public offering, which is promised for later this year.President Trump has publicly called for the I.P.O. to be listed in New York. A Saudi listing now appears more likely, with additional trading in London or Hong Kong. Global financiers say they want a piece of the action wherever it occurs.The interest in the I.P.O. has given the kingdom greater leverage at a time when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, through which it has long wielded power, has lost much of its clout.\u201cThe Saudis are compensating for their lost power in OPEC and they are showing pure geopolitical pragmatism in their new energy and foreign policy,\u201d said Bill Richardson, a former energy secretary and ambassador to the United Nations. \u201cBut they are not just compensating for lost power. They are adding to their power in world politics.\u201dSaudi Arabia has had a central role in global energy since at least World War II. When the kingdom created a global glut of oil to gain market share in the mid-1980s, it sent prices into a tailspin that contributed to the bankruptcy of the Soviet Union at the same time that it was financing Afghan rebels fighting the Soviets.The kingdom was such a crucial supplier of oil to the United States that Washington went to war in the early 1990s in part to protect it from a possible Iraqi invasion. And when China needed new energy supplies for its expanding economy in the early years of the new century, Saudi Arabia was there with an ambitious oil exploration program to meet the new demand.But OPEC can no longer control oil prices alone. A flood of oil from American shale fields has enabled the United States to slash imports of OPEC oil and begin exporting to markets that were once dominated by Saudi crude.The Saudis, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are seeking to link cuts in OPEC production over the past two years with cuts by Russia, another oil-exporting powerhouse, to buoy prices. Over the longer term, the Saudis want to import natural gas to replace domestic consumption of oil for electricity, freeing more crude for export.At the same time, the country is expanding its investments in refineries and petrochemical plants around Asia and the United States to guarantee markets for its crude while making additional sales of higher-value gasoline, diesel and other refined products.\u201cLow oil prices have made the Saudi way of life unsustainable, so they have to find alternatives,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former Middle East analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency and the author of \u201cKings and Presidents: Saudi Arabia and the United States Since F.D.R.\u201d \u201cAny partner they can find that can help them do that, they are going to embrace enthusiastically.\u201dThe most surprising partner is Russia, which remains on the opposite side of the Syrian civil war and is also trying to build better relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitter regional rival.In the fall of 2016, the crown prince\u2019s father, King Salman, made the first official trip to Russia by a reigning Saudi monarch. Multiple cooperation agreements including military sales were reached, as well as a commitment by Russia\u2019s largest petrochemicals company, Sibut, to build a plant in Saudi Arabia.Relationships between the Chinese and Saudi oil companies had already grown close in recent years. Aramco bought a 25 percent stake in a refinery in Fujian Province operated by the state-owned oil giant Sinopec, and the companies have joint refinery ventures in Saudi Arabia. China and Saudi Arabia also signed a preliminary agreement last summer to create a $20 billion investment fund for infrastructure, energy and mining projects.\u201cWe might as well work with them,\u201d said Sadad Ibrahim al-Husseini, a former Saudi Aramco executive vice president. \u201cThey desperately need energy, and we have a heck of a lot of energy, so the pieces fit.\u201dSuch deals also promote Saudi Aramco\u2019s efforts to become a global refining powerhouse. That can only increase the value of the proposed initial public offering of the company, which already produces more crude than any other in the world.Many international banks, including JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, have been seeking to advise the kingdom and have a role in the eventual deal.\u201cEvery global investment bank should be interested in a lead role given the quality of the company and the fact that it would be the largest I.P.O. in history,\u201d said Osmar Abib, global head of oil and gas at Credit Suisse Securities.The kingdom has valued the company at $2 trillion, a number that investment bankers say would be realistic only if oil were worth $100 a barrel, nearly $40 more than the current price.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for them to persuade anybody to buy a hunk of Aramco until they figure out how to be more transparent about the royals\u2019 take and the actual value of the company,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, who was the State Department\u2019s top energy official early in the Barack Obama administration.Saudi oil executives say the issues of valuation and governance will be worked out in the end because the crown prince and his father view the public offering as central to remaking the economy with more foreign investment.\u201cThere is no backtracking,\u201d Mr. al-Husseini said. \u201cThe I.P.O. commitment is driven by a central leadership, by people who are empowered to make decisions. It\u2019s not a winding narrow road that comes to no conclusion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unexpected Opposition Imperils Federal Reserve Nominee", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is struggling to muster the necessary Senate votes to put the conservative economist Marvin Goodfriend onto the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors.Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said Thursday that he would vote against Mr. Goodfriend, who has also yet to attract any support from Democratic senators.In the narrowly divided Senate, that could be enough to sink Mr. Goodfriend\u2019s confirmation.The unexpected opposition is a setback for the Trump administration, which has struggled to pick qualified candidates for the Fed\u2019s board. The central bank, which sets monetary policy and plays a leading role in financial regulation, now has just three governors on its seven-seat board, the fewest in the Fed\u2019s modern history.\u201cThree is really thin,\u201d said Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, a research firm for investors.Mr. Katz noted that the Fed under its new chairman, Jerome H. Powell, was conducting a wide-ranging review of regulations, part of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to give greater leeway to financial institutions. It also must wrestle with the implications of recent financial market volatility.\u201cFed governors have even more on their plates and minds than just a week ago,\u201d he said.He said Mr. Goodfriend, who repeatedly criticized the Fed\u2019s post-crisis economic stimulus campaign, had a record of \u201cprioritizing hypothetical inflation over real people losing jobs.\u201dSenator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who has often voted for the Trump administration\u2019s nominees, said he opposed Mr. Goodfriend because of his comments at the hearing that there was no need for the federal government to guarantee 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans.Mr. Tester said Mr. Goodfriend was \u201cunqualified for a leadership role at the Fed.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound very exciting to me,\u201d Mr. Paul, a libertarian, said Thursday.Mr. Goodfriend has since abandoned the specific proposal, but in his academic writings he has continued to advocate other forms of \u201cnegative interest rates\u201d \u2014 policies that make it expensive to hold money when the government wants to encourage spending.Republicans have a 51-vote Senate majority, and Vice President Mike Pence is available to break ties. If Mr. Paul remains opposed, Mr. Goodfriend\u2019s chances could rest on Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is in his home state undergoing treatment for cancer.The White House said in a statement that it continued to support Mr. Goodfriend.\u201cThe president stands behind his nomination of Marvin Goodfriend, who is incredibly qualified for the Federal Reserve board of governors,\u201d it said. \u201cWe hope the Senate confirms Mr. Goodfriend swiftly given the importance of the Federal Reserve to the American economy.\u201dThe Senate Banking Committee approved Mr. Goodfriend\u2019s nomination in a 13-to-12 party-line vote on Thursday. Republicans have not yet scheduled a final vote by the full Senate.Mr. Trump has not announced nominees for the other three board seats. The White House has focused on its search for a vice chairman, a job that has been vacant since October. Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Fed governor who was considered a leading candidate, said this week in a note to clients of his economic advisory firm that he was withdrawing from consideration. Mr. Lindsey\u2019s decision was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.Others who have been considered, according to a person familiar with the search process, include Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist and a managing director at the investment firm Pimco; Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the financial conglomerate Allianz; and John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rewrite Iran Deal? Europeans Offer a Different Solution: A New Chapter", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s threat to rip up the Iran nuclear deal has touched off an urgent scramble in European capitals to preserve the agreement \u2014 not by rewriting it, but by creating a successor deal intended to halt Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and make permanent the restrictions on its ability to produce nuclear fuel.The Iranians have so far dismissed efforts by the State Department to impose strict new terms on Tehran \u2014 or face threats of renewed sanctions if it fails to comply \u2014 as a backdoor effort to reopen the original agreement that limits Iran\u2019s nuclear program.The European demand comes under duress. Talking points that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson recently circulated to American diplomats in Europe warned that \u201cin the absence of a clear commitment from your side to address these issues, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal.\u201dThe instructions, which were shown to The New York Times, stipulate that the Europeans agree to three key fixes: a commitment to renegotiate limits on missile testing by Iran; an assurance that inspectors have unfettered access to Iranian military bases; and an extension of the deal\u2019s expiration dates to prevent Iran from resuming the production of nuclear fuel long after the current restrictions expire in 2030.European diplomats said there was scope for an agreement on missiles and inspections, but not yet on the length of the deal. They argue that rewriting those terms would break the bargain they struck, not only with Iran but also with Russia and China, two other signatories. And breaching the deal, they say, would free Iran to pursue nuclear weapons again.The upcoming talks are being led by Brian H. Hook, a low-key Republican lawyer who is the State Department\u2019s director of policy planning, who has said he would bring the European request for a guarantee back to Washington. European diplomats said they worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn for the deal runs so deep that he would find other reasons to pull out. Last month, he warned that the accord \u201cis under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me as president at any time.\u201dEven if Mr. Trump did pledge to abide by the deal, it is far from clear that a successor deal would be endorsed by Russia or China, let alone the Iranians, who signaled in recent weeks that they are planning a new project \u2014 a fleet of nuclear-powered ships, fueled by Iranian-made reactors \u2014 that they say would justify resuming the production of nuclear fuel as the limits imposed by the deal expire over the next dozen years.Still, the mere fact that the United States and Europe are trying to work out a compromise attests to the desire, on both sides, to find a solution that would satisfy Mr. Trump while not unraveling the deal.The president\u2019s national security team \u2014 Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 has on three occasions talked him out of ripping up the deal. With each deadline to reimpose sanctions on Iran, that task gets harder.There is an element of diplomatic legerdemain to the exercise, European diplomats acknowledge: How do you convince Mr. Trump that you have changed the deal without actually changing it?\u201cThe supplemental deal is a diplomatic device that is being used to allow the Europeans to declare victory,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, a leading critic of the Iran deal who is nevertheless open to the idea.\u201cThey can say they were able to keep the deal, remain steadfast to their commitment not to renegotiate it, but also to satisfy the U.S. and their own concerns that the length of the deal was too short,\u201d said Mr. Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.By law, Mr. Trump must decide every 120 days whether to continue suspending longstanding American economic sanctions against Tehran, which the United States committed to lift as part of the deal. If he were to reimpose them, as he has threatened, that would effectively scuttle the deal.Iran complains that Mr. Trump\u2019s threats have already kept European banks from investing in major projects in Iran, denying it the benefits that were promised for giving up its enrichment program.\u201cIf the same policy of confusion and uncertainties over the future of the deal continue,\u201d Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, who was a member of the negotiating team, said last week, \u201cif companies and banks are not working with Iran, we cannot remain in a deal that has no benefit for us.\u201dThe International Atomic Energy Agency said last week that it had received formal notice from Tehran about a \u201cdecision that has been taken to construct naval nuclear propulsion in future.\u201dThe Europeans are most comfortable with enforcing new limits on Iran\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile development and testing. Missiles are not covered by the nuclear accord, but rather by a United Nations resolution, whose wording was negotiated by then-Secretary of State John Kerry just as the nuclear accord was coming together in Vienna in July 2015.The State Department\u2019s talking points said the United States viewed the nuclear and missile programs as \u201cinseparable,\u201d and said that \u201cIran\u2019s development and testing of missiles should be subject to severe sanctions.\u201d The Europeans have not gone that far, at least yet.Inspections are potentially more problematic, given the administration\u2019s rejection of arguments by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that all military-related sites are off limits to international inspectors.But this has not been an issue yet: The inspections have been limited to declared nuclear sites, and the United Nations nuclear agency affirmed last week that it had been given all the access it sought. Inspectors have said they would try to inspect military sites only if they had intelligence suggesting that surreptitious nuclear activity was underway.Once a deal is struck with the Europeans, administration officials intend to seek approval from Russia, China and Iran. But concerns that such a deal could not possibly pass muster with Iran will not deter them, a senior official said. Russia and China\u2019s lack of participation would also matter little, given the stark consequences for Iran\u2019s economy if Europe and the United States reimpose sanctions, this person said.While American and European negotiators are working feverishly on a deal to preserve the 2015 accord, there are also preliminary discussions about what will happen if they fall short.Reimposing sanctions, such as blacklisting the Central Bank of Iran, would cause serious problems for European companies, potentially precipitating a split in the trans-Atlantic alliance. But the president, Mr. Dubowitz noted, has the authority to phase in sanctions, which he could use as leverage to give negotiators more time to work out an agreement.He could, for example, impose sanctions on the central bank for its support of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is accused of supporting terrorism, but waive the imposition of so-called secondary sanctions on foreign companies that do business with the bank until the next deadline in July.For the Europeans, who are mostly satisfied with the deal and face no domestic political pressure to pull out, there is little joy in this exercise. But they feel they have no choice but to go along with it. One diplomat compared it to humoring an angry relative who controlled a family vacation estate, and periodically threatened to burn it down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arizona Republicans Inject Schools of Conservative Thought Into State Universities", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySmall classes, deep engagement with professors, and a focus on the Classics \u2014 they could be scenes from an elite and expensive liberal arts college. Instead, these classes are taking place at one of America\u2019s largest public universities, Arizona State, courtesy of a pet project generously funded by the state\u2019s conservative leaders.Around the country, Republican legislatures have been taking a greater interest in the affairs of their state universities to counteract what they see as excessive liberalism on campus, from quarrels over conservative speakers to national anthem protests to the very substance of what students are taught.Their creation reflects a cultural struggle within academia, one that some conservatives believe requires government intervention to counter a liberal professoriate. Their goal is to promote the study of Western civilization, once a core requirement at many colleges, contending that a well-educated society must understand its roots \u2014 the Delphic maxim \u201cknow thyself.\u201d\u201cThere is too much revisionism being taught in universities today,\u201d said State Representative Jay Lawrence, a Republican from Scottsdale who backed the new programs. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal to those of us who feel very strongly about a more conservative education.\u201dBut many liberal arts professors view these efforts as reviving an antiquated and Eurocentric version of history, one that they have tried to balance with viewpoints of women and racial minorities.The initial debate over funding the Arizona State program broke along party lines, reflecting the increasing polarization around higher education nationwide.\u201cI think part of the problem is a perception or reality that we got a bunch of libs indoctrinating your children, and there\u2019s not a lot of balance,\u201d said Margaret Spellings, the president of the University of North Carolina system, which has asked to send a delegation to observe the Arizona State program.Lawmakers are also reacting to protests that have roiled college campuses in recent years.Louisiana State University said its president, F. King Alexander, received a phone call from someone in the Legislature threatening to withhold funding if football players \u201ctook a knee\u201d during the national anthem. \u201cThat\u2019s the type of intrusion that we deal with politically even on something that\u2019s the issue of the week, or the issue of the month,\u201d Dr. Alexander said.Private donors, including the Charles Koch Foundation and the Jack Miller Center, have been funding conservative campus programs around the country for years, and the programs at both Arizona universities are absorbing earlier Koch-funded initiatives at each school.Officials of the school, which currently operates in the university\u2019s Social Sciences building, said they expected enrollment to increase once its major was fully approved by the Board of Regents, permitting the school to grant degrees.The new program has not been well received by some professors elsewhere at Arizona State, who view it as duplicating existing classes and too heavily focused on white male thinkers from the United States and Europe.\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be interested in looking at diverse political theorists in this country, Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. DuBois, Ida B. Wells, Native scholars or Asian-American scholars,\u201d said Karen Kuo, a professor of Asian Pacific American Studies.With the school cognizant of concerns that it focuses only on \u201cdead white men,\u201d its director, Paul Carrese, has sought to diversify the curriculum, adding women and minority thinkers to the readings. Last month, the school sponsored an unveiling of two more rare books, inscribed editions of works by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u201cThe program is not pursing a party line or dogma,\u201d said Dr. Carrese, who was recruited from the Air Force Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s making space for debate.\u201dA look at two economics courses \u2014 one in the new school and another offered by the university\u2019s School of Social Transformation \u2014 provides an example of the contrasting approaches.In the new school, Peter McNamara, who has published on the free-market economist F.A. Hayek, teaches \u201cClassics of Modern Economic Thought,\u201d a survey of 20th-century economists. Four of the 30 sessions are devoted to inequality and moral issues, according to the syllabus.The other class, \u201cGlobalization and Socioeconomic Justice,\u201d covers some of the same thinkers but focuses on why \u201cinequality and poverty exist,\u201d with discussions that include colonialism and imperialism, \u201cenduring economic injustice\u201d and environmental issues associated with capitalism.\u201cI teach the students to actually look at what\u2019s happening around the world when these economic theories are applied in practice,\u201d said LaDawn Haglund, who teaches the globalization course.Among students in the new program is Justin Heywood, a sophomore from Phoenix who took a course titled \u201cGreat Debates in American Politics and Economics\u201d last fall. This semester, he is enrolled in \u201cFederalists and Anti-Federalists.\u201dMr. Heywood, 20, who wrote in House Speaker Paul D. Ryan for president, said that he was drawn to the program by its deep exploration of topics, and that he believed the new school was attracting a political mix of students.Some, he acknowledged, were enticed by the chance for the free India trip. \u201cI know a lot of students who signed up just for that,\u201d he said.Michael Crow, the university\u2019s president, has embraced the program. \u201cThey were interested in having a broader set of curricular offerings than the one we presently have, particularly as it related to economic thought or political theory, philosophy,\u201d Dr. Crow said.\u201cThe fact that someone from the state came along and gave us money for it, O.K., good,\u201d he said. Yet, he complained, the Legislature has not fulfilled his request to pay half the cost of the university\u2019s in-state students. \u201cThe fact that they weren\u2019t giving us money for other things, bad.\u201dMr. Bradley, the Democratic lawmaker, said there was some mystery surrounding the origin of the funding request for the schools. \u201cThe governor\u2019s budget appears at 11 o\u2019clock at night and we vote two hours later,\u201d he said.A spokesman for Gov. Doug Ducey said that he did not think the request was generated by their office. But in the governor\u2019s most recent State of the State speech, on Jan. 8, he said he was pleased with the efforts to promote a range of viewpoints at state schools.\u201cHere in Arizona, on our campuses, debate is encouraged, free speech is protected, and diversity of thought isn\u2019t just a platitude,\u201d Mr. Ducey said. \u201cIt\u2019s alive and well in lecture halls, on debate stages and in the pages of college newspapers.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly named a college that has experienced student protests.

{"Headline": "California Today: The Beverly Hills Affordable Housing Loophole", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, who reports on economics from the Bay Area.What was surprising, even shocking, was the city that topped the very short list of places that are meeting their goal of affordable new residences: Beverly Hills. How could that be? Are Beverly Hills\u2019s residents feeling guilty about income inequality and mass building low-income housing as a result?Perhaps not surprisingly, Beverly Hills\u2019s apparently stellar record at building housing for poor people has more to do with politics and funny math than a sudden building boom.The progress report released last week is based on a series of housing goals that are decided by a regional body of governments. Over the eight-year period covered by the goals, Beverly Hills was required to build a total of three housing units: One very-low income housing unit, one low-income housing unit, and one moderately priced housing unit. In fairness, the wealthy Los Angeles County city far exceeded its numbers, at least on a percentage basis, by issuing permits for a total of nine low- and moderate-income housing units.The city was not required to build any high-income housing units, since it already has a lot of them. Nevertheless, it blew its goal of zero out of the water, and issued 75 new permits for high-income housing.Scott Wiener, the San Francisco senator who wrote the streamlining bill on which the recent report was based, said in an interview that numbers like those reported by Beverly Hills are why he is working on a new bill that would try to neutralize the role of politics in housing production by tying future state housing goals to economic measures like job growth. It would also carry forward past housing deficits so that cities that don\u2019t build will lose further control over local housing decisions as time goes on.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd and we see this around the state where communities that are whiter and more affluent are able to push down their numbers and essentially opt out of new housing,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Coming up this week:In 1875, a visitor to Yosemite recorded his predicament in a guest registry. \u201cCan\u2019t get out of Yosemite on account of a sick horse,\u201d he wrote, adding ruefully: \u201cYosemite Valley is a lovely place in which to be incarcerated.\u201dThat\u2019s a quaint picture of a park that has exploded in popularity in recent years. The park received more than 5 million visitors in 2016.And although February is usually one of the slowest months, the spectacular sunsets that occur during the last two weeks of the month at Horsetail Fall have become a major draw.

{"Headline": "In Loss to Real Madrid, P.S.G. Fails on the Big Stage It Covets", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMADRID \u2014 No matter how hard Paris Saint-Germain pushes, no matter many superstars it acquires, no matter how many hundreds of millions of dollars it spends, that glass ceiling simply will not break.Yet again, at the moment it was supposed to make its giant leap, the world\u2019s richest club froze. P.S.G.\u2019s list of Champions League disappointments already included Barcelona (2015 and 2017), Manchester (2016) and London (2014). Now, add Madrid (2018).Off the field, P.S.G.\u2019s financial might, its naked ambition, is capable of making the game\u2019s traditional elite shudder and tremble. On the field, under the brightest of lights, it can only stumble and fall.This was, of course, only the first leg of P.S.G.\u2019s tie with Real Madrid in the Champions League\u2019s round of 16. There are 90 minutes, at least, left in which to rectify things. Losing by 3-1 on Wednesday still offers a glimmer of hope; that single goal on the road could yet prove crucial. P.S.G. is not out, not yet.But there was an unavoidable sense in those dying minutes, as Cristiano Ronaldo bundled Madrid ahead and Marcelo stretched its lead, that it was all happening again: Against the very best, P.S.G. was being exposed as a mere pretender.It was impossible, as soon as this tie was confirmed, not to see it as a battle between the establishment and the insurgent.The club does not indulge Neymar \u2014 throwing him a lavish, two-day birthday party earlier this month and giving him a variety of \u201cprivileges,\u201d in Rabiot\u2019s words again, that others do not enjoy \u2014 to perform party tricks in Ligue 1. It does so because it sees him as the sort of player who can deliver in these moments, on the biggest stages, against the most illustrious opponents.For his part, Neymar\u2019s decision to leave Catalonia centered on his desire to establish himself as the best player in the world, the standard-bearer for the generation behind Lionel Messi and Ronaldo. He could not be heralded as the finest player on the planet, ran the logic, if he was not the finest player on his team. If, from the outside, it looked almost like a step down, there was a sense that the ambitions of player and team meshed rather neatly. Both, after all, had their eyes on usurping the established order.For Neymar, then, as much as P.S.G., this was a night to shine, and not just because Real has convinced itself that the Brazilian yearns to make Madrid his permanent home. This was his chance to demonstrate that his move to Paris had been more than folly, that change was coming.He did not do it. Neymar did not decide this game: Ronaldo, the man he would depose, did. It should not be a source of great controversy to suggest that Ronaldo, at 33, is now beyond his wondrous peak, no longer the force of nature he once was. He has had to metamorphose into something different to remain pre-eminent. Where once Ronaldo\u2019s embroidery \u2014 his dazzling array of tricks, his jet heels \u2014 set him apart, now it is his economy, his ruthlessness.Twice, when the pressure was greatest, Ronaldo delivered. Not prettily, necessarily \u2014 he converted a penalty kick to draw Real level, after Rabiot had given P.S.G. the lead, and then scuttled the ball home fortuitously to put his team ahead \u2014 but decisively.It was a model of efficiency, an object lesson of what big players do in big moments.Neymar was the opposite: endless slaloming dribbles, drifting effortlessly past defenders with sure touches and elegant movement \u2014 all culminating in cul-de-sacs. It was an inherently cinematic performance. He played as you imagine a superstar should, as opposed to how a superstar does.He will have a chance, in Paris next month, to make amends. Unai Emery, his coach, saw enough here to believe his team can score the two goals it needs to progress to the quarterfinals (though it may well require more). The score line, he said, \u201cdoes not reflect what we saw on the pitch.\u201dP.S.G. has heard that line before. It has felt this sensation before. It is the mantra of a team that gets so far and then can go no further: We are so close, we will get there in the end. The ceiling, though, never seems to shift. It always there, just beyond reach, unyielding, unforgiving.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ruud Lubbers, Former Dutch Prime Minister, Is Dead at 78", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRuud Lubbers, the youngest and longest-serving prime minister of the Netherlands, who helped lay the groundwork for the European Union and revive the Dutch economy, died on Wednesday in Rotterdam. He was 78.His death was announced by the Dutch government. No cause was given, but he had been ailing for several years.After serving as prime minister from 1982, when he was only 43, until 1994, Mr. Lubbers (pronounced LEW-burs) lost bids for his two dream positions: secretary general of NATO and director general of the European Commission.In 2001, he was named the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. He held that job for four years until he was forced to resign in a sexual harassment scandal.As the Christian Democratic parliamentary leader and prime minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Lubbers was a political centrist and a pragmatic compromiser, forming coalition governments with the right and left.Declaring that \u201cHolland is sick,\u201d he pruned spending and persuaded civil service unions to trade wage and benefit demands for a shorter workweek. His policies helped reduce unemployment and a budget deficit.In 1984, Mr. Lubbers deftly sidestepped a confrontation with the United States over the installation of nuclear-armed cruise missiles in the Netherlands.The issue had become moot by 1988, because the Soviet Union and the Reagan administration had agreed to scrap intermediate and shorter range missiles.\u201cRuud Lubbers got the Netherlands back on fiscal track,\u201d Hubert Smeets, a prominent Dutch historian and journalist, said in an email, \u201cwithout destroying the traditions of Christian and Social Democratic solidarity as well as the liberal achievements of the \u201960s.\u201dRudolphus Franciscus Marie Lubbers (Ruud was a diminutive of his first name) was born on May 7, 1939, in Rotterdam, the sixth of nine children of the former Wilhelmine van Laack and Paulus Lubbers.After attending a Jesuit boarding school, he graduated from the Netherlands School of Economics (now Erasmus University Rotterdam) in 1962 with a degree in economics.That year, he married Maria Hoogeweegen, an economist. She survives him, along with their daughter, Heleen, and two sons, Paul and Bart.Mr. Lubbers had aspired to an academic career, but those plans were derailed with the death of his father, who managed the family\u2019s engineering firm, in 1965. He and his brother became co-directors of the company.He enlisted in the Catholic People\u2019s Party, which later joined with other parties to form the Christian Democratic Appeal. He was recruited as minister of economic affairs in 1973.As prime minister he formed three successive governments, pursuing a \u201cmore markets, less government\u201d agenda through what the Dutch call the polder model of consensus, named after cooperative efforts to reclaim the country\u2019s low-lying land from the sea.That model extended to negotiations with the leaders of other European nations on European integration and a single currency \u2014 talks that led to the agreement to form the European Union, signed in 1992 in the Dutch city of Maastricht.In a statement, the current prime minister, Mark Rutte, said of Mr. Lubbers, \u201cWith his broad knowledge and experience and his tireless creativity, he knew how to find a solution for every problem.\u201dIn 1994, Mr. Lubbers failed in his bid to become president of the European Commission. A year later, he was the top European prospect to become the civilian leader of NATO, but he withdrew his candidacy when the United States, said to be unhappy that it had not been properly consulted, expressed doubts about his qualifications.He was named to the United Nations post in 2001. He served in Geneva without pay and was generally well regarded until a female employee charged that he had touched her inappropriately during a meeting.While viewed as a peacemaker, Mr. Lubbers also developed a reputation as a hands-on crime-fighter.In the 1980s, he twice thwarted thieves who were trying to steal his family\u2019s cars. In 1987, someone threw a firebomb through the window of his home. Mr. Lubbers threw it back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Trade Investigation Takes Aim at Trump\u2019s Voter Base", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China has opened an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into sorghum imports from the United States, the latest salvo in an escalating trade dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies.In espousing his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, President Trump has pledged to protect manufacturers in the United States. He has labeled the challenges posed by the Chinese economy as a threat to United States national security and opened separate trade investigations related to Chinese steel and aluminum imports and into whether Chinese stole intellectual property.In its statement, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry did not link its investigation to the decision on solar panels and washing machines. The ministry said it obtained \u201cpreliminary evidence and information\u201d that showed that imported sorghum from the United States had received subsidies from the United States government. The agency found that domestic producers in China had suffered as a result.\u201cIt\u2019s already a partial trade war,\u201d said Li Qiang, chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Company, an agriculture consultancy. \u201cIn our opinion, this is related to the deterioration in the Sino-U.S. relationship.\u201dThe ministry\u2019s initiation of the investigation \u201csuggests that the government had it teed up and it\u2019s not a response or demand from the industry for protection,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cIt\u2019s the government taking action, which is what you would expect if they are trying to send a message to retaliate,\u201d Mr. Bown said.Sorghum is a type of grain that is mostly used in China to feed livestock. It is also used to make baijiu, a clear liquor with a pungent aroma that sells well among the rich in China and is often served at banquets. More than three-quarters of the sorghum the United States exports goes to China, according to the U.S. Grains Council, a grain export industry group.The United States exported about 4.8 million tons of sorghum, worth about $1 billion, to China in 2017, accounting for nearly all of China\u2019s imports of the grain last year, according to Chinese customs data.Mr. Bown said that some farmers would suffer but that the broader United States economy would not be substantially harmed if tariffs were to be imposed only on the sorghum industry. The worry is that, as trade frictions escalate, tariffs could spread to more economically important sectors, such as soybeans, he said.Soybean exporters are a powerful political constituency for Mr. Trump. China imported $14 billion worth of soybeans from the United States in 2016, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture.China, which in recent years has been increasingly assertive about protecting its economic interests, has not been afraid to use tariffs as a tool against the United States. In 2010, it said it would impose tariffs on American poultry after its own anti-dumping investigation. China opened the investigation in 2009, less than two days after former President Barack Obama imposed steep tariffs on Chinese tires.Despite Sunday\u2019s announcement, Mr. Li, of Shanghai JC Intelligence Company, said that he believes the Chinese government \u201cis still exercising restraint.\u201d\u201cChina still believes there\u2019s room for negotiation,\u201d he said, \u201cand hopes that the United States will return to the negotiating table.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Is Getting Paid to Save the Music Industry: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify files to go public.\u2022 Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles.\u2022 The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one?\u2022 What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?\u2022 The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope.\u2022 And is Jared Kushner\u2019s weakness his family business?Perhaps more than any other streaming service, Spotify has revived the fortunes of recording artists. It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday.The numbers are included in Spotify\u2019s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing\u2019s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, \u201cconsists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.\u201dThe filing says Spotify had \u20ac3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was \u20ac2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. \u201cThis decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,\u201d the filing said.But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that.\u2014 Peter EavisAccounting nerds delving into Spotify\u2019s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy.Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of \u20ac324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled \u20ac179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda?It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung \u20ac439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year.\u2014 Peter EavisDirect listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market.Spotify won\u2019t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days.Here\u2019s a look at the details:Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang.Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify\u2019s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public.In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby.Dick\u2019s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT:\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201dOver five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero.Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest.\u2022 Mr. Ackman\u2019s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet.How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high.Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIs it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no.BackgroundSnap\u2019s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock.The criticism has also overshadowed Snap\u2019s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent.BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock\u2019s annual report:As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as \u201ccommon ownership\u201d. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.The filing goes on to say:If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock\u2019s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years.What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy.To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes.Is it working? Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year.Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony.\u2014 Peter EavisSky is both a telecom operator \u2014 selling TV, internet and phone services \u2014 and a media company with its own original news, sports and entertainment programming.

Investors refocused on the continuing strength of the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated on Tuesday, and the S.&P. 500 ended the session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles.The decline in stock markets on Monday was steep, but not the worst one-day percentage drop in the S.&P. 500. In the history of the index, 38 one-day drops were worse.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk ever higher, as measures of volatility \u2014 the ups and downs of stock prices \u2014 hit remarkably calm levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop of lackluster growth and inflation, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But that peaceful climb ended in recent days. Investors have become worried that the solid economy in the United States could be showing early signals of inflationary pressure and that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than previously expected. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data \u2014 such as the Labor Department\u2019s jobs report on Friday \u2014 showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.But Tuesday\u2019s results put a brake to the slide, at least for now.The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said it was possible that algorithmic trading programs were partly responsible for recent volatility in the stock market. \u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role \u2014 as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said Tuesday, adding that market participants are acting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems.In a sign of investor confidence, yields on the 10-year Treasury note rose on Tuesday. Spooked investors had bought supersafe government bonds in recent days after being startled by the market sell-off, bringing yields lower.

{"Headline": "The C.E.O. Who Stood Up to President Trump: Ken Frazier Speaks Out", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of the pharmaceuticals company Merck, served on one of Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory councils in the early days of the administration.But after Mr. Trump equivocated in his response to an outburst of white nationalist violence last August in Charlottesville, Va., the advisory groups swiftly unraveled.In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Frazier elaborated for the first time on his motivation for taking a stance.\u201cIt was my view that to not take a stand on this would be viewed as a tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said,\u201d he said. \u201cI think words have consequences, and I think actions have consequences. I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience, I could not remain.\u201dThe events that led to Mr. Frazier\u2019s confrontation with the president unfolded over a tense summer weekend, as white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. Bloody fighting broke out as they clashed with counterdemonstrators, one of whom was killed when a self-described neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of people.\u201cI saw what was happening on that Friday night, and then I heard the horrible news about what had happened on Saturday with the young woman being killed, and others being run down by a person who was sympathetic to people who held views that I consider personally noxious,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cAnd then I heard the president\u2019s response.\u201dMr. Trump, speaking at a veterans\u2019 event at one of his golf clubs, condemned the violence but did not criticize the white nationalists chanting neo-Nazi slogans. He blamed \u201chatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.\u201dThe president\u2019s remarks drew widespread condemnation for appearing to equate the actions of the counterprotesters with those of neo-Nazis, and many Americans, including Mr. Frazier, found them deeply inadequate.\u201cIn that moment, the president\u2019s response was one that I felt was not in concordance with my views,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as a country.\u201dBefore announcing his decision to resign from the president\u2019s manufacturing council, Mr. Frazier consulted with the Merck board.\u201cI wanted to say that this was a statement I was making in terms of my own values, and the company\u2019s values, and there was unanimous support for that,\u201d he said. \u201cMy board supported that 100 percent.\u201dThen, on Monday morning, Merck posted a statement from Mr. Frazier on Twitter.\u201cI am resigning from the President\u2019s American Manufacturing Council,\u201d it read in part. \u201cOur country\u2019s strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs.\u201dThe president, not one to let a slight go, swiftly hit back on Twitter.\u201cNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President\u2019s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\u201d the president wrote.Mr. Frazier doesn\u2019t regret his initial decision to advise the president.\u201cI joined because I think Merck is an important company and has something to contribute to the discussion about how we could as a country become much more competitive in the global economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI joined because the president asked me to join, and I thought it was the right thing to do as the C.E.O. of a company like Merck.\u201dAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks after Charlottesville were not the first time that Mr. Frazier found himself at odds with the president.\u201cThere were things that happened earlier on in this administration that I didn\u2019t necessarily agree with, about immigration and climate change, but I didn\u2019t think that it was my role to actually speak out on those issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a process for deciding how we address those issues as a country. This is a democracy.\u201dBut he viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s unwillingness to condemn white nationalists as different.\u201cIn this case, we were not talking about politics,\u201d Mr. Frazier continued. \u201cWe were talking about the basic values of the country.\u201dMr. Frazier did not respond to the president\u2019s tweet, and has not spoken publicly about the episode until now.For a man who rose to the pinnacle of corporate America, Mr. Frazier came from a humble background. His grandfather was born into slavery in South Carolina, and his father was a janitor in Philadelphia. Yet Mr. Frazier\u2019s parents pushed him to believe he could achieve great things.\u201cThey believed that despite the history of this country as it related to African-Americans, that for my siblings and I, there would be tremendous opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have.\u201dMr. Frazier attended Pennsylvania State University. After earning a degree from Harvard Law School, he went to work at Drinker Biddle & Reath, a law firm in Philadelphia. While there, he began representing Merck, and took on pro bono work.He spent several summers in South Africa teaching black law students. And he took on the case of James Willie Cochran, known as Bo, a black inmate on death row who had been convicted of killing a white store manager.After looking at the evidence, Mr. Frazier and his colleagues became convinced of Mr. Cochran\u2019s innocence. They eventually secured him a new trial, and he was acquitted in 1997.\u201cIt was by far the most important thing that I\u2019ve ever done in my life, full stop, professionally,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cThis is a man who was facing an execution date for a crime he did not commit.\u201dMr. Frazier joined Merck 1992 and rose through the ranks, overseeing the company\u2019s defense against lawsuits related to the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx and, as chief executive since 2011, making the development of drugs to treat cancer a priority.Early in his tenure as chief executive, Mr. Frazier resisted calls to cut research and development spending and focus on profitability. \u201cWe value R & D as a company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s who we are.\u201dMr. Frazier has little interest in dwelling on his feud with Mr. Trump, and would rather stay out of politics altogether. Yet when confronted last summer with a stance he considered unconscionable, Mr. Frazier said, he could not help but speak out.\u201cWhat happened that weekend I think was not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that really went to the core of who we say we are as Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The move sent markets tumbling.But over the past three-plus decades, investors have endured a number of bigger percentage drops in the stock market.Our perceptions are distorted, in part, by thinking about swings in terms of points rather than in terms of percentages. The problem with that thinking is that our idea of big point moves was most likely shaped when the Dow was much smaller \u2014 and a drop in several hundred points would have made up a greater share of the average than it does today.This recent decline so far has returned the market roughly to its level in mid-December, less than two months ago.

This Olympian Has Taken Up the Cause.", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWinter athletes like the cross-country skier Jessie Diggins are demanding action on climate change.Jessie Diggins fell in love with snow as a child. Diggins is a member of the United States women\u2019s cross-country skiing team, which is favored to win a medal at the Pyeongchang Olympics. It would be only the second medal in the sport for the United States and the first for the women\u2019s team.Before Diggins was an Olympic skier, before she had even taken her first steps, her parents strapped her into a baby carrier and took her cross-country skiing near her hometown, Afton, Minn. But she worries that future generations of American children might miss that opportunity.So, Diggins and other winter sport athletes are becoming advocates for climate action. I interviewed her just before her World Cup win last month to learn more about why she thinks winter is worth protecting. (The following has been edited and condensed.)Growing up, I didn\u2019t play video games. I didn\u2019t watch TV. I went and played in the snow. I built snow forts and snowmen, I went sledding with my friends, and I went cross-country skiing every single weekend with my family and my friends. I don\u2019t want my kids to grow up in a world where they\u2019ve never experienced snow because we weren\u2019t responsible enough.One reason I feel that I can say how much climate change is affecting us is because I\u2019ve seen it all over the world. This isn\u2019t just like, \u201cOh, winter in Minnesota has been hard for the last 10 years.\u201d This is like, nope, it\u2019s people I\u2019ve spoken to in Switzerland who are losing their jobs because winter\u2019s going away. And I\u2019ve seen it in France: They had to pull ice from the lake in order to make a ski course up in the mountains where they\u2019ve never had problems with snow.Because of climate change, by midcentury many prior Winter Games locations may be too warm to ever host the Olympics again.As a kid, it was never hard to find trails to ski on, and now over the last 10 years it has been so hard to be able to ski on real snow. Most venues over the last three years have been exclusively on man-made snow. The same World Cup courses that we race get more and more dangerous with man-made snow because it gets icy. One of my teammates broke his leg on a corner of a course where it never should have been as fast as it was. Real snow, it feels softer. It\u2019s not as hard when you fall, and having actual snow on the trees and on the ground outside of the racecourse is more beautiful.You know, when people try skiing for the first time they always call me up and go, \u201cThat is so fun.

There are trails that go up and around the mountains, and you\u2019re skiing down these switchbacks and you\u2019re skiing up them, and you get to see the world from a very different point of view. It\u2019s very special. I think that that\u2019s something that definitely shouldn\u2019t be lost.An earlier version of this article misidentified the Climate Impact Lab.

{"Headline": "No Fairy, No Cry", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans preached fiscal austerity when the economy needed stimulus, and have turned to fiscal profligacy now that it doesn\u2019t. If this surprises you, either you\u2019ve been completely oblivious to the reality of the modern GOP for the past decade, or you\u2019re a reflexive centrist \u2013 which is pretty much the same thing.But how bad a thing is this fiscal profligacy? It\u2019s not good \u2013 it means higher debt, which will in turn reduce the \u201cfiscal space\u201d for responding to the next crisis. It will also crowd out investment, hurting long-run growth. But I\u2019ve been seeing some people suggesting that rising deficits are going to hurt the economy in the short run, perhaps even cause a recession. Will they?Well, much as I\u2019d like to believe this proposition for political reasons, it doesn\u2019t make sense. The same analysis that told us that austerity was a bad thing in the depths of the slump says that deficit spending now won\u2019t be contractionary. The cases aren\u2019t symmetric \u2013 this deficit will do much less good than austerity did harm. But still, we should be consistent.Remember, the direct effect of fiscal policy is to change overall spending in the economy: a fiscal expansion means more spending, a fiscal contraction means less spending. When the economy is depressed, as it was for years after the financial crisis, the number of jobs is constrained by the overall level of spending. And because the Fed had limited influence \u2013 short-term interest rates, which the Fed controls, were already zero \u2013 fiscal contraction translated into major job loss.It didn\u2019t work out that way: austerity hurt economies every bit as much as Keynesians said it would.But if we didn\u2019t believe that the confidence fairy would come to rescue us then, we shouldn\u2019t believe that it will desert us now. What the GOP has done is hugely irresponsible, but don\u2019t expect that to have much effect on private-sector spending.But what about interest rates? Won\u2019t this ill-timed stimulus drive them up? Yes, a bit \u2013 but it\u2019s important to understand why.As I said, the Fed sets short-term interest rates; and longer-term interest rates are mostly driven by expectations about future short rates, that is, by expectations about future Fed policy.So why will the blowup in the deficit cause the Fed to raise rates? Precisely because it will tend to make the economy grow faster in the short run, raising the perceived risk of inflation, and the Fed will raise rates to head that risk off. You may think the Fed is over-worried on that front, but still, that\u2019s how it will work.And what that means is that you shouldn\u2019t worry about higher interest rates causing a recession \u2013 rates will be going up only to the extent that the Fed believes this fiscal blowout will cause economic expansion.Now, the Fed\u2019s role will limit the expansionary effects of the deficit. The Fed couldn\u2019t offset the effects of austerity policies in 2010-2013 by cutting rates, but it can and will offset the effects of unwarranted stimulus now by raising rates. But it will limit the magnitude of the expansionary effect, not turn it into contraction.OK, there\u2019s one slight wild card here: if there was a bubble in asset prices, the prospect of Fed rate hikes could be the pinprick that bursts the bubble. But we don\u2019t know that, and even if it turns out to be the story, the bubble would have burst eventually regardless.Bottom line: the G.O.P.\u2019s fiscal behavior has been hypocritical, irresponsible, and reprehensible. But it won\u2019t cause a recession.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can the German Left Save Itself?", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBERLIN \u2014 The German left is in disastrous shape.At worst, in the case of the Social Democrats, its support is eroding. At best, as in the case of the Greens and the Left Party, it is stagnating. Germany has no figures to excite left-wing voters as Bernie Sanders has done in the United States and Jeremy Corbyn has done in Britain. There is no growing anti-capitalist, anti-nationalist movement around which to anchor leftist policy.This is especially dangerous right now, as German politics are in turmoil. Five months ago, a general election delivered disappointing results for both major parties, and no majority. Today, there is still no government as coalition talks crawl on. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats are negotiating yet another \u201cgrand coalition\u201d government with the Social Democrats \u2014 a situation about which very few in Germany are enthusiastic.Ms. Merkel has always been more of a manager than a visionary. But her often opportunistic brand of politics has become less and less popular. Her party had its worst showing since 1949 in the last election. Voters have called time on centrism.Political malaise of this kind could be an opportunity for left-wing groups promising social and economic change. But it\u2019s not working that way. Instead, in this vacuum, the far-right party Alternative for Germany, widely known by its German initials as AfD, has managed to combine its fierce anti-immigrant stance with a new rhetorical and policy focus on social welfare \u2014 calling for higher wages, safer pensions and extended unemployment benefits. These are the kinds of issues that should be offered by the left, untainted by the AfD\u2019s putrid nationalism.But hashtags and grandiose promises aside, the Social Democrats offer no shift to the left, which is what they would need to regain some support. Instead, they are planning to be Ms. Merkel\u2019s junior partners, so they will not push for reforms to Germany\u2019s unfair health insurance system and they will back the government\u2019s taking a tougher stance against immigration. This coalition is expected to, among other plans, postpone climate goals, hire more police officers and strengthen the state surveillance system.The party\u2019s 464,000 members will now vote on whether it should participate in this coalition. But no matter what the base decides, the party has proved itself weak on ideas and indecisive in realpolitik. A reinvention is not in sight. The Social Democrats will continue to wither into irrelevance unless room is made for the ideas and leadership of leftists like the Jusos leader Mr. K\u00fchnert.The other two parties of the left, the Greens and the Left Party, appear equally devoid of optimism and direction. At the beginning of the year, Sahra Wagenknecht, the parliamentary leader of the Left, called for a \u201cleft movement\u201d in which her own party, the Social Democrats and the Greens came together. This sounds like a good idea, a way to unify Germany\u2019s fragmented progressives into a strong collective. Unfortunately, Ms. Wagenknecht is one of the impediments.In recent years, she has made remarks on immigration (\u201cNot all the impoverished and poor of the world can come to us\u201d) and on feminism (\u201cI get hit on, too, but I\u2019m able to set boundaries and don\u2019t have to weep on Twitter\u201d) that have alienated potential allies on the left. And a divisive leader is not the party\u2019s only problem. The Left Party has historic links to the East German regime, which continues to scare off voters. Some members of the Parliament, like Diether Dehm, are reported to have ties to anti-Semitic groups. The party\u2019s soft line on Russia has also drawn censure. The result is that the party is \u2014 despite its promising left-wing program \u2014 \u201cunw\u00e4hlbar\u201d (unelectable) for many leftists.The Greens, for their part, hardly present a better option. Last month, the party elected new leaders, choosing for the first time since its founding in the 1980s \u201crealos\u201d \u2014 a nickname for centrist \u201crealistic\u201d politicians. Meanwhile, the left-wing core of the Greens, known as \u201cfundis\u201d for their commitment to the party\u2019s fundamentals, continues to lose power. In the months after the election, the Greens entered into coalition talks with Ms. Merkel\u2019s party and the radically free-market Free Democratic Party. Those talks foundered, but that the Greens even contemplated the idea was seen as the end of an era. And this centrist drift hasn\u2019t even led to electoral success; in September\u2019s election, the party came in sixth place.The main task for the German parliamentary left now will be to offer an alternative for both disaffected young urbanites and the alienated working class. The Social Democrats, the Left Party and the Greens all have politicians in their ranks who stand for progressive change. But these figures can come into power only with increased pressure from the base.There is no need \u2014 or reasonable prospect \u2014 of a merging of these three parties. And yet they would be well advised to agree on three points: opposition to nationalism, to further deregulation of the economy and to the gutting of social services. With this groundwork, the first red-red-green coalition in German history could, eventually, move from a seeming impossibility into a realistic hope.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Behind a Key Anti-Labor Case, a Web of Conservative Donors", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the summer of 2016, government workers in Illinois received a mailing that offered them tips on how to leave their union. By paying a so-called fair-share fee instead of standard union dues, the mailing said, they would no longer be bound by union rules and could not be punished for refusing to strike.\u201cTo put it simply,\u201d the document concluded, \u201cbecoming a fair-share payer means you will have more freedom.\u201dThe mailing, sent by a group called the Illinois Policy Institute, may have seemed like disinterested advice. In fact, it was one prong of a broader campaign against public-sector unions, backed by some of the biggest donors on the right. It is an effort that will reach its apex on Monday, when the Supreme Court hears a case that could cripple public-sector unions by allowing the workers they represent to avoid paying fees.One of the institute\u2019s largest donors is a foundation bankrolled by Richard Uihlein, an Illinois industrialist who has spent millions backing Republican candidates in recent years, including Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois.Tax filings show that Mr. Uihlein has also been the chief financial backer in recent years of the Liberty Justice Center, which represents Mark Janus, the Illinois child support specialist who is the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case.And Mr. Uihlein has donated well over $1 million over the years to groups like the Federalist Society that work to orient the judiciary in a more conservative direction. They have helped produce a Supreme Court that most experts expect to rule in Mr. Janus\u2019s favor.The case illustrates the cohesiveness with which conservative philanthropists have taken on unions in recent decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to look at the Janus case and earlier litigation as isolated episodes,\u201d said Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a Columbia University political scientist who studies conservative groups. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a multipronged, multitiered strategy.\u201dIn doing so, these donors have not just brought labor to the brink of crisis but threatened the Democratic Party as well.Amid changes in the campaign finance landscape and the decline of private-sector unions, the party and its candidates have increasingly relied on major public unions for funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect spending during the 2016 presidential cycle. Those unions include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, whose Council 31 is the defendant in the Janus case.And that is clearly on the mind of Republicans. In a recent interview, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, acknowledged the potential of the Janus case to hurt Democratic fund-raising for the coming midterm elections. \u201cIn states where they got rid of the automatic deduction and employees figured they could keep their own money, they did,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it could have an impact.\u201dConservative groups aren\u2019t alone in locking arms to advance an ideological agenda. For decades, liberal donors and foundations, sometimes working together through coalitions like the Democracy Alliance, have promoted liberal goals in a variety of ways. Some backed groups, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, that used litigation to move American society leftward.But the extent of the coordination on the right often dwarfs liberal efforts. Especially on the state level, conservative groups are \u201cdoing different things, mobilizing different constituencies,\u201d Mr. Hertel-Fernandez said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all working with one another. You don\u2019t see the same thing on the left.\u201dAs the percentage of unionized private-sector workers has collapsed in recent decades, public-sector unions, which have held steady in the mid-30s since the early 1980s, have increasingly become a target.Conservatives chafe at the unions\u2019 political influence, which they believe not only props up the Democratic Party but also drives up government spending and skews public policy on issues like education.In seeking to produce similar results nationally, conservative donors have created a symbiosis between groups aiming to overturn Supreme Court precedent favorable to unions and groups that take advantage of those rulings to drain unions of members.The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation of Wisconsin, which had over $800 million in assets in 2016, has funded both kinds of organizations.Then in 2016, the court heard a case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, that could have struck down fair-share fee requirements for all public employees represented by unions in more than 20 states, including California, Illinois and New York. The case was brought by a group that has received millions of dollars from the Bradley Foundation.Richard Graber, the chief executive of the Bradley Foundation, said the foundation avoided short-term tactical considerations in its giving. But he acknowledged that the increase was driven partly by the recent Supreme Court developments, which promised to make such opt-out campaigns more compelling for union members. (Some conservative groups are currently raising money for even more ambitious opt-out campaigns to take advantage of a favorable ruling this year.)In February 2016, the month after the Supreme Court heard the Friedrichs case, Justice Antonin Scalia died, depriving conservatives of a decisive fifth vote to strike down mandatory union fees. That gave the Liberty Justice Center, backed by Mr. Uihlein, a chance to try again.Few philanthropists have funded a more sweeping assault on labor than Mr. Uihlein, who with his wife, Elizabeth, founded a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company called Uline.Mr. Uihlein is an ardent conservative who considers many Republican office holders too moderate on fiscal and social issues, according to those who know him.\u201cIt\u2019s not just politics for him,\u201d said his friend Leonard A. Leo, the Federalist Society executive vice president, who declined to offer specifics on Mr. Uihlein\u2019s views. \u201cI think he is philosophically attuned to conservative ideas,\u201d added Mr. Leo, whom the Trump White House enlisted to shepherd the Supreme Court nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch, Justice Scalia\u2019s successor.The Uihleins have spent tens of millions of dollars over the past decade supporting Republican candidates and committees. That includes contributions to super PACs backing the 2016 presidential campaigns of Mr. Walker and Mr. Cruz, and at least $250,000 to help Mr. Walker survive a 2012 recall election. (Mr. Uihlein did not respond to a request for comment.)Mr. Rauner has been a major ally in the fight against public-sector unions. Shortly after taking office in 2015, he challenged the constitutionality of mandatory union fees in federal court.By the time a judge ruled that Mr. Rauner lacked standing for his lawsuit, the Illinois Policy Institute, which drew more than one-third of its $5.8 million in revenue that year from Mr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation, had found a viable plaintiff to replace him: Mark Janus. The Liberty Justice Center and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which Mr. Uihlein also contributes to, represented Mr. Janus in court.Since then, the policy institute has sought to persuade state employees to leave their union through its mailing campaign. It said it had obtained employees\u2019 names through Freedom of Information Act requests.At the center of this network is a longtime conservative activist named John Tillman, who serves as the chief executive of the Illinois Policy Institute as well as the chairman of the Liberty Justice Center and Think Freely Media.In an interview, Mr. Tillman, who managed a call center earlier in his career and talked up his \u201cmarketing-centric approach\u201d to promoting free enterprise, said the institute is fighting the enormous power of union leaders but is not anti-union per se.\u201cIn the late 1800s, early 20th century, business owners had all the power, and workers had very little power,\u201d he said. \u201cUnions and collective bargaining emerged as a way to level the playing field. I think it was an amazing story of success.\u201dBut in other contexts, Mr. Tillman has been less conciliatory.In a fund-raising solicitation by the policy institute in December, Mr. Tillman claimed credit for helping more than 2,600 workers leave their union, resulting in a loss of $1.2 million in union revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Illinois to throw off the shackles of big labor and big government,\u201d he wrote.\u201cWhen you and I look around Illinois and see the devastation the union-dominated status quo has inflicted,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe simply have no choice.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting.

Foreign ambassadors seek him out, even though he holds no public office. He claims to be but a simple member of a political movement, volunteering free technical assistance, but critics say he and his small Milan company control the votes, the candidates and the policies of the country\u2019s leading party.As Italy faces critical national elections on Sunday, the media-shy internet entrepreneur, Davide Casaleggio, is the Wizard of Oz-like figure behind the tightly drawn curtain of the country\u2019s front-running Five Star Movement as it approaches real political power.Since its birth less than a decade ago, the party has confounded Europe\u2019s establishment and promoted itself as an internet-based insurgent party that could change Italy\u2019s politics. It has gained support, especially among young voters, by presenting itself as a truly transparent, egalitarian political movement that votes on its candidates \u2014 as well as positions \u2014 on the web.Yet on the way to becoming a forum for unfiltered democracy, Five Star has grown into Italy\u2019s most opaque political party, and Mr. Casaleggio its most enigmatic leader in an era when the web is a mire of hacking, fake news and hidden interests.Mr. Casaleggio, 42, may then be Italy\u2019s most powerful IT guy. Party dissidents and critics say that the uncharismatic Milanese management consultant, who is far from a household name even within Italy, is the bland Big Brother of an Orwellian party that could shake up all of Europe.Five Star\u2019s bylaws require it to use the web platform Mr. Casaleggio helped found and which shares a Milan address with his Milan-based company, Casaleggio Associates.Party dissidents say that it is Mr. Casaleggio who, from behind the scenes, expels nonconformists and enforces a strict party line.Mr. Casaleggio declined repeated requests for an interview, explaining that he did not trust the news media.His company has hosted, and earned advertising revenue from, websites littered with conspiracy theories and fake news, messages echoed across a vast network of supportive social media accounts.One of the co-founders of the Five Star Movement was Gianroberto Casaleggio, a visionary internet entrepreneur and Mr. Casaleggio\u2019s father. It was supposed to be an answer to Italy\u2019s corrupt back-room deals and the ossified hierarchies of its traditional political parties.The party eventually adopted the web platform called Rousseau \u2014 after the 18th-century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau \u2014 promoting it as a tool of direct democracy in which all clicks were created equal.\u201cHe has the keys to everything, all of the infrastructure,\u201d said Jacopo Iacoboni, the author of \u201cThe Experiment,\u201d a critical exploration of the Five Star Movement. \u201cHe decides who runs and doesn\u2019t run. He is the boss.\u201dRank-and-file party activists say observers should not pay attention to the man behind the curtain. They contend that Mr. Casaleggio has no official role in the party and is only a management consultant.\u201cHe\u2019s a researcher and a technician,\u201d said Massimo Enrico Baroni, a member of Parliament. \u201cA poet and a visionary.\u201dCaterina Grimaldi, a city councilor from Voghera, said Mr. Casaleggio kindly housed Rousseau in his office space for convenience and to cut costs.\u201cHe has nothing to do with politics,\u201d she said, balking at the suggesting that he would ever abuse his position within the party. \u201cI trust these people.\u201dThe two politicians and other members of the party had just exited a private dinner on a recent rainy evening in Milan, where Mr. Casaleggio, unusually, held forth on his vision of web-based politics.\u201cThrough the web we can try and resolve problems that we have never been able to tackle,\u201d he proclaimed, wearing a stubble beard on his sharp chin and a checked blue suit.He seemed happy to get off the stage, though he gamely mixed with attendees and party members waiting their turn to talk to him late into the night.By the bar, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder greeting guests with Luigi Di Maio, a squeaky-clean 31-year-old who is the party\u2019s official political leader, public face and, after receiving 30,936 votes on Rousseau, a candidate for prime minister.Absent that evening was the party\u2019s founding standard-bearer, the gleefully vulgar comedian Beppe Grillo, who has in recent weeks appeared to distance himself from the party by removing his wildly popular, and powerful, blog from the servers of Casaleggio Associates.The break has prompted speculation about divisions within the party, with its \u201corthodox\u201d faction unhappy about Mr. Casaleggio\u2019s efforts to use Mr. Di Maio to transition from protest party to powerhouse. The movement has denied any internal tension.The bilingual Mr. Casaleggio, whose mother was a British translator, competed in chess tournaments as a child and focused on e-commerce at Bocconi University\u2019s business school in Milan.At Kangaroo.it, a start-up to help IT professionals with job searches, the young graduate managed operations and was quiet, honest and constantly saying \u201cokey-doke,\u201d said the company\u2019s founder, Franco Bondi. He now spends his free time scuba diving in cold lakes. The limelight is not for him.The party\u2019s dissidents agree that Mr. Casaleggio is at the controls.Giovanni Favia, an early officeholder with the party from Bologna, said his suspicion that Casaleggio Associates was manipulating votes helped prompt his expulsion in 2012. Since then, he said, things have only gotten stranger.\u201cCasaleggio has an association that controls the movement, but the movement is a client of his,\u201d he said, questioning whether the firm\u2019s political connections have earned it more lucrative advertising or clients.Lorenzo Andraghetti, another former party member, recalled that when he had a problem in the early days of the movement, Mr. Grillo told him to see Davide Casaleggio because he maintained connections with the local activists.Mr. Andraghetti said Mr. Casaleggio carried out his father\u2019s orders, including his own political demise in 2015. \u201cHe is the one who eliminated my nomination with a click,\u201d he said.Mr. Casaleggio is apparently not the only one with access to the party\u2019s voting platform. Hackers have repeatedly breached Rousseau, raising concerns from the independent Italian Data Protection Authority about the private data and voting records of members.One hacker claimed to have manipulated the vote for Mr. Di Maio and mocked Mr. Casaleggio by publishing his cellphone number and his password to the platform.But Mr. Casaleggio is looking toward a new Italian utopia.\u201cLet\u2019s not wait until the future knocks on our door,\u201d Mr. Casaleggio said from the stage in Milan, where attendees deposited in a closed box surveys saying what they hoped would be the priorities of Mr. Casaleggio\u2019s new association. \u201cLet\u2019s build it ourselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Era of Fiscal Austerity Is Over. Here\u2019s What Big Deficits Mean for the Economy.", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt depends on whether you look at the short, medium or long term.The last seven weeks amount to a sea change in United States economic policy. The era of fiscal austerity is over, and the era of big deficits is back. The trillion dollar question is how it will affect the economy.In the short run, expect some of the strongest economic growth the country has experienced in years, and some subtle but real benefits from a higher supply of Treasury bonds in a world that is thirsty for them.In the medium run, there is now more risk of surging inflation and higher interest rates \u2014 fears that were behind a steep stock market sell-off in the last two weeks.In the long run, the United States risks two grave problems. It may find itself with less flexibility to combat the next recession or unexpected crisis. And higher interest payments could prove a burden on the federal Treasury and on economic growth. This is particularly true given that the ballooning debt comes at a time when the economy is already strong and the costs of paying retirement benefits for baby boomers are starting to mount.It\u2019s hard to overstate how abrupt the shift has been.One major reason is the tax law that passed on Dec. 20, which is estimated to reduce federal revenue by about $1.5 trillion over the next decade, or $1 trillion when pro-growth economic effects modeled by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation are factored in. A budget deal passed in the early hours of Friday morning includes $300 billion in new spending over the next two years for all sorts of government programs and $90 billion in disaster relief, without corresponding cuts elsewhere in the budget.It is a stark reversal from 2010 to 2016, when congressional Republicans insisted upon spending cuts and the Obama administration insisted on raising taxes (or, more precisely, allowing some of the Bush administration\u2019s tax cuts to expire). Those steps, combined with an improving economy, cut the budget deficit from around 9 percent of G.D.P. in 2010 to 3 percent in 2016.In almost any economic model you choose, the new era of fiscal profligacy will create a near-term economic boost. For example, Evercore ISI, the research arm of the investment bank Evercore, estimates that the combination of tax cuts and spending increases will contribute an extra 0.7 to 0.8 percentage points to the growth rate in 2018, compared with the policy path the nation was on previously.Economists generally think that these policies will have a lower \u201cmultiplier\u201d than these policies would have if they took place during a recession, when there is more spare capacity in the economy. But that doesn\u2019t mean the multiplier becomes zero.\u201cSome people assume that because this was a bad process and the tax bill is really regressive that it won\u2019t have a short-term growth impact, but I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t confuse whatever distaste one has for the composition of the package for totally overwhelming the multiplier effects.\u201dThis has arguably been a factor in depressed interest rates and sluggish growth across much of the advanced world. More Treasury bonds floating around might reduce those pressures.Over the next two or three years, things get more murky. What happens will depend on how the economy responds to the additional fiscal stimulus, and how the Fed responds to that.If that happens, the Federal Reserve would almost certainly raise interest rates more than it now plans, essentially engineering an economic slowdown to try to keep inflation from accelerating. In that scenario, the apparent benefits of tax cuts and spending increases would be short-lived.But there\u2019s no certainty that will happen. It may be that the United States has more growth potential than standard models suggest. Perhaps corporate income tax cuts and looser regulation on business will unleash more capital investment and higher productivity, as conservatives argue. Maybe some of the millions of prime-age adults who have dropped out of the labor force in recent years will come back in, creating more economic potential.\u201cThe really big question mark we have is how much slack there really is in the economy,\u201d said Donald Marron, a scholar at the Urban Institute who was once acting director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cIf you look at conventional measures, unemployment looks really low, but on the other hand if you look back to what we used to think of the potential of the economy a few years ago, we may have some room to grow.\u201dThe public debt was already on track to rise relative to the size of the economy before the new tax and spending deals; now it will probably rise faster. The Congressional Budget Office projected last June that the nation\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio would rise to 91 percent in 2027, from 77 percent in 2017.But those numbers are just an abstraction. The question is what effects higher debt loads might have for Americans in 2027 and beyond.Higher debt service costs are one big one. Taxpayers in 2027 were forecast to pay $818 billion a year in interest costs even before the tax cuts and spending increases, or 2.4 percent of G.D.P. That will presumably be higher, because taxpayers will be paying interest costs on more debt, and probably at higher interest rates.And there is probably some point at which the amount of debt the government takes on crowds out private investment; to the degree that the supply of funds to borrow is finite, every dollar the government borrows is not available to be lent to a homeowner taking out a mortgage or a business looking to expand. That said, in practice, the supply of loanable funds is not finite \u2014 households may save more with higher interest rates, for example, and foreign capital might flow in.The bigger costs of a high national debt may come in how much flexibility policymakers have to respond to a future recession or crisis. If the United States finds itself in a major war or a deep recession, its starting point in terms of debt load will be much higher than it was at the onset of the Iraq War or the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cIt\u2019s about risk management,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWe may need that fiscal capacity for something else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Without Steve Wynn, Casino Empire Risks Losing More Than a Name", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the chief architect of modern Las Vegas, and a visionary who didn\u2019t understand the meaning of subdued, Steve Wynn spent more than three decades luring visitors to the Strip with his opulent hotels, fantasy-filled casinos, fine dining experiences and luxe shopping.But now, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is: What is the $18 billion Wynn Resorts casino and hotel empire without Steve Wynn?Hours after an unscheduled meeting of Wynn Resorts\u2019 board of directors on Tuesday, Mr. Wynn, a 76-year-old billionaire, suddenly resigned as the chairman and chief executive of a casino conglomerate that stretches from Las Vegas to Boston to Macau.With pressure mounting on his lucrative business operations, including a half-finished $2.4 billion casino resort near Boston, and with shareholder lawsuits and various investigations clouding his future, Mr. Wynn said he was stepping down because of \u201can avalanche of negative publicity.\u201dHe denied the allegations, calling them \u201cpreposterous.\u201d And in his statement Tuesday evening, Mr. Wynn did not admit to any wrongdoing.A Wynn Resorts spokesman said Mr. Wynn was not available for comment Wednesday.On Wednesday, shares in Wynn Resorts rebounded by jumping 8.6 percent, as Wall Street investors hoped that Mr. Wynn\u2019s surprise departure would stave off any significant licensing or regulatory fallout.But on Wednesday afternoon, members of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission said it would not halt its investigation of Mr. Wynn and his company, noting that he continued to hold stock and could exert influence over the company and its brand.The commission is determining the suitability of Mr. Wynn and his partners to hold the lone license awarded to build a casino in eastern Massachusetts. The luxury resort is on track to open in June 2019.\u201cA central question is, what did the board of directors and staff know, and when did they know it, about the settlement and the associated allegations?\u201d said Stephen Crosby, chairman of the commission. He was referring to a settlement reported by The Journal in which Mr. Wynn allegedly paid $7.5 million to a former manicurist.\u201cThat\u2019s a critical point for us and for the public of Massachusetts to know ASAP,\u201d Mr. Crosby added.While the various investigations continue, it is unclear how Wynn Resorts will proceed without its longtime leader.Matt Maddox, the company\u2019s president since 2013, was named Mr. Wynn\u2019s replacement. Mr. Maddox joined the company in 2002 after working in corporate finance for what is now Caesars Entertainment.Billy Vassiliadis, chief executive of R & R Partners, the firm that markets Las Vegas for the city\u2019s Convention and Visitors Authority, said Mr. Wynn was \u201can idea generator.\u201d\u201cNone of us in this world are irreplaceable,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Vassiliadis said. \u201cBut that kind of raw imagination is pretty rare.\u201dFrank Fahrenkopf, a former Republican National Committee chairman who founded the American Gaming Association and is a close friend of Mr. Wynn\u2019s, said he had not talked to Mr. Wynn about the decision. But he added that he could not imagine others forcing the mogul to step down.\u201cI know him well enough to know no one\u2019s going to come in and say, \u2018You built this company, but we think you should resign,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fahrenkopf said.\u201cThis thing wasn\u2019t getting any better,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were moving in Massachusetts. There\u2019s discussions about what could happen in Macau. He decided it was in the best interests of the company, the shareholders, to step down. This was a decision that Steve made on his own.\u201dWynn Resorts is not the first corporation or entity to confront the thorny predicament of a megastar leader\u2019s becoming embroiled in controversy.Before the celebrity businesswoman Martha Stewart went to prison in 2004 on charges of obstruction of justice, she stepped down as chief executive of her publicly traded company. But she continued to wield influence at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in a creative director role as she worked to improve her image by talking openly about her time in prison and the plight of the other inmates.Mr. Vassiliadis, whose firm is famous for the What Happens Here Stays Here campaign, believes the Wynn brand can succeed even without its namesake.\u201cThe product they have stands apart from the man, and the Wynn brand stands for luxury and service,\u201d he said.Given the nature of the allegations against Mr. Wynn and the growing power behind the #MeToo movement, the company could face a consumer backlash if his name remains a prominent part of it.If moral outrage builds, it may make sense for the company to simply move quickly and come up with another name for the properties, said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cIf they decide they are going to do it, then they should rip the Band-Aid off and just do it,\u201d she added.But removing Mr. Wynn from the Wynn empire is easier said than done.He is likely to maintain an awkward, physical presence at Wynn, given that he maintains a residence at the villas of the Wynn hotel. Many of Wynn Resorts\u2019 top executives were handpicked by Mr. Wynn and, many analysts suggested, remain loyal to him, raising the possibility that other leaders could depart.Mr. Wynn\u2019s shoes \u201cwill not be easy to fill,\u201d Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong, wrote in a note on Wednesday. \u201cWhile, theoretically, the old adage that everyone is replaceable may be generally true, the Wynn dynamic is much more complicated and uncertain. Steve Wynn is WYNN (the company).\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the chairman of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission. He is Stephen Crosby, not David.Reporting was contributed by Matthew Goldstein, Tiffany Hsu, Alexandra Stevenson, Katharine Q. Seelye, Kenneth Vogel and Steve Friess.Advertisement"}

Just one problem: The protest took place four years ago.They just don\u2019t seem to care that much.Every generation of campus activists embraces a worthy foreign-policy cause: Ending apartheid in South Africa; stopping ethnic cleansing in the Balkans; rescuing Darfur from starvation and genocide. And then there\u2019s the perennial \u2014 and perennially unworthy \u2014 cause of \u201cfreeing\u201d Palestine, for which there never is a shortage of credulous campus zealots.The case of Venezuela ought to be an especially worthy one for college students. It is urgent. It is close by. Its victims are fighting for democracy, for human rights, for the ability to feed their children.So why the relative silence? Part of the reason is that campus activism is a left-wing phenomenon, making it awkward to target left-wing villains.Even today, the criticism is amazingly muted. If Klein has seriously come to terms with Maduro\u2019s tyranny or Venezuela\u2019s catastrophe, she has not done it in The Nation, The Guardian, or anywhere indexed by LexisNexis or Factiva.

Penn and Glover seem to have moved on to other causes, like bashing Trump. Such courage.Still, it says something about the moral dereliction of too many liberals that Pence has been a clarion voice of attention and outrage at the unfolding catastrophe, while they mostly remain silent. When you\u2019ve ceded the moral high ground to the Trump administration, you\u2019ve ceded a piece of your soul.It would be nice to suppose that Venezuela\u2019s agonies will soon be at an end, on the theory that it can\u2019t go on like this much longer. People said that about Syria several years ago, too. How many more Venezuelans have to starve or drown before Western liberals do something more than merely shake their heads?Advertisement"}

Tim RobbinsThe actor, now 59, muses on Trump, Weinstein and the perhaps overenthusiastic flaying of Matt Damon.Supported bySo Tim Robbins and Donald Trump walk into a bar.Not together.They just happened to be in the same Greenwich Village club one night in the mid-1990s. But given the fact that fame is an irresistible magnet for Mr. Trump, the two men naturally ended up in a picture.\u201cI was throwing a private party for a friend, and he tried to crash it and I wouldn\u2019t let him,\u201d Mr. Robbins recalls. But Mr. Trump is not that easily put off, even when his quarry has disdain for him.\u201cWe were in a little roped-off section of the club that I had rented out and I was leaving to go to the bathroom and all of the sudden, there he is. And before I know it, I turn around and there\u2019s photo flashes, and it was weird. He wanted a photo with me because I was famous. He used to do that a lot, by the way. He wanted to be photographed with famous people all the time.\u201dIt is strange that this onetime cardboard-cutout celebrity popping up at Gotham parties has turned into a psychic dentist drill, boring into Americans\u2019 deepest, most painful schisms on race, gender and inequality.\u201cThink about this,\u201d Mr. Robbins says, over scallops, fries and espresso in the bar at the Crosby Street Hotel in SoHo. \u201cYou pursue celebrities your entire life when you\u2019re a real-estate developer, and then you become the most powerful person in the country and no one wants to be photographed with you. This is the time when most celebrities will go to your side, and no one is going to his.\u201dThe Washington traditions that you\u2019d think President Trump would have enjoyed, given his old party-surfing, glitterati-fawning ways \u2014 like the White House Correspondents Dinner and the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 he has shunned.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be in a situation where anyone has any kind of power over him,\u201d Mr. Robbins theorizes. \u201cAnd celebrities ultimately have the power to say, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want to be photographed with him.\u2019\u201d Like Tom Hanks saying he wouldn\u2019t go to the White House to screen \u201cThe Post,\u201d even if he were asked, or Tom Brady deflating President Trump and refusing to go to the Super Bowl ceremony at White House, no doubt because he feared the wrath of Gisele.\u201cHe\u2019s that guy at work that you used to ignore, you know?\u201d Mr. Robbins says of the president. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, God, he\u2019s at it again. Just leave him alone. Ignore him.\u2019 And then he\u2019s all upset he wasn\u2019t invited to the party. \u2018No, you\u2019re an ass. You don\u2019t get invited to the party. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u201dI muse that it must be uncomfortable to follow the first African-American president, known for his grace and exemplary family life, into the White House and then have to spend all your time denying that you\u2019re a racist or that you assaulted a string of women and paid off a porn star (whose interview with In Touch contained the startling revelation that the country\u2019s most famous germophobe didn\u2019t wear a condom.)\u201c\u2018Bob Roberts\u2019 came true,\u201d Mr. Robbins says, referring to the 1992 mockumentary he wrote and starred in.He prefigured the Trump phenomenon in the film, which is about a charismatic television entertainer and rich businessman who runs for office on the Republican ticket, sugarcoating his corrupt ways with an appeal to family values. He is hailed as a savior by his fans and as a crypto-fascist by his critics.When a young woman sends an admiring note to Bob Roberts, he writes back warning her to stay away from crack because \u201cIt\u2019s a ghetto drug.\u201dAs Vincent Canby said in his New York Times review, \u201cBob understands the appeal of an ultraconservative political and economic policy even to those who have nothing: anticipating the day when they do have it all, they want to make sure they will be able to keep it.\u201d Bob urges his followers to \u201ctake, make and win by any means\u201d and asks them: \u201cWhy has your American dream been relegated to the trash heap of history?\u201dWhen the movie was a big hit in Cannes, Miramax signed on as a co-distributor and Harvey Weinstein began hectoring Mr. Robbins to recut and re-edit the film.\u201cHe must have called me 20 times and I just told him, \u2018No, I\u2019m not doing it,\u201d\u2019 Mr. Robbins says. \u201cHe was so powerful because he had a company that was making movies that the studios weren\u2019t making.\u201dAside from his monstrous behavior with women, Mr. Weinstein ravaged Hollywood in other ways, Mr. Robbins posits, adding that, though the producer was hailed for his good taste, \u201cyou could make the argument that Harvey\u2019s overall impact on cinema was negative.\u201cWhat happened is, when Miramax became as successful as it became, every studio all of a sudden wanted to have an independent arm,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they all set up their little boutique companies that would do \u2018independent\u2019 films, quote unquote. And it wasn\u2019t that they were independent or edgy or that the content was risky or provocative. It was more that it was independent of paying people what the studios had to pay them. And so it became this way of making films on the cheap and not committing full studio resources into those kinds of films.\u201dWhen Mr. Weinstein asked Mr. Robbins to star in an indie called \u201cSmoke,\u201d shortly after the producer had sold Miramax to Disney for some $60 million in 1993, the actor remembers confronting him, saying: \u201c\u2018Harvey, the talent made your company and you\u2019ve been paying them scale for years. And you just put a fortune in your pocket. When are we going to see some of that?\u2019\u201dHe said that Mr. Weinstein called back an hour later to say that he would pay Mr. Robbins a million dollars to do the part but ordered him not to tell the other actors, who would still get scale.\u201c\u2018You don\u2019t get what I was saying,\u2019\u201d Mr. Robbins recalls telling him. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a shakedown for me to get money. This was about, What are you going to do overall for talented people now that you\u2019ve been monetized in this way?\u201dMr. Robbins deadpans: \u201cNeedless to say, I never worked for him again after that conversation. Also, he was personally transforming the Oscars into an advertising campaign that was about a relentless pursuit of gold.\u201dMr. Robbins, who loves old Hollywood, is rueful about the dearth of great movies: a decay in Hollywood standards that gave Mr. Weinstein power, and cover, for a long time.\u201cSince I won the Oscar for \u2018Mystic River\u2019 in 2004, I think I\u2019ve worked in one studio film as a lead actor, which was \u2018Catch a Fire\u2019 at Universal,\u201d Mr. Robbins says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know why that is. The way I look at it is, every movie I have done, I am proud of, other than one I did for money, \u2018Green Lantern.\u2019 Is it \u2018Green Lantern\u2019 or \u2018Green Arrow\u2019? I forget. I do have to pay the bills occasionally. But I\u2019m not broke. I have been wise with my money. I don\u2019t need to be an \u00fcber-rich person. I\u2019m happy where I am.\u201dHe agrees with the philosophy of the San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who explained recently why charitable contributions matter: \u201cBecause we\u2019re rich as hell, and we don\u2019t need it all, and other people need it.\u201d And you\u2019re a jerk if you don\u2019t give it.Asked about the tectonic shift for women in Hollywood, Mr. Robbins says he is happy that \u201cthe incredibly libidinous atmosphere in Hollywood is changing\u201d so that men will be more afraid \u201cto intimidate women into compliance in horrible, rapey ways.\u201d\u201cEverybody knew,\u201d he says in a disgusted whisper about Harvey Weinstein. \u201cEverybody knew.\u201dHe thinks there might actually be a fundamental shift, \u201cnot just on the man-woman thing but the male-male thing, too. That\u2019s been happening for a long time.\u201dHe knows this is a supercharged moment, given the opprobrium that has descended on stars such as Matt Damon, who said people should acknowledge \u201ca spectrum\u201d of bad behavior among men.\u201cIt\u2019s really, really important that women have the floor now to talk about this because it has been so pervasive throughout every industry as long as I\u2019ve been alive,\u201d Mr. Robbins says. But, he adds, \u201cI don\u2019t trust mobs of any kind, even when they\u2019re advocating for things I support. People losing their careers based on innuendo or accusation is troubling for me. There is a process for this: a legal system. Convicting someone on an accusation is really dangerous territory to be living in.\u201dHe worries about overreach. \u201cIs it possible for me to do a feminist film or a film about race and speak with any authority, or am I limited to telling stories about white men?\u201dMr. Robbins is passionate about politics but protests that he is not a radical.He does cop to driving in Santa Monica many years ago with his older son, Jack, when he was about 12, and when Mr. Robbins saw Henry Kissinger coming out of the posh Ivy at the Shore restaurant, he leaned out and yelled, \u201cWar criminal!\u201d\u201cAnd my son was like, \u2018What? What? Why are you doing that?\u2019\u201dHe does not regret speaking out against our misguided wars, even though, during the Iraq fiasco, he got denounced by conservatives as a \u201cterrorist supporter\u201d and a \u201cSaddam lover.\u201d\u201cMy children were young when 9/11 happened, and that was a traumatic experience,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they saw how a traumatic experience was turned into using manipulated information to produce another catastrophe, which was the war. So it\u2019s kind of a double trauma. And I don\u2019t think they trust the institutions of power and so they\u2019re looking to create their own. Many of our leaders are no longer on moral high ground. The millennials are living in a society where if you fail you succeed, from the bankers who almost brought down the economy and then got bonuses to Trump and his bankruptcies. It started with Nixon. The degradation of it all. Wouldn\u2019t we be living in a different country right now if Richard Nixon went to jail?\u201dHe laughs, noting wryly that \u201cthe millennial midlife crisis will be one for the ages.\u201dHe avidly supported Bernie Sanders in the primary before switching to Hillary Clinton in the general. (His ex Susan Sarandon, also an independent spirit, got heckled by Hillary supporters for refusing to support Mrs. Clinton; she said, \u201cI don\u2019t vote with my vagina,\u201d and then switched to Jill Stein after Mr. Sanders was out.)\u201cI think the Democratic Party is making a huge mistake right now, trying to caustically marginalize those people that voted for Bernie, because they\u2019re not going to be shamed,\u201d Mr. Robbins says.When he started his career, Mr. Robbins got offered a lot of roles as psycho killers. Then came \u201cThe Player.\u201d Now, at 59, he says that \u201cmost of the parts I get offered are middle-aged dudes having existential crises.\u201dHe\u2019s depicting another in Alan Ball\u2019s new HBO series, \u201cHere and Now,\u201d which has its premiere on Feb. 11. Mr. Robbins\u2019s character is a depressed philosophy professor named Greg Boatwright who plays Candy Crush and cheats on his wife, played by Holly Hunter, with a young hooker. In addition to their biological daughter, the couple, who met at Berkeley, has the \u201cgreat experiment\u201d of three adopted children (black, Asian and Hispanic), now grown.The show centers on the dynamics of having this pocket of progressivism in Portland, Ore., when white supremacy groups are lurking right outside of town. Mr. Robbins\u2019s gloomy character sees \u201cignorance, hatred, terror and rage\u201d winning, which makes his wife yearn to \u201csmack him in the face with a big, wet fish.\u201dMr. Robbins has also been working on a memoir about growing up in a one-bedroom railroad apartment with a dog, two cats, a rabbit and his folk singing family \u2014 his father, Gil, was a guitarist and songwriter with the Highwaymen \u2014 and meeting a lot of \u201ccrazy creative geniuses\u201d in Greenwich Village. (Mr. Robbins lived nearby in Chelsea during his long relationship with Ms. Sarandon.)\u201cMy dad\u2019s way of dealing with his depression was to build something, a harpsichord or cabinets or a loom,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have some of the things from his weaving period.\u201dMr. Robbins says he is \u201csuper-proud\u201d of his children. Ms. Sarandon\u2019s daughter with Franco Amurri, Eva \u2014 Mr. Robbins refers to Eva as his daughter \u2014 has two children and writes a parenting blog called \u201cHappily Eva After.\u201dMr. Robbins has been producing short films for his oldest son, Jack, who got into Sundance last year and this year. And his younger son, Miles, is going on tour with his band and has roles in the upcoming \u201cX Files\u201d and \u201cHalloween\u201d movies.Perhaps because he got used to wearing the garter belt of Ms. Sarandon\u2019s character in \u201cBull Durham,\u201d Mr. Robbins was not bothered by Miles\u2019s op-ed in HuffPost talking about how, even though he is \u201cmostly heterosexual\u201d \u2014 he has kissed a few men \u2014 he likes to wear dresses on stage sometimes or to parties.\u201cHe\u2019s a showman,\u201d said his father, adding that he himself wouldn\u2019t do it because \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have nice legs for that.\u201dHe is still very private about his two-decade romance with Ms. Sarandon, noting that accounts of stars\u2019 personal lives are inevitably \u201cartificial or manufactured because when you\u2019re promoting a movie, you\u2019re trying to tell people what they want to hear. And they\u2019re operating in stereotypes from the past \u2014 younger man, older woman, whatever it is \u2014 different perceptions that have nothing to do with reality.\u201dAfter dating for years, he says, \u201cI\u2019m with someone right now that I\u2019ve been with for a while. I like my life right now.\u201dHe lives in Venice, Calif., in a charming house, where he has fun art parties and writes poetry and music and plays and screenplays. (His latest, \u201cThe Heretic,\u201d is about a trio of Jesuses, one of whom gets waterboarded because his message of love is too radical for Christian consumption.)He is still busy with the Actors\u2019 Gang, which he founded in 1981. Through the Actors\u2019 Gang Prison Project, Mr. Robbins, who starred in \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\u201d has had some success over the last decade in renewing interest and funding for arts programs in California prisons, which he believes can help change the behavior of criminals and teach social skills. Former Attorney General Eric Holder was a strong supporter, given the soaring incarceration rates, and Mr. Robbins says his prison plays, mingling black gang members and white supremacists, should be a bipartisan project. He says he would meet with Jeff Sessions, if Mr. Sessions were willing. He\u2019s doing a documentary on the project.The latest production of the Actors\u2019 Gang, \u201cThe New Colossus,\u201d opens on Feb. 8, with 12 actors from 12 different parts of the world reminiscing about or playing their ancestors in their journeys from oppression to freedom.\u201cAll of our ancestors are related in a common desire,\u201d Mr. Robbins says. \u201cThe tribalism, dividing us by race, is not who we are. It\u2019s being manipulated for an economic cause. One night we had people from all over the world in our little hundred-seat theater and I was like, \u2018This is America right here in this room.\u2019 And it was so powerful. The division that\u2019s happening now is all an illusion.\u201dAn earlier version of this article appended an unnecessary correction.

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Squirms as Trump Veers Off Script With Abuse Remarks", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s approval ratings have been nudging upward and his party\u2019s political standing is improving, but the president\u2019s unceasing habit of making inflammatory and insensitive remarks is galvanizing opposition against him \u2014 especially from women \u2014 that could smother Republican momentum going into the midterm campaign.Saturday was a case in point. In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump appeared to raise doubts about the entire #MeToo movement, a day after he had offered sympathy for a former aide accused of spousal abuse.\u201cThis is coming, this is real,\u201d Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, said recently about the female-fueled wave of liberal energy.The frustration in the Republican political class is bursting forward.\u201cFor members or anybody else who cares about keeping control of Congress, if you find yourself talking about anything but the middle-class tax cut, shut up and stop talking,\u201d fumed Corry Bliss, who runs the primary House Republican \u201csuper PAC,\u201d the Congressional Leadership Fund. \u201cAny time spent on TV talking about anything but how we\u2019re helping the middle class is a waste of time and does nothing to help us win in 2018.\u201dRepublicans have grown accustomed to the president\u2019s lack of discipline and inability to reliably carry a message. But operatives overseeing the midterm effort and some lawmakers facing difficult re-elections are growing more alarmed that Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation on the Russia inquiry, personal slights and personality clashes inside and outside his White House are only encouraging his congressional and conservative news media allies to swerve off message.That is in part because of what mainstream Republicans describe as a destructive cycle of incentives: Mr. Trump reacts to Fox News segments about the Russia investigation or another controversy, encouraging more such coverage and prompting House conservatives from largely safe seats to make their own incendiary comments, which win them television invitations and attention from the president. Such notoriety might help those lawmakers in their deep red districts, but they do nothing for the party\u2019s overall political standing.\u201cThese guys are performing for the president when they go on TV,\u201d said Jason Roe, a longtime Republican strategist who is consulting on a series of at-risk House districts in California.Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, a first-term Republican who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most visible champions outside the White House staff, all but said as much.Mr. Gaetz, who used the State of the Union speech to snag a selfie with Mr. Trump in the House chamber, has said the president is \u201cabout as popular in my district as oxygen.\u201d He acknowledged that the tax bill was far more politically urgent than arguments about Russia and conceded that his on-air denunciations of Mr. Mueller served no electoral purpose. But for good measure, he said, he has been urging colleagues to warn voters in 2018 that Democrats could impeach Mr. Trump.He also boasted that he had found a particular audience for his cable news forays: Mr. Trump, he said, \u201ccalls me frequently and shares his thoughts on my television appearances.\u201dFar less visible are Republican lawmakers such as Representative Mimi Walters of California, who is facing a difficult campaign in an Orange County district where lobbing rhetorical bombs at the F.B.I. will do little with her centrist constituents but drawing attention to Disney\u2019s bonuses could bear fruit.\u201cWe talk about this all the time \u2014 we have got to get the message out on taxes,\u201d Ms. Walters said.Campaign veterans and Capitol Hill aides say part of the challenge, particularly in the House, is that many Republican lawmakers had until last year been in office only with a Democratic president and therefore are well practiced at oppositional politics but know little about trumpeting a positive message.Party officials have for weeks sought to drive home to lawmakers and Mr. Trump how crucial it is that they sell the tax law, bluntly warning that it will take an ambitious campaign to transform the measure into an unambiguous political winner. Strategists have written memos for public consumption and published op-eds emphasizing the need to go on offense. Senior lawmakers have used private meetings to implore the president and their colleagues to stay focused on taxes.At a gathering last month at Camp David, House Republican leaders invoked the example of Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump, who is often eager to act differently than his predecessor. The lawmakers told the president that Democrats suffered such deep losses in 2010 in part because Mr. Obama did not make a sufficient case for his economic stimulus measure, Republicans in attendance said.Last week at a congressional Republican retreat in West Virginia, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the head of the House campaign arm, opened and closed his presentation to lawmakers with \u201cthree takeaways,\u201d according to a Republican in attendance: \u201cBe ready, sell tax reform and run a campaign.\u201dRepresentative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, another member of the leadership, has even created a kit for lawmakers about how to stage district events to \u201ctell the story of the tax cuts and jobs,\u201d offering a \u201cGipper of the Week\u201d award to Republicans who do top-flight communications works (the award: a jar of jelly beans, a favorite of Ronald Reagan\u2019s).David Winston, a veteran Republican pollster, made a presentation at the retreat arguing that many voters remained highly flexible in their views of the tax law, giving Republicans a chance \u2014 but so far, only a chance \u2014 to close the sale. But in an interview, Mr. Winston, who advises Speaker Paul D. Ryan, warned that the party could not trust public opinion on the law to continue improving on its own.\u201cThere\u2019s a need to make people aware of what\u2019s in the legislation,\u201d Mr. Winston said. \u201cThere is a large portion of the electorate that is aware of it, but there\u2019s probably a larger portion of the electorate that\u2019s not.\u201dMr. Ryan has been uneasy about the attention devoted to the release of the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s memo about the F.B.I. Instead, the speaker has mapped out a series of visits to businesses affected by the tax law to showcase his preferred 2018 message by example.In a revealing sign of the party\u2019s anxiety about Mr. Trump, the Republican National Committee has taken to trumpeting the \u201cTrump tax cuts\u201d and has urged campaigns and other Republican committees to credit Mr. Trump explicitly and often with enacting the new law, but has faced skepticism from Republicans wary of introducing Mr. Trump\u2019s name into competitive elections.Mr. Trump himself underscored the risk involved in tying him, as a personality, to the Republican economic agenda during a visit to Ohio this week. His speech was intended to showcase the health of the economy, but he veered into an extended digression about his recent address to Congress and accused Democrats of \u201ctreason\u201d for refusing to clap at points. The economic message was lost.The conundrum, several strategists and lawmakers conceded, is that Mr. Trump\u2019s legal and culture wars are more politically galvanizing to the party\u2019s conservative base than Ryanesque sermons on the free enterprise system.\u201cThe G.O.P. base just doesn\u2019t eat that up the way it does trending memo hash tags and firing-Mueller conspiracies,\u201d Nick Everhart, a Republican strategist based in Ohio, said of the party\u2019s economic message. \u201cThus, it\u2019s no surprise members of Congress in super-red districts, immune to the perilous political environment we\u2019re headed toward, put themselves and feeding the base first.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fraudulence of the Fiscal Hawks", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere have been many \u201cnews analysis\u201d pieces asking why Republicans have changed their views on deficit spending. But let\u2019s be serious: Their views haven\u2019t changed at all. They never really cared about debt and deficits; it was a fraud all along. All that has changed is the fact that a Republican now sits in the White House.However, pretending to care about the deficit served several useful political purposes. It was a way to push for cuts in social programs. It was also a way to hobble Obama\u2019s presidency.And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to suggest that there was an element of deliberate economic sabotage. After all, Republicans weren\u2019t just vehemently opposed to fiscal stimulus; they were also vehemently opposed to monetary stimulus. Basically, they were against anything that might help the economy on President Obama\u2019s watch.Now Obama is gone, and suddenly deficits don\u2019t matter.But let me not just bash Republicans. Let me also bash their enablers \u2014 all those who were duped into believing their claims to be deficit hawks, or pretended to believe them in order to appear balanced and bipartisan. Such people did America a great disservice.And they will continue to do a great disservice if they obscure what\u2019s happening now. Please, let\u2019s not talk about the wrongheadedness of fiscal policy \u2014 about imposing austerity in a depressed economy, then running up the deficit when we\u2019re already near full employment \u2014 as a problem of \u201cpolitical dysfunction,\u201d or assert that both parties are to blame. Democrats didn\u2019t block stimulus when the economy needed it, or push a tax cut that will worsen inequality and explode the national debt.No, this is all about Republican bad faith. Everything they said about budgets, every step of the way, was fraudulent. And nobody should believe anything they say now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi King Shakes Up Military and Security Leadership", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 King Salman of Saudi Arabia is shaking up the leadership of the kingdom\u2019s military and internal security services, elevating younger officials at a time of increased military engagement abroad and sharp economic and social change at home.In a series of royal decrees announced late Monday, the king discharged dozens of officials across the government, bringing in a new chief of staff for the Saudi military and new officials for security and economic policy.A number of younger princes were named deputy governors and a woman was appointed deputy labor minister, a rare occurrence in the ultraconservative kingdom.The personnel shifts come at a time of rapid change for the kingdom, propelled by the ascendance of the king\u2019s son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32.Domestically, Prince Mohammed has consolidated tremendous power for himself while working to modernize the kingdom\u2019s economy and social life.As is typical in the highly opaque kingdom, the leadership offered no explanation for the abrupt changes. But analysts said they appeared to be in line with the young prince\u2019s plans.\u201cThere is definitely a move toward a younger generation,\u201d said Mohammed Alyahya, a Saudi analyst and nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington.Over several decades, Saudi Arabia has spent hundreds of billions of dollars assembling an impressive array of military hardware from the United States, Britain and other countries. But the heavy spending never translated into an effective fighting force that would enable the kingdom to protect itself and engage in military ventures abroad.Prince Mohammed has spoken publicly of his frustration over the gap between the kingdom\u2019s military spending and its capabilities, which has become clear during the war in Yemen. The new changes seem to be part of an effort to narrow the gap.The military appointments fit into a wider reorganization of the kingdom\u2019s armed forces that seeks to make them more efficient and stronger players in the region, Mr. Alyahya said.\u201cThe Saudi military is looking to become an organized, regional force on its own, and looking for more independence,\u201d he said.Those changes included a new chief of staff, Gen. Fayyad al-Ruwaili, new leaders for the air defense and land forces, and a royal endorsement of a road map for developing the Defense Ministry.Three younger princes \u2014 sons of Talal, Sultan and Muqrin, members of the king\u2019s generation whose political careers have ended \u2014 were named deputy governors.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of three princes who were named deputy governors in a series of royal decrees. The appointed princes are the descendants of Princes Talal, Sultan and Muqrin, not princes Talal, Ahmed and Muqrin. A son of Prince Ahmed, Prince Sultan bin Ahmed, was appointed as an adviser to the royal court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa\u2019s New President and a Mandela Favorite", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Cyril Ramaphosa, who was sworn in Thursday as South Africa\u2019s president, recently did what many politicians do at pivotal points in their careers.He released a book.The book told of one of his passions \u2014 his love for a Ugandan breed of royal cattle that he imported to South Africa at great expense. Anticipating criticism of his wealth in a country where millions still live in shacks, Mr. Ramaphosa argued at his book launch that the cattle were not meant as trophies for the elite like him, but to help struggling black farmers in South Africa.Mr. Ramaphosa is a business tycoon, one of South Africa\u2019s wealthiest men. To many here, he represents a kind of royalty of the African National Congress, an upper class that has grown removed from the average South African that the party still claims to champion.Yet he vows that as president he will work for the ordinary citizen, root out the country\u2019s debilitating corruption and convince a highly skeptical public that, under him, the governing African National Congress can whittle away at the gaping inequality that has enraged millions of citizens.As a union organizer decades ago, Mr. Ramaphosa founded the National Union of Mineworkers, winning mineworkers benefits and better working conditions. Years later, though, he switched sides and sat on the board of a mining company, drawing criticism for his role in a massacre of wildcat strikers.After being overlooked as Mr. Mandela\u2019s successor, he went into business and helped draft new policies to expand a black entrepreneurial class. But Mr. Ramaphosa never shied from using his political ties to accumulate vast wealth for himself, and over the years, critics have said the program rewarded only a small class of black South Africans with ties to the A.N.C.\u201cFor those who were hoping that Ramaphosa would return to the A.N.C. as a new broom, sweeping the party clean with a barnstorming assault on its corrupt establishment, years of disappointment lay ahead,\u201d wrote Ray Hartley, a journalist, in his book, \u201cRamaphosa: The Man Who Would Be King.\u201dBut to Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s supporters, he was, as always, playing the long game \u2014 waiting to succeed Mr. Zuma and accumulate the power he needs to change South Africa.Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa was born in 1952 in Johannesburg, to a police sergeant and a domestic worker. He became politically active in high school and was arrested on charges involving leading a student protest while in college. He served 11 months in solitary confinement in a Pretoria prison.After earning a law degree, Mr. Ramaphosa became a labor organizer, turning the National Union of Mineworkers into the nation\u2019s biggest trade union. He rubbed shoulders as easily with South Africa\u2019s white oligarchs as with the men he represented.After the apartheid government lifted the ban on the A.N.C. and freed Mr. Mandela in 1990, Mr. Ramaphosa, just shy of 40, became the party\u2019s secretary general. Under Mr. Mandela, he played a critical role in negotiating the peaceful transition from apartheid to democratic rule in 1994, and he also helped draft the new Constitution.Influential A.N.C. leaders who had been in exile successfully pushed one of their own, Thabo Mbeki, to succeed Mr. Mandela. So Mr. Ramaphosa left politics for business, though he remained closely involved with the A.N.C.He quickly became one of the most prominent members of the new black elite. He sat on many corporate boards and acquired interests in many sectors \u2014 including mining, finance, South Africa\u2019s McDonald\u2019s restaurants and Coca-Cola bottling plants \u2014 where his high-level ties to the A.N.C. proved useful.He was involved in drafting the new Black Economic Empowerment program, aimed at encouraging the growth of a black entrepreneurial class and skills. Still, in 2012, Mr. Ramaphosa spoke of the slow economic improvement among black South Africans since the end of apartheid.Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s ties to a mining company, Lonmin, made him, in the minds of many South Africans, the symbol of an A.N.C. elite that had lost touch with its base \u2014 a sellout, some said simply.When Mr. Zuma made him the nation\u2019s deputy president in 2014, Mr. Ramaphosa became the heir apparent to South Africa\u2019s presidency.More troubling to many was that Mr. Ramaphosa publicly supported his boss or stayed quiet, even when Mr. Zuma drew criticism for the kind of corruption Mr. Ramaphosa decries. In photos, he was often seen standing next to Mr. Zuma, a wide smile across his face.By then, Mr. Zuma was openly backing his former wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to succeed him as party leader. Like her husband, Ms. Dlamini-Zuma espoused economic populism, pushing for the need for \u201cradical economic transformation.\u201d She called for transferring slices of South Africa\u2019s economic pie from whites to blacks; Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s emphasis was on growing the whole pie.In recent weeks, Mr. Ramaphosa chipped away at Mr. Zuma\u2019s support with an undeniable argument: The prospects of the party and its members would be better in a government led by Mr. Ramaphosa. Sticking with Mr. Zuma would be bad \u2014 for everyone \u2014 in the next elections in 2019.Like all good negotiators, Mr. Ramaphosa no doubt found points to make. Identified with South Africa\u2019s urban and business elite, he visited rural areas and traditional leaders, including Mr. Zuma\u2019s home province of KwaZulu Natal.Perhaps he even handed out copies of his new book, \u201cCattle of the Ages,\u201d in which he ruminates on how he, a city boy, learned late in life the spiritual value of cattle and of his ancestral village, Khalavha, in rural northern South Africa.As he grew up in the city, \u201cthe only encounter I had with cattle was buying meat at the local butchery,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa wrote.\u201cBut I guess in every man is his father, and his father\u2019s father, and his father before that \u2014 and so it always goes. Somewhere in the depths of my soul is the connection my father had with his cattle, the hills of Khalavha and his people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Latest Surprise: Shutdown Might Be a Good Idea", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 A week ago, President Trump stood before Congress as an improbable unifier. \u201cTonight,\u201d he declared, \u201cI call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.\u201dA week ago, Mr. Trump called for a grand compromise with Democrats on the legal status of the undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers \u2014 a deal, he said, \u201cwhere nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.\u201d After all, the president added, \u201cAmericans are dreamers too.\u201dOn Tuesday, his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, said that many Dreamers failed to register for protected status with the government because they were \u201cwere too afraid to sign up\u201d or were \u201ctoo lazy to get off their asses.\u201d He said he doubted Mr. Trump would extend the March 5 deadline that shields them from deportation.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of a shutdown seemed to have little effect on the delicate negotiations on Capitol Hill to raise spending caps on military and nonmilitary spending \u2014 an agreement that, if passed by both houses of Congress, would pave the way for long-term deal to fund the government.It was also not clear whether Mr. Kelly\u2019s charged language about the Dreamers would affect the charged negotiations on immigration that will soon consume Congress, though it was the latest evidence that Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine general once viewed as a curb on Mr. Trump, shares some of his most hard-edge views.Head-spinning reversals, of course, are nothing new for Mr. Trump. His positions on issues can gyrate more wildly than the Dow Jones industrial average. His is a presidency that has made the extraordinary ordinary.After these latest remarks, the White House swung into its customary role of cleanup. The deputy press secretary, Hogan Gidley, played down Mr. Trump\u2019s charges of Democratic treason as \u201ctongue-in-cheek,\u201d while the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, muddied the waters on whether the president really planned to shut down the government.\u201cWe don\u2019t need a government shutdown on this,\u201d she said, imploring Mr. Trump. \u201cBoth sides have learned that a government shutdown was bad. It wasn\u2019t good for them.\u201dFor others in Washington, however, there was a creeping sense of numbness. Mr. Trump has said so many outrageous things, has broken so many taboos and has insulted so many people that his latest outbursts no longer shock. To some, they seem more of the same.It fell to Senator Jeff Flake, the lame-duck Arizona Republican who has emerged as a prime nemesis of Mr. Trump, to point out the novelty of an American president branding members of the other party as traitors because they did not celebrate him.\u201cHave we arrived at such a place of numb acceptance that we have nothing to say when a president of the United States casually suggests that those who choose not to stand or applaud his speech are guilty of treason?\u201d he said from the floor the Senate. \u201cI certainly hope not.\u201dMr. Flake noted that \u201cthe president\u2019s most ardent defenders use the now-weary argument that the president\u2019s comments were meant as a joke, just sarcasm, only tongue in cheek.\u201d\u201cTreason,\u201d he thundered, \u201cis not a punch-line, Mr. President.\u201dPart of the problem is that Mr. Trump\u2019s most inflammatory comments do sometimes appear tossed-off. His claim that Democrats were guilty of treason came during a rambling speech at a factory near Cincinnati, where his celebration of the recent tax cut gave way to a litany of complaints about the stone-faced Democratic reception of his speech.\u201cCan we call that treason?\u201d Mr. Trump mused. \u201cWhy not? I mean they certainly didn\u2019t seem to love our country very much.\u201dThe president embraced the idea of a shutdown during a White House meeting meant to dramatize the dangers of the gang MS-13. After listening to Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, talk about how loopholes in the immigration laws allow violent criminals to get into the United States, Mr. Trump suddenly upped the ante with Democrats.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change it, let\u2019s have a shutdown,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a shutdown. And it\u2019s worth it for our country. I\u2019d love to see a shutdown if we don\u2019t get this stuff taken care of.\u201dLater, Ms. Sanders noted that the president did not view the spending bill and immigration as \u201cmutually exclusive,\u201d meaning that he would not necessarily precipitate a shutdown if Congress agreed on spending without meeting his demands on immigration.At the same time, she questioned the patriotism of Democrats who sat on their hands during Mr. Trump\u2019s discussion of the thriving American economy. \u201cDemocrats are going to have to make a decision at some point really soon,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cDo they hate this president more than they love this country? And I hope the answer to that is, \u2018No.\u2019\u201dMr. Schiff has drafted a Democratic rebuttal to the classified House Republican report that raised questions about the conduct of the F.B.I. in investigating links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\u201cMust be stopped!\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter of the congressman.\u201cMr. President,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI see you\u2019ve had a busy morning of \u2018Executive Time.\u2019 Instead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The issue has been divisive in Britain\u2019s overseas territories, which control their own internal affairs but rely on Britain for defense and for representation in the international community.International human rights groups and supporters of same-sex marriage condemned the reversal.\u201cThis decision strips loving same-sex couples of the right to marry and jeopardizes Bermuda\u2019s international reputation and economy,\u201d said Ty Cobb, director of the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group in the United States.Eight same-sex marriages that took place in Bermuda between May and now will remain recognized under the new law.Reached by phone, Winston Godwin-DeRoche said that the legislation was an improvement on the situation before last May, but that it was a setback.\u201cThe problem is, when you are giving a community these rights, you are allowing them to get married \u2014 and then less than a year later, you are taking them away,\u201d he said.His husband, Greg Godwin-DeRoche, said: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating in so many ways.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tool Kit Does Not Include the Constitution", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince before President Trump was elected \u2014 and with greater frequency afterward \u2014 historians, political scientists and journalists have wondered how autocratic our democracy might become.The results also revealsubstantial declines (greater than 10 percentage points) in the belief that the government does not interfere with the press, protects free speech rights, that opinions on policy are heard and that candidates disclose information.Helmke and her colleagues warn that these trends constitute a threat to democracy:If scholars are right that erosion proceeds on a piecemeal basis, and that the first steps often entail targeting democracy\u2019s \u201creferees,\u201d then our results regarding declines in judicial independence and support for a free press are especially disturbing.The release of the Bright Line survey comes at a moment when Trump has once again defied traditional norms and constraints concerning the treatment of political opponents.You\u2019re up there, you\u2019ve got half the room going totally crazy, wild \u2014 they loved everything, they want to do something great for our country. And you have the other side, even on positive news \u2014 really positive news, like that \u2014 they were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, \u201ctreasonous.\u201d I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not?If we don\u2019t change the legislation, get rid of these loopholes where killers come into our country and continue to kill, if we don\u2019t change it, let\u2019s have a shutdown. We\u2019ll do a shutdown, and it\u2019s worth it for our country.The decline of public faith in America\u2019s democratic institutions can be seen in the accompanying chart describing Bright Line\u2019s findings.Those polled were asked to rate whether the United States fully meets, mostly meets, partly meets or does not meet more than two dozen principles of democracy. The bars in the graphic capture the drop in the percentage of people who agree that the United States fully or mostly lives up to democratic standards.The authors of the analysis of the survey conclude that the \u201coverall picture is sobering,\u201d citing public agreement \u201cthat the performance of U.S. democracy has declined\u201d during Trump\u2019s tenure in office.\u201cThe damage being done is twofold,\u201d Dolan wrote by email:The president\u2019s strategy is doing permanent damage to the view of law enforcement agencies, at least among the segment of the population that takes what he says as truth.This is only part of \u201cthe more general problem we are having today with the success Trump and others have had in creating the view that there is no objective truth,\u201d Dolan argued:The manipulation of the truth by the president and other Republicans continues to degrade public discussion of issues.While polarization has created a political universe composed of two truths, one Democratic, the other Republican, Trump has driven, and profited from, this duality.Iyengar posed the following hypothetical:Let\u2019s assume that Mueller uncovers evidence of collusion and close associates of the Prez are implicated. Republicans are likely to deny the validity of the charges on the grounds that the investigators are biased and Republicans in Congress, as they\u2019ve repeatedly demonstrated, will stick by Trump since the base is with him. Trump, of course, will continue with the \u2018hoax\u2019 narrative, and his surrogates in the media will be only too happy to back him up. At that point, we will have a very real threat to the rule of law.Republican confidence moved in the opposite direction, from 46 to 31 percent.Polarization by party identity is so powerful at the moment that most voters see the world through thick red and blue lenses. Almost everything is politicized. And, in almost every study I have run, I find that Republicans are more intense partisans than Democrats on average. We\u2019ve seen partisanship color Republican evaluations of the FBI (negatively) and Russia and Putin (positively).Theodoridis argued that the damage to \u201cany given institution is not likely to last beyond its usefulness in a specific political context.\u201d But, he warned,the more pernicious problem is the very phenomenon of universal politicization. If everything, even the most esteemed institutions and norms, is subjected to the power of partisan motivated reasoning, then there really cease to be esteemed institutions and norms.Moving from politicization to politics, how likely are these trends to play out in the midterm elections?If the economy stays strong and swing voters see benefits to the economy and themselves from tax cuts, the Republicans may well hold on to the House and, more easily, the Senate.If Rosenthal is right, then the future of democracy in America during the Trump administration depends as much or more on unemployment, take home pay, the Dow Jones industrial average, tax rates and the gross domestic product as on principled support for the rule of law.In all likelihood, as the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, continues to pursue lines of inquiry reaching deep into the White House, Trump will have plenty of opportunities in the near future to push the envelope on the rule of law.Presidential approval and the economy are the two big contextual predictors of congressional elections in the midterms. And those are pushing in opposite directions.Looking forward toward the midterm elections, Ansolabehere is not optimistic about Democratic prospects to win back control of the House:I see the Democrats poised right now to make net gains of about 10 to 14 seats. They need 25 or so depending on vacancies.That could all change, he added:A sag in the economy over the summer or really bad news for Trump could tip twenty or so races that are leaning GOP right now.Consistently, we find that Americans oppose the concentration of authority in the presidency; in fact, we find that Democrats and Republicans exhibit far greater agreement in their opposition to unilateral powers than they exhibit in their evaluations of the sitting president. This opposition, we find, is driven by their beliefs in constitutional principles. Further, we find that the public penalizes presidents for circumventing the constitutional order to take matters into their own hands.In other words, Rogowski wrote,our research suggests that how presidents wield power matters, and the public does not view presidents fondly for violating accepted constitutional arrangements. Democrats, therefore, have an opportunity to mobilize public support against President Trump by emphasizing the president\u2019s violations of constitutional norms.At the same time, Rogowski added,Sometimes the other institutions push back. For instance, Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s seeking of a third (and then a fourth) term is among the most important norm violations in American political history. He hadn\u2019t been dead for two years before both chambers of Congress proposed the 22nd amendment to limit presidents to two terms. After Lincoln\u2019s use of emergency powers to flex presidential power in ways not previously seen, Congress fought back against his successor, Andrew Johnson. More of his vetoes were overridden (15) than for any other president and Congress limited presidential influence over executive branch employment by passing the Tenure of Office Act (1867).The Rogowski and Reeves thesis faces a certain test. Trump won the Republican nomination and the presidency by conducting a campaign directly challenging the notion that the electorate will punish a politician for \u201cviolating accepted constitutional arrangements.\u201dHe has not wavered from this course throughout the first year of his presidency, and, barring unforeseen events, it will guide him into the 2020 election.If Republicans retain control of both branches of Congress in 2018 \u2014 even if by just one vote in the House and a 50-50 split (with Vice President Pence the tiebreaker) in the Senate \u2014 Trump will claim vindication. His assault on the pillars of democracy will continue unabated, with increasingly insidious effect.Advertisement"}

But today\u2019s column will focus on the incompetence, whose full depths \u2014 and consequences \u2014 we\u2019re just starting to see.Let\u2019s start with a few recent stories.FEMA later said that this was a miscommunication. But at the very least it suggests a complete lack of focus.Trump also declared, as he has in the past, that he is \u201ccommitted\u201d to taking action on the opioid epidemic. But he\u2019s been in office a year and has basically done nothing.The thing is, these aren\u2019t isolated examples. A remarkable number of Trump appointees have been forced out over falsified credentials, unethical practices or racist remarks. And you can be sure there are many other appointees who did the same things, but haven\u2019t yet been caught.Why is this administration hiring such people? It surely reflects both supply and demand: Competent people don\u2019t want to work for Trump, and he and his inner circle don\u2019t want them anyway.By now it\u2019s obvious to everyone that the Trump administration is a graveyard for reputations: Everyone who goes in comes out soiled and diminished. Only fools, or those with no reputation to lose, even want the positions on offer. And in any case, Trump, who values personal loyalty above professionalism, probably distrusts anyone whose credentials might give some sense of independence.But what\u2019s the problem? After all, stocks are up and the economy is steadily growing. Does competence even matter?The answer is that America is a very big country with a lot of strengths, and it can run on momentum for a long time even if none of the people in charge know what they\u2019re doing. Sooner or later, however, stuff happens \u2014 and then incompetence becomes a very big deal, as it already has in Puerto Rico.What kind of stuff may happen? The scariest scenarios involve national security. But we can\u2019t count on smooth sailing for the economy, either. And who will manage economic turbulence if and when it hits? After all, we currently have perhaps the least impressive Treasury secretary in U.S. history.Matters are a bit better at the Federal Reserve, where nobody seems to have bad things to say about Jerome Powell, just confirmed as Fed chairman. On the other hand, why didn\u2019t Trump just follow the usual norms and appoint Janet Yellen, who has done a fantastic job, to a second term?One answer may be that Trump is a traditionalist \u2014 and few things are more traditional than passing over a highly qualified woman in favor of a less qualified man. But I also suspect that he found Yellen\u2019s independent stature threatening.And lower-level Fed appointments are becoming cause for concern.Now, everyone makes bad predictions now and then; God knows I have. But you\u2019re supposed to face up to your mistakes, figure out what went wrong and adapt your views. Goodfriend refused to do any of that. And why should he? His errors were politically correct; they reinforced Republican orthodoxy. From the G.O.P.\u2019s point of view, having been completely wrong about monetary policy isn\u2019t a defect, it\u2019s practically a badge of honor.The point is that even at the Fed, which is partly insulated from the Trumpian reign of error, U.S. policymaking is being denuded of expertise. And the whole nation will eventually pay the price.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Women\u2019s Voices Are Scarce in Economics", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewFor decades, the number of women studying economics seemed to be increasing, easing the persistent scarcity of professional female economists in the United States. But that progress has stalled.New data indicates that the share of women studying the subject in America\u2019s universities has flatlined and the pool of prospective female economists may even be shrinking.That pattern would be disturbing in any academic field but because economics has an outsize influence on public policy, it means that many important debates are likely to be dominated by men\u2019s voices for years to come.Among first-year doctoral students studying economics, the share was 32 percent in 2017 \u2014 barely changed from 33 percent in 2000, according to the report. The imbalance is so great that in six of the \u201ctop twenty\u201d economics programs, fewer than one-fifth of the incoming doctoral students were women.This decline in the share of women at relatively early stages of the economics career path is already beginning to reshape the field at more senior levels.The share of undergraduate women who major in economics peaked in the mid-to-late 1990s, I have found, and it has drifted downward since. In 2016, only 35 percent of economics majors were women \u2014 about the same as in the early 1980s \u2014 although women earn a majority of all undergraduate degrees.The result is that women\u2019s voices are underrepresented.These studies have forced introspection upon many economists, making it difficult to believe that the field is really a meritocracy. They have forced urgent conversations in faculty lounges and conference hallways in parallel to the broader national conversation about gender and power.The scarcity of women economists has already had important consequences.Perhaps most telling was the question on pay: Only 14 percent of female economists said the gender wage gap is largely explained by differences in education and voluntary occupational choices while 54 percent of male economists agreed with that notion.Women economists tend to focus on different topics than men. While men dominate macroeconomics, women are more visible among those studying labor markets, health and education. The only majority-female economics conference I\u2019ve ever attended was on the economics of children, a field focused on schooling, family structure and child well-being. If there were more female economists, more attention would surely be paid to these issues.Justin Wolfers is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.

Macarenia clavigera, she said, is the key to the future of this remote region in central Colombia.When the rains come in May, the rivers will rise and the plant will turn a brilliant red. \u201cThis plant has the peculiar quality of turning distinct colors,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can see it from May to November.\u201dA few paces away, Ms. D\u00edaz, who works as a guide during the tourist season, also noted a tarry seep staining the river rock. This is the other reason this region is getting attention: oil.A Texas company had hoped to drill oil wells to the west of this unique ecosystem. Now, a dispute between the company and the Colombian government is heading to court.The hub of this region is La Macarena, a small town perched on the broad, silty Guayabero River. For decades, the government\u2019s war with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a guerrilla army known as FARC, made this a risky place to visit.More than 15,000 tourists visited the rainbow river last year, and Ms. D\u00edaz is one of more than 130 local guides. On busy days, hundreds of tourists disperse among seven designated sites managed by Cormacarena, a regional government agency focused on sustainable development. Several of the sites, including Ca\u00f1o Cristales, are part of Sierra de La Macarena National Park.In 2009, Hupecol, a Colombian subsidiary of the Dan A. Hughes Company of Beeville, Tex., began seismic studies to look for oil on land it had leased near the small town of San Vicente del Cagu\u00e1n, west of here.The revocation was popular in La Macarena, where Mayor Ismael Medellin Due\u00f1as, whose desk sits beneath a painting of Ca\u00f1o Cristales, said residents are very concerned about possible environmental impacts of oil development. The region\u2019s economic future rests on dairy farming and ecotourism, he said.Posters and murals against oil drilling emblazon the walls and windows of the town. \u201cOnce it was a FARC war,\u201d said Miguel Ortiz, an English teacher and interpreter who has lived here for 13 years. \u201cNow it\u2019s the fracking war.\u201dScientists are trying to learn more about the diverse and unique environment, where jaguars and margays roam the savannah and jungles, and river dolphins swim in the Guayabero River.Carlos Lasso, a senior investigator at the Humboldt Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to studying Colombia\u2019s biodiversity, has co-authored a 180-page guide to the fauna of Ca\u00f1o Cristales, part of a four-year regional study.In late January, he led a two-week expedition in large dugout canoes to survey the Duda, Guayabero and Losada rivers. The team identified more than 50 species of aquatic birds, four species of aquatic snakes, and more than 150 species of fish, including three that may be new to science.They also found Orinoco crocodiles, a critically endangered species that can grow to seven meters in length.The humble M. clavigera plays a key role, not least because it attracts the tourists that drive the economy. The plant is endemic to the clear, acidic, nutrient-poor waters rivers flowing from the Serrania de la Macarena, an isolated mountain range east of the Andes.\u201cIt\u2019s a unique ecosystem,\u201d Dr. Lasso said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very fragile.\u201d\u00c1ngela Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, the integral sustainability manager at Hupecol, said there is a lot of misinformation about the oil project. To start, she said, Hupecol\u2019s oil lease was far from Ca\u00f1o Cristales.\u201cThere\u2019s no possibility of any impact, because it\u2019s 68 kilometers away,\u201d Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said. (That\u2019s about 42 miles.) Further, she said, the company had no interest in fracking, as some feared, only in conventional oil drilling.Ms. Rodr\u00edguez described the decision to revoke Hupecol\u2019s permit as political, an opportunity for government officials to burnish their environmental credentials by protecting a popular tourist site.Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said the seismic studies were promising, and Hupecol had hoped to drill an exploratory well. The company is seeking $21 million in damages in a court case against the government.But now there is a new complication. A group of FARC dissidents, who did not disarm in the recent peace deal, is active in the area. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to drill a well in that area if the licenses comes back to us,\u201d Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said, citing the instability.Javier Francisco Parra, the regional coordinator at Cormacarena, acknowledged that the Hupecol lease is not very close to Ca\u00f1o Cristales, but said it is hard to know whether it would pose a direct threat to the river.And oil drilling is incompatible with a regional management plan Cormacarena developed with the input of local residents, he said.Mr. Parra sees another emerging threat: In recent years, there have been dry periods during the rainy season, and rain during the dry season.Dr. Lasso said there is no long-term water flow data for Ca\u00f1o Cristales, but agreed that things appear to be changing. The river is closed to tourists during the dry season, and over the past decade, he said, the season has seemed to arrive earlier each year.The timing could be part of a natural cycle, Dr. Lasso said, or related to local forest clearing. But it could also be linked to broader patterns of climate change.Back on Ca\u00f1o Piedras, Ms. Diaz, who works as a firefighter during the off-season, stood on the ancient rocks between M. clavigera and an oil seep, and said she is looking forward to May. The tourists will return, and the rivers will again run red.And Ms. D\u00edaz was clear about where she and her co-workers stand on the local controversy. \u201cThe guides,\u201d she said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want the oil drilling.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ukraine, Corruption Is Now Undermining the Military", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Nearly four years into a grinding war against rebels armed by Russia, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry proudly announced last month that it had improved its previously meager medical services for its wounded troops with the purchase and delivery of 100 new military ambulances.Not mentioned, however, was that many of the ambulances had already broken down. Or that they had been sold to the military under a no-bid contract by an auto company owned by a senior official in charge of procurement for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. Or that the official, Oleg Gladkovskyi, is an old friend and business partner of Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro O. Poroshenko.Ukraine\u2019s spending on defense and security has soared since the conflict in the east started in 2014, rising from around 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product in 2013 to more than 5 percent this year, when it will total around $6 billion.This bonanza, which will push procurement spending in 2018 to more than $700 million, has enabled Ukraine to rebuild its dilapidated military and fight to a standstill pro-Russian rebels and their heavily armed Russian backers.The problem has throttled the hopes raised in February 2014 by the ouster of Ukraine\u2019s notoriously corrupt, pro-Russian former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. It has also left the country\u2019s dispirited Western backers and many Ukrainians wondering what, after two revolutions since independence in 1991, it will take to curb the chronic corruption.\u201cIt serves no purpose for Ukraine to fight for its body in Donbas if it loses its soul to corruption,\u201d Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson warned last year, referring to regions of eastern Ukraine seized by Russian-backed separatists after the ouster of Mr. Yanukovych.Ukraine has made considerable progress since 2014 in draining pools of corruption in the gas business, a major source of income for crooked tycoons under Mr. Yanukovych. It has overhauled the state energy company, Naftogaz, and reduced the scope for corrupt gas deals by insiders by cutting its reliance on supplies from Russia\u2019s energy giant, Gazprom.Military spending, however, has opened up new vistas for opaque insider deals, sheltered from scrutiny by a cone of secrecy that covers the details of military spending.\u201cCorruption in the energy sector has been reduced, so some of the main avenues for corruption have moved to defense,\u201d said Olena Tregub, the secretary general of the Independent Defense Anti-Corruption Committee, a research group funded by Western donors.While Mr. Gladkovskyi acknowledged that the ambulance purchase did not involve an open tender for bids, there is no evidence that he tilted military contracts for ambulances and other vehicles toward his own company, something he denies doing. But the appearance of a blatant conflict of interest is just one of many in a country where business and political power form a tangled skein of overlapping, opaque and often lucrative transactions.\u201cThere is no proof that he influenced purchasing decisions, and there never will be. It is all secret,\u201d said Victor Chumak, an independent member of the Ukrainian Parliament and deputy chairman of its anticorruption committee. \u201cThe merging of politics and business is our biggest problem.\u201dEmblematic of the intertwining of business and politics and the rich fruit this can yield are three lavish villas on the southern Spanish coast. They are owned by President Poroshenko, Mr. Gladkovskyi and Ihor Kononenko, another business partner of the president who leads Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s faction in Parliament.All three were wealthy businessmen before taking official posts, but they have nonetheless stirred suspicion by being less than forthcoming about their holdings. None of them declared the Spanish properties in mandatory filings of assets, an annual declaration of wealth by senior officials introduced in 2016 as part of a now-stalled drive for greater transparency and accountability.Conflicts of interest are so widespread \u201cthat you are no longer even shocked,\u201d said Aivaras Abromavicius, a former investment banker from Lithuania who helped lead a since-becalmed push for clean government while serving as Ukraine\u2019s minister of economy and trade. \u201cThey are all over the place. It is sad, depressing and discouraging.\u201dSuch disappointment has already cost Ukraine dearly. The International Monetary Fund and the European Union, frustrated by foot-dragging over the establishment of a long-promised independent anticorruption court and other setbacks, have suspended assistance money totaling more than $5 billion.\u201cUkraine lived for decades in a state of total corruption,\u201d said Artem Sytnyk, director of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, known as NABU, an independent agency set up in 2015 during an initial burst of enthusiasm for clean government following the ouster of Mr. Yanukovych. \u201cThese schemes have now been renewed and are again working. Some people simply don\u2019t want to get rid of them.\u201dNABU\u2019s efforts to delve into defense-related embezzlement, which led to the arrest last year of a deputy defense minister and the ministry\u2019s procurement chief, led to a flurry of moves to neuter the anticorruption body.\u201cThis is a very sensitive zone,\u201d Mr. Sytnyk said.NABU has come under sustained attack in recent months, with Parliament drafting legislation, later dropped, that would have emasculated the agency and with the domestic intelligence service raiding the homes of NABU employees.Mr. Poroshenko, who is expected to seek re-election next year, has positioned himself as a leader who rebuilt Ukraine\u2019s ramshackle military and stood up to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. To the consternation of the Ukrainian leader, though, the conflict with pro-Russian separatists is slowly mutating in the public mind from a heroic struggle into yet another sinkhole of profiteering and graft.\u201cNobody mentions Putin anymore, and the \u2018P\u2019 word now is Poroshenko,\u201d Mr. Saakashvili said in an interview in Kiev shortly before his expulsion from Ukraine. \u201cThis is not fair, because Putin is mostly responsible, but people see that there is a war and that Poroshenko and his friends are making money out of it.\u201dMr. Abromavicius, the former economy minister, who quit in fury over the backtracking on anticorruption efforts, said he did not believe that Mr. Poroshenko was profiting personally from the conflict in the east. But he said the president has left himself exposed by failing to deliver on promises to sell off his business assets or to set up a genuinely independent anticorruption court.Mr. Gladkovskyi defended the secrecy and the absence of public tenders for most military equipment, including ambulances, as necessary to prevent Russia from meddling in purchases by submitting phony bids through fake companies, which he says it has done repeatedly when competitive bidding has been attempted.\u201cNobody is making money from the war,\u201d he said.Mr. Gladkovskyi said that he had withdrawn from business decisions at his auto company, Bogdan Motors, and that his only knowledge of the ambulances came from visits to the front line, where he saw his vehicles and felt proud that Bogdan was assisting the war effort.\u201cCorruption,\u201d he added in an interview, \u201cis really very serious, but it is not connected with the system I am running.\u201dLooming large in this system is Ukroboronprom, a sprawling state conglomerate comprising 130 defense companies and employing around 80,000 people. Dmitro Maksimov, a former employee in Ukroboronprom\u2019s control department, said shady deals in procurement were \u201cthe essence\u201d of the conglomerate\u2019s operations.He recounted how a small screwlike piece of metal purchased by Ukroboronprom for an aircraft repair factory in Lviv had skyrocketed from $50 in early 2014 to nearly $4,000 a year later, after Ukroboronprom mysteriously shifted its business to an outside supplier.Mr. Maksimov said he had raised this and other inexplicably high prices with his superiors, but was told to drop the matter and was later fired, a dismissal he is challenging in court.Denys Gurak, the conglomerate\u2019s young deputy director, said he did not know about Mr. Maksimov\u2019s complaints but acknowledged that corruption existed in the defense sector. He added that after years of systematic looting under Mr. Yanukovych \u2014 who he said set up Ukroboronprom in 2010 so as to centralize stealing \u2014 \u201cit is a miracle we can still do anything.\u201d\u201cIt is a systemic problem for the whole country, not just one sector,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system does not work, so people steal. This is why the Soviet Union collapsed.\u201dHe said that Ukroboronprom had itself sent 200 reports to prosecutors about corruption in its ranks but that only two of these had ended up in convictions, and suspended sentences.The defense conglomerate last week announced, without explanation, the resignation of its director general, Roman Romanov.Daria Kaleniuk, director of the Anticorruption Action Center, a nongovernmental group in Kiev, said that transparency and accountability are national security issues that must be addressed if Ukraine is not only to create a functioning European-style democracy, but also to hold its own on the battlefield in the east.They would also help clarify why the military ambulances sold by Mr. Gladkovskyi\u2019s auto company keep breaking down and why they were purchased in the first place.A report last year by the Independent Defense Anti-Corruption Committee said that each vehicle, whose chassis is Chinese made, had cost the Ukrainian Defense Ministry $32,000, much more than an ambulance imported from China would cost, and could carry only 800 pounds, far too little for a vehicle that would need a driver, armed guards and medical staff.Valentina Varava, a volunteer who delivers supplies to troops in the east, said the ambulances were designed for urban roads, but \u201cin the military zone, there are no roads.\u201dShe said that as many as 19 of the 50 vehicles so far delivered to the east were out of service. The Ministry of Defense, she added, recently decided to buy 100 more ambulances from Mr. Gladkovskyi\u2019s auto company.Iulia Mendel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

She received an art education in S\u00e3o Paulo, but she found the instruction traditionalist, so she left for Paris in 1920. There she learned from Fernand L\u00e9ger, whose bold colors and rounded figures would be decisive for her mature art. There is much of L\u00e9ger in a 1923 academy (or nude figure study) of Tarsila\u2019s, in which the sitter\u2019s contoured flesh pops against a backdrop of blue, green and beige.For contemporary audiences in New York, now hyper-attuned to white artists\u2019 use and misuse of black bodies, \u201cA Negra\u201d will pose the toughest challenge in this exhibition. But context is critical here. In 1923, for a trained artist to imagine a black woman as the embodiment of a new national spirit would have constituted a direct attack on the old, wannabe-European establishment of Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo. (We might add that Modern artists in 1920s Paris were besotted with African and Native American art, precisely what the Brazilian bourgeoisie disdained.) The Modernist tropes of \u201cA Negra,\u201d with its scrambling of scales and its simplified graphics, were to be the building blocks for the art of a multiracial society.Tarsila did not wholly commit to a new formal language after \u201cA Negra.\u201d There are landscapes and genre scenes, such as \u201cThe Papaya Tree\u201d (1925), that appear very much like folk art \u2014 a good reminder, especially here at MoMA, that the development of Modernism could proceed at different tempos and take nonlinear paths, in Brazil and elsewhere. But in 1928, Tarsila painted \u201cAbaporu,\u201d a landmark work of Brazilian Modernism, in which a nude figure, half-human and half-animal, nuzzles his nose or beak into his bent knee, and looks down at his massive, swollen foot, several times the size of his head.The ornery nudes of \u201cA Negra\u201d and \u201cAbaporu\u201d unite in Tarsila\u2019s final great painting, \u201cAntropofagia,\u201d a marriage of two figures that is also a marriage of Old World and New. The couple sit entangled, her breast drooping over his knee, their giant feet crossed one over the other, while, behind them, a banana leaf grows as large as a cactus. The sun, high above the primordial couple, is a wedge of lemon.Advertisement"}

But in 2008, when he sold $1 million of his Facebook shares on private markets, and the amount of money he needed to give away increased exponentially, he started thinking more seriously about where his contributions might make the most impact.\u201cI grew up looking at the price almost down to the penny on everything from a bottle of juice to a can of soda,\u201d he told me in early February, explaining why he wanted to get \u201cthe most value\u201d out of philanthropy. We were sitting in the East Village office of the Economic Security Project, an organization Mr. Hughes co-founded with two other activists, Dorian Warren and Natalie Foster, to fund the work of technologists, academics, policymakers and others exploring the idea of a guaranteed basic income for low- and middle-income Americans.Mr. Hughes is one of the co-founders of Facebook, for which he did \u201cthree years\u2019 worth of work for nearly half a billion dollars,\u201d as he puts it, emphasizing the extreme nature of his success. He and Mark Zuckerberg were roommates at Harvard, and early on, Mr. Hughes ran the company\u2019s communications and marketing department. The social network\u2019s colossal success fast-tracked Mr. Hughes\u2019s career. In 2008, he joined Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign to launch and manage My.BarackObama.com, a robust system that organized Obama supporters and was viewed as instrumental to his victory. In 2012, when Facebook went public and The New Republic came up for sale, he bought it, hoping to herald the publication into a digital future and expand its reach. His tumultuous ownership ended in 2016, when he sold the magazine. Later that year, he joined with Mr. Warren and Ms. Foster to form the Economic Security Project.In his new book, \u201cFair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn,\u201d out this week, Mr. Hughes, 34, traces his ascent to show how the forces that influenced his and Facebook\u2019s success \u2014 technological advancements, globalization and the rise of private equity firms \u2014 have created a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d economy in which only a small group of people succeed.\u201cI think that when people enjoy success of many sorts it is oftentimes easy to forget all of the factors that contribute to making that possible,\u201d he said, citing his own upbringing. He grew up in a stable, middle-class family, the only child of a paper salesman and a schoolteacher. As a child, he took advantage of government-run after-school programs and was placed in \u201cgifted\u201d classes. At 14, he searched online for the \u201cbest high school in America,\u201d turning up Phillips Academy, a prestigious private school in Andover, Mass.; Mr. Hughes applied and talked his way into a scholarship. All these factors, he argues, factored into his success even before he landed in a dorm room with Mr. Zuckerberg.In \u201cFair Shot,\u201d he offers a solution to balance the scale: a guaranteed income of $500 a month for adults earning less than $50,000, including nontraditional workers like parents and students. His proposal is that such a program be paid for through a tax on the country\u2019s highest earners, those whose annual income is $250,000 or more. His plan would reach 60 million adults and lift 20 million out of poverty overnight, he writes, while providing those in the middle class with more financial stability.\u201cThe guaranteed income as an idea is so simple that oftentimes people just sort of skip over the power of cash itself,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cWe think, Oh my God, income inequality \u2014 it\u2019s so incredible, all the stats are so insane, but what can we do about it? It\u2019s got to be education or it\u2019s got to be more job training. It\u2019s got to be a higher minimum wage. I say, \u2018Yes, yes and yes.\u2019\u201d But we need to do more, he insists.The Economic Security Project\u2019s office is part university library, part tech start-up, with dark leather and wood furniture alongside a white meeting pod near the entrance. It seems to reflect Mr. Hughes\u2019s sensibilities \u2014 his admiration for old, established institutions and his embrace of digital technology. When I arrive for our interview, Mr. Hughes greets me warmly, and we sit in what appears to be the office\u2019s only conference room, enclosed by a glass wall. His Southern accent is barely detectable, and in conversation, he is measured and cautious, laying out his argument with his hands, becoming riled only when I bring up the tax bill (\u201cthe most perplexing and infuriating move\u201d) and the fact that some might view their success as completely self-generated (\u201cthat\u2019s just flat wrong\u201d).Before he started the Economic Security Project, Mr. Hughes had been working on the issue of the guaranteed income internationally through GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that, as the name suggests, operates a cash transfer program that puts money into the hands of those who need it. Mr. Hughes was inspired by the organization\u2019s ideals, and he started to wonder whether a similar model could work domestically.\u201cThere was no real organization in the United States focused on exploring how a guaranteed income might work,\u201d he said.But rather than go in \u201cguns blazing,\u201d he explained, \u201cwe said: \u2018This is a promising idea. Let\u2019s bring together a network of people to think about this collaboratively and see where it goes.\u2019\u201d The Economic Security Project was originally conceived as a temporary, two-year initiative, but has since been extended to 2020.Mr. Hughes\u2019s cautiousness is a direct result of his experience at The New Republic. Despite his intention to \u201cmake it a publication that millions of people would adore and really value,\u201d the result was not so idyllic. He invested $25 million, moved the magazine to a slick new office and hired top talent from other publications. By late 2014, his investment was not paying off, and he brought in Guy Vidra, a former Yahoo executive, to be the C.E.O., hoping he might be able to make The New Republic a digital media company. Mr. Vidra and Mr. Hughes decided to replace Franklin Foer, the editor at the time, but the news reached Mr. Foer first, and he resigned, prompting mass resignations across the publication. What followed was a media maelstrom, and a little over a year later, unable to turn the publication\u2019s profits around, Mr. Hughes sold the magazine.\u201cChris was pretty anxious about where things were headed,\u201d Mr. Foer said on a recent call, adding: \u201cThere were lots of larger forces remaking journalism, and because of Chris\u2019s biography and because of some of the ham-fisted ways in which he handled things, he kind of fell into a morality play. It was pretty easy to cast the story as a parable about journalism, and I think that helps explain the heat of the coverage that fell on him.\u201dIn retrospect, Mr. Hughes said he regretted his approach at The New Republic. \u201cI went in with very big-picture kinds of goals and went too far too fast,\u201d he said, before I could ask. \u201cNow, I work on this big-picture, similarly idealistic kind of idea of a world where everyone has some basic financial security through cash, but I don\u2019t think we necessarily need to start off by giving $1,000 to everybody.\u201dThe plausibility of his idea is a matter of debate. Branko Milanovic, a leading scholar on income inequality, and Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, both believe the plan is unrealistic given the partisan divisions of the current political climate. Mr. Baker also noted that policy changes to restructure the economy, such as weaker patent and copyright laws and public funding for generic medication, were a more urgent need. The Stanford professor and economist Nicholas Bloom brought up the potential for fraud, adding that government enforcement would be difficult.Mr. Hughes is aware that his proposal is far-reaching. \u201cThis is a big idea and it\u2019s an expensive idea, but I do think that it is in line with the scale of the problem, which is also immense,\u201d he said.Mr. Hughes said his own windfall gave him the mental space to think about and pursue his goals, and now, he feels a responsibility to pay it forward. When I ask him where this impulse comes from, his face softens. \u201cFrom my parents.\u201d His father wanted him to be successful, he explained, but \u201cthere was also a sense that you don\u2019t do better at the expense of others.\u201dGiving people cash, in Mr. Hughes\u2019s view, is not only the most effective way to tackle inequality today, it is also the most humane: \u201cIt\u2019s truly a belief that people can be trusted and deserve the opportunity to design their lives, to chase their own dreams.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Congress Doesn\u2019t Always Do the Right Thing", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWill arguments to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d persuade lawmakers? Don\u2019t hold your breath. Such exhortations are rarely heeded by politicians, because the structural incentives of the institution usually trump policy considerations.But those instances are rare. Most of the time, members of Congress do want to pass good public policy, but they also have two other important goals, re-election and increased power in the legislature. These goals offer a road map to the incentives that shape their decision making.When the incentives don\u2019t align, members face problems. In these cases, re-election usually wins out, not least because it is a prerequisite for any other goal. Indeed, profiles in courage are so rare because they routinely cost legislators: Both Edmund Ross and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky lost their re-election bids.Many argue, however, that members should be willing to risk their jobs for the public good, especially on matters of conscience or morality. Historically, some politicians have done this \u2014 perhaps most famously Sam Houston of Texas, when he refused to support slavery\u2019s expansion or secession from the Union, which cost him first his Senate seat and then his governorship. But giving up one\u2019s job for a public policy is tougher than it appears. Consider whether you would give up your current job \u2014 and likely any future in your current career field \u2014 to pass one specific public policy.The tension between the public good and re-election also highlights the dual role of members of Congress: They are national policymakers but local representatives. When they are criticized for favoring re-election over the public good, it is often a criticism of putting local concerns over national ones.In practice, this local incentive tends to distort public policy toward parochialism and away from the national good. But this is neither irrational nor inherently bad. Even if you believe national interests should take priority, it doesn\u2019t follow that local interests should be ignored.Complicating this, most citizens do not have consistent opinions about when each role should take precedence. So asking members to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d often means asking them to risk their job for an important policy, but just this once. Even worse, determining \u201cthe right thing\u201d is largely subjective; in most cases, it just means \u201ca position I feel strongly about.\u201dThe third goal of members \u2014 increasing their power within Congress \u2014 is intrinsically linked to partisanship. Power in both the House and Senate is structured along party lines, with party caucuses holding gatekeeping authority over committee seats, chairmanships and chamber leadership positions. Members can parlay skills like fund-raising prowess or issue expertise into increased power, but in most cases they need to please party leaders to improve their standing.When all three of their incentives align, members have little to consider. If a position is strongly supported by constituents, pleases party leaders, and is judged by the member to be good public policy, then taking that position is a no-brainer.The most difficult choices members make concern supporting the party position on issues that cut against the preferences of their constituents or district interests. This may take the form of voting with the party on high-profile legislation. For example, the Democrats in 2010 passed the Affordable Care Act even though it was obvious the votes were going to cost them seats in Congress.Sometimes members judge that siding with the party and against their constituents actually best serves their district. If a member can gain a lot of favor with the leadership while mildly going against her district, his increased power will probably benefit the district in the long term.It\u2019s still not easy to go home and say, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t vote with you, but this is really going to line me up for a chairmanship, which will be great for us in five years.\u201d This is why developing trust with constituents is so important. If constituents believe the member has their best interests at heart, they will give him the benefit of the doubt.So critics asking Republican members to sharply break from President Trump are essentially asking them to choose a subjective vision of the public good over their re-election and party power incentives. Mr. Trump is reasonably popular in most Republican districts, and while Republican leaders have neither asked for nor expect members to refrain from all criticism of the president, they would likely frown upon, for instance, a member calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment.Conversely, departing members of Congress are freed from both the re-election and party power incentives; it\u2019s no surprise that Senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake have been among the most vocal critics of the administration.Neither trustees of the national good nor automaton reflectors of district opinion can wholly satisfy our desire for Congress to fulfill both of its roles. It is healthy and useful for citizens to urge representatives to prioritize the public good over other incentives. It is equally healthy for members to be skeptical when weighing such demands against competing concerns in their decision making.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As China Puts Pressure on Taiwan, Signs of a U.S. Pushback", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 As China ratchets up pressure on Taiwan, the self-governing island it claims as its territory, the United States is cautiously starting to push back.Concern about Taiwan\u2019s fate now appears to be building slowly in Washington, even as President Trump continues to seek China\u2019s help on other issues. Through his first year in office, Mr. Trump pressed Beijing to put more pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, with limited success. He has also sought to limit China\u2019s nearly $400 billion trade surplus with the United States, which has nonetheless continued to widen.Against that backdrop, Washington has recently begun moving gradually to reinforce its ties to Taiwan, a vigorous democracy facing an increasingly authoritarian government in Beijing.Bills have been introduced in Congress to promote visits to Taiwan by warships and by civilian officials. A small gathering of defense contractors is planned for May to discuss Taiwan\u2019s production of parts for weapons assembled in the United States. And in June, an American institute that functions as an informal diplomatic channel plans to open an elegant new complex in Taiwan\u2019s capital.\u201cIt looks like the Trump administration is playing the Taiwan card for whatever purpose \u2014 to put pressure or to seek concessions,\u201d said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Chinese officials are showing signs of annoyance, and raising accusations that the United States is interfering in what Beijing considers one of its redline issues. \u201cIt is horrible that the present situation of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will probably be turbulent,\u201d said a commentary earlier this month on Huaxia, a Beijing-controlled news service on Taiwan issues.Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the second-ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Forces Committee after Senator John McCain of Arizona, is in Taiwan this week, leading a large delegation of House and Senate committee members and staff.They have been meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen and her senior ministers, a dialogue likely to offend Beijing officials. In an emailed reply to questions, Senator Inhofe endorsed continued American support for Taiwan, including a bill pending in the Senate that would encourage senior administration officials to visit the island. The bill has already passed the House.\u201cWith China becoming more aggressive and intent on expanding its influence globally, the United States-Taiwan security relationship is now more important than ever,\u201d the senator said. \u201cBy ensuring they have the ability to defend themselves, Taiwan will continue to be an important part of promoting regional stability.\u201dTwo events coming up in Taiwan may further annoy Beijing.One is a luncheon and meeting in southern Taiwan in early May for a handful of executives from American military contractors and their Taiwanese counterparts. They will discuss a proposal by President Tsai to develop Taiwan\u2019s components industry by selling more parts to military contractors, said Rupert Hammond-Chambers, the president of the United States-Taiwan Business Council, the host of the event.The development was initially reported by Taiwanese, mainland Chinese and Hong Kong news media as a decision to move a big annual military contracting conference from the United States to Taiwan, potentially triggering a further chasm between Beijing and the United States. But the business council, which has organized the much larger event since its inception 16 years ago, has consistently held it in the United States and plans to keep doing so, Mr. Hammond-Chambers said.The other event that could trigger Sino-American disagreement is expected in mid-June. That is when the American Institute in Taiwan is scheduled to open a new complex of elegantly designed buildings in Taipei, the capital, consolidating operations that are currently scattered among several dilapidated sites around the city. The institute is staffed mainly by State Department employees and local workers.The first Bush administration, the Clinton administration and the Obama administration all sent cabinet officials to Taipei at various times. But they chose the United States trade representative, the secretary of transportation and the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, rather than higher-profile officials like the secretary of state or the secretary of defense.In each case, Beijing complained that the visits happened at all. Global Times, a nationalistic, Beijing-controlled newspaper, said earlier this month, \u201cIf any U.S. high-level official pays an official visit to Taiwan, Beijing will treat it as severe provocation and adopt all possible countermeasures, including uniting Taiwan by military force.\u201dBut Beijing officials have been biding their time about confronting Taiwan too publicly this year as they await the results of Taipei\u2019s mayoral election in November. The race is likely to be closely contested by the Nationalist Party, which favors a more cooperative relationship with the mainland, and which Beijing officials are eager to see back in power in Taiwan.Chris Horton contributed reporting from Taipei.

{"Headline": "From Oil to Solar: Saudi Arabia Plots a Shift to Renewables", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Life in Saudi Arabia has long been defined by the oil that flows from the kingdom. Over decades, the vast wealth it pumped out paid not just for gleaming towers and shopping malls but also for a government sector that employs a majority of working Saudis.Now, Saudi Arabia is trying to tie its future to another natural resource it has in abundance: sunlight.The world\u2019s largest oil exporter is embarking, under Prince Mohammed bin Salman, on an ambitious effort to diversify its economy and reinvigorate growth, in part by plowing money into renewable energy. The Saudi government wants not just to reshape its energy mix at home but also to emerge as a global force in clean power.Reaching that goal is a big if. But the strategy is finally making progress after fits and starts.Riyadh on Monday tapped ACWA Power, a Saudi energy company, to build a solar farm that would generate enough electricity to power around 40,000 homes. The project will cost $300 million and create hundreds of jobs, according to Turki al-Shehri, head of the kingdom\u2019s renewable energy program.By the end of the year, Saudi Arabia aims to invest up to $7 billion to develop seven new solar plants and a big wind farm. The country hopes that renewables, which now represent a negligible amount of the energy it uses, will be able to provide as much as 10 percent of its power generation by the end of 2023.\u201cAll the big developers are watching Saudi,\u201d said Jenny Chase, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a market research firm.\u201cThe country has made grand plans and pronouncements, but various bodies within it have failed to agree on the new way forward,\u201d Ms. Chase added. She referred to the agreement as \u201cthe first step in creating what is widely expected to be a major market.\u201dSaudi Arabia has talked a big game when it comes to renewables. It adopted ambitious targets for green power several years ago, but no major projects were carried out, and little changed. That is not unusual.The country\u2019s biggest solar farm in operation covers a parking lot of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, here in Dhahran. Lying just a couple of miles from a fenced-off area honoring the country\u2019s first commercially viable oil well, it generates enough power for a nearby office block.Still, the experiment with solar power has been an important catalyst, and the company built a team of experts in renewable power. The experience helped Saudi Arabia focus on conventional solar panels over another system, known as concentrated solar, in which mirrors focus sunlight to create heat.Mr. Shehri, who had worked at Aramco before leading the kingdom\u2019s renewables program, said he faced an \u201cextremely challenging\u201d task. Meeting Saudi Arabia\u2019s targets would require contracts for a series of new facilities to be awarded by the end of 2020. \u201cThe only way this was possible,\u201d he said, \u201cwas because we have done previous work.\u201dSaudi Arabia, with its vast oil resources, would seem an unlikely champion for renewables. But the country\u2019s location and climate mean it has plenty of promising sites for solar and wind farms.The costs of installing and operating those two technologies have fallen drastically around the world in recent years. That means that even in a country where oil is plentiful, renewables beckon as a cheap, and clean, alternative to traditional fossil fuels.For the project announced on Monday, Riyadh received bids for the solar farm, which will be built in Sakaka, in northern Saudi Arabia, that rivaled the lowest ever submitted at auctions anywhere. At 2 to 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, a wholesale measure of electricity, solar power here would be below the cost of fossil fuel-generated electricity, Mr. Shehri said.\u201cJust look at the prices,\u201d Ms. Chase said. \u201cThat is why they are doing it.\u201dA big push into wind and solar power would also have other benefits, notably allowing Saudi Arabia to sell more of its oil.Selling oil internationally is central to funding the Saudi budget. The terms of the Sakaka project\u2019s auction required that developers pay the upfront cost of the solar farm, in return for payments for the power they supply to the grid. That would allow Saudi Arabia to continue focusing on producing and exporting oil while it makes the shift to cleaner power.In the 1920s, the area surrounding the Aramco offices here was little more than a series of rocky hills. But then a team of American geologists discovered crude, and everything changed.Dhahran is now home to the headquarters of one of the world\u2019s most advanced and prolific energy companies, with a series of research laboratories, training centers and even a golf course on site. What had been a scattering of small towns is now a major metropolitan area housing around four million people.A major plank of the crown prince\u2019s plan to transform the Saudi economy involves finding jobs for young people. Attracting investment into what is essentially a nonexistent sector in the kingdom, Mr. Shehri said, would mean \u201ccreating jobs, creating manufacturing.\u201dStill, despite the ambitious goals and positive language, the process by which Saudi Arabia has looked to expand its wind and solar capacity has raised concerns.Analysts have pointed in particular to how Saudi leaders have chosen their preferred companies. When Riyadh produced a short list of two firms for the Sakaka project this month, it passed over one that had presented a lower bid than the finalists, leaving some experts worried about the transparency of the bidding process.Local-supplier requirements might also deter some bidders. Mr. Shehri insisted that companies interested in the Sakaka project agree to spend 30 percent of the costs on domestic suppliers and expected that proportion to rise in subsequent bidding rounds. Many companies may find it difficult to justify building factories in Saudi Arabia just to construct one power plant.The Saudi market\u2019s sheer size, however, means it merits the attention of the world\u2019s renewable energy companies. Paddy Padmanathan, the chief executive of ACWA Power, which also has other energy projects in the region, predicted in an interview last month that once the country\u2019s energy authorities became comfortable with renewables, they would ramp up their goals for wind and solar power production.\u201cMost of what they will procure going forward, I am convinced, will be renewables,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of homes a new solar farm in Saudi Arabia would be able to power. The figure is around 40,000, not up to 200,000. The error was repeated in a capsule summary.Advertisement"}

The drop ended a streak of eight straight weeks with bullish sentiment above its historical average of 38.5 percent.It began the year at nearly 60 percent, its highest level since 2010.The contextThe survey has proved to be a good contrarian indicator.

{"Headline": "Over 40 Should Face Trial for South Sudan Atrocities, U.N. Team Says", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 More than 40 senior military officers and officials in South Sudan should be prosecuted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, a United Nations commission said on Friday, citing harrowing witness testimony and thousands of documents tying them to mass atrocities in the country\u2019s four-year civil war.Government and opposition forces had systematically butchered men, women and children, slitting throats, gouging out eyes, castrating and mutilating men and gang raping men and women on a massive scale, the commission said in a report it intends to submit next week to the Human Rights Council in Geneva.\u201cHolding those in charge in South Sudan accountable for the intentional suffering they inflict on their own people is crucial to stemming this humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d said Andrew Clapham, a member of the commission and an international law expert.Fighting has forced more than four million people, one-third of the country\u2019s population, to flee their homes, and has disrupted the economy of what was already one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, leaving millions suffering severe malnutrition and in some areas close to starvation. \u201cSouth Sudan is a young country tragically devouring itself,\u201d the commission observed.\u201cThere is a clear pattern of ethnic persecution, for the most part by government forces, who should be pursued for crimes against humanity,\u201d Mr. Clapham said.The commission called on the African Union to move immediately to set up a hybrid court combining international and South Sudanese judges, in line with a peace deal it struck with South Sudan in 2015.\u201cUltimately this is the only way to stop the rampant devastation of millions of human lives by South Sudan\u2019s leaders,\u201d said Yasmin Sooka, a South African jurist and the panel\u2019s chairwoman.Sexual violence had become endemic in the latest conflict, the commission said. Among accounts it accumulated was one from a South Sudanese man who said he had been hiding in the bush and returned home to find that government soldiers had gouged out the eyes of his wife with spears when she tried to stop them from raping their 17-year-old daughter. Soldiers had also gang-raped his mother and castrated and beheaded his father, he said.Another witness told investigators that opposition soldiers had shot and killed his father, raped and killed his mother, and killed all of his brothers and sisters, then castrated him with a knife. He believed they had been attacked because they belonged to the same Dinka ethnic group as South Sudan\u2019s president and his father was loyal to the government.Sexual violence was used not only to intimidate and humiliate victims, and to force them to flee their homes, but also as a currency of war, with soldiers encouraged to rape in lieu of being paid, Mr. Clapham said. Children are thought to make up a quarter of the victims of sexual violence, the commission said.Thousands of children, some as young as 12, were recruited to serve as soldiers, the commission found \u2014 some were abducted outside their homes; others volunteered to protect themselves and their families. The panel said children had been forced to kill civilians and loot and had faced corporal punishment if they disobeyed.The commission collected 230 witness statements and 58,000 documents. It said that examining only part of this evidence had helped it identify 38 high-ranking military officers and three state governors responsible for serious rights violations and international crimes.It will submit a confidential dossier containing those names to the Human Rights Council when it presents the report in March. These individuals \u201cshould face prosecution,\u201d the commission said.As investigators acquired more information, other names could be put forward for prosecutors to investigate. \u201cIt\u2019s not a closed list,\u201d Mr. Clapham told reporters in Geneva.\u201cThe time is up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue now is to get the South Sudanese and the African Union to agree on this quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Bitcoin Reveals About Financial Markets", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe spectacular increase and recent plunge in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have raised concerns that the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble will cause financial markets to crash. They probably won\u2019t, but the Bitcoin bubble should finally destroy our faith in the efficiency of markets.Since the 1970s, economic policy has been based on the idea that financial market prices reflect all the information relevant to the value of any asset. If this is true, market prices are the best estimates of the value of any investment and financial markets should be relied on to allocate capital investment.The hypothesis survived the absurdities of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well as the meltdown in derivative markets that led to the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. Although the hypothesis should have been refuted by those disasters, it lived on, if only in zombie form.But at least each of those earlier bubbles began with a plausible premise. The rise of the internet has transformed our lives and given rise to some very profitable companies, such as Amazon and Google. Even though it was obvious that most 1990s dot-coms would fail, it was easy to make a case for any of them individually.As for the derivative assets that gave us the global financial crisis, they were viewed favorably in light of a widely held theory, known as the \u201cgreat moderation,\u201d that suggested that major economic crises were a thing of the past, thanks to certain systemic changes in the way developed nations ran their economies. The theory was backed by leading economists and central bankers. Asset-backed derivatives were, ultimately, a bet on the great moderation.The contrast with Bitcoin is stark. The Bitcoin bubble rests on no plausible premise. When Bitcoin was created about a decade ago, the underlying idea was that it would displace existing currencies for transactions of all kinds. But by the time the Bitcoin bubble took off last year, it was obvious that this would not happen. Only a handful of legitimate merchants ever accepted Bitcoin. And as the Bitcoin bubble drove up transactions charges and waiting times, even this handful walked away.For a while, Bitcoin was used for transactions that people wanted to keep secret from government authorities, like drug deals. It soon became apparent, however, that if authorities wanted to track these transactions, they could. For instance, Silk Road, the first major online drug market, which made use of Bitcoin, was shut down by the F.B.I. in 2013.Hardly anyone now suggests that Bitcoin has value as a currency. Rather, the new claim is that Bitcoin is a \u201cstore of value\u201d and that its price reflects its inherent scarcity. (By design, no more than 21 million Bitcoins can be created.)Most economists, including me, dismiss this claim. And if the claim is false, Bitcoin\u2019s value is obviously another deadly strike against the efficient market hypothesis.Consider: If Bitcoin is a \u201cstore of value,\u201d then asset prices are entirely arbitrary. As the proliferation of cryptocurrencies has shown, nothing is easier than creating a scarce asset. The same argument would apply to any existing financial assets. Any stock in the S & P 500 could be priced not in terms of future earnings prospects but on the basis that people choose to value it highly.Suppose, more plausibly, that Bitcoin has no underlying value and will eventually become worthless. According to the efficient market hypothesis, financial markets will correctly estimate the true value of Bitcoin and will drive the price to zero immediately.But that hasn\u2019t happened either. Until recently, it wasn\u2019t even possible because the Bitcoin markets were themselves as opaque as the currency.Now it is possible: Futures trading for Bitcoin on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has been going on since December. But Bitcoin prices rose after the creation of futures trading and began their sharp decline only when governments took measures to limit speculation.Current futures contracts in Bitcoin extend as far as June of this year. According to those contract prices, the market expects Bitcoin to retain its value well into the future.Whatever happens to Bitcoin, we must not lose sight of a more fundamental \u2014 and more worrisome \u2014 development: A financial product with a purely arbitrary value has been successfully introduced in the world\u2019s most sophisticated financial markets.Bitcoin probably won\u2019t bring financial markets crashing down. But it shows that regulators need to cut those markets down to size.John Quiggin is an economist at the University of Queensland in Australia and the author of \u201cZombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk Among Us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "If a Law Bars Asking Your Past Salary, Does It Help or Hurt?", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLaws prohibiting employers from asking job candidates about their past compensation before making a salary offer are gaining momentum, aimed at reducing pay disparities and other obstacles confronting women and minorities.The premise is simple: Judging an applicant\u2019s worth from his or her previous salary can perpetuate pay gaps that arise from discrimination \u2014 or make it hard to get in the door at all.Laws banning the practice have taken effect in New York City, Delaware and California in recent months. But the way some researchers see it, such laws are likely to be ineffective or even backfire. For example, employers who can\u2019t ask about prior salary might assume that a female candidate would accept less money than a man, because women make less on average.\u201cIt seems like the general social impulse is, \u2018We don\u2019t like employers using particular information, so we\u2019ll tell them they can\u2019t use it any more and assume that\u2019s the end of the conversation,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Doleac, an economist at the University of Virginia. \u201cBut if they cared enough about it to ask it to begin with, they probably care about it enough to try to guess.\u201dBut the consequences may not be as clear when it comes to salary history. Some academic evidence suggests that the new laws may help women in certain circumstances.To anticipate the effects of such laws, it\u2019s worth exploring why employers ask about a candidate\u2019s salary history in the first place. Here are a few reasons.If employers know what a candidate previously made, they effectively know how little that person will accept.\u201cOn one level, I\u2019d like to pay people the least amount of money to get the most amount of benefit from that person,\u201d said Adam Klein of the employment law firm Outten & Golden, who has represented many workers in discrimination cases.\u201cUnder that market-efficiency construct, why wouldn\u2019t you pay women less?\u201d Mr. Klein said, channeling a hypothetical employer who can ask lower-paid women about their salaries. \u201cIt makes business sense.\u201dSeveral economists said a ban on questions about salary history would probably prompt such employers to engage in what\u2019s known as statistical discrimination \u2014 relying on group averages in place of information they were previously able to obtain about an individual.(Alternatively, employers may try to get the information in slightly less direct ways, like asking candidates about their minimum salary expectation, Mr. Klein said.)In doing so, employers will be further enabled by another feature of the recent salary history laws: They typically allow job applicants to disclose their previous salary voluntarily. As a result, some employers may feel comfortable making lowball offers to women, because they assume applicants will speak up if they make significantly more than the employer\u2019s offer. Those who don\u2019t speak up will be deemed to have made less.\u201cBy adding that hoop \u2014 putting them in a position where they have to negotiate more \u2014 I imagine it widening the gender gap,\u201d Ms. Doleac said.By asking what the candidate currently makes and paying the same or slightly more, an employer may simply want to ensure that an offer is accepted and that the new hire is satisfied \u2014 but may be oblivious to the risk of perpetuating pay disparities.\u201cWhat we are seeing is the myth of the sneaky employer,\u201d said Andrew Hoan, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce.\u201cIn Brooklyn, a high percentage of all firms in the borough are 50-person firms or less,\u201d Mr. Hoan added. \u201cThe C.E.O. is the person making the offer. Frankly, he or she has no time to go around and create comparable stats. All this stuff they\u2019re doing now is simply streamlining the process.\u201dWhere this is true, banning salary-history questions could help substantially, advocates say.\u201cIn companies that are treating people the same, and not thinking about how their behavior might differentially harm people, this type of law raises awareness of it,\u201d said Joelle Emerson, the founder and chief executive of Paradigm, a firm that advises employers on promoting diversity. \u201cIt forces companies to sit down and say: \u2018O.K., why were we doing this before? How should we set compensation now that we don\u2019t do it this way?\u2019\u201dAt Dime Community Bank, which employs about 400 people at 29 branches in the New York City area, the standard job application asked candidates for their salary history until shortly before the New York ban took effect in October.Angela Blum-Finlay, the bank\u2019s head of human resources, said that she had already begun de-emphasizing salary history in determining compensation beforehand, and that she was asking hiring managers to use competitive benchmarks for different positions instead.Ms. Finlay said that it was counterproductive for employers to try to squeeze candidates on compensation, especially in a tight labor market.\u201cWe are, at Dime, trying to be an employer of choice, a place people want to come,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I lowball you coming in, I\u2019m not going to make you feel valued.\u201dStandard economic theory holds that workers are paid in line with their productivity, so a higher salary should imply a better worker.In effect, employers may also be using salary on the front end of the hiring process \u2014 to help determine whom they want to interview \u2014 rather than solely on the back end, when preparing an offer.But restrictions on asking for salary information can play out very differently in those situations. When employers want to know how little money a worker will accept, and the law prevents them from asking, they may rely on cruder information, like stereotypes.But when employers want to know how good a worker is, they have several alternatives to considering salary history, many of them more revealing. They can, for example, interview the candidate, read letters of recommendation, and talk to former employers and co-workers.During a roughly two-week period in 2014, half the employers in the experiment were no longer able to view the wage history of prospective workers, as they had in the past, while the other half could continue to see workers\u2019 wage history.Compared with employers who had the wage information, those without it ended up interviewing and hiring workers who, on average, had made significantly less money in the past. When employers could no longer consult salary history, they expanded the pool of workers they considered and went to greater lengths to evaluate them.\u201cYou\u2019re widening the top of the hiring funnel,\u201d Mr. Barach said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t allow you to as easily throw people away.\u201dHe and Mr. Horton acknowledged that because this approach required spending more time collecting information, employers might not find it worthwhile when filling a low-skilled or entry-level job. In those cases, they might retreat to stereotypes involving gender or race, as other economists have suggested.But \u201cfor some range of jobs,\u201d Mr. Barach said, \u201cmore upfront costs could have benefits down the road. If you actually talk to someone, interview them, it will allow you to locate a high-quality candidate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Iranian Photographer\u2019s Unflinching Look at His Country\u2019s Revolution", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKaveh Kazemi's images of the Iranian revolution and its aftermath reveal the country's transition from a different era, and a contrast with its social upheaval today.That picture, from 1979, captured the end of an era. Soon, Iran\u2019s parliament passed a law making the Islamic veil compulsory for all women, even visiting dignitaries and tourists. The country remains one of the few in the world to ask people to dress according to the state\u2019s wishes.Four decades later, some women have again taken to the streets, removing their veils in protest. Feb. 11 is the 39th anniversary of the revolution that ousted the Shah and led to the Islamic republic\u2019s creation. But instead of celebration, there is general dissatisfaction, as well as tensions over the economy and the political system. Nationwide protests that started in December lasted more than a week, leaving 25 people dead and nearly 5,000 detained.With cameras everywhere and an unending torrent of images on social media, we forget how photography documents history. In Iran, where the state has long tried to impose its own versions of the truth, Mr. Kazemi\u2019s work has aged particularly well. His images of the revolution, its aftermath and the war with Iraq have now been published in \u201cRevolutionaries, the First Decade,\u201d which shows that while today there is upheaval in Iran, and opponents abroad hail it as the start of a new revolution, it\u2019s still very far from those early tumultuous years.His book has been as successful as a photo book can be in Iran, perhaps because it offers an alternative \u2014 and more realistic \u2014 narrative of the events leading to the 1979 revolution and its aftermath. Over the decades, the Iranian state has smoothed over the early era\u2019s rawness, chaos and pain. Instead, state media and history books now portray it by relying on images of Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s return from exile, masses cheering and a new, Islamic administration taking hold.  That one objectionable picture is of a banner showing the late founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, with a protester\u2019s fist in front of it. \u201cI never understood what the issue was with that particular image,\u201d said Mr. Kazemi. The book shows many taboo topics, like a sequence of a post-revolution firefight between competing groups. Years of bloody infighting have long been ignored by the state media\u2019s narrative of Iran\u2019s visual contemporary history, with those in power preferring to pretend \u2014 with images at least \u2014 that they led the revolutionary vanguard from the start. His images show looting, burning and chaos during the revolution. During the war with Iraq, Mr. Kazemi accompanied soldiers to the front to show the agony of combat, rather than jubilant images of victorious soldiers that the state media preferred. He found people waiting for fuel in long ration lines, and went to houses destroyed by Iraqi missiles. He also followed protests where women refused to wear the Islamic veil, while men smile arrogantly at them. Official news media rarely show images of the transition years before the veil became compulsory, going as far as editing out those women without scarves for their archives. Mr. Kazemi waited decades before he could publish these pictures. \u201cI did not want to compromise on the images I wanted to show and frankly, I thought for many years that getting a permit to publish such a book was a near-impossible dream,\u201d he said. The fact that he could publish his straightforward book now is a sign that there has been a change of view among some in the Iranian leadership. \u201cSomehow some reforms are working,\u201d he said, \u201cand those in power are much more realistic nowadays.\u201dHis black and white images also show how long ago the revolution occurred: The anti-American slogans and murals feel dated, as do the mustaches, hippie pants and now-classic American cars. Iranian society has changed and modernized beyond recognition, but what remains a fixture are the ruling clerics with their turbans and cloaks. Mr. Kazemi has witnessed it all. The book\u2019s final pages are devoted to the death of Ayatollah Khomeini, a moment when many thought the Islamic republic would soon end. He showed the millions who flocked to his funeral, an event that stretched over several days of public mourning. After the funeral, a new leader was elected, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is still in power.\u201cFor me, photography is best at its simplest and purest form, looking at things directly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just clicking the shutter, you also have to convey a message.\u201d What message exactly? \u201cTo put in perspective what you are witnessing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Inflation has remained sluggish for nearly a decade, and Mr. Powell said the Fed \u201cwill continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy\u201d and allowing inflation to tick up toward the Fed\u2019s target of a 2 percent annual pace.Investors widely expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate in March, into a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, and most expect another quarter point increase in June.Some Wall Street analysts said that Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony increased the chances that the Fed would continue with quarterly rate hikes in the second half of the year.\u201cWe are naturally more confident in our standing call for four hikes this year and another four next year,\u201d said Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.But the Fed has emphasized that stronger growth is necessary to justify three rate hikes this year. Fed officials have also said growth will not prompt the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate more quickly unless it increases inflationary pressures.Randal K. Quarles, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, said Monday that the tax cuts could increase the country\u2019s economic capacity, allowing faster growth without faster inflation. His remarks suggested the Fed is willing to wait and see what happens.\u201cI will be carefully watching indicators of economic activity and inflation and assessing the degree to which activity appears to be pushing up against the constraints of the economy, as opposed to being a reflection of the expansion of those constraints and the growth of the potential output of the economy,\u201d Mr. Quarles said.Lawmakers grilled Mr. Powell on Tuesday on many subjects. House Republicans, who pressed for Mr. Trump to put a Republican in charge of the central bank, asked Mr. Powell how he would respond to changes made after the 2008 financial crisis, including stronger financial regulations and a new approach to managing interest rates.Democrats, nervous about the new leadership, pressed Mr. Powell for assurances that the Fed would remain committed to supporting job growth and that it would enforce laws aimed at reducing discrimination by financial institutions.Both sides sought Mr. Powell\u2019s affirmation for their views about the economic effect of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that took effect in January.Mr. Powell began his remarks by commending Ms. Yellen on her tenure and calling for continuity with her policies. But the differences between Mr. Powell, a former investment banker, and his predecessor, a labor economist, showed through. Unlike Ms. Yellen, Mr. Powell shied away from questions about economic inequality, and he spoke more freely about financial regulation.Mr. Powell reaffirmed to House members that the Fed intends to loosen some limits on banks. One change could reduce capital requirements for some large banks, allowing them to rely more heavily on borrowed money.The goal of the changes is to reduce the burden of regulation \u201cwithout losing any safety and soundness,\u201d Mr. Powell said. He also said the Fed plans to reduce regulation of smaller banks.He added the Fed must be alert to both the buildup of financial imbalances and inflation, but that neither risk appeared high at the moment.\u201cThere\u2019s always a risk of a recession at any point in time, but I don\u2019t see it as at all high at the moment,\u201d Mr. Powell added. \u201cI would expect the next two years on the current path to be good years for the economy.\u201dStocks took a tumble this month as investors began to chew on the possibility of faster rate hikes. Mr. Powell dismissed the turbulence, saying the Fed saw no evidence that it was \u201cweighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market and inflation.\u201dThe losses on Tuesday were more modest. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 lost 1.27 percent, closing at 2,744.28.Mr. Powell has taken the helm of the central bank as the economy is nearing the end of its ninth year of expansion. The Fed has been steadily raising its benchmark rate back to a more normal level after cutting it nearly to zero to stimulate lending in response to the financial crisis.Those rate hikes are intended to keep the economy from running too hot, while also giving the Fed the capacity to fight a future recession by once again cutting interest rates.Although a strong economy and low unemployment typically drive up inflation, it has remained puzzlingly low in recent years. Mr. Powell acknowledged the trend, but said that he believed sluggish price increases were due in part to temporary factors and that inflation would gradually rise this year.He noted, however, that some indicators suggest the labor market still has room for improvement, including the modest pace of wage growth. The share of working-age adults who are not working also remains significantly higher than before the recession; most of those people are not counted in the unemployment rate because they are not actively seeking work.Investors are watching carefully for any indication that inflation could lift off faster than they expected \u2014 a sign that the Fed might have to raise rates more quickly than it planned and risk choking off economic growth.On Monday, Mr. Quarles was cautiously optimistic that faster economic growth is likely. \u201cThere are indications that we have a sustainably stronger economy,\u201d Mr. Quarles said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too early to call that as happening, but there are clear indications that it could be happening.\u201dMr. Powell, a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors who was sworn in as chairman this month, will testify again on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Officials Say Economy Is Ready for Higher Rates", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Robust economic growth has increased the confidence of Federal Reserve officials that the economy is ready for higher interest rates, according to an official account of the central bank\u2019s most recent policymaking meeting in late January.The Fed did not raise its benchmark interest rate at the meeting on Jan. 30 and 31, but the account reinforced investor expectations the Fed would raise rates at its next meeting in March.The account said Fed officials have upgraded their economic outlooks since the beginning of the year and listed three main reasons: The strength of recent economic data, accommodative financial conditions and the expected impact of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that took effect in January.The Fed is seeking to raise rates gradually to maintain control of inflation without impeding an economic expansion that is nearing the end of its ninth year, one of the longest stretches of continuous economic growth in American history.So far, however, Fed officials have treated the stronger economic news as a reason to carry out their plans for gradual rate hikes, rather than as a reason to start raising rates more quickly. Most Fed officials predicted in December the Fed would raise rates three times in 2018, as it did last year.\u201cIf the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe further increases in interest rates will be appropriate this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year\u2019s,\u201d Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said this month.The meeting account said the addition of the word \u201cfurther\u201d in that statement reflected the increased confidence among officials that the Fed would continue raising rates.Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the Fed\u2019s increased confidence was likely to translate eventually into more interest rate increases than the three Fed officials predicted.\u201cWe think increased confidence in the need for further hikes will accompany a perceived need for more than three hikes among a growing portion of the committee,\u201d he wrote Wednesday.And the minutes did suggest the Fed might eventually raise rates to a level higher than financial markets presently anticipate. Fed officials predicted in December that the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate would come to rest around 2.8 percent, well below its precrisis level. The rate is currently in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent.At the January meeting, some Fed officials raised the possibility that the strength of economic growth might raise that ceiling. The Fed would welcome such a development, because it would preserve more room to reduce rates in future downturns.The persistent question mark is inflation. The Fed aims to keep prices rising at an annual rate of 2 percent, but it has consistently fallen short of that goal since the end of the last recession in 2009.The minutes said the Fed has gained some confidence in its prediction that inflation will rise toward 2 percent. The economy continues to gain strength, and the minutes said a decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar was also likely to put upward pressure on inflation. Lower exchange rates translate into higher prices for imported goods.But the Fed has made the same predictions repeatedly, without success, and the minutes said the Fed intends to raise rates slowly as it continues to watch inflation closely. Some officials argue that the Fed should stop raising rates until inflation shows clear signs of revival.The Fed has good reason for its uncertainty about inflation: It lacks a convincing explanation of what causes inflation, or a model that accurately predicts future inflation.In a presentation at the January meeting, economists on the Fed\u2019s staff told policymakers that the most popular explanations had significant flaws. One class of theories says inflation is produced by excess demand for available resources. This suggests inflation should rise as growth approaches its natural speed limit, a pattern that can be seen in some historical data but is difficult to find in recent decades. Another class of theories argues, with some circularity, that inflation is determined by expectations about inflation. It is not clear, however, how those expectations are formed.The account said that \u201calmost all\u201d Fed officials responded by expressing a continued commitment to both theories. They said they intended to raise interest rates as the economy gains strength, and to seek to maintain public confidence in the 2 percent inflation target.The January meeting was the final meeting for Janet L. Yellen, who concluded her four-year term as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman in early February. Her successor, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to make his public debut when he testifies before House and Senate committees next week.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Two Cities, Two Countries, Common Ground", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the BorderResidents of this town of 20,000 souls wanted me to see the Nogales they see: a place steeped in layers of rich history and culture, which maintains a uniquely special relationship with its namesake and sister city across the border, Nogales, Sonora. And indeed, in the two Nogaleses \u2014 or Ambos Nogales, as locals refer to them \u2014 I found the most quintessential of all the border cities.I love the concept of twin cities on the border. Maybe it\u2019s because I grew up in one, or because I\u2019m a twin. I love the idea of two worlds that coexist and intermingle, and in fact, depend on each other for survival.The descendant of families that were already living in the Texas border region when the international boundary was drawn up in 1848, I grew up almost in two countries, spending Sundays across the border immersed in the Mexican universe of my abuelitos and t\u00edas and primos. We didn\u2019t talk about it like we were visiting another country \u2014 we went to el otro lado, the other side. I liked that my sisters and I could choose what we loved about each of our two upbringings, and creatively mix languages and systems of meaning.There are 16 sets of sister cities that line the 1,950-mile United States-Mexico border, and as a journalist who has focused on the region, I\u2019ve experienced all but two of them. While I\u2019d been in Nogales before to report on immigration and the border wall, what I learned on this visit is that calling Ambos Nogales \u201cone town in two countries\u201d may be a slight exaggeration, but it\u2019s a very apt metaphor. And this is what makes it a fascinating place to visit.That explanation is more or less true.In 1841, when the territory was still part of Mexico, a family by the last name of El\u00edas received a land grant from the government it established as Los Nogales de El\u00edas, a name derived from the walnut trees that blanketed what today is known as the Santa Cruz River Valley.The Spaniards had utilized that mountain pass during the previous two centuries when they explored the Pimer\u00eda Alta, as northern Sonora and southern Arizona were known, west to California, and it\u2019s believed indigenous groups had traveled the same path for millenniums. Nogales, then, has formed part of an important northern migratory route far before the United States became concerned with border walls.The land was not part of the original territory gained by the Americans at the end of the Mexican War, but the United States government acquired it in 1853, through the Gadsden Purchase, to build the southern transcontinental railway line. Foreseeing the boon in international commerce that intersecting railroads could bring, two Russian brothers named Jacob and Isaac Isaacson set up a trading post in 1880, which was renamed Nogales by the U.S. Postal Service soon thereafter.To support the new trade, a community emerged on the Mexican side of the line that people also referred to as Nogales. Unlike the Texas border, however, where the boundary is defined by the Rio Grande, Arizona\u2019s is a land border, and in Nogales, the border was an unobstructed street called International, half of which technically lay in one country, half in another. Around it, a seemingly singular town spread north and south.But managing an international division, it turned out, wasn\u2019t simple. The first fence on the United States-Mexico border went up here \u2014 after the Mexican government called for it.The United States government had grown wary after the Mexican Revolution began in 1910, and relations had tensed as each side accused the other of banditry and incursions. The United States set up a military camp in Nogales, Ariz., and General John J. Pershing was dispatched to chase after the Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa. The Sonora governor put up an 11-wire fence, which got torn down four months later.In 1918, after the two cities went to war for a day because an American guard shot a Mexican citizen at the border crossing, authorities on both sides agreed to construct a permanent chain-link fence between them.But as life resumed, the fence became a technicality, not a reflection of how people related across the line. During Prohibition, Mexicans built saloons that straddled the border, so that patrons could drink so long as they were on the correct side of the building.Ms. Maitrejean remembers how this tight-knit existence endured as she was growing up. In the 1950s, a Mexican shop on International Street would put up a huge blackboard to transmit the World Series as nogalenses watched the games excitedly from the United States side. On Cinco de Mayo, city leaders would build a platform over the fence and crowned a binational queen as a joint parade marched across the border.Eventually, migration from other parts of Mexico grew through the area, and stricter United States enforcement followed. \u201cThe border crossing was getting more difficult,\u201d said Ms. Maitrejean, \u201cand, of course, once they put up our horrible Vietnam landing-mat fence in the \u201990s, that was really the end.\u201dMade of 10-foot panels of corrugated steel that the United States Army had used to land helicopters in the Vietnam War, that was the fence that locals most resented, for it blocked the view they had always had to the other side. Then in 2011, the federal government replaced it with a rust-colored steel bollard fence, encased in cement footing with four-inch slats between the bars. Now, the two Nogaleses could see each other again, somewhat. Soon, families that didn\u2019t have the right paperwork to cross started coming to either side on weekends to catch up with each other across the bollards.When they spot some of the families reaching between steel bars to hug each other, or holding up a newborn baby for their relatives on the other side to meet, she said, \u201cwomen will frequently cry.\u201dDriving south the 60 miles from Tucson, where the closest commercial airport is, the highway rises thousands of feet as the desert scrublands of the lower Sonoran desert give way to hilly terrain ringed by the Santa Rita, San Cayetano and Tumacacori mountains.The region nurtures some of the best bird-watching in North America and an abundance of wildlife, such as javelinas, rattlesnakes and hawks. There are many activities in the region that can be paired with a visit to the two Nogaleses, including hunting for deer and mountain lion; fishing at Pe\u00f1a Blanca Lake; wine tasting and hiking in Patagonia and Sonoita; and golfing in Tubac, Kino Springs or Rio Rico.But in my view, as a lifelong student of the border, the cultural treasure is Nogales itself.Here, the kind of tourism you\u2019re doing changes, and you train your eye and ear to catch things you wouldn\u2019t see or hear in other parts of the country. In Nogales, I heard perfectly bilingual speakers mix Spanish and English more as an artful form of expression than a linguistic deficiency (\u201cle pide a la se\u00f1orita que nos traiga un saut\u00e9ed spinach?\u201d).And there\u2019s more diversity in the city than American and Mexican, he said. \u201cThis community\u2019s got French, it\u2019s got Irish in it, it\u2019s got Greek in it, and they\u2019re on both sides of the border.\u201dEconomically, Nogales today still thrives on international commerce. It depends on the logistics and transportation services industry that supports maquiladoras in Sonora and on the import of produce, which makes up half of the Mexican vegetables and fruits consumed by Americans.It also relies heavily on Mexican consumers \u2014 Nogales, Sonora, has 450,000 residents to its 20,000 \u2014 and those shoppers are coming over less and less. Mr. Urman said annual pedestrian crossings into Nogales, Ariz., have dropped to 2.7 million from 7.7 million in the past 10 years.John Doyle, the mayor, said various factors have led to the decline, including the devaluation of the Mexican peso and increased wait times at the ports of entry because of heightened border security. Still, he said, President Donald Trump\u2019s talk of building a longer and heavier border wall is of less concern to him and the mayor of Nogales, Sonora, than his roiling against international trade.\u201cWe\u2019re more worried about where the Nafta agreement\u2019s gonna end up, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cBut even so, everybody\u2019s getting creative and looking ahead in case of it. Everybody\u2019s working harder.\u201dOn the other side of the dividing line, the steel fence gives way to a protest of walls and borders. The government has permitted some local artists to put up creative works that make bold statements, while others have informally drawn on it with spray paint.One piece, titled \u201cPaseo de Humanidad\u201d (\u201cParade of Humanity\u201d), features a procession of extraterrestrial-looking steel figurines marching toward the border with emblems on their bodies that evoke the economies that drive people to migrate (one figure is made of maize, and another bears an \u201cHecho en Mexico\u201d stamp, possibly alluding to the maquiladora plants that displace people from their home regions). Another installation consists of 60 small wooden crosses that lean against the fence, each one symbolizing a migrant who has died crossing the border.The border and its themes naturally infuse some of the artistic production of Nogales, Sonora, because of the way it shapes the artists\u2019 daily lives, said Elena Vega, a local poet and photographer who also experiments through painting, dance, music and spoken word.\u201cIn the art world, it\u2019s always like that \u2014 some people live over there and come play here, or else we go and present our work over there,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a coming-and-going. Maybe my work has that essence, but it\u2019s not that I\u2019m looking for it. It happens, it emerges from the work.\u201dWhile Mexico, like the United States, sometimes looks down upon its border cities, Ms. Vega said it is creative precisely because it\u2019s a fluid, heavily traversed zone. \u201cI think it\u2019s the border environment. There\u2019s more openness, it\u2019s more diverse.\u201dThe alliance, which works with organizations in both countries to increase social investment and improve Americans\u2019 understanding of the border, offers tours for Americans who prefer to visit with a guide. One of the tours introduces them to nonprofits including a migrant shelter. Another takes them to a craft brewery and to Calle Hermosillo, a long street that is home to many new restaurants and bars.\u201cSonora, in addition to having the best beef in all of Mexico,\u201d Mr. La Pierre said, \u201calso has some of the best seafood in Mexico, because they\u2019re adjacent to the Gulf of California, which Jacques Cousteau called \u2018the aquarium of the world.\u2019 What I tell our guests is that Sonora really has the best of surf and turf.\u201dOn a warm Saturday in early January, as I walked the downtown zone, averting my eyes to avoid the many vendors who will immediately try to pull you into their curio shops, I felt the energy change immediately. Mexican border cities are always a little busier and more alive than their American counterparts. Cars backed out of parking spots from every direction, and people moved briskly along the sidewalks. Amid endless pharmacies and dental offices catering to mostly-gone Americans, local life pulsed and thrived.As I turned a corner and made my way toward Calle Internacional, the street that once singularly marked the border, to view the wall art, I glimpsed a young woman on the American side of the fence who was reaching through it as she lovingly stroked the head of a teenage boy squatting on the other side. And I remembered Jessy Zamorano\u2019s comment about tourists reacting when they witness these displays of humanity.It seems something fantastic happens when you draw a line on the ground: People almost instinctively reach out across it toward each other. And that\u2019s a hard thing to appreciate from anywhere else but the border.Cecilia Ball\u00ed is a writer-at-large at Texas Monthly and has also written for Harper\u2019s Magazine.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Infrastructure Plan Is Light on Federal Funds, and Details", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s long-awaited plan for overhauling the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure includes spending $200 billion in federal money over the next decade to spur an additional $1.3 trillion in spending from cities, states and private companies on major projects, White House officials said on Wednesday, a formula that faces long odds on Capitol Hill.The increased infrastructure spending would be offset by unspecified budget cuts. Officials would not detail where those cuts would come from, or how the proposal would effectively leverage at least $6.50 in additional infrastructure spending for every dollar spent by the federal government, a ratio many infrastructure experts consider far-fetched. The officials said Mr. Trump would leave it up to Congress \u2014 where there is little consensus about how to pay for such a plan \u2014 to figure out the details, giving lawmakers wide latitude in creating what would need to be a bipartisan bill against the backdrop of the midterm elections.Asking a polarized Congress to hash out a complex and contentious plan could complicate an already steep climb for a proposal that was a pillar of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. That difficulty was underscored by a cool reception for Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal from Democrats and labor groups, longtime champions of boosting infrastructure spending, on Wednesday.\u201cThat\u2019s not a plan. That\u2019s a hope,\u201d said Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has lobbied for a large infrastructure bill. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of pathetic.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, one of several Democrats up for re-election this year in states Mr. Trump won, said Democrats were still waiting for the president to deliver on a campaign pledge to pour $1 trillion into rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cAccounting gimmicks don\u2019t build bridges,\u201d Mr. Brown said.An ambitious infrastructure program has been a frequent theme of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda since he took office. But despite repeated promises by White House officials and the president himself that such a plan was just weeks away, a detailed proposal has yet to be made public.An administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump would be open to virtually any bipartisan proposal from Capitol Hill that met his criteria of generating a total of $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending, speeding the process of permitting projects and making a significant investment in rural communities, preferably including broadband.The hands-off approach is similar to the one the White House pursued with its tax cut, in which the president laid out broad parameters and drew senior lawmakers into the process of determining the details. But such a process faces long odds on infrastructure, given that Republicans are far less united on the issue and the president will not be able to rely on unified partisan support to force through a plan over the objections of Democrats.Passing a plan through a polarized Congress, in an election year, will require \u201cstrong presidential leadership, a bipartisan effort by leaders in both parties and bringing together the broad constituency of stakeholders who will push their lawmakers to get something done,\u201d said Ed Mortimer, the chamber\u2019s executive director of transportation infrastructure. \u201cThat\u2019s how we take advantage of this opportunity to do something transformational.\u201dDemocrats say the White House has not seriously courted their input. Several Senate Democrats and their aides noted that the administration appeared to be rejecting their longstanding call for much more federal spending. \u201cUnless we get real dollars, we will not build the infrastructure we need,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader.White House officials said they had met with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, including members of key committees that oversee infrastructure policy. They also said they spent months meeting with mayors and state officials to determine infrastructure needs throughout the country and the funding streams available to finance them. They concluded that a larger package than Mr. Trump had initially proposed was necessary and feasible.Administration officials say an increase in federal funds would unleash a wave of spending from cities, states and the private sector, the result of unspecified incentives in the plan. But many local and state officials have expressed concern in recent days that the administration\u2019s faith in that potential effect is misplaced. Some Democrats and progressive groups have branded the plan a \u201cscam,\u201d meant to reward wealthy investors and gut environmental regulations under the guise of a job-creating, economy-juicing initiative, and said it would not prove sufficient to meet America\u2019s need to improve roads, bridges, communications and other infrastructure.The idea that a $200 billion federal investment would drive $1.5 trillion in total spending is \u201cthe great hocus-pocus,\u201d said Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no evidence for that.\u201dWhite House officials dismiss such concerns, arguing that many aspects of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including the Federal Aviation Administration and the inland waterways system \u2014 have built-in revenue streams that can finance improvements and save money, and that the new tax law preserved incentives to finance projects. But many lawmakers privately worry that relying on such mechanisms will not be sufficient to ensure that resources flow to areas that need them most.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers also disputed the notion that expediting permitting for projects could harm the environment.White House officials did not rule out an alternative funding mechanism proposed by Congress, including a possible gas tax increase. Mr. Trump, the senior administration official said, would like to see a higher federal contribution to the plan but said the administration was being realistic about those chances.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Did George Washington Predict Donald Trump?", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIn September 1796, George Washington, weary of partisan combat just eight years after the ratification of the Constitution and the founding of the nation, wrote a farewell address explaining why he would not seek a third term. His message is worth remembering in our current political moment.In elaborate and thoughtful prose, Washington raised red flags about disunity, false patriotism, special interests, extreme partisanship, fake news, the national debt, foreign alliances and foreign hatreds. With uncanny foresight, he warned that the most serious threat to our democracy might come from disunity within the country rather than interference from outside. And he foresaw the possibility of foreign influence over our political system and the rise of a president whose ego and avarice would transcend the national interest, raising the threat of despotism.Washington certainly had great confidence, but in his address he didn\u2019t brag about his accomplishments. On the contrary, he beseeched the Almighty to soften the impact of his errors and expressed hopes that the country would forgive them. He established a standard for presidential self-deprecation out of the fear that a president of grossly inflated ego could become a threat to democracy.He cautioned against both overly friendly alliances (lest another country\u2019s interests and wars become our own) and excessive hatreds (lest we provoke unnecessary conflict and war with others). Forbearance in the use of power was another of his major themes. \u201cA free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another,\u201d he declared. Such encroachment, he said, would lead to the consolidation of power and create \u201ca real despotism.\u201dSome of Washington\u2019s most prescient warnings were about the dangers of factionalism. He wrote that should one group, \u201csharpened by the spirit of revenge,\u201d gain domination over another, the result could be \u201ca more formal and permanent despotism.\u201d The despot\u2019s rise would be fueled by \u201cdisorders and miseries\u201d that would gradually push citizens \u201cto seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual.\u201d\u201cSooner or later,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe chief of some prevailing faction, more able and more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.\u201dAs if envisioning the political tribalism and 24/7 cable news culture of today, he urged political leaders to restrain \u201cthe continual mischiefs\u201d of political parties. The \u201cspirit of party,\u201d he wrote, \u201cserves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection.\u201dAnd then he arrived at one of his greatest concerns: The ways in which hyperpartisanship could open the door \u201cto foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.\u201dSince 1893, a senator has read the farewell address on the floor of the Senate every year on Washington\u2019s Birthday, alternating annually by political party. Bluntly speaking, it\u2019s become little more than an exercise in bipartisan lip service. The House of Representatives stopped reading it decades ago. This was, at least, a form of honesty. Clearly no one was listening anymore.In 2016, fake news, gerrymandering, voter suppression and disenfranchisement were \u201cthe mischiefs\u201d employed by the Republican Party to propel Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. And Mr. Trump, perhaps \u201cmore able and more fortunate than his competitors,\u201d stumbled to victory using mendacious appeals to voters squeezed by a greedy economy \u2014 even though Mr. Trump had himself profited handsomely from that economy.If only we had heeded Washington\u2019s warnings, would the election have turned out as it did?Washington\u2019s goal was to ensure that the young country became stable enough to withstand the threats to liberty and freedom he saw on the horizon \u2014 a horizon that has now stretched 220 years into the future. We can never say he didn\u2019t warn us.Thomas R. Pickering is a former under secretary for political affairs and ambassador to Russia, Israel and the United Nations.

And now it appears that he is escalating the standoff, which is worrying tourists, foreign governments and countless Maldivians.In addition, a former president, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom \u2014 the president\u2019s half brother \u2014 was arrested, along with his son-in-law. Mr. Gayoom ruled for 30 years until 2008, and is now in the opposition. His son Faris is one of the jailed opposition figures whom the court had ordered freed.The United States said it was \u201ctroubled and disappointed\u201d by the state of emergency, which gave the security forces sweeping powers to arrest and hold suspects, prohibited public gatherings, imposed travel restrictions and suspended parts of the Constitution.\u201cDespite being elected in 2013 with the support of a broad coalition, President Yameen has systematically alienated his coalition, jailed or exiled every major opposition political figure, deprived elected Members of Parliament of their right to represent their voters in the legislature, revised laws to erode human rights, especially freedom of expression, and weakened the institutions of government by firing any officials who refuse orders that run contrary to Maldivian law and its Constitution,\u201d the State Department said.It called on Mr. Yameen, the army and the police \u201cto comply with the rule of law, implement the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling and the rulings of the Criminal Court, ensure the full and proper functioning of the Parliament, and restore constitutionally guaranteed rights of the people and institutions of the Maldives.\u201dSince last week, when the Supreme Court ordered the release of the political prisoners, opposition rallies in the capital, Mal\u00e9, have grown bigger \u2014 and rowdier.The Maldives, with around 400,000 people, is usually not a big newsmaker. It is known among tourists as something of a paradise. But climate change poses an existential threat to the islands, and in recent years a new problem has swept in: Islamist radicalism, which has security services on edge and led to the stabbing death of a blogger after he dared to criticize extremists.The opposition says the president is scared to free the prisoners because he may lose his influence in Parliament, and possibly his job, if the opposition lawmakers are allowed to return.It is hard to decipher exactly what is happening in the upper reaches of the government. Ibrahim Hussain Shihab, a government spokesman, said on Monday that the president did not intend to disobey the Supreme Court, but that \u201cprocedural measures\u201d needed to be addressed.But The Associated Press reported that the legal affairs minister, Azima Shakoor, had said the government did not believe that the high court order \u201ccan be enforced.\u201dAnother figure to watch is Mohamed Nazim, a former defense minister who was sentenced to 11 years for arms smuggling and is now under house arrest. Many Maldivians say they believe he was framed, and he still commands deep support within the military, leading to concerns that the security services could split.Some younger activists seemed invigorated by the standoff, however.\u201cFor the first time in Maldivian history, a court has ruled in favor of the people and we will protest until it is enforced,\u2019\u2019 said Mickail Naseem, an opposition supporter. \u201cI have never been more hopeful for change.\u201dHassan Moosa reported from Mal\u00e9, and Jeffrey Gettleman from New Delhi.

The two men are not related.Mr. Alvarado had won almost 25 percent of the vote to nearly 22 percent for Mr. Alvarado Quesada, with about 90 percent of the polling places counted, the nation\u2019s electoral board said.What had been a conventional campaign in Latin America\u2019s most enduring democracy \u2014 with debates over corruption, crime and the economy \u2014 was suddenly upended four weeks ago when an international court decision required Costa Rica to legalize same-sex marriage.Fabricio Alvarado, 43, who was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in 2014, made his opposition to the ruling the centerpiece of his campaign and suddenly emerged from the crowded field of 13 candidates to take the lead in opinion polls.Mr. Alvarado called the decision a violation of Costa Rica\u2019s sovereignty, and he threatened to pull the country out of the court if he is elected.\u201cPeople said, \u2018This is the person that I want to defend us in the face of international impositions,\u2019\u201d he told a Costa Rican radio station after he took the lead in opinion polls.But the court opinion quickly exposed a deeply conservative strain in Costa Rica, with a poll by the University of Costa Rica\u2019s Center for Research and Political Studies finding that a majority of Costa Ricans who knew of the ruling opposed it.\u201cConservatism is latent among Costa Ricans,\u201d the poll\u2019s authors wrote.The second-place finisher, Mr. Alvarado Quesada, who, at 38, was the youngest in the race, served first as the minister of human development in the Sol\u00eds government before moving to the Labor Ministry.

{"Headline": "So It\u2019s Your First Market Hiccup. What Should You Do Now?", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyWe\u2019ve been here before. Stocks can fall fast and bounce back hard, even if they haven\u2019t moved all that much or that quickly in recent years.And now, after watching the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fall by several percentage points since Thursday and bounce some of the way back on Tuesday, you have a different kind of fear: that all the stock market riches have been won already or that your emotions will get the best of you amid all of the volatility. It\u2019s tempting to sell what you have as quickly as possible to make that feeling go away.But before you do, take a deep breath and ask yourself these six questions.Watching the overall market numbers move up and down on television or the internet can be addictive. Even if your net worth is low, when the market goes up and down by a few percentage points in a day, there can be sizable dollar amounts at stake.But part of what you\u2019re trying to do here is avoid making panicked decisions. Big red or green arrows or commentators with raised voices generally don\u2019t induce calm. Also, those talking heads know nothing about you and why you invested in the first place. So don\u2019t base your actions on their pontificating and pronouncements.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in the first half of your career. You probably invested in stocks because over the very long haul, they deliver better returns than the other investment choices that are easily available to you at an online brokerage firm or through your workplace retirement plan.When you buy stocks, you\u2019re purchasing tiny little pieces of the profits that our capitalist system generates. Nothing about the events of the last few days suggests that the system is under siege. Quite the contrary: The markets may be spooked in part by the fact that the economy is humming along so nicely that companies will have to pay more for workers. That can hurt the profits that help drive stock prices and also lead to inflation.The small overall decline in the stock market over the past few days pales in comparison with the large gains over the past few years. So hopefully you\u2019re still on schedule to meet your goals, absent any big health or job changes.This moment of checking your gut, however, is as good a time as any to consider whether you have the right proportion of your money in stocks versus other options like cash, bonds or real estate that don\u2019t experience this kind of volatility or may not rise or fall in tandem with stocks. In other words, are you taking too much risk? Or too little? If so, buy or sell some stocks accordingly \u2014 not because of what the stock market will or will not do next but because you are or are not on track to pay for the things you want to buy someday.Let me answer that one for you: No. Perhaps you got lucky with some individual stocks as a teenager or used what you learned in finance class to buy just the right mutual fund at exactly the right time.Congratulations! But you\u2019re almost certainly more lucky than you are smart. Professionals rarely do so well over 50 years that their decisions about when to get in and out of a stock lead to better performance than they might have achieved by just putting money into an index fund that buys every stock in a particular category. And you can\u2019t know ahead of time whether you are that rare breed of market genius.Any decline hurts, even if it\u2019s only on paper and you don\u2019t plan on selling for decades. But consider everything else that might happen over that many years.You will (hopefully) pay down your student loan debt. You will (hopefully) get promotions and raises or start a company that will increase your income. You will buy a home, and its value will probably go up over time, or at least match inflation. Or you\u2019ll rent and draw dividends from the freedom and flexibility that brings you.In other words, you are not the stock market. There is so much more to your net worth (and, hopefully, self worth) than a bouncing S.&P. 500 chart. Check in with your life, and if it\u2019s better than it was a year or five years ago, think about that if the stock market keeps falling.Some of us (O.K., me, although I do a good job of hiding it in my columns) are more anxiety-prone than others. And maybe there is only so far we can go toward suppressing those feelings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sexual Misconduct Spurs New Elections: The #MeToo Races", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese and other allegations of sexual misconduct led to resignations by nearly a dozen state and federal lawmakers in recent months, setting off a flurry of special elections around the country to fill seats suddenly left open by the #MeToo reckoning.Yet the candidates running to replace these disgraced men \u2014 many of whom are women \u2014 are hesitating to put sexual harassment front and center as an issue in their campaigns. In at least eight state legislative and two congressional races, including special elections in Minnesota and Oklahoma that were held last week, the subject has rarely been mentioned in advertisements, rallies or when knocking on doors.In Minnesota, Karla Bigham, a Democrat who won a special election on Feb. 12 to replace a disgraced member of her own party, found slightly more interest in the issue, though it did not dominate conversations.\u201cPeople were well aware of why we were having a special election,\u201d Ms. Bigham, who has been a union organizer, said. \u201cThey expected a change and I talked about that on the doors in Minnesota \u2014 we need a cultural change in the Capitol.\u201dSome candidates said they have hesitated to press the issue because sexual harassment does not weigh as heavily on voters\u2019 minds as do other concerns, such as the economy, local issues or their approval or disapproval of President Trump.In most years, there are scores of special elections around the country to fill vacancies in statehouses and Congress. Most occur after a lawmaker dies or resigns after winning higher office, getting a political appointment or taking a private-sector job.This year, sudden openings after revelations of sexual misconduct have added to the count, creating a new brand of #MeToo elections.That is because most were in districts that are safely Republican or Democratic, and voters have shown no inclination to punish the party of a lawmaker who quit after accusations of sexual misbehavior.In Minnesota last week, Jeremy Munson, a Republican, retained a State House seat for his party in a rural district after the resignation of former Representative Tony Cornish. Leading up to the special election, Mr. Cornish campaigned for Mr. Munson. In an interview, Mr. Cornish said, \u201cI didn\u2019t run into any negativity in personal appearances or anything else.\u2019\u2019Mr. Cornish, a former deputy sheriff of Blue Earth County, stepped down after a lobbyist in the capital, Sarah Walker, said he had propositioned her for years.Ms. Walker said she viewed it as outrageous that a candidate would want Mr. Cornish\u2019s endorsement on the campaign trail. \u201cTo me it seems to speak to the Republicans\u2019 total disregard or concern about sexual harassment allegations,\u201d she said.The Arizona district covers reliably Republican suburbs outside Phoenix, and it is widely expected to remain in Republican hands. State Senator Debbie Lesko, another Republican seeking the seat, said she has largely avoided the subject of Mr. Franks\u2019s disgrace, although occasionally it comes up on the trail.\u201cI usually respond by saying, \u2018Well, in the Republican primary, it\u2019s myself and 11 men running, and I\u2019m not going to sexually harass anyone,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lesko said.Some of the candidates hoping to replace Raul Bocanegra, a California state assemblyman accused by women of groping or unwanted advances, are closely linked with the movement that ousted him. One accused Mr. Bocanegra, a Democrat, of harassing a co-worker last fall; another declared her candidacy after calling for his resignation last year, but has since decided to run in the general election rather than the special election.\u201cI think there\u2019s definitely a feeling for the people running that it\u2019s incumbent for them to bring respectability back to the seat,\u201d said Adama Iwu, a lobbyist who helped to organize a campaign against sexual harassment in California politics.But Dan Schnur, a lecturer in political communications at the University of Southern California, said the issue has not dominated races to replace Mr. Bocanegra or to replace Matt Dababneh, another Democratic lawmaker, who is accused of masturbating in front of a female lobbyist.\u201cRunning against a candidate facing these kind of accusations is a different type of challenge than running to replace one,\u201d Mr. Schnur said.In Oklahoma, a Republican easily held onto a State Senate seat that had been occupied for nearly a decade by Bryce Marlatt, who was arrested last year after his Uber driver accused him of grabbing and kissing her. (He has pleaded not guilty.)Casey Murdock, a rancher and state representative who won Mr. Marlatt\u2019s seat in the heavily Republican district, said voters occasionally told him they were disappointed in Mr. Marlatt. Mr. Murdock said he was skeptical about the Uber driver\u2019s accusations. \u201cI still, I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said.Mr. Murdock\u2019s Democratic opponent, Amber Jensen, said that with 32 percent of the vote, she had outperformed expectations for a Democrat running in this rural stretch of northwest Oklahoma. She spoke with voters who grimaced over the allegations against Mr. Marlatt, but said she did not make them a central part of her campaign.\u201cAt the end of the race, we all still have to live in the same town,\u201d said Ms. Jensen, who owns a construction company. \u201cBut behind the scenes, that is something that drove me forward because \u2014 well, because, me, too. I\u2019ve been victimized before. I\u2019m really tired of men making the decisions for women.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Keeps Britain\u2019s Trains Running? Europe", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 The privatization of public services \u201cwas one of the central means of reversing the corrosive and corrupting effects of socialism,\u201d Margaret Thatcher wrote in her memoirs. \u201cJust as nationalisation was at the heart of the collectivist programme by which Labour governments sought to remodel British society, so privatisation is at the centre of any programme of reclaiming territory for freedom.\u201dThose sentiments fueled a sell-off that put nearly every state-owned service or property in Britain on the auction block in the final decade of the 20th century, eventually including the country\u2019s expansive public transportation infrastructure. Enshrined by parliamentary acts under Mrs. Thatcher and implemented by her two immediate successors, John Major, a Conservative, and Tony Blair of New Labour, the gospel of privatization was embraced by leaders around the world, notably including Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s closest overseas ally, President Ronald Reagan.In the realm of transportation, that gospel was soon betrayed by its own chief disciples. Put simply, there were few private-sector buyers with the expertise and deep pockets necessary to maintain control of a transit system that serves approximately seven billion passengers per year. With minimal transparency, operational ownership of the network of train and bus lines that crisscross the 607-square-mile sprawl of Greater London, linking it to the far-flung corners of Britain, was peddled in bits and pieces by the British state or acquired in corporate takeovers.But the new bosses were not private, business-savvy British firms. By 2000, the masters of British public transit \u2014 thanks to a scheme that was intended to replace state waste and sloth with soundly capitalist business principles \u2014 were foreign governments, most of them members of the European Union.In short, the privatization devolved into a de facto re-nationalization \u2014 but under the direction of foreign states \u2014 that somehow went largely unnoticed. It now poses a startling and unprecedented dilemma thanks to Brexit, which will soon divorce Britain from the state bureaucracies beyond the English Channel that literally keep its economy in motion.Germany is followed closely in the ranks of British transit bosses by France, proprietor of the London United bus system, among many other holdings. Its iconic red double-deckers openly announce themselves as the property of the RATP Group (R\u00e9gie Autonome des Transports Parisiens), the state-owned Paris transport company, and are emblazoned with its logo of a zigzagging River Seine flowing through an abstract representation of the French capital.No country on earth comes close to Britain\u2019s peculiar status as a modern nation and economy knitted together by transportation networks that are overwhelmingly in the hands of foreign states. Of Britain\u2019s 23 major train operators, 18 are now foreign-run \u2014 16 of them by European Union governments and two by China. A majority of the 1.7 billion passenger rail journeys undertaken in Britain each year are now on foreign-managed trains, in addition to most of its 4.5 billion bus trips.Deutsche Bahn, technically organized as a private corporation but with a single stockholder \u2014 the German government \u2014 owns the Arriva bus network in metropolitan London and nationwide, along with six train lines. French state firms, through various joint ventures and subsidiaries, preside over another six. The Dutch state railway is the owner of Abellio, which runs three lines, along with an enormous number of Transport for London bus services. Italy\u2019s Trenitalia is the proprietor of another rail line.Eurostar, Britain\u2019s rail link to continental Europe, which annually speeds around 10 million people between London and Paris, is a joint venture controlled by France and Belgium, the country that hosts the headquarters of the European Union.Other owners of British transit lines include the former colonial possessions of Singapore and Hong Kong, which is today effectively a subsidiary of China. In the name of asserting capitalist freedom over state collectivism, a 30 percent stake in the South Western Railway \u2014 a critical carrier across heavily populated southern England \u2014 has been sold to a one-party Communist state (albeit with extensive experience in capitalist enterprise). Beijing will also operate the new Crossrail Line, which will start its central London services in December, and eventually run from the eastern commuter county of Essex to the western English heartland of Buckingham and Berkshire.Most of these transit operations are reliably profitable, contradicting the privatization gospel\u2019s fundamental tenet that state enterprises are incorrigible wastrels. In 2015-16, the overall rail system\u2019s bottom line was nearly \u00a3300 million ($420 million) in the black.By March 29, 2019, if the current departure schedule is met, either with a formal agreement or with no agreement at all, Britain will no longer be in the European Union. But its transportation system will be.It may not have mattered that the German, French, Dutch, Italian and Spanish governments owned the companies franchised to run Britain\u2019s transit system when London was an integral player in the European Union. Fellow European Union member states were treated as welcome investors \u2014 beneficiaries of eased regulatory controls that were intended to stimulate growth in the British private sector \u2014 when British private firms were unable to match their bids. But it will be more difficult, if not impossible, to rationalize that curious arrangement after Brexit.The central promise of those who wanted Britain to leave the European Union was to return full economic, political and legal sovereignty: a dubious premise in a post-European Union Britain whose employees and managers, public and private alike, are delivered to their jobs by RATP and Deutsche Bahn.An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Belgium. It is not the capital of the European Union. (Its capital, Brussels, is home to the union\u2019s main institutions, however.)Frank Viviano is a writer for National Geographic Magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018The 15:17 to Paris,\u2019 Real Heroes Portray Their Heroism", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Aug. 21, 2015, Ayoub El Khazzani boarded a high-speed train en route to Paris, armed with a knife, a pistol, an assault rifle and nearly 300 rounds of ammunition. His attack, apparently inspired by ISIS, was thwarted by the bravery and quick thinking of several passengers, notably three young American tourists: Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler and Spencer Stone.But the thing to admire about \u201cThe 15:17 to Paris\u201d is precisely its artlessness. Mr. Eastwood, who has long favored a lean, functional directing style, practices an economy here that makes some of his earlier movies look positively baroque. He almost seems to be testing the limits of minimalism, seeing how much artifice he can strip away and still achieve some kind of dramatic impact. There is not a lot of suspense, and not much psychological exploration, either. A certain blunt power is guaranteed by the facts of the story, and Mr. Eastwood doesn\u2019t obviously try for anything more than that. But his workmanlike absorption in the task at hand is precisely what makes this movie fascinating as well as moving. Its radical plainness is tinged with mystery.Who exactly are these guys? They first met as boys in Sacramento, which is where we meet them, played by Cole Eichenberger (Spencer Stone), Paul-Mikel Williams (Anthony Sadler) and Bryce Gheisar (Alek Skarlatos). Alek and Spencer, whose mothers (Judy Greer and Jenna Fischer) are friends, pull their sons out of public school and enroll them in a Christian academy, where they meet Anthony, a regular visitor to the principal\u2019s office.Frustrated by the educational demands of both church and state, the boys indulge in minor acts of rebellion: toilet-papering a neighbor\u2019s house, swearing in gym class, playing war in the woods. They are separated when Alek moves to Oregon to live with his father and Anthony changes schools, but the three stay in touch as Anthony attends college and Alek and Spencer enlist in the military. Spencer, stationed in Portugal, meets up with Anthony in Rome, and Alek, who is serving in Afghanistan, visits a girlfriend in Germany before joining his pals in Berlin. They go clubbing in Amsterdam, wake up hung over and, after some debate, head for Paris.To call what happens before the confrontation with the gunman a plot, in the conventional sense, does not seem quite accurate. Nor do Spencer, Anthony and Alek seem quite like movie characters. But they aren\u2019t documentary subjects, either. Mr. Eastwood, famous for avoiding extensive rehearsals and retakes, doesn\u2019t demand too much acting. Throughout the film, the principal performers behave with the mix of affability and reserve they might display when meeting a group of people for the first time. They are polite, direct and unfailingly good-natured, even when a given scene might call for more emotional intensity. In a normal movie, they would be extras.And on a normal day, they would have been \u2014 part of the mass of tourists, commuters and other travelers taking a quick ride from one European capital to another. At times, Spencer, the most restless of the three and the one whose life choices receive the most attention, talks about the feeling of being \u201ccatapulted\u201d toward some obscure destiny. But \u201cThe 15:17 to Paris\u201d isn\u2019t a meditation on fate any more than it is an exploration of the politics of global terrorism. Rather, it is concerned with locating the precise boundary between the banal and the extraordinary, between routine and violence, between complacency and courage.The personalities of the main characters remain opaque, their inner lives the subject of speculation. You can wonder about the sorrow in Alek\u2019s eyes, about the hint of a temper underneath Spencer\u2019s jovial energy, about Anthony\u2019s skeptical detachment. But at the end of the movie, you don\u2019t really know them all that well. (You barely know Chris, a British passenger who helped subdue Mr. Khazzani, at all.

But, tainted by numerous accusations of misconduct, he came to symbolize the corruption that flourished during his time in office.Influence peddling in his administration was so widespread, according to the nation\u2019s former public protector, that it became a form of state capture in which Mr. Zuma\u2019s business partners or friends influenced government decisions in their personal interest.Now, his departure as president leaves South Africa with a disillusioned electorate, a weakened economy and a tarnished image in the rest of Africa.Only hours before his resignation he sounded defiant and aggrieved during a live interview with the state broadcaster SABC, after party leaders threatened to hold the no-confidence vote on Thursday. He indicated strongly that he would not resign, saying that the party\u2019s effort to pull him from office was \u201cunfair,\u201d that he was being \u201cvictimized,\u201d and that he had done nothing wrong.But by Wednesday night, whatever narrow paths of escape he may have hoped for earlier had closed.Mr. Zuma, who throughout his long career had overcome scandals with a combination of guile and boldness, said he did \u201cnot fear exiting political office.\u201d He expressed contrition, though only fleetingly, saying that in executing his political responsibilities, he had not been \u201cthe epitome of perfection.\u201d\u201cIf truth be told,\u201d he added, \u201cnone of us are.\u201dMr. Zuma still faces possible corruption charges for an arms deal in the 1990s, before he was president. If he had remained in office, he might also have faced impeachment proceedings stemming from another corruption case, related to the misuse of public funds for upgrades to his homestead.On Thursday, Mr. Ramaphosa is almost certain to be chosen by Parliament to become the nation\u2019s fifth president since the end of apartheid in 1994; all have been members of the A.N.C.The resignation was the culmination of a long internal fight, pitting Mr. Zuma\u2019s supporters against an ascendant faction led by Mr. Ramaphosa, who pushed the president to step down before the end of his full term in mid-2019. The balance finally tipped against Mr. Zuma when the majority of party leaders concluded that the A.N.C.\u2019s interests, and their own, would be better served under a new head of state.On Tuesday, after more than a week of failed efforts by Mr. Ramaphosa to ease Mr. Zuma out office, party leaders ordered him to step down, saying his continued presence as the nation\u2019s leader would \u201cerode the renewed hope and confidence among South Africans,\u201d and indicating that he was hurting the party\u2019s electoral prospects.That set off a tumultuous Wednesday of moves and countermoves that ended with Mr. Zuma\u2019s late-night resignation.In the morning, Mr. Zuma\u2019s administration appeared to schedule an address to the nation by Mr. Zuma at 10 a.m., but an hour before it was scheduled to start issued a statement saying no such briefing was planned.As Mr. Zuma remained defiantly silent, the police\u2019s investigative unit \u2014 which has long been subject to political interference \u2014 raided the residence in Johannesburg of the Guptas, a family with wide-ranging business interests and close ties to one of the president\u2019s sons and his political allies, and arrested three people.The intended message, political analysts said, was that those closest to Mr. Zuma, or even Mr. Zuma himself, could be next unless he acceded to the party\u2019s order to quit.Then, a few hours after that, as Mr. Zuma gave no indication of responding to his party\u2019s order, A.N.C. leaders escalated the pressure. If the president did not resign by the end of the day, they said, they would move to remove him through a vote of no confidence the next day.\u201cThe ball is in his court,\u201d said Paul Mashatile, the party\u2019s treasurer general and a Ramaphosa ally.Mr. Zuma broke his silence with the SABC interview shortly after that, before finally resigning during his address to the nation.The developments were a clear sign of how much had changed in the two months since Mr. Ramaphosa was chosen to succeed Mr. Zuma as the leader of the A.N.C., creating what South Africans refer to as the two centers of power \u2014 the presidency and the head of the party.Mr. Zuma, seemingly untouchable just a couple of months ago, was gone in just 58 days.For years, Mr. Zuma \u2014 as the leader of both the party and the nation \u2014 had relied on his party\u2019s support to fend off opposition-led no-confidence votes in Parliament and damning rulings by the nation\u2019s highest courts.Mr. Zuma\u2019s reversal in fortunes began in December, when his choice as party successor, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a veteran politician and his former wife, lost to Mr. Ramaphosa by a small margin.Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s election was considered a victory for reformers inside the A.N.C. After his election, South Africa\u2019s currency, the rand, and overall business confidence have risen.In recent weeks, Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s supporters lobbied for Mr. Zuma\u2019s early exit. They argued that Mr. Ramaphosa needed time before the 2019 elections to rebuild the party and woo back voters, especially in the urban black middle class.Pushing back, Mr. Zuma\u2019s followers said he should be allowed to complete his term. But the momentum was not in their favor, and the legal challenges Mr. Zuma faced, potentially embarrassing to both him and the party, lay ahead.Mr. Zuma\u2019s resignation also saved the A.N.C. from a confrontation in Parliament. It is almost certain that the party would have succeeded in passing the no-confidence vote, given its dominance in the legislative body.But the spectacle of a party finally turning against a leader it had protected steadfastly for nearly nine years would have most likely resulted in awkward verbal footwork by A.N.C. lawmakers and stinging attacks by a reinvigorated opposition.The same A.N.C. lawmakers, who had until a couple of months ago always offered a full-throated defense of Mr. Zuma\u2019s conduct in a series of scandals would have been forced to proffer reasons to remove him in Parliament \u2014 exposing the party to charges of hypocrisy and expediency, and casting doubt on Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s pledge to reform it.The A.N.C.\u2019s difficult position was on clear display on Tuesday. At a news conference at its headquarters in Johannesburg, Ace Magashule \u2014 who is third in the party\u2019s hierarchy and has traditionally acted as its spokesman \u2014 struggled to explain why the party was asking for Mr. Zuma\u2019s resignation.Mr. Magashule said the corruption accusations against the president had played no role, saying, \u201cWe did not take these decisions because Comrade Jacob Zuma has done anything wrong.\u201dMr. Magashule\u2019s remarks suggested the party might be reluctant to deal head-on with the culture of corruption that was endemic under Mr. Zuma \u2014 and also that it was concerned about its success in future elections.In the 2016 local elections, the A.N.C. lost control over the nation\u2019s biggest cities after it was deserted by traditional supporters disillusioned by Mr. Zuma\u2019s conduct; some party officials have since warned that it might face a similar fate in national elections in 2019.But party leaders did not explain, as Mr. Zuma himself pointed out in the television interview, why they had loyally backed him until two months ago and were now demanding his resignation. What had changed, beyond the fact that there was now a new A.N.C. leader who wanted him out?\u201cNobody\u2019s saying what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Mr. Zuma said in his television interview.Advertisement"}
