{"Headline": "Why Iranian Women Are Taking Off Their Head Scarves", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionOn Dec. 27, Vida Movahed stood bareheaded on a utility box on one of Tehran\u2019s busiest thoroughfares, waving her white head scarf on a stick. Within days, images of the 31-year-old, who was detained and then released a few weeks later, had become an iconic symbol.Ms. Alinejad, who worked as a journalist in Iran before emigrating to England in 2009, says her campaign came about by chance. She posted a photo of herself driving her car in Iran without hijab and invited others to share \u201chidden photos\u201d of themselves on her Facebook page. The overwhelming response \u2014 the page now has more than a million followers \u2014 prompted her to focus more on the issue. \u201cI was a political reporter, but the women in Iran forced me to care about the issue of personal freedoms,\u201d she told me.For Ms. Alinejad and the protesters, the struggle against the compulsory hijab is about regaining a woman\u2019s control over her own body, not a matter of questioning the validity of the hijab itself. Now that bareheaded women are joined in these acts by women who proudly wear the full-body chador, it is clear that the movement on the ground is also about a woman\u2019s right to choose how to dress \u2014 something that, over the past century, various Iranian leaders have tried to deny.The founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, Reza Shah, banned the hijab, in a gesture of modernization, in 1936, which effectively put some women under house arrest for years since they could not bear to be uncovered in public. The leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, made the hijab compulsory in 1979.Mass protests by women were unsuccessful in overturning the edict. Pro-hijab campaigners invented the slogan \u201cYa rusari ya tusari,\u201d which means \u201cEither a cover on the head or a beating,\u201d and supervisory \u201ccommittees\u201d \u2014 often composed of women in full chadors \u2014 roamed the streets and punished women they deemed poorly covered. Those who opposed the strict measure called these enforcer women \u201cFati commando,\u201d a derogatory term that combines Islam \u2014 in the nickname Fati for Fatemeh, the prophet\u2019s daughter \u2014 and vigilantism.While the requirements have remained firmly in place, Iranian women have been pushing the boundaries of acceptable hijab for years. Coats have gotten shorter and more fitted and some head scarves are as small as bandannas. This has not gone without notice or punishment: Hijab-related arrests are common and numerous. In 2014, Iranian police announced that \u201cbad hijab\u201d had led to 3.6 million cases of police intervention.But for years, many women\u2019s rights activists have written off the hijab as secondary to other matters such as political or gender equality rights. In 2006, the One Million Signatures for the Repeal of Discriminatory Laws campaign, one of the most concerted efforts undertaken by Iranian feminists to gain greater rights for women, barely mentions the hijab. Iranian feminists have also been determined to distance themselves from the Western obsession with the hijab, almost overcompensating by minimizing its significance. Western feminists who have visited Iran and willingly worn the hijab have also played a hand in normalizing it.But fighting discriminatory policies has not resulted in any real change, as the crushed One Million Signatures campaign proved. So now Ms. Alinejad and a younger generation of Iranian women are turning back the focus on the most visible symbol of discrimination, which, they argue, is also the most fundamental. \u201cWe are not fighting against a piece of cloth,\u201d Ms. Alinejad told me. \u201cWe are fighting for our dignity. If you can\u2019t choose what to put on your head, they won\u2019t let you be in charge of what is in your head, either.\u201d In contrast, Islamic Republic officials argue that the hijab bestows dignity on women.But these young women appear undeterred. Their generation is empowered by a new media ecosystem, one that not only unites protesters but also helps to spread potent images of defiance. Ms. Alinejad believes that the movement has already, in a sense, succeeded. \u201cWomen are showing that they are no longer afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to fear the government, now it\u2019s the government that fears women.\u201dNahid Siamdoust is a postdoctoral associate of Iranian studies at Yale University and the author of \u201cSoundtrack of the Revolution: The Politics of Music in Iran.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In October, after going nearly two years without a sale at a gallery where she had a nine-year relationship with the owner, she decided to market her pieces more energetically online.Ms. Massion is following a path taken by other older artists who, eager to continue creating and attempting to earn a living from art in their retirement, are turning to online sales to supplement or replace their gallery ties. With the change, older artists are having to learn to engage with an ever-widening pool of buyers on the internet.The experience can be unsettling, she said.\u201cGoing online and selling online was for me hitting a brick wall. The technological aspect of selling art online was foreign to me,\u201d said Ms. Massion, who had a steep learning curve, starting with learning how to upload digital images.The move to online sales is happening as drawings and photos are more frequently shared on sites like Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram, whether by professional artists or hobbyists. \u201cThe growth of social media has made artists of us all,\u201d said David Winton, the chief executive of Kalisher, a company outside Chapel Hill, N.C., that places original art in businesses and other commercial spaces.After a representative from Kalisher began looking for Cleveland artists for a local client, Mr. Dibble landed a big commission in 2015. The result: 24 paintings hung as a single unit on display in the Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel. He earned just over $19,000 for the job.Mr. Stein still sees a need to continue marketing in the physical world. He has been keeping some work with a gallery in Britain, while also being digitally savvy. \u201cArtists will need more than one platform,\u201d he said.Artists over the age of 50 make up a significant contingent of those represented by online galleries. Artsy.net estimates that nearly 50 percent of living artists represented on its site are older than 50, with similar proportions at Artnet.com and Ugallery.Ruth Finkelstein, associate director of the Robert N. Butler, Columbia Aging Center at Columbia University, said people typically don\u2019t retire from highly creative activities. \u201cYou do it as long as you can.\u201dFledgling and more established artists may also sell on well-known sites like Etsy, eBay and others. Carolyn Edlund is the executive director of the Arts Business Institute, a nonprofit group on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The association conducts workshops in major cities and online for artists who want to start a business. \u201cEntry into the marketplace is incredibly easy,\u201d she said, making it crowded.Some see that as a virtue. Rachel A.J. Pownall, an art economist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who prepared a report on art market trends for the European Fine Art Fair, said in an email: \u201cThe online developments are helping the art market blossom by reaching many more buyers through a large number of business models.\u201d She said that the online market could be a boon for older women whose work might have been overlooked by traditional galleries.Ms. Pownall, who co-authored the recent paper, \u201cGlass Ceilings in the Art Market,\u201d said female artists, to establish themselves in the marketplace, have to be better than average.\u201cAn online presence using an art e-commerce platform,\u201d Ms. Pownall said in the email, \u201cis therefore likely to be a more attractive option for sales for females, who have more to gain by circumventing the traditional channels of the dealer and gallery, and hence my intuition that female artists are more prone to move online.\u201dTo be sure, there can be some potential downsides to going online, but even those are changing. Artists have long relied on traditional galleries, for example, to navigate contracts and help them market their work. Now, online galleries are also bridging that gap. UGallery helps artists with pricing and offers advice about a professional path, and Saatchi Art has an artists relations team.\u201cWe help the artist prepare for every shipment, no matter how complicated, and act as his or her liaison with the courier services, managing any customs clearance issues on behalf of the artist and the art buyer,\u201d Saatchi Art\u2019s chief curator, Rebecca Wilson, said in an email.Artists who place their work on nonexclusive sites also need to be familiar with the terms, Ms. Grissom said. One artist who was showing her work online realized belatedly that she had agreed to a markdown of unsold units of a limited-edition work. Rather than sell the pieces at a discount, the artist removed her remaining work from the site.For now, the two business models, off- and online, co-exist.Regardless of where one sells, Mr. Dibble said, \u201cThe hardest thing in the world is to sell a painting at a fair price.\u201d So he\u2019s keeping his ties to brick-and-mortar galleries in Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland; and New York City, while remembering that unlike them, the internet never closes.An earlier version of this article misstated how Kalisher, a company that places art in businesses, found Matthew Dibble\u2019s artwork. It found his art directly online and by visiting Cleveland and talking to local artists, not by scouting the online outlet Saatchi Art.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: The Story Behind the Street Hearts", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this chilly Tuesday.You might have stepped on several.They\u2019re pink, blue, yellow and green, and drawn in a single swoop.They\u2019re hearts, ranging from the size of a quarter to the size of a quarter block, and for about three years, a street artist has anonymously drawn as many as 100 a day on the sidewalks of downtown Manhattan.We got a tip, and tracked him down.Hash Halper, 38, drew his first hearts in 2014 while working at Kossar\u2019s Bagels & Bialys on the Lower East Side, he said. \u201cThe reason I started drawing hearts all over the city is because I fell in love with a woman.\u201dMr. Halper was raised in modern Orthodox communities in Philadelphia and Washington Heights, and attended Yeshiva University before becoming less religious in his 20s and later finding work at the bagel store.After he met the woman, he would pay homage to her by writing her initials, \u201cMSB,\u201d along with hearts, on the sidewalks and buildings that lay along his route to work.\u201cI wanted to infuse that romance into the city,\u201d he said.He draws all these hearts, he said, because he feels New York is losing its romance, with people holding phones instead of looking at each other.He also hopes that chalking hearts (and words like \u201clove,\u201d \u201cpeace,\u201d\u201ddream\u201d and \u201crespect\u201d) around the city might influence New Yorkers\u2019 behavior and decisions.At first, his street art mainly influenced the decisions of police officers, who arrested him several times before he switched to colored sidewalk chalk from spray chalk, and to sidewalks from buildings and scaffolding.His punishment was community service. \u201cDrawing hearts is community service,\u201d Mr. Halper said, \u201cso it\u2019s ironic to get community service for something that you feel is a community service.\u201dThe police don\u2019t bother Mr. Halper much these days, but he is still occasionally approached by an officer, he said.\u201cI say, \u2018You\u2019re a cop? Are you in a relationship? What\u2019s your emotional problem? Why are you so upset about a heart?\u2019\u201dIn preparation for Valentine\u2019s Day, Mr. Halper will be chalking hearts around SoHo today, on Broadway between Canal and Houston Streets.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Warmer weather awaits on Wednesday.The roses, the chocolates, the love notes, the prix fixe menus \u2014 for some, it\u2019s all a little ... triggering.The series, which began on Sunday, continues at locations across the system.Today and tomorrow, you can join a health program exploring Seasonal Affective Disorder.On Thursday, you can see a one-woman show about the tale of Venus and Adonis or \u201cCampfire Heartbreak,\u201d a concert (and time to vent) with comforting country music.This weekend, you can attend a stand-up comedy show about love (or the lack thereof), and discussions with medical professionals about the science behind heartbreak.Alexandra S.

{"Headline": "Brazil Looks to Crack Down on Fake News Ahead of Bitter Election", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Worried that Brazilians will soon be flooded with fake news ahead of a critical presidential election, the country is setting out to crack down on organized efforts to intentionally mislead voters.The officials leading the effort argue that the right to free speech cannot come at the expense of an illegitimate outcome, in an election that could dramatically alter the course of Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy.At Justice Fux\u2019s direction, Brazil\u2019s Federal Police recently established a task force of law enforcement and intelligence personnel, which is developing strategies to prevent fake news from being produced and to limit its reach once misleading content starts spreading online.\u201cIt is not our intention to infringe on anyone\u2019s freedom of expression or their right to voice an opinion,\u201d said Eug\u00eanio Ricas, the director of the Federal Police\u2019s organized crime division, who is leading the fake news task force. \u201cThe big question is when does a personal opinion become a lie about a candidate that is published with the specific intent of harming them and in doing so interfering with an election.\u201dJudicial officials say the task force is studying the tactics used by groups that have been active in spreading fake news in the past and assessing under which current laws they could most effectively be charged. They have also been consulting and negotiating with American technology companies, including Google, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, in hopes of turning them into partners in the fight against fake news rather than targets of enforcement actions and fines.If their initiative succeeds, Brazilian officials say that the October election, which will take place in a deeply polarized society, could serve as a template to address a problem that has undermined faith in democracy across the world.While officials are mainly concerned about fake news strategies deployed by rival campaigns, not a foreign power, they caution that such tactics are often planned and executed abroad, which makes shutting them down difficult.Yet it is unlikely that lawmakers will pass controversial legislation before the election, according to politicians and analysts.That leaves officials having to make use of laws and regulations they view as anachronistic for a 21st-century problem.These include electoral and defamation penal codes that were passed before the internet existed, and a dictatorship-era public security law from the 1980s that prohibited spreading rumors with the potential to generate panic or unrest.\u201cThose laws are not adequate to apply to the tactics of today,\u201d Mr. Ricas said. \u201cThe evolution of the internet and communication,\u201d he added, \u201cmakes it hard to be relying on laws from the \u201980s, the \u201960s, the \u201940s.\u201dThe legal situation has made building constructive relationships with technology companies a pinnacle of the plan.They have a powerful incentive to cooperate because the tribunal headed by Justice Fux is in the process of finalizing guidelines for electoral advertising online. At a time when Brazilian politicians are increasingly turning to social media rather than traditional outlets to target voters, the social media platforms are positioned to make a windfall.This reliance on social media to get the campaigns\u2019 messages out are expected to put the companies in the cross hairs of fake news disputes, and they say they are doing what they can to combat the problem.\u201cThe elections in Brazil are a priority for us, and we have been taking a series of steps to make sure our platform gives people a voice, encourages civic engagement and helps strengthen democracy,\u201d a press officer for Facebook said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have made several product improvements to reduce the reach of low quality content, eliminate the economic incentives behind most fake news, and prioritize content from trustworthy and informative sources.\u201dGoogle, which has been sued and fined dozens of times in Brazil as part of efforts to get online content removed, has met with judicial officials to explain the advances, and limitations, of its tools to combat fake news.\u201cWhile there is always more to do, we believe the actions we are taking will help prevent the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality and downright false information,\u201d a Google press officer said in a statement.Law enforcement officials in Brazil have expressed particular interest in WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook, which has about 120 million active users in Brazil.While government officials and the technology companies\u2019 representatives say their discussions have been cordial and productive to date, the companies have made it clear they do not intend to become arbiters of truth.Mr. da Silva is by far the leading target of negative fake news stories in Brazil, according to an analysis by Veja, a weekly newsmagazine, which recently published a cover story about misinformation campaigns. One example was an article falsely claiming that Mr. da Silva had said he would ascend to the presidency even if it meant trampling the federal judge who convicted him of corruption and money laundering last year.Mr. Bolsonaro is the rare Brazilian public figure who is the subject of more fake news stories that cast him in a positive light than a negative one, according to Veja\u2019s analysis. A spokesman for Mr. Bolsonaro did not respond to an emailed query about whether the campaign considers the use of fake news a legitimate electoral tactic. Mr. de Silva recently said such tactics should not be employed.Marina Silva, a former environment minister who is running third in the polls, announced that she was recruiting an army of volunteers to discredit the type of disinformation campaigns that she said derailed her past two bids for the presidency, in 2010 and 2014. False stories spread on social media about Ms. Silva before those elections included a claim that, as an evangelical, she intended to ban video games and an accusation that her bodyguards once fatally beat a gay man who tried to approach her.\u201cWe have already seen troublesome initiatives and a proliferation of laws aiming at active monitoring and regulating of online speech and delegating fact-checking to authorities,\u201d the group said.But Justice Fux pointed to the American election as a cautionary tale about what can happen if there is no effort to check false information.\u201cIn the American election, freedom of expression trumped over fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cHere in our country we recognize that while a right may be exercised, it can also be abused.\u201dLis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Bush said that with Mr. Immelt, the answer is yes.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing less marriage counseling with 12 adults,\u201d Mr. Bush said of his board, adding that Mr. Immelt would be a partner to take advice from (and occasionally whine to).An outside perspective\u201cWhat Jeff brings is an understanding of scale on a couple of dimensions, not only in terms of people and processes but also how you think about scaling with your partners.\u201d\u2014 Henry Ellenbogen of T.

Daily users rose nine million to 187 million, the best growth in over a year. The retention rate of new Android users, a special focus for Snap, jumped nearly 20 percent over the previous year.\u201d\u201cThe company lost $350 million in the quarter, or 13 cents a share, which was narrower than the loss of 16 cents that was expected by analysts. And it also contrasted with the carnage of the prior quarter, when Snap recorded a net loss that was twice the forecast.\u201dThe bigger pictureThe results have helped quell some of the concerns about the company\u2019s slowing revenue and user growth in the face of increased competition from the likes of Facebook.Critics cornerIn the early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump lamented that in the \u201cold days,\u201d stocks would rise on good economic news, saying \u201cToday, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down.

Shear and Alan RappeportIn recent months, many powerful men have had to step down from senior positions as they have faced accusations of sexual harassment, but none were the head of a public company like Mr. Wynn. How would the board, shareholders, regulators, customers and unions react?We now know something about the shareholder perspective: Shares in Wynn Resorts were up 7 percent in early-morning trading today. Regulators in Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau are still conducting their own investigations.But the biggest unresolved question remains the board and its conduct.The board set up a committee of independent directors to carry out an investigation after the WSJ article, but it was not clear how rigorous it would be. The board did not have a track record for holding Mr. Wynn accountable.In an email exchange with me, Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard law professor and an expert in corporate governance, asked why the board did not suspend Mr. Wynn from his position pending the investigation, or demand that he not interact with Wynn Resorts employees, a step that would have limited his ability to influence the board investigation.One remaining way to assess the board\u2019s resolve will be Mr. Wynn\u2019s separation agreement, which is not yet finalized.When the WSJ article was published, Mr. Wynn denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, calling them \u201cpreposterous.\u201d On Tuesday he said, \u201cI have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity.\u201dIt is not clear why Mr. Wynn decided to step down.

They had runny eggs, home fries \u2014 and bacon \u2014 for breakfast.Then, a week after a shooting rampage killed 17 at their high school, the students headed for the capitol, marching together up a hill, past a statue of leaping dolphins. They had come to urge lawmakers to impose new restrictions on guns, including a ban on the sale of military-style firearms like the AR-15 used in the rampage at their school. A former student, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged in the slayings.As the students walked to the capitol, Rosio Briones, 17, was quiet. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put my thoughts into words,\u201d she said. \u201cThis still feels so surreal to me.\u201dBut another student, Olivia Feller, 16, stood with Anthony Lopez, 16, and ran through a list of state legislators: who supported what, who they might be able to sway. \u201cWe are ready,\u201d she said. \u201cSleep deprived but ready.\u201dOutside the capitol, Senator Aaron Bean, a Republican, was rushing into the building.How did he feel about the student visit? a reporter asked.\u201cAngst,\u201d he said. \u201cI just \u2014 there is so much emotion. I\u2019m really really sad. It\u2019s a very sad situation. Kids shouldn\u2019t have to worry about that. It\u2019s already tough enough being a teenager, without worrying about things like that.\u201dDid he plan to vote in favor of any bills that would do anything about that?\u201cYou know, I think it\u2019s too early to say.\u201dWhy?\u201cIt\u2019s just too early to say.\u201dInside, the students divided into groups of 10. Senator Lauren Book, a Democrat, had helped the students arrange meetings with lawmakers in both parties, and the groups were supposed to meet with some 70 elected officials.Group Six crammed into the elevator with two parent chaperones. They met with Representative Patricia H. Williams, a Democrat, and Senator Debbie Mayfield, a Republican. Ms. Mayfield said that changes were needed, perhaps including raising the minimum age to buy powerful weapons, but she rebuffed criticism from a student, Daniel Bishop, 16, that such a change would not actually prevent deaths.\u201cWe can\u2019t stop crazies,\u201d she told the group.Afterward, Amanda De La Cruz, 16, looked distraught. \u201cI want the ban on semiautomatic weapons,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the crazies.\u201dThen they headed to the House floor, where the powerful speaker of the House, Richard Corcoran, a Republican, had agreed to take their questions.Standing at the front of the chamber, he promised to unveil what he said would be the most sweeping gun reform package in the nation\u2019s history by Thursday or Friday.Then a 16-year-old student named Alondra Gittelson raised her hand.\u201cI just want to know why such a destructive gun is accessible to the public \u2014 why that gun, the AR-15, that did so much damage, how is an individual in society able to acquire such a gun?\u201dMr. Corcoran responded that he would not be in favor of banning weapons like the one used in the attack on the students.\u201cI think that if you look, it\u2019s widely used in multiple different hunting scenarios,\u201d he said. \u201cI know people who go out and they\u2019ll do boar hunts and they\u2019ll use them.\u201dHe continued: \u201cYou can disagree, but what I tell my kids \u2014 and being in elected office, you have to be very, very, very careful how much authority and power you bring to government. The greatest atrocities known to mankind have been committed by governments.\u201d\u201cI understand your question,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll look at it, but I\u2019ll just be honest with you: Me personally I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the solution.\u201dAfterward, Ms. Gittelson observed that Mr. Corcoran had said exactly what her stepfather had predicted he would say.Around noon, hundreds of people converged on the capitol in support of the Stoneman Douglas students. Then, in the afternoon, the tone inside the capitol changed, as protesters flooded the building.The morning had been filled with impassioned but respectful conversation between the Stoneman Douglas students and lawmakers. But as the day wore on, college students and others packed the hallways carrying signs and boxes of petitions.On one floor, they crowded the doorway of the office of Gov. Rick Scott, shouting \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d On an upper floor, they gathered outside Mr. Corcoran\u2019s office: \u201cFace us down! Face us down! Face us down!\u201dAs the students pressed lawmakers in Tallahassee, cries for stricter gun control measures swelled on sidewalks and football fields around the country.\u201cSeventeen lives are more important than gun rights,\u201d said Christopher Lormeus, 18, who had walked from Coconut Creek High School, six miles away.But at Needville High School, about an hour outside Houston, administrators threatened any student who protested during school hours with a three-day suspension.\u201dLife is all about choices and every choice has a consequence whether it be positive or negative,\u201d Curtis Rhodes, the superintendent, said in a statement posted on Facebook. \u201cWe will discipline no matter if it is one, 50, or 500 students involved.\u201dJess Bidgood contributed reporting from Boston and Neil Reisner from Parkland, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Shooting in Florida, Student Activism, \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and the Olympics: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationPlease note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted._________It\u2019s obviously not right what he did and what all the other school shooters did. The government needs to actually do something instead of showing their \u201cgrievance\u201d about the topic. After the Columbine Shooting every town had to have a security guard or a resources officer but as we can all see that has done absolutely nothing. The Florida high school had multiple guards at the school yet he still got in the school, pulled the fire alarm, shot multiple students/ teachers, AND pretended to be one of the students that were trying to escape. The fact that he was able to buy an AR-15 LEGALLY is not good at all. It shows how easy it is to get an AUTOMATIC weapon even with the mental troubles that he as a child and into his teenage years. The US needs to do something about this \u201cepidemic\u201d and they need to do something about it quickly.When I received the notification from my iPhone\u2019s \u201cNews\u201d app that this shooting took place, my heart sank as I couldn\u2019t begin to imagine the fear rushing through the minds of the parents, teachers, and students whose lives were in jeopardy. While my school has not faced any gun violence, I do recall a time in middle school where a student brought a bullet in their backpack to school \u2014 I was petrified.In seventh grade after the Newtown incident, I was too scared to go to school for a few days. Guns \u2014 ARs in particular \u2014 absolutely terrify me and it blows my mind how it takes this many gun-related deaths to heed attention of the country. My school has practiced lockdowns and mentioned the training of ALICE drills but we have not been trained, and this scares me because I would freeze up and not know what to do in the case of an active shooter. I do not believe there are enough school security precautions nor counseling resources in my high school.Honestly, I don\u2019t feel safe in school anymore. My town is incredibly safe and the \u201codds\u201d might be low of a school shooting, but this does not mean that we\u2019ll be free of any gun violence as this has been the 18th massive school shooting in 2018 alone. I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s a problem with my school but more a larger political/cultural/governmental problem in the United States, because schools did not face these same acts of violence in earlier years. I am hoping to attend the March For Life on March 24th in Boston Common to protest.The problem with the school shooting isn\u2019t necessarily that the school isn\u2019t safe or that it has bad security. This is happening again and again and nothing is changing. How do we expect to prevent this if we\u2019re the ones letting it happen? Anyone can be a victim and any school could be the next potential site for another shooting. What we need right now is change. The government needs to make stricter gun laws to prevent dangerous people getting their hands on a gun. If you look at statistics from other countries where they have stricter laws, there are less incidents happening. If a 19 year old with a mental illness can get a semiautomatic rife, how safe really is our country?The gun control laws in this country are horrific. No one else has this many mass shootings or as many guns. Australia hasn\u2019t had a mass shooting since 1996. Why is a nineteen-year-old allowed to have a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle? That just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. How many casualties need to happen until someone actually does something about it? No civilian needs a weapon like that. People always say that gun control laws shouldn\u2019t be written because of the second amendment. But you know what, when the second amendment was written, we didn\u2019t have these semi-automatic weapons. If you have psychosis or are prone to manic depression, you shouldn\u2019t have a gun! What if you become sad or angry, and to feel better, you pull out your guns, and start shooting innocent people? That\u2019s not okay! Going to school should not be a thing that makes you nervous or terrified that you are going to be shot.This is an issue that is deeply rooted in American culture that does not seem to have a single solution. While the FBI has prevented many people inspired by these terrible events. There is always a black market for nearly anything. So banning certain guns will not stop a highly motivated individual, however, I am not opposed to banning certain guns such as the AR-15 or Tech-9 (or any sort of semi-automatic gun capable of firing multiple shots in a couple of seconds). Banning these guns would cease the production of them, and therefore reduce their availability. Another form of gun control that could be implemented is required fingerprint activation. Therefore only the legal owner (or whoever else they put on it) can fire a shot. This would most likely help reduce the mass shooting rates, as most of the firearms used are stolen from parents\u2019 closets or friends\u2019 houses. In this case, the 19-year-old legally purchased a firearm that \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 should not be legal in the first place. Preventative measures could also be taken on the mental side, as it is not JUST about the firearms used, it\u2019s also about the mental health of wielders. Offering free counseling and mental help nationwide would be a great help.Personally, I do not feel safe going to school knowing these events happen on a (near) weekly basis. While there has never been any gun-related issues at my school that I am aware of, I feel the government does little to prevent these events but give their condolences.What happened Wednesday was horrific, and a serious sign that we need gun law reform. 18 lives were taken from this world at the hands of a murderer who should have never been able to grasp the weapons he used to cause this destruction. Along with the many who agree with this idea, there are also ignorant opposers who suggest the guns have nothing to do with the problem and it is all the person\u2019s fault. Accept these exact same people are raged when background checks and mental evaluations are mentioned as solutions.Contrary to what these pro-gun people say, guns have allowed 18 school shootings to occur before the end of February. On average \u201c6 children or teens are killed per day by guns in the U.S.\u201d Semi-automatic guns which were made for the sole purpose of killing humans shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be handled by everyday people. The gun used in the recent shooting, an Ar-15, can empty up to 800 rounds per minute leaving tens of people dead in seconds. If these guns of horrible mass murder were never allowed into the hands of the public these shootings could have been stopped without such large casualties, and maybe even prevented.The time for gun reform is NOW, the time for change is NOW, the time to act is NOW. For the sake of children and adults across America SPEAK UP.It is a nightmare that no one needs to ever experience, no one should ever have to go through, but I can\u2019t help to feel that the problem doesn\u2019t so much lay with gun control laws than parental control and a failure of the so called system that doesn\u2019t work for the underprivileged or a health care system that sucks. Before the late 80\u2019s stuff like this was rarely ever heard of, but once kids were allowed to play video games where there is uncontrolled violence, prayer removed from schools, and music talking about killing people who have made someone mad, that\u2019s when things started happening. The issues ahead of us is not going to be corrected by stricter regulations on gun control, \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people,\u201d the question is why? Lawmakers and legislators should look closer at the real issues and stop trying to blame a tool instead the users and the so called systems that have allowed our children to slip through the cracks of society and become a tool for their political views. The idea of tougher laws on guns isn\u2019t the answer, fixing a broken system is a better start. When our children suffer at the hands of a drunk driver are automobiles blamed? Children are products of their environment and when legislators and lawmakers want to blame guns for the problems we face today all I can say is look a little better at the real issues and stop trying to place blame on an object that can not do anything unless it has someone to use it.I don\u2019t think guns are the problem here. I think that the customer should be checked out and observed closely and tested by certain individuals with no mental illness. Then it can be decided whether they can pay for it, or they have proper training and all that jazz. This is a sad subject and I wish for the best of the victims of this incident but I wish that you don\u2019t blame guns.I am 15, and I now fear for my safety at school.The first problem is the gun laws itself, we need gun control laws in place, so no unstable 19 year old can go purchase an assault rifle. It\u2019s actually so mind blowing how money hungry congressmen are that they\u2019d rather receive and collect money from the NRA, than do what they signed up for, which is to run and protect this country.First of all, being an international student from Oman, we never have lock down drills or safety precautions because these mass shootings never happen in my country. Guns are illegal in Oman which means that no one owns guns and I\u2019ve also never heard of a shooting in Oman. However, studying at a boarding school in the U.S introduced me to the idea of lock down drills. My school has some safety precautions to prevent possible shootings. Just like fire drills, we have lock down drills that prepare us for this type of incident. We also have good security and doors that are only accessed by students and faculty key cards. So yes, I feel safe in my school.I am afraid. When I walked into school on Thursday I couldn\u2019t help but think of what I would do if someone started shooting up my school. Would I live or die? Would my friends survive? Would I have the courage to help injured people? What would I do. It\u2019s terrible that I and a lot of other people had thoughts like these running through our heads the mornings and weeks after these continuously occurring tragedies. What\u2019s even worse is the innocent lives lost. People with so much to live for gone in an instant. People who would still be alive today if our government would pay attention and DO SOMETHING about it. I\u2019m not saying that I have all the answers and that my opinion is the solution to this epidemic but I know that something needs to be done.If I had it my way I would do away with guns. I know that this is an unpopular opinion and that it is virtually impossible to get rid of all the guns in the United States but that\u2019s what I would do if I could. At the very least we should do with automatic assault weapons, which by definition are used for infantry use, and have better mental health screenings for people trying to license their guns. I hope that as a nation we have a revelation and make an effort to prevent another tragedy like Parkland from happening again by snuffing out this epidemic from the source.I would like to start off by sending out prayers to the families that lost a close one in their lives, but making guns illegal won\u2019t help. Think of it this way; many drugs are illegal and people still get them, so if guns become illegal people will still find ways to get them. If I could make a solution it would be to give more in depth background checks.There are so many things I want to say about this tragedy. There is so much grief, so much anger inside of me that inundated every other sense I felt on Wednesday. So many words I want to say to the gunman, to the high school students who were all irreversibly affected by him, to Congress. But I feel like I can\u2019t anymore. I am so exhausted. So inexplicably tired of the needless and terrifying violence that has gripped America, that we\u2019ve become despicably desensitized to because it happens so often. So tired of just \u201cthoughts and prayers,\u201d and idleness, when already over a dozen school shootings have occurred since the beginning of 2018. So tired of mass shootings being chalked up to mental illness, when mental illness is an issue globally, yet the U.S. is still the only nation where this regularly happens. So tired of hearing \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people,\u201d when we should be fixated on the fact that people are being killed in the first place. So tired of seeing that an amendment that was written over 200 years ago is being protected over the lives of children who didn\u2019t deserve this. So tired of every single victim of gun violence being overlooked, not given justice, and forgotten about because our government puts them on the back burner.I am tired, and ashamed of this country and the people who run it. Weapons should not take priority over people any longer. Things need to change. And they need to change now.In America, mass shootings have become an epidemic. What is the appropriate response to an epidemic? Eradication. When smallpox was an issue, we did all in our power so that no one could get smallpox ever again. Vaccines weren\u2019t given to a select few, they were given worldwide so that absolutely no one would suffer from it, and there hasn\u2019t been a case of smallpox since it was officially declared eradicated in 1980. Action was taken by those in power to eliminate the disease, real action, not just their \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d. The phrase \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d should be used in cases of unpreventable destruction, such as an earthquake, and not the destruction that could be solved by the passage of legislation by Congress, preventing such deaths. Banning all semi-automatic guns and assault rifles at the very least would prevent the mass shootings we see all-too-often today. Another phrase that gets tossed around often in the wake of a mass shooting is \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people do.\u201d While this is true in a sense, you could kill a lot more people at once with an AR-15 than with a knife.I have to start off by saying this was very tragic event that happened on Valentine\u2019s Day, I give my prayers to the families whose loved ones passed during the shooting. The way people obtain guns need to be restricted, or harder to obtain, I know the 2nd amendment is the right to bear arms, and people take that law very seriously, but nowadays we really don\u2019t need the weapons. Also many people use the weapon for bad uses like murder, or intimidating people and that\u2019s increasing many crimes. According to the article it says the man was using an AR-15 assault rifle and according to the laws of gun control you can purchase an AR-15 when you\u2019re at the age of 18 with a license but you have to be the age of 21 to purchase a handgun. That doesn\u2019t make much sense from the fact that an AR-15 can be more deadly than a handgun. I hope someday we can fix this problem happening in America.I heard that students were Snapchatting their experience during the whole thing. And that people are calling them out and saying that what they were doing was stupid. Which is very insensitive since the students didn\u2019t know what else to do. One student said that they were all calling 911 and 911 told them to stop calling.A couple years ago there was a gun incident at my brother\u2019s school \u2014 a kid brought a gun to show off to his friends, it accidentally went off. It was chaos for awhile, people didn\u2019t know if it was an accident or not. All my family knew was that a shooting had occurred at my brother\u2019s school, everyone was so worried.At my old school, a kid brought a gun to school this year and went running through the halls with it. He didn\u2019t shoot anyone, but he escaped campus and caused a big police chase. A lot of fear in both of those incidents when families were still figuring out what was going on. Every year we have to watch videos on what to do if a shooting occurs, and they always remind us of the genuine danger that schools can present these days. It\u2019s frightening to have to worry about friends and siblings whenever there\u2019s an incident. Especially in my state, where guns are really easy to obtain, there\u2019s a lot of worry.Wow, that is so scary. I think that if something like this happened in my school, I\u2019d be too panicked to breathe. Even in these \u201cnonviolent\u201d gun situations, it just shows how terrible and how easy it is to sneak a weapon into school. I read something a while ago that a student wrote. She said that it was against her school\u2019s policy to wear a tube top, but the students were allowed to carry a weapon under 4 inches. I don\u2019t necessarily know if this is true, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt it with all the weapon and gun violence that has been happening recently.The school shootings that periodically erupt all over the United States are terrible and my heart is filled with sorrow at the thought of so much suffering. May God please bless all those suffering from the shooting yesterday. Thankfully at my high school we have not had to suffer through any shootings recently.I believe that tightening gun laws will only solve half the problem because I feel that schools can do more on their part in taking good security measures. Some pretty good security measures that all schools might want to consider are resource officers and student IDs. The resource officers not only intimidate any one who poses a threat from outside the school, but their presence also effectively discourages violence within the school. Threatening disciplinary action to anyone walking around without a student or administrator\u2019s ID, all schools can be very careful about who they let on campus. Another step schools can take is an alert system that connects to all administrators\u2019 phones so that if there is a threat to the school, all administrative personnel can be immediately notified without having to spread the information through the intercom system and also alerting the shooter. The awful shootings are heart-wrenching and devastate many lives. We need to do everything we can to help each other and keep our schools safe. These precautionary steps aren\u2019t always the cheapest, but can anyone really put a price on how much people\u2019s lives are worth?With the influx of school shootings this year, I feel like the schools in my area are growing less and less safe. A year or so ago, one student made a threat against the school on social media, claiming he would blow up the gym during a pep rally. The next day, after the comments had been posted, the school looked like a ghost town. Parents kept their kids home and kids skipped collectively. We did not address the issue in school, just went on after we realized the threat was empty. The panic of that day, of not knowing if some upset student would come in and target me and my friends or if we were afraid for nothing. My health science teacher, of course, was my savior when it came to situations like this, having given my class a semester of CERT (Civilian Emergency Response Training) I know what to do, where to go, and how to get my classmates out. The ONLY solution is gun controlMy reaction to the Florida shooting was actually just solidly passive and bitterly accepting. \u201cIt was another school shooting, nothing shockingly knew,\u201d I thought. You\u2019d think that at this point in time, after so many school shooting cases, that the higher ups that run our country would have already taken care of it. But as everyone can see now this isn\u2019t the case.While I do understand that the having the right to bear arms is part of the American identity but as a collateral to having that much power in a person\u2019s hand, then there should be strict ways to obtain a gun. I don\u2019t have the slightest idea on how to effectively prevent a school shooting but that is not up to me to decide neither it is my responsibility to do so. But I do know what thing for sure and that is to obviously do something to prevent school shootings.I am reminded of the story of the Minotaur, or of any ritual from ancient legend in which children were sacrificed as a form of tribute. The parallels to our contemporary world are only too clear. For far too many politicians and gun-worshippers, periodic human sacrifice is the necessary tribute that sustains their devotion. As Carl Jung, Aldous Huxley and Joseph Campbell would have each pointed out, our modern civilization is but a veneer, that is often quite transparent._________Can high school students make a difference when it comes to gun control? I say they already are. Why change is happening now, after 19 years since the shooting in Columbine, why it took yet another mass shooting to become highly public, why it took seventeen more deaths, why we had to endure this many tragedies before a change is actually happening, I have no idea. However, the work that the students from Florida are doing is phenomenal. It takes a tragedy to make a change, but it shouldn\u2019t have taken this many tragedies. So, to answer the question, yes they can. In fact, they seem to be doing a better job of making a change than anyone has before.I am a Republican, born and raised. I am also all for the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, and I believe that the government should not have complete control over our guns. But after seeing school shootings like this over and over on the news, there comes a time when any rational person must think \u201cHmm, maybe we should try to do something about all these shootings.\u201d What these students went through is absolutely heart breaking. I couldn\u2019t imagine what some of the kids, especially the younger kids must have felt. This is something that will change their lives forever. And if we just choose to see the whole situation as it is, a terrible thing, and if we don\u2019t look at the good that could possibly come from this, then nothing will change. This event, as horrible as it is, sparked a flame of inspiration inside the hearts of these students to go and make a difference and I believe this terrible act of violence does in fact have the potential to turn into something good.Ever since I was old enough to really start watching the news I\u2019ve been seeing almost countless reports on shootings all around the country. Honestly, I found myself growing numb to them. But hearing all these stories of the kids doing heroic things and all the students getting together for a great cause to help save lives and protect future generations has lit a spark in me too. I intend to help these students in any way possible to accomplish their goal of having stricter regulations on guns.I believe that my generation has the power to change the world more than any group before us. Unlike the generations in decades past, we have more information available to us than ever before. Social media, arguably the most powerful tool of communication in the history of the world, is at our fingertips. With the click of a button, our words can be shared with millions. All it takes is one tweet, one post on Instagram or Facebook. And a second later, your opinion is broadcasted everywhere. The internet has empowered us to have the ability to change the world, even at the young ages that we are.I do think that there is a way for students to make the government make changes to gun laws. With the school walkouts that are currently happening along with the Moms Demand Action group creating a whole nother separate group, student focused advocacy group, something needs to be done and will be done after more people start to join in on these things. These kids were born into a world where they have to practice lockdown drills and even fathom the thought that a school shooting could happen at their own school.The people affected in this school shooting are speaking out, whether or not they are doing it in public or behind locked doors they are talking about this. Luckily with the power of the internet the students made videos and posted them online where we could see them and see how they really feel about the gun laws. In one of the videos a parent is talking about their child and how she was shot at school and he then says, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me there\u2019s no such thing as gun violence\u201d. The video then cuts to people chanting, \u201cno more guns, no more guns\u201d. Now I don\u2019t completely agree with the crowd on this but I do think there should be a change to gun laws and that change and the law needs to happen fast.I believe that from the ashes of this tragedy, we are seeing high schoolers gain a new voice. From the combination of the age of the victims, to the devastation that occurred on the 14th, to the frequency of mass shootings, many of us are yearning to make change in any way we can, because we see ourselves in the victims. By protesting and walking out of school, and by keeping pressure on representatives and the NRA, we will make our voices heard. Will this effect change? I hope so. I don\u2019t want to keep worrying about being gunned down in my own school, or seeing my classmates die. Emma Gonz\u00e1lez is just one powerful voice being heard today, but it will take all of our efforts if we hope to see an end to mass shootings.After the mass shooting in Florida, many people from my school took to social media to rant about how they hated that this had to happen and how they hated that no action was being taken to prevent it in the future. I\u2019m angry too, I\u2019m angry that this tragedy is something that we have to fight for in order to prevent. In the article, \u201cA \u2018Mass Shooting Generation\u2019 Cries Out for Change\u201d, when Delaney Tarr stated that she, \u201ccannot remember a time when she did not know about school shootings\u201d, I really related to her. I remember having lock down drills when I was in early elementary school. No one ever said it but I know that everyone was thinking, \u201cwe are doing this for practice if someone ever decides to shoot up our school.\u201d School shootings have become so frequent that I\u2019ve even had multiple nightmares about school shootings. I\u2019ve had around 3 nightmares in which someone brings a gun into my school and starts murdering everyone in sight. Students should not be having dreams about being shot in their schools! Schools should be a safe place for everyone, schools should be a place where students can learn and grow along with their peers. Not bleed and cry out for help. I think that people everywhere should use their voices and call for action. Honestly, it shouldn\u2019t take this much effort for change but I think that if we all stand up for what is right and fight for action to be taken, we can and will end the fears of many people living in America: mass shootings.In a generation where we have grown up hearing about school shootings as a regular occurrence, something needs to be done. It is an absolute tragedy to think of the lives that have been lost as a result of our current gun control legislation. Our generation has become so used to the idea that this can occur. We as students have a job and that is to get an education to make something of ourselves, but when we feel that it is no longer safe to go to school, then what? We need to make a change, in the article the author references a teacher saying \u201cpeople say it\u2019s too early to talk about it\u201d but when is it the right time? It seems to me that every time a school shooting occurs we talk about gun control, but when will we actually take action. One recent movement \u201cNever again\u201d has been started by the students in Florida\u2019s most recent shooting to advocate for more gun control. We are the generation of change. Previous generations will never understand the fear that goes through our minds. \u201cIt could have been my school, my friends.\u201d Enough is enough. We as students should not have to worry for our safety at school. Our main focus should be getting an education. Students shouldn\u2019t have access to guns. We need to speak up, not be afraid to talk to our teachers, counselor, and school resource officers. If we hear of anyone that could be a threat to our safety. We need to think about how this affects the lives of our students and protect them to the best of our abilities.By a Liberal\u2019s logic on gun control, the best way to solve drunk driving would be the take cars away from sober people. This is what they are trying to do with firearms. There are millions of law abiding gun owners across America who use firearms as personal defense weapons, for hunting, or just for collecting. Illegal or not, if someone, like Nicholas Cruz, is crazy enough to commit murder on that scale, they will get their hands on a gun one way or the other. There are many alternatives to a ban on firearms, such as increased screenings and background checks, which I am fully behind. No mentally unstable person should be able to legally purchase a gun. Another thing is arming and training teachers. If the teachers in Florida were armed and trained, then the death count could have been much lower. Again, a direct ban on firearms will do nothing but harm, and as a U.S citizen it is an explicit infringement on the second amendment.Most of my family are strong Republicans. I grew up in a Republican house. I am also a firm believer in the Second Amendment. \u201cThe Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten amendments contained in the Bill of Rights.\u201d I mourn for the lives lost in the Florida shooting, but I believe that we need to take some sort of precaution. My father has his concealed carry license. The ONLY reason he carries a handgun EVERYWHERE is for the protection of my family. If someone comes and tries to shoot MY family, he can protect all of us because of his concealed carry license.My parents worry every day for my sister and I to go to school because it could happen to anyone. In the small town of Greenbrier, Arkansas, NO one would EVER imagine a mass shooting here. Our parents NEVER had it this bad when they were in high school. Our perspective on this is VERY different than the older generation. Some people do not realize how uncomfortable it is to go to a public school now. My mother has constantly told me, \u201cAddison, when I was in school, it was NEVER like this...\u201d Overall, we need to have some sort of restraint, but not so harsh that we cannot have guns at all. I hope that being educated on this topic can have some sort of impact on our society today.All of my life, I\u2019ve grown up around guns, yet I\u2019ve always had a fear of the damage that they can cause. When I was 10, I shot a gun for the first time; a .22 caliber long-rifle, and I loved it. I know that I\u2019ve always been a good shot, and it was great to one-up my older brother with my accuracy. Guns are practical; they are tools that we use to hunt and that we use in War. As I was always told as a child, guns are not toys.I believe that guns are not the problem in our world, but instead the fingers that pull the triggers that are problematic. A gun cannot shoot itself, but instead a mechanism is pulled back to strike a pin and thus fire a bullet. A human finger causes the gun to fire; a human mind causes the human finger to move. The mental state of a human determines whether or not innocent lives will be lost; not a gun. Say that a shooter were to come into a classroom, and open fire on students. What would students do? They would be completely defenseless against the bullets. One way to solve this is allowing teachers to conceal-carry guns to school. Even if the teacher is shot down in attempting to defend the classroom, a brave student would likely grab the teacher\u2019s gun and defend the classroom by his or her self. If the government allows teachers to conceal carry a weapon, there should be certain rules set into place, such as a carrying teacher\u2019s anonymity. Overall, school shootings are a problem that is growing. The government should restrict people, not gunsWhile most of us can not even vote yet, we certainly all share one thing. We have a voice. A voice that we can project and allow many to hear in hopes someone will listen and actually address this issue instead of sweeping it under the rug. As said in the article, situations like this \u201cdon\u2019t need to be approached so early\u201d, but we are far too late. This needed to be approached much before, and not just talked about for maybe half a month and dropped when something new comes to the news. No, this is an issue that needs to be addressed much more often, and high school students, the ones that have participated in the lock down drills for so long, can help raise awareness to it.The Second Amendment is our right to bear arms, which allows us to have guns. Freedom or not, I believe we need gun control. We do not need AR-15s lying around. Guns less likely to do damage should still be around, that\u2019s all. This is a mental health issue just as much as it is a gun or person issue. We need to be aware that this is how it has to be: it takes 17 people to die for this to be brought up again for what to happen: nothing? This is not Liberal V. Conservative. This is a battle against unnecessary killings that take the lives of those that are precious to us. As a high school student, we can use our voice all we want and hope we get justice. Mention our peers that are dying because of gun violence, and maybe we\u2019ll get results.People will say that it\u2019s not the guns, but the people. That is just stupid. If the people that have the guns are mentally unsound then we need to take the guns away from them. Some people will say that outlawing guns will only keep it away from the average person and only criminals will have them. However, people who have remote access to them; black market don\u2019t do crimes like this, they assassinate people and don\u2019t get caught. Also nearly every gun that is on the black market was purchased legally and is then sold illegally.I believe that our country should take action to stop these school shootings. We have already had more mass shootings in 2018 than most countries have ever had! I don\u2019t agree in banning guns completely but I do think we should definitely have some stricter laws on acquiring them. People need to go through a longer process and have to meet stricter requirements to buy a gun. Although this won\u2019t keep all harmful people from getting guns, it will be a whole lot harder and possibly decrease the number of shootings. I most definitely think we shouldn\u2019t just sit back and let these terrible shootings keep happening. A change needs to be made._________I will be attending tonight\u2019s opening at a 3D theater. I am not a Black Panther or Marvel fan, preferring drama and science fiction. My reason to attend is to participate in the excitement of the birth of a new cultural touchstone for African Americans.... As a fashion enthusiast, I am also excited at seeing how those of us who will dress up will interpret the esprit of everyday Wakandans.I can\u2019t wait to see Black Panther, I\u2019m practically counting down the hours till I get to see it. I am a black, female, superhero nerd and I can say that Black Panther is a Marvel hero that many nerds have been waiting to see as a live action movie. Growing up he was a character that I looked up to because he looked like me, he had dark skin, and I also looked up to his wife (Storm from the X-Men who I hope they have to meet T\u2019Challa in the upcoming movies). Black Panther represents something that resonates with people, he is a strong, powerful, confident black man that rules a country with a tender heart. Now this generation can see what I, a sixteen-year-old girl, and the generation before me got to love and enjoy. The cast is made up of beautiful actors that get to show us their representation of a story that I grew up hearing. This movie is going to change people\u2019s views on what black actors, and superheroes, are made of.Watching Black Panther has been my weekend plans since its creation was announced. This movie is not only in the superhero genre, aka the best kind of movie, but it features an all African American cast. With such lack of African American actors in big, successful movies, the wait for this movie has been a long one. Watching this movie will allow people EVERYWHERE so see black excellence and success. The setting of the movie even portrays the theme of black excellence and success. In society today, with so much hatred and rare unifying instances, a movie that caters to all ages and all people is much needed. This movie has been unifying for POC I know. Even people who know absolutely nothing about the background and creation of the movie are excited to watch it.I am totally going to watch the Black Panther, with my family and friends. I believe this movie will be a huge hit for Marvel and will also bring in many fans on opening weekend. I have seen the previews for this and it looks beyond good, it seems action packed, exciting and it will have a good story line leading into Marvels Avengers: Infinity War. Apart from this, Kendrick Lamar co-produced a genuine soundtrack that sounds amazing, it adds extra excitement to the movie in my opinion.This movie alongside others from MNarvel such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok, are connected to Marvel\u2019s biggest movie coming in May. Apart from the entertainment aspect of this movie, there are also cultural and political sides to it, which is why I think it\u2019s gathering so much interest among fans and critics. According to the article there hasn\u2019t been as much hype to African-American audiences since Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cMalcolm X\u201d in 1992. A huge key factor is that the cast is mostly African American apart from Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. I can say I agree with the statement that Mr. Grey stated saying that this film should be understood in a political context in which both the legal gains of the civil rights movement and the interracial optimism of Obama era have been undermined. This movie will bring people together and unite African-Americans, the concept of this whole project is truly amazing. It\u2019s going to be a grand expression of cultural pride for the African-American populationHeck yeah, I\u2019m gonna see Black Panther! It looks like a great movie especially because it has already had so much success. It\u2019s great to finally have a superhero movie with a black cast. This is probably a big reason why it has so much interest. Many black children and little girls only have white male superheros to look up to. It\u2019s great to finally have a black superhero that isn\u2019t a sidekick. Also, Hollywood is starting to have more female superheroes such as Wonder Woman, the Scarlet Witch, and the Black Widow. I love how more women and people of color are getting better opportunities in the movie industry. It\u2019s a huge advancement in equality with jobs. Especially the movie business. I am a white male that grew up loving Captain America. It would be sad to grow up as a black child or little girl without a superhero to identify with. I was Captain America for Halloween for three years in a row. It\u2019s time for little girls and children of color to have a chance to be a superhero for Halloween.I cannot wait to see Black Panther, I actually just bought my tickets for opening night. This film has been getting hype ever since they announced it back in October of 2014, and it deserves every second of it! Chadwick Boseman\u2019s performance as Black Panther in Captain America Civil War was phenomenal and was the highlight of the movie to me. Now two years later he\u2019s getting his own film and I am so excited. The whole cast is primarily African-American excluding Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman but the whole cast is super stars. They have Michael B. Jordan as the main villain (Erik Killmonger), Luptia Nyong\u2019o (Star Wars the Force Awakens), Forest Whitaker (Rogue One), Daniel Kaluuya (Get out) just to name a few. This film is shaping up to be one of Marvel\u2019s (yet again) grand slams. The movie is a superhero fan\u2019s dream of a Black Panther movie, and it could really intrigue common movie goers too. The soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar is fantastic and just another reason to go and see the movie. Finally we have the reason people are probably most excited for Black Panther, it is the last Marvel movie before Avengers Infinity War and everyone is excited to see how this leads into Marvel\u2019s biggest movie ever._________My favorite genre of music is Hip Hop, I\u2019ve been \u201creally into it\u201d ever since eighth grade but I\u2019ve actually been listening to it all my life. Examples of artists: Future, Drake, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Eminem, Ed Sheeran, NF, Lil Uzi Vert. I\u2019m more into the rapping side of hip hop rather than the actual singing, so i guess that\u2019s where the \u201cOld School Rap\u201d comes into play. I used to listen to only rock songs with my Mom, Dad and Brother such as songs by A.C.D.C., Doors Down, and The Beatles but the music started to leave my mind while listening to the radio with friends because when they grew up they were listening to hip hop or both hip hop and rap. Either way my generation grew up with hip hop being more popular then most other genres. Many of my family members don\u2019t listen to hip hop but my cousins do and as a kid I would spend a lot of time with them at my grandparents and we would I guess connect to what the artists were singing or rapping about. So yes I believe I have forged my lifelong taste in music and that taste is hip hop.1. Nothing in the article, despite the fact that the information was new to me, particularly surprised me. It makes sense that a person\u2019s taste in music solidifies during a time which their brain is finishing development; ages 11 - 16. 2. I\u2019ve never had a \u201cfavorite song,\u201d but one artist I was introduced to when I was around 14 was Mac Demarco, whom I still thoroughly enjoy listening to at 17. 3. The reason early teen years are significant for forging a person\u2019s music taste is because during the early teen years, a person\u2019s brain is beginning the final stage of development. At this time, a person is more open to ideas and music. Once a person\u2019s brain is effectively developed fully, though, they are less open to new ideas and in conjunction, new music. 4. Talking to my parents and other adults around their age (50\u2019s), I have noticed that they generally enjoy the same musical artists; the Beatles, ELO, Queen, etc. Generally, these bands were popular during a 50 year old\u2019s teenage years, so it does support the evidence. 5. Mainstream music is repeated garbage, so the challenge is actually listening to it as a parent. Most mainstream billboard hits use the exact same elements, and act as money generation machines, not music. Musical complexity is low, tracks are compressed to hell, and all of them use almost identical melodies. Often, listening to this type of music is unengaging for parents who grew up listening to much more varied, complex, and creative music.My music taste is constantly changing. If you asked me a year ago what my favorite song was, I can guarantee that my answer is different today. Every few months, I have to erase my Spotify playlist and start from scratch because I get sick and tired of the songs on it. Just three months ago, I was obsessed with The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and three months before that, I would only listen to mid-2000s rock. Assuming this trend continues, I can\u2019t imagine myself liking the same music I like now in 20 years. The music industry is perpetually evolving. Artists are always striving to find new ways to make their songs stand out and keep their audiences coming back for more. Who knows, maybe my favorite song will be one in an entirely different dimension that has yet to be discovered. 20 years is a long time from now.I will admit that I\u2019ll blast Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d when it comes on the radio and bask in the joy of still knowing all the words. Like the men in their 30s who love \u201cCreep\u201d, I will always have a special place for the songs that remind me of my childhood in my heart, but I look forward to discovering new songs and further developing my musical taste.In this article, I really did not expect that the age where we usually find our \u201clifelong taste in music\u201d would be 13 or 14 years old. I expected the age range to be around 20-27. Personally when I was around 13 or 14 I had quite a broad range of music but it\u2019s nothing compared to the wide range of music that I listen to today. I mainly listened to \u201cemo\u201d bands such as, Good Charlotte, My Chemical Romance, Twenty One Pilots and A Rocket to the Moon. I think that the early teen years are significant for forging a lifelong taste in music because in these early years we are starting to truly realize who we are and who we want to be. The music that we listen to in this time is significant because we are in the midst of discovering what we want to do in life and how we want to do it, and the music follows us along the journey and reminds us of who we are. I feel that today, older generations struggle with the amount of swear words that are used in most songs today. Growing up in past generations, swearing was considered sinful and impolite. So now when older generations hear these words on the radio, they are typically astounded and wonder why these artists have to use such foul language to share the message of their song (or at least that\u2019s what my mom does).In my opinion I don\u2019t think the music I listen to today will be the same that I chose to enjoy as an adult, mostly because there will always be a new rap artist/album with a better flow than the one from a couple weeks ago. Now that seems like a pretty rude answer until you realize the flaw in the article... The title asks about your taste and I agree with. But the article shares research that for men that are now 38 rate \u201cCreep\u201d by Radiohead as the 164th on the charts, it then shares the song came out when they were 14, and it wasn\u2019t as popular for men either 10 years older or younger. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz comes to the conclusion that when the men are 14 the songs they like then shape the songs they listen to for the rest of their life. I think this is wrong and if it is correct it needs a different, wider data set. The research tells you that the men still like the song, not that they listen to similar songs in the genre. I believe a similar explanation to explain the data is that men in women are in middle school, I mean junior high while they are 13 and 14, it has been shown that these are a challenging times in life. Songs that got them though that bring back great memories and that\u2019s why they are popular for these men. I think other songs in the genre from when they are the age of 13 or 14 need to be compared to songs that are more recent that share the genre. Therefore I don\u2019t agree with the article when the title is different from the research.I\u2019ve had trouble really finding my musical taste recently and was surprised after hearing that my preferences have probably been set already. From a young age my primary exposure to music has been through ballet and my parents. In ballet we listen to classical nonstop and I\u2019ve grown to really appreciate it but it never particularly struck me. What really struck me at a young age was those long car trips with my dad listening to Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Police, and The Doors. Just nonstop jamming out to Bohemian Rhapsody, Black Dog, Roxanne, and Break on Through ingrained some of the best songs in the sweetest part of my memories. But I never truly found my taste until recently when I whipped out some classic Metallica and Megadeth from my dad\u2019s collection and was swept off my feet. I felt like I knew myself, and I know that I will never stop loving metal. I don\u2019t know why the early teens are so instrumental to musical taste, but know that for me I\u2019ve always really liked the same music, just couldn\u2019t really pin in down. Just play me some classic rock and I\u2019ll be good._________College is a unique experience, and with that comes unique needs. I am a sophomore and have recently started looking and touring colleges to get a feel for what I want in a school and learn more about what I need to do to get there. Over the summer, I looked at Davidson College, a small, private, liberal arts college. I completely fell in love with the school and everything it had to offer. It seemed like the perfect place for me, except for the hefty price tag that comes with it.Around the same time, I toured UNC-Chapel Hill. Unlike Davidson, it is a huge school, which is something I\u2019m not sure I want. However, the quality of education I would receive would be excellent at this state school that is tens of thousands of dollars cheaper.Initially after these two visits, Davidson was my favorite followed closely by UNC. I thought that I could handle the immense debt that would come with it, because I was inclined to follow my heart. However, after thinking about it more, UNC soon started to encroach on Davidson\u2019s #1 spot. The reason for this is simple; I don\u2019t want to lock myself into a major that is more lucrative than something I love to do, just to pay off my loans for a school that offers a similar education to many cheaper public schools.This is not to say I won\u2019t apply to Davidson, but cost and debt should 100% be factored into the decision of which college to go to, especially if you can\u2019t see yourself in a highly lucrative career.As a current high school senior applying to college, I am well aware of the fact that depending on the college I may attend, paying off debts in the future is a likely outcome. I feel that now more than ever, at least from what I\u2019ve personally observed, both parents and children are much more hands-on with the process, consistently weighing the pros and the cons. My family has taken the question of finances more seriously than any other topic regarding the admissions process, and it will be a driving factor for the school I choose. Especially because my family and I didn\u2019t grow up entirely in the United States \u2014 I was born in Australia, and have since lived in Singapore and Great Britain \u2014 until recently, we weren\u2019t aware that we may have to pay a quarter of a million dollars for a bachelor\u2019s degree (which both my mother and I find somewhat ridiculous in the first place), nor did my parents know they would have to save up from my birth in order for me to attend certain institutions in the U.S. that may potentially cost more. Right now, I\u2019m looking at colleges in Canada partially because my Canadian citizenship makes the costs much less expensive. I have kept in mind throughout this process that realistically, wherever I may end up \u2014 even if it isn\u2019t my \u201cdream school\u201d \u2014 not only is it going to be a fantastic institution where I will get an exemplary education, but I\u2019m also going to find a way to make it my home for the next four years, and a place I will truly enjoy and love.As a prospective law student and someone who is applying to highly competitive colleges, I\u2019m still unsure. On one hand, I see debt at a more prestigious institution as an \u201cin\u201d to better jobs as more prestigious institutions carry more weight in job hunting for recent graduates. On the other hand, for those intending to pursue a post-secondary degree I think it\u2019s better to go somewhere you will have less debt to pay off as grad school, medical school or law school are even more expensive and it\u2019s better to save money in undergrad.I think student debt is very much worth it. Without a college degree, it can be very hard to find a good paying job that does not require backbreaking labor. That being said, it is essential for students to factor in costs in their college choice. An honors college at a state school can provide as good an education as a highly ranked liberal arts college, even though the public university costs considerably less.Student loans are a frightening thing to think about for most students, including myself. Based on this author\u2019s experience, I feel intimidated by the system because they basically crush you with all the interest rates and such. In all honesty, it has always been my dream to attend a prestigious college. A dream that seems unattainable because of the schools\u2019 cost nowadays. I come from a working-class family so paying off such high debts would prove a challenge. In order to relieve the strain that debts may place on my family, I would choose a school based on its affordability. After all, the success of a student does not necessarily depend on the school they attend. Ambition is what determines success, in my opinion. Ultimately I would like to choose my career based on my interest but a high-paying job will definitely be appealing to me because I will need to pay all my loans. Yes, student debt is a problem in the United States but apparently, it is merely a consequence of acquiring an education.Both of my parents came from extremely low income households. Money was always tight, so they were both completely on their own as far as paying for college. Even a small state school or community college was expensive. Both of them were in the first generation of their families that achieved a higher education, and had zero knowledge or assistance in process and payment. The only thing that they both had was drive. Today, they are both Ivy League graduates with no debt between them. Through hard work and focus, they were able to receive an education and pay off their loans. I have complete respect for them.Now that my bias is out of the way, I believe that student debts are worth every penny. A college education opens an unlimited amount of doors for the future, and with hard work and dedication, can pay for itself. Now, that being said, I also believe that many students are misinformed about what going to college entails. As Michael Arceneaux said, after taking out thousands of dollars in loans, \u201cno one mentions just how expensive and soul-crushing the debt will be\u201d. This is where a better pre-college education is necessary. I believe that it is important to be realistic about college with high school students, as opposed to only discussing its benefits. Teenagers need to be informed of the debt they will most likely accrue, and helped to plan school choices accordingly. If we emphasize smart financial decisions, people like Michael will have better debt situations.I have always known that going to college would be expensive, but this article really reinforced everything that every adult has ever told me about the cost. When I was younger, I really wanted to go to NYU and become a pediatrician, however I recently came to the realization that NYU is one of the most expensive colleges in the United States, so I have taken it off my list. I also still want to be a doctor, but my mind is not as set on being a pediatrician as it once was. That being said, I do not have a specific dream school because there are so many schools that have programs that will aid me in becoming the doctor I want to be, so I do not need to be narrow-minded about a school just because it is one that everyone knows the name of. The school I go to will be a good school and will not put me in too much debt because I do not want to owe the bank for the rest of my money. I might take out some loans but as little as possible. I do believe student debt is a problem in the United States and it has gotten increasingly higher over the past few years. I do not want to take part in it and I hope that the government gets a grip on it. There are quite a few countries around the world where they offer their citizens free, or close to free college. Education is extremely important no matter where one lives, so I hope the United States can realize this and make it more affordable so that all students can have access.I have no idea what to do about my future student loans. In high school, it\u2019s drilled into you that a fancy college and a high degree is your ticket to a happy, successful life. \u201cJust rack up the debt, kids, you\u2019ll pay it off with your neurosurgeon\u2019s salary\u201d. But what they don\u2019t tell us is that most student loan providers give you only six months after you graduate to get a job and start paying your dues, and it\u2019s awfully hard to set up your life and start making bank in about 26 weeks. This means that hopeful young adults in lower to average income families are stuck in a pit of debt they can\u2019t climb out of, weighed down by paying off loans when it\u2019s time to start saving money for their own lives. Here comes the stories of living off of ramen and sleeping in your parent\u2019s basement; students don\u2019t have the cash to pay their credit card bills, pay rent, or properly feed themselves. And according to recent statistics, the costs of tuition are only going up.My class and I will be graduating in 2020, the election year. I suppose my only hope now rests upon Oprah for a change in the education system. Perhaps I\u2019ll wait a year before going to college, just until the legislation passes through._________The Olympics is an anticipated event that so many people enjoy to watch, me being one of them. My family and I enjoy watching the Winter and the Summer Olympics together. Most of the time the Olympics don\u2019t impact me much, but this year the games have actually been very inspiring to young athletes all around the world.So many young kids have taken home medals this year in the Winter Olympics. It is very inspiring knowing that someone still in high school (or just out of high school) has the potential to win something as big as the Olympics. This shows that no matter how young you are, if you really try for something it will happen. This statement relates to the article about Mikaela Shiffrin because when she first competed in the Olympic Games, she went home in 5th place. Mikaela wasn\u2019t happy with her score so she kept practicing until she came back to the Olympic Games and won first place. Just a little hard work and determination changed her life.The Olympics, either winter or summer, is my favorite sporting event. The only problem that I have with it is that we have to wait every 2 years to be able to watch the incredible athletes from around the world perform on the highest level. The competition is not the only thing that I love about the Olympics. I love how it is the perfect stage for all countries to put away their differences and to come together to celebrate. I also learn about sports that I have never heard of, and every year I learn something new. I never realized how tough and dangerous a sport like skeleton is. It may just look like they are not doing anything, but it takes tremendous control to keep the sled on the track.The most mesmerizing moment for me in this years Olympics is Red Gerard, the 17 year old US snowboarder that won gold in the slopestyle event. He is the youngest male Olympic snowboarding champion ever. It is hard to imagine how a kid only a year older than me is able to win the gold on the world\u2019s biggest stage. He is half the age of some of his teammates, and it gives me motivation in my life that just because you are young doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t make a difference. I can\u2019t wait to see what else the Olympics has in store.My favorite moment of the Winter Olympics this year was seeing Shaun White make his return to snowboarding and take home the gold. I\u2019ve always been a huge Shaun White fan and used to love watching him pull off near impossible tricks on the halfpipe and take home gold after gold after gold at such a young age. Now seeing him come back and do it at a much older age just shows the true talent that this man has. I\u2019m inspired by his drive to get better and his passion for the sport and one day hope to have the same for whatever I do in my life.I absolutely love the Olympics \u2014 both winter and summer. I always look forward to cheering on Team USA, and this year, it\u2019s been great to see younger athletes dominate at the Winter Olympics such as Red Gerard and Chloe Kim. You can find me sitting on my couch, squeezing the life out of a pillow when Team USA is competing in any event. Throughout the day, I\u2019m constantly checking for updates on the Olympics, whether it\u2019s the current medal count, results, etc. But what\u2019s even better to see this year than Team USA is South Korea and North Korea united under one flag. It\u2019s amazing to see what effect sports has on the world. The Olympics are respected and revered around the world, and this year have caused the seclusive North Korea to join with its southern counterpart. This Korean team represents peace, and I find myself rooting for their team just as much as Team USA. I appreciate how far they\u2019ve gone to being a unified team, especially by making a joint women\u2019s hockey team. Even though they haven\u2019t won a single game this Olympics, the fact that they\u2019re playing together is the best win of all. We can only hope that this unity and peace that are being experienced in the games will translate into a much greater picture in the future._________I, as a teenager, definitely believe that pornography has and will continue to corrupt the impressionable minds of us teenagers. I mean think about it, \u201cporn\u201d is basically everywhere now. All it takes is one click to find it on your phone. There are entire magazines dedicated to it. Movies all about it. Music that essentially talks about it. It\u2019s almost like there is no escaping it. Porn has consumed our world one way or another whether we like it or not. Porn affects the way people think even without them knowing it. The porn industry makes women look like toys and discourages their pride. I believe sex is a sacred thing created for humans to reproduce and should not be put out on the internet for the entire world to see. It also changes the way men see sex. Young kids have access to porn and if they continually watch it then when it comes time for them to have sex they will think \u201cWow this isn\u2019t like the videos at all, maybe I\u2019ll just go home and use my hand that\u2019s a lot better.\u201d It also corrupts the way that men view women. After watching too much porn, a man starts to find women attractive based on what their body looks like, completely ignoring her personality. I believe porn is degrading to not only women but men too. It gives young kids a false sense of what a man should look like if he wants girls to find him attractive. This could lead to a feeling of depression because maybe the boy doesn\u2019t fit the \u201cperfect man\u201d mold. This should not be acceptable under any circumstances.First, to comment on the \u2018elephant in the room\u2019, it is clearly obvious that pornography has a huge impact on society \u2014 with virtually almost all adults and teenagers being exposed to it at some point in their lives. Porn often times takes the place of traditional standardized \u2018sexual education\u2019, which frankly, is quite a flop in today\u2019s system. Modern day sex-ed classes teach more about abstinence and the variety of STDs accompanied by sex than focusing on how to use proper protection to avoid any diseases or dangers when engaging in sexual intercourse. This kind of education does not help students to actually learn how to keep themselves safe and not do anything stupid \u2014 it\u2019s just a mere warning telling people to \u2018not do it\u2019 whilst giving no details on safety.Furthermore, regarding the impact that pornography has on masculinity, femininity and relationships, I would have to say that it completely takes out the intimate aspect of the act altogether. Today\u2019s society believes that sex is just a physical act, and nothing more. Much of the music we hear glorifies the action of intercourse and the female physique but never focuses on the relationship aspect of the subject. These messages are harmful because they provoke a message of \u2018doing it just to do it\u2019 (sounds stupid, I know) which doesn\u2019t help people make entirely smart choices.OK, let\u2019s all take a breather before I start writing. In a way, it is just in human nature to explore what we don\u2019t understand, and sadly sex can fall into that category. Yes, porn is bad when exposed to society, but people learn better from experience. The issue is that nobody wants to teach us about the issue. We don\u2019t need to learn all about the urethra and tubular organs, but rather a brief explanation as to how \u201cit\u201d works. I find that all media has shaped not only the idea of sex but love in general. Face it, you can\u2019t just fall in love in a session of detention or show up in your red Porsche while you swipe a girl off her heels. The real world takes time to learn what love is, believe me, I\u2019m still learning. If we can just teach people how a healthy relationship works without having them surf the private web, if we can have more talks to teach youth before they\u2019re sent off holding hands, just maybe we can be rid of these concepts about what love looks like from a computer screen.The topic of unrealistic and overstimulating sex also referred to as porn is a disgusting site that brainwashes anyone watching it into its lies and deceit. I don\u2019t believe the vocabulary and or content of pornography has any purpose being on the free ranged internet, let alone in the minds of unpredictable teenagers. I just don\u2019t understand why we are even debating the fact that porn influences the way teenagers think about sex, of course it does. When one is exposed to graphic material portraying a dominant man overtaking a weak female, that is exactly how teenagers will perceive sex to be in real life. In real life, women are portrayed as strong, dominant figures, not sex idols. The only solution to changing the way teenagers think about sex now is by destroying ponography and its content permanently. Doing this will not only save the present, but the many more to come in the future.Our nation\u2019s sex education is appalling. The fact that only half of our fifty states mandate sexual education is absolutely insane. It\u2019s no wonder teens go to porn at such an early age. Our own schools completely shut down any talk of sex during the most important time of development in adolescence. Teens everywhere are going through so many changes they don\u2019t understand and are beginning to look at the world in different ways and our response is silence. It should be no shock to anyone that so many people were first exposed to sex through porn. I\u2019m in no way justifying minors watching porn, but for a lot of people, it\u2019s all they\u2019ve got. Of course porn is impressionable on someone who has no other experience with sex. The problem is when teens only have porn. When no one is there to let them know the possible dangers of sex. When teens don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s bigger than just the act itself. Sex education is vital in the upbringing of any child. I think we should move away from blaming porn itself and instead see that the problem may lie within our societies education systems._________When I first looked at the image I was confused. After a few minutes of looking I finally came to the realizations that the cloth represents how we like to cover up our problems, and leave them for later. But the thing is, no matter how hard we try to cover up our problems, the cloth is always too thin. You can never fully cover it up or remove the problem from your life until you face it head on. If you keep putting it off you might let the problem get too big. You could leave it until it is so bad that there is no longer anything you can do about it.The article shows that Puerto Rico is a perfect example of this. The island is a prime hurricane location and feels the pain of it every day. After Hurricane Maria the island was greatly damaged. Due to its lack of funding, Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical system was in bad shape and the island experienced many blackouts. After Hurricane Maria it is worse than it ever was before. Due to the lack of power during and after the hurricane the water treatment plants have not been able to do their job. Many people are still being advised to boil their water before drinking. All these problems could have been mostly avoided if we had dealt with these problems in advance, or at least as they came; the situation would not be this bad.I think this image is shedding a light on how things in today\u2019s society that were overlooked are now being exposed and spoken out against. From protesting against deporting Dreamers to YouTubers basically boycotting a makeup brand because they aren\u2019t inclusive to all shades of skin, problems in our society are no longer just an at home discussion. Problems in our society are no longer being tolerated because there are so many people who have the platforms to be able to condemn them. It\u2019s 2018 now, and we have the power to push for progress. I think this image is a sign of progress and it encourages people to speak out.I believe that this picture is used as a symbol that we are running out of solutions for our current event problems. The covered part symbolizes problems that have solutions or have been solved. The uncovered part symbolizes the unsolved problems in our society.Often times the simplest art is also the most impactful. At first glance, the image portrays the fact that humans tend to deal with problems by covering them up, therefore not actually fixing the issue. The more I gazed at the image, I also noticed that the thin bandage only wraps around part of the word. This could be interpreted as only fixing or addressing part of a problem. The uncovered part of the problem is left unsolved. This image reminds me of the recent shooting that occurred in Florida this past week. To call the increasing number of school shootings in America a problem is a huge understatement. It is a nightmare that does not end for families all over the country and that our government is struggling to find a solution to. It is as if our country has a broken bone and we are trying to heal by putting a band-aid on it. We might be covering the surface of the wound but the problem still exists beneath the surface. We can\u2019t expect to solve our country\u2019s problems with simple solutions._________Watching the Olympics for the past week has showed how the difference between 1st and 10th place is sometimes is only 1 second. It seems that the human body has begun to peak in its ability to go faster. According to the data in the article, around 2005, times began to plateau. Times were becoming very similar, and it took a full decade to beat the speed skater record by Denis Yuskov. This shows me that technology needs to be a key part in not only speed skating, but other sports around the world.A competitor\u2019s goal is to always become better, faster, and stronger. It seems nowadays that the only way athletes can improve is with the implication of technology. Technology will also influence how many people will watch the sport. Viewers don\u2019t want to see the same speed every year, and with the implication of technology, athletes will performing better than ever, giving more awareness to the sport. If the only way that athletes can improve is through technology, then so be it. I just don\u2019t want it to come down to robots playing the sports.One sport that I can think of that has definitely increased its technology over the years would be football. Back when football was just becoming a sport the players only had leather helmets, I mean you might as well wear paper on your head. As a football player myself I really understand the need for technology in football. As much as we try to avoid them, head to head collisions on the field are a real thing. I believe technology has really taken a big role in preventing concussions and other injuries in football, and it has definitely changed the game.The \u201cPeak Olympics\u201d have arrived as seen in the graphs depicted in the interactive article. Up until around 1980 scores in the 800 meter run, high jump, and shot put all improved, until the scores plateaued in 1980. In another graph shown in the interactive article, you can see the male height in the United States showed a significant increase up until 1950. There the heights plateaued, even slightly decreasing in the 90\u2019s. While technology may advance in the future the human performance of the Olympics has reached its peak.I do not think athletes should be allowed to use technology to improve their performance. Once a technology becomes crucial in order to compete at a high level, it then provides wealthier countries an advantage. Once technology provides a substantial advantage, the sport no longer is entirely about human performance and becomes about a factor that does not encourage things like dedication to the sport. Not only does it provide a disadvantage to others currently competing, it diminishes the scores and legacy of past athletes. They need to provide stricter guidelines that stay constant throughout the years so that an scores can be compared to past scores. While some may argue technology improves scores these results are inflated by something that people in the past didn\u2019t have access to. There comes to a point where technology will be providing advantages at a level such as PED\u2019s which are currently disallowed throughout sports.Personally, I believe that technology should be used in sports but only to improve the fairness of the game. For example, in the World Cup, they should improve the goal-line techno to truly find out if the soccer ball fully went over the line. The limits of technology in sports should be like athletes using the technology to enhance their skills to outdo their opponent unfairly.I believe we have reached \u201cPeak Olympics\u201d, especially in some events. Take for example skeleton or most timed events. I\u2019ve witnessed countless runs within milliseconds of each other, making me question the appeal for that sport. Personally, I\u2019m attracted to events where the competition doesn\u2019t come in nitpicky ways, like how well you hugged a turn. I tend to watch the events like hockey, snowboarding, or other events where more grit, emotion, and even flaws are visible to the average viewer. I\u2019d rather see raw athletic ability than reproducible \u201cclones\u201d of the sport. The plateau of times due to human limits could definitely be boosted by new technology. But like before, if you hand the entire human race a task and give them decades to refine and perfect their skills, it will eventually reach a threshold. Adding new tech may stir up the competition for a few Olympic games, but once it becomes mainstream, we\u2019ll eventually run into the same issue.My solution for the Olympics introduces new modifications, or even new events entirely. Why watch the same thing every 4 years when new obstacles and challenges can be created to entertain the audience? Many might argue that changing the games will ruin the careers of athletes and trainers, along with the integrity of the sport. However, the Olympics and any competition for that matter are in the business of entertainment. If you can\u2019t keep viewers glued to the screen, in awe of amazing competition, it\u2019s time to switch it up.I think that humans are not at their peak in many sports. The authors are arguing that because the difference in performance times are becoming smaller and smaller, the athletes seem to be reaching a peak performance level at which they will no longer be able to improve, or will only be able to improve through improved technology. I completely disagree with this for multiple reasons. From what I\u2019ve seen, athletes are getting more and more skilled. For my example, I\u2019ll use running. Specifically, the mile run. In 1855, the first recorded mile time record on a track was set, with a time of 4:28:00. That\u2019s ridiculously slow for a professional. Even my friend can run a mile faster than that. By 1886, the mile record had dropped to 4:12:75. From 1945 to 1954, the record had been 4:01:40, until it was broken with a time of 3:59:40. From 1855 to 1954, the record has gone down by 29 seconds. Now, the record stands at 3:43:13. In 64 years, the record has gone down by 16 seconds. Between 1954 and 2018, the record has gone down by an average of four seconds per year, while between 1855 and 1954, the record has gone down by an average of 3.41 seconds. The athletes in this case are actually improving more quickly as time goes by, rather than plateauing. With the new technology that is being made, athletes aren\u2019t getting an unfair advantage to boost their performance, athletes are actually improving the same amount as they did back in the 1850s, when track spikes were first being produced._________I love Valentine\u2019s Day! It is the one day of the year where love, joy and cheer is spread and the focus is simply love. Often times in this world where there is so much hate, we need a reminder to be good to one another. To spread love. This holiday provides a time to support others in ways that they normally wouldn\u2019t. For instance at school students might spend a day making valentines for friends and family. Just by making a simple card people on the receiving end feel appreciated and loved. Significant others may even go out of their way to make sure their spouses have a wonderful day, by buying candies, cards and stuffed animals. This day promotes friendships and joy. It encourages you to do something nice for others, like making a Valentine\u2019s Day card for someone in a nursing home that may have lost their loved one. I think it is a beautiful reminder to be good to one another. Valentine\u2019s Day is not about the materialistic things. On Valentine\u2019s Day I saw big bears, candies and flowers lining the halls as gifts to their girlfriends, how happy it made them. Here\u2019s the thing, flowers will die and the chocolate candies will get eaten, then what is left? When there is no more presents being given, no more cards to show how much you care. Will we still spread love and kindness? I hope that we continue to even after the day ends.I remember Valentine\u2019s Day before high school when kids were more interested in getting their sugar fix then finding a Valentine. Now? I would only take part in Valentine\u2019s Day if I were in a relationship. If not, I don\u2019t believe anything I\u2019d do would be very genuine, which is the main reason I\u2019m not a fan of Valentine\u2019s Day. If you love someone, or want to ask them out on a date or something, why wait until Valentine\u2019s Day? Most others are doing the exact same thing, so why not do it when no one else is?Valentine\u2019s Day is another excuse to dress up and eat dinner. I love Valentine\u2019s Day because it is a day for you to eat as much candy without being judged, although I eat it no matter what day it is. I don\u2019t hate this holiday because it is just another day to show your love and appreciation for the people around you. I think the reason why many people dislike the holiday is because of the assumption that you need to be in a relationship to enjoy it. This is not the case, however, because it is just a day about love. To prove this assumption wrong, we can look at the name for Valentine\u2019s Day in Spanish that some use to refer to it, being \u201cDia de la Amistad\u201d. This means the day of friendship. I apply this definition to celebrate the holiday. I make plans with my friends and go out for a meal.I think Valentine\u2019s Day is a perfect day to show others how much you love them. It is not necessary to be in a relationship because you can show love to your parents, family or friends. Most people confuse this day with giving gifts and spending a lot of money, but it is not about that, a person can make happy another by sharing, treating and giving love and happiness on this day. I know some people do not agree with me, and maybe they think that we can share and give love every day, but I think it is good, at least one day, remembering with more emphasis the meaning of the love.In my opinion, Valentine\u2019s Day is an amazing day for the couples and for friends but I do not really care so much this day. I think that this day is a commercial day, created so that couples spend money on gifts but is not a bad day because in this day, many couples forgot their problems for one day and they concentrate on having the best day. Another thing that you can do in this day is spend time with your family and this is a good point for this day because not every day we can see all of our familiars and this is a good day to see them.I always remember loving Valentine\u2019s Day when I was little, but let\u2019s be honest. It was a day where everyone in your class would give you cards and candy and you barely did any work, but over the years I\u2019ve grown to resent it. Now it\u2019s just another day where people are walking around holding bears with hearts and chocolate prices sky-rocket. I had always believed Valentine\u2019s Day was a day only for people in love, and if you didn\u2019t have a significant other then you weren\u2019t included. I\u2019ve now realized it\u2019s just a day to let people know you love them. This is the first year I\u2019ve celebrated Valentine\u2019s Day since those days in elementary school where I would give out those little cards with puppies on them that came with stickers. This year I\u2019ve made cards for everyone in my family and plan on buying candy for my friends, but not until tomorrow, because then it\u2019s half-off.Valentine\u2019s Day is s day for the commercial business because if you see the season in February after Christmas the sales are low. Them the commerce need to activate and what better way than create a day for in love. For you demonstrate to someone that you have any love feeling for this person not necessary have that it is this day every day, every moment you can do it. Personally I every day I say my daughters, my husband and other person during the day \u201cI love you\u201d, not necessary with words almost with attitudes. I give them a hug, biscuits, hot chocolate or simply you say them something beautiful. You can use this way. You do not want the commercial day for you say, \u201cyou are important for me\u201d.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Taqueria El Sinaloense, Regional Dishes Worth an Early Trip", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City10 PhotosThe pork is stained red, shading from carmine to vermilion, and a beautiful ruin. It\u2019s been braised for two hours, tugged apart and crisped in lard, its flavor betraying a softening touch of vinegar and musty sweetness from cumin and cloves. The chiles are legion: guajillo, pasilla, ancho and arbol, a confluence of smoke and berries, raisins and chocolate, pine and grass.All this is delicious, but the texture is the wonder: the tangled strands juicy and yielding and then holding back, with buried knots of crunch where the meat took hard to the pan, popping at intervals like a string of firecrackers. The name of the dish is chilorio, and it is reason alone to come to Taqueria El Sinaloense in Elmhurst, Queens.The restaurant, with its purple awning framed in dashes of neon, opened in November just off the 90th Street-Elmhurst Avenue stop. Inside, the dining room is narrow and bright; at every table stands a red cloth heart in a silver vase. A map of Mexico sprawls over the wall, with the northwestern state of Sinaloa painted green.Elv\u00eda Castel\u00e1n, the owner, is from Puebla in central Mexico but has family roots in Sinaloa. She hired a chef, Am\u00e9rica Rodr\u00edguez, who grew up in El Rosario, once one of Sinaloa\u2019s richest mining towns, with veins of silver running through the surrounding Sierra Madre mountains. (According to legend, the town was founded after a vaquero broke his rosary while searching the hills for a stray cow; unable to find the beads in the dark, he spent the night on the spot, and in the morning saw silver in his campfire\u2019s embers.)The Sinaloan dishes on the menu sometimes run out by nightfall. It\u2019s worth coming early for frijoles puercos, almost more pork than beans, embedded with nubs of chorizo and possessed by chipotle. The beans taste of smoke and brine, leached from green olives, with a touch of velvet from melted cheese.Machaca is jerkylike dried beef, pounded in a mortar until it becomes almost airy, verging on carnal cotton candy. Then it\u2019s pressed in a hot pan, scrambled with tomato, onion and egg, and tucked into flour tortillas \u2014 common in Sinaloa as throughout northern Mexico, where wheat, introduced by Spanish missionaries, proved easier to grow than maize.The egg binds the fluffy dried beef together, giving it creaminess. And while the machaca here may not have the full-force animal intensity it\u2019s renowned for, it\u2019s still flagrantly meaty and concentrated. The flour tortillas happily bear no resemblance to their anemic grocery-store counterparts; they\u2019re chewy and thick enough to stand up to the meat, slightly muffling the salt.The remaining tacos on the menu, built on two layers of corn tortillas (a nod to the rest of the country), might be remarkable in another neighborhood but are merely good here, in the shadow of the elevated train along Roosevelt Avenue, where a hundred taco carts and trucks bloom. Still, on a wintry night, it\u2019s nice to take shelter for mouthfuls of cecina, a demolition of salt-cured beef with edges like candy; suadero, akin to brisket but cut closer to the udder, swollen with fat that turns to liquid instantly on the tongue; and al pastor, pork shaved thin and stung with chiles and pineapple, with a flavor close to burnt caramel, the darker side of sweet.Of the house-made salsas, one is green and lively, a pleasant pick-me-up; the other is the color of sunset on a dying planet, and cataclysmic. Measure your life out in daubs.Although Sinaloa, flanked by the Pacific Ocean, is known for its seafood, almost none was available on my visits. One night I was able to order shrimp, but the specimens that arrived were meek and pale, purged of any memory of the sea.The waitress had tried to warn me. English is peripheral to life here, but the staff is patient with those who don\u2019t speak Spanish. If it takes a while for the meal to unfold, note that there\u2019s often only one person in the kitchen, visible through an open window \u2014 sometimes the waitress, doing double duty.To end the night, there is arroz con leche, a cinnamon-laced rice pudding loose enough to drink, served in a ceramic mug with a bulge at the bottom. It\u2019s warm and gently sweet, and the scent is half the comfort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women in Cryptocurrencies Push Back Against \u2018Blockchain Bros\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 When a cryptocurrency start-up that promised to revolutionize the fruit and vegetable industry shut down last month, it left behind one word on its website: penis.When a virtual currency company called DateCoin recently tried to entice investors for its initial coin offering, it posted a Facebook ad that featured a reclining woman in a swimsuit with text over her body that read, \u201cTouch my I.C.O.\u201dAnd after the North American Bitcoin Conference in January, which highlighted 84 male speakers and three women, the official conference party was held at a Miami strip club.Now, some early female investors and entrepreneurs are beginning to sound the alarm and push back.Some crypto leaders are now organizing events, clubs and conferences to attract women to the industry. Ms. Bonatsos spoke at one such event this month in San Francisco. And Jalak Jobanputra, founder of the start-up investment firm Future Perfect Ventures, and other blockchain developers gathered in New York this month to discuss the issue. They later announced that they would form a blockchain diversity advocacy group called the Collective Future and create a diversity pledge for crypto companies to sign as a show of commitment.\u201cThe early days are what decide the culture of an industry and who gets involved in making the decisions,\u201d Ms. Jobanputra said. She cited the venture capitalists who funded eBay and Amazon and whom they funded next.\u201cWomen always question if they\u2019re qualified,\u201d she said. \u201cBut look at these clowns around us.\u201dThe response to some of the events has been encouraging, some of the women said. Brit Morin, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, recently held a blockchain gathering for women that sold out in an hour. She moved the meeting to a bigger venue, where all 500 seats sold out again. So she set up a livestream for the event; that evening, 16,000 viewers joined to watch.\u201cWe have an opportunity to rebuild the financial systems,\u201d Ms. Morin said. \u201cWomen want to be part of that.\u201dThe resistance follows increasing outrage at the lack of diversity in virtual currencies, punctuated by the sexist incidents involving DateCoin\u2019s Facebook ad and Prodeum, the blockchain-for-fruit start-up. Neither company returned requests for comment.\u201cIt just coincidentally happened that there were more men than women speakers,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not intentional not to include them. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t have time to include them.\u201dWhen others in the cryptocurrency industry realized the conference\u2019s after-party would be held at a strip club, they encouraged Mr. Levin to change locations. He said the strip club was the most convenient and safest venue he could find.\u201cDowntown Miami doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of event spaces,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cAnd we needed a lot of security.\u201dThe year before, the conference\u2019s kickoff party featured underwear-clad models \u2014 painted gold and covered in Bitcoin logos.\u201cMoe does something just as sexist every year,\u201d said Rose Chan, who founded the World Bank\u2019s blockchain working group and now runs her own cryptocurrency project. \u201cHe switches it up, which actually means that he thinks about it.\u201dOne group of female investors said they had decided to boycott the conference in the future.Mr. Levin said this reaction surprised him. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people who had a great time,\u201d he said.At some women-in-crypto events, frustration is giving way to anger and sadness. On a recent night, about 50 young women interested in cryptocurrencies gathered at the Woman\u2019s Club of Palo Alto. Some were engineering students at nearby Stanford University.Over wine, they shared their stories \u2014 some had been mistaken for hired models, others propositioned during job interviews, and many men had not believed they were engineers at all.Catheryne Nicholson, the chief executive of BlockCypher, which provides infrastructure for blockchain applications, explained to some of the younger women why the gender situation had deteriorated.\u201cNow there\u2019s a lot of money, and the men think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a whale now,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re a little more full of themselves.\u201dKaren Hsu, BlockCypher\u2019s head of growth, said she thought some of the gender concerns had been overstated. She said that at a recent conference, she had been asked if she was a speaker, which was validating.\u201cIt was nice because he didn\u2019t think I was a booth babe,\u201d Ms. Hsu said, referring to hired models who stand near the booths of start-ups to draw the attention of conference attendees.Other women spoke about how the culture of blockchain was slowly wearing them down. Jay Graber, a developer at Zcash, a new cryptocurrency aimed at enhanced privacy, was wearing small green earrings she had made out of RAM sticks used in cryptocurrency gear. She said she had become interested in blockchain after joining the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011, and she viewed the technology as a tool that could take power away from big central banks. Now she\u2019s not so sure.\u201cI never felt insecure before I got into this space,\u201d Ms. Graber said. \u201cBut I just realized there is no one else like me. It is a very hard feeling when you don\u2019t see anyone who is like you.\u201dMs. Graber said she had considered leaving the industry.\u201cI have this perpetual sense of being on the outside of that conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a general state of alienation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Go, Me!\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplaySATURDAY PUZZLE \u2014 I was struck by two aspects of this Saturday puzzle by John Guzzetta, one very specific, one broad. First, for some reason, a pair of long crossing entries stuck out to me \u2014 PAROLE HEARING and BAILED OUT. That inspired the silly readout under the headline today, and just struck me as extra clever. It couldn\u2019t be my own conscience, which is as innocent as a spring lamb, and certainly couldn\u2019t be because the long, extremely slow-moving arm of the law has been on my blameless mind these days. Nevertheless, I appreciated it.The other, less particular attribute today was the nice mix of clues from different vernacular eras. Today\u2019s puzzle had a couple of very recent terms that I was challenged by, and another couple of long entries that were anachronisms to me, equally hard to figure. Most of the good Times puzzles use modern slang, terms from antiquity, and everything in between; the best do it so skillfully that solvers of all linguistic interests can find a clue or two for their genre of choice, as well as pick up some terms. That\u2019s one of the things that keeps this sport alive!17A: For \u201cDirt spreader,\u201d I thought literally, and tried to figure out what farming or construction implement could fit in here. Instead this cleverly refers to the kind of dirt we dish out, gossip or whisper about, the specialty of a RUMORMONGER.33A: An occasional entry in the Times puzzle, I didn\u2019t know the term COLLET for a gem setting. In case you want to incorporate it into conversation (with your jeweler, perchance?) the word apparently sounds like \u201ccall it,\u201d rather than \u201cCollette\u201d or \u201cCalais.\u201dThis meditative little video is from a notable silversmithing family, originally from Spain, that\u2019s been in Buenos Aires for about a century.When I submitted this puzzle in 2016, MACRON was not the president of France. I\u2019m glad to see that improvement in the clues, as well as several others.What did you think?Advertisement"}

Cooked in a rich sauce containing jet-black \u201cink,\u201d squid finds a perfect, deeply flavored home in risotto, pasta and paella. Whole squid stuffed with bread crumbs and herbs is extremely popular across the Mediterranean. Crisp Chinese \u201csalt and pepper\u201d squid is addictive, with a whisper of five-spice powder. I\u2019ll never forget a dried squid snack I ordered from a street food vendor in Thailand; it was toasted briefly over coals, then flattened to the thickness of a potato chip and served with a spicy dipping sauce.In Spain, you can buy a paper cone full of glorious flash-fried cuttlefish rings and the tiny squid known as chipirones for just a few euros. But you\u2019ll also find many types of long-simmered squid stew there, many of which contain chorizo and garbanzo beans and, more often than not, a few clams, too.For tender results, the rule is, cook it high and fast (think frying or saut\u00e9ing) or low and slow, just as with many tougher, inexpensive cuts of meat. (Squid is also one of the cheapest items in most fish markets.)Once, in a restaurant north of Barcelona, I had a dish of long-cooked squid that didn\u2019t seem Spanish at all. It didn\u2019t even seem like seafood. I had ordered it without paying much attention to the menu description. When it appeared, it looked rather like braised veal, served in a brown gravylike sauce, surrounded by peas, carrots and potatoes. This squid stew tasted remarkably like pot roast, in the best possible way. It was savory and satisfying and very meatlike. I fantasized about having mashed potatoes to accompany it.The other day, when I found large squid at the fish market, that dish from long ago immediately came to mind, and I attempted to recreate it. It is an easy stew to put together in a heavy soup pot with just an onion, a thyme sprig, some white wine and chicken broth. A few carrots and turnips, some chopped leek and a handful of (frozen) peas completed the picture. The squid was fork tender in 30 minutes, and the broth had become divinely complex. Slurping a large bowlful, I felt as if I were in the company of an old friend: comforted, reassured, and yet not at all bored.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reunited? CBS and Viacom Are Talking About It", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new chapter opened Thursday in the drama over the future of the $37 billion Redstone media empire, with CBS Corporation and Viacom announcing plans to explore a reunion, reigniting a plan that fizzled a little more than a year ago.In simultaneously released statements, CBS and Viacom \u2014 which were part of the same company from 2000 to 2006 \u2014 said that their boards had created special committees of independent directors to \u201cevaluate a potential combination.\u201d Yet the companies cautioned that there could be \u201cno assurance that this process will result in a transaction or on what terms any transaction may occur.\u201dIn rekindling the possibility, though, both companies are acknowledging that they must get bigger to remain competitive in a media industry that now prioritizes scale.In the past year, The Walt Disney Company has agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox in a deal that would form an entertainment colossus for the age of streaming. AT&T is still pursuing an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. At the same time, traditional media companies are contending with technology companies like Apple and Facebook that have moved into the entertainment business.\u201cWhile it never was the case that you need scale to have a successful business, it becomes a more credible proposition to investors to say that you need it,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cInvestors believe that scale equals clout and clout equals pricing power with both suppliers and customers.\u201dThe ailing 94-year-old media mogul Sumner M. Redstone took control of Viacom in 1987, through National Amusements, the private theater chain started by his father. He then went on to acquire CBS in 2000 in a nearly $40 billion deal. Mr. Redstone split the two companies apart in 2006 amid uncertainty about the future of both businesses.Yet those plans relied largely on winning over Leslie Moonves, the chairman and chief executive of CBS, whom Ms. Redstone wanted to lead the combined company. Mr. Moonves expressed skepticism about how such a deal would benefit both Viacom, which had been struggling, and CBS, which had been delivering strong results. In addition, Mr. Moonves was seeking strategic and operational freedom over the combined companies.But both companies face challenges keeping pace in an increasingly digital world, especially amid the merger frenzy that has swept across the media industry. \u201cAs the world around CBS and Viacom will soon be inhabited by giant companies with endless balance sheets, the reality of the current arms race has recently weighed on these two stocks,\u201d Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research said in a recent research note.In a statement on Thursday, National Amusements said that it supported \u201cthe processes announced by CBS and Viacom to evaluate a combination of the two companies, which we believe has the potential to drive significant, long-term shareholder value.\u201dMr. Wieser, the media analyst, noted that a deal could also be aimed at more firmly establishing a successor to Mr. Moonves, 68. \u201cShari Redstone is more firmly in control,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has her person in place at Viacom and potentially a successor she\u2019d like to see to Les Moonves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slovak Journalist Found Shot to Death at Home", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRATISLAVA, Slovakia \u2014 A 27-year-old Slovak journalist who had been investigating corruption has been found shot to death at his home along with his fianc\u00e9e, the authorities said Monday.The killing \u2014 which appeared to be the first targeted slaying of a journalist in Slovakia\u2019s modern history \u2014 was immediately condemned by officials, who vowed to investigate.The journalist, Jan Kuciak, and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Kusnirova, both 27, appear to have been killed on Thursday in the village of Velka Maca, in western Slovakia, according to the office of the general prosecutor. Their bodies were found on Sunday after Ms. Kusnirova\u2019s mother was unable to reach her.Ms. Kusnirova was shot in the head and Mr. Kuciak in the chest, the authorities said.\u201cIf it turned out that the death of the investigative reporter was connected to his work, it would mean an unprecedented attack on the freedom of press and democracy in Slovakia,\u201d Prime Minister Robert Fico said in a statement.The killings were condemned by the European Union and by journalists across Slovakia.\u201cMurder of journalists is a clear sign of a crime against one of the most important pillars of liberty: freedom of speech and the right of citizens to check the powerful and those who break the law,\u201d a group of top Slovak news editors said in a statement. They were joined by colleagues from the Czech Republic \u2014 which until the end of 1992 was joined with Slovakia as one country \u2014 and from Reporters Without Borders and other human rights groups.\u201cThe E.U. cannot accept that a journalist is killed for doing his job,\u201d he said. \u201cI call on Slovak authorities to launch a thorough investigation, with international support, if needed, for Jan Kuciak.\u201d\u201cWe are shocked and stunned about the message that Jan Kuciak and his companion obviously have been the victim of a cruel assassination,\u201d the company said in a statement. It said that if the crime was intended \u201cto deter\u201d the company from uncovering any misconduct, \u201cwe will use this as an opportunity to take our journalistic responsibility\u201d with even greater determination.At a news conference, the top police official, Tibor Gaspar, said the killings were most likely connected to Mr. Kuciak\u2019s reporting. Investigators were trying to piece together what he had been working on most recently.The country\u2019s elite was unified in condemning the deaths, and the government offered a reward of 1 million euros to anyone with information leading to the killer or killers.\u201cI am shaken and terrified that something like this could happen in Slovakia,\u201d President Andrej Kiska said in a statement. \u201cThe coldblooded murder of young people is an atrocity that has to be punished. We have to find the people who did this and secure the safety of journalists.\u201dThe justice minister, Lucia Zitnanska, said in a statement: \u201cSlovakia can\u2019t be a country where journalists are murdered.\u201dMr. Kuciak, who studied journalism in Nitra, Slovakia, had written about shady financing or tax evasion in companies connected to well-known Slovak oligarchs and businessmen, many of them linked to the governing party, or to two powerful men: Robert Kalinak, the interior minister, and Jan Pociatek, a former finance minister. His most recent articles focused on a Slovak oligarch, Marian Kocner, and his companies.In October, Mr. Kuciak wrote on Facebook that he had filed a report on Mr. Kocner for threatening him the previous month. Mr. Kocner, he wrote, said that he would \u201ccollect dirt\u201d on the reporter and his family and would not stop until he would \u201cnever write anything again.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Kocner issued a statement deploring the killings and calling allegations that he had threatened Mr. Kuciak absurd.Last fall, Mr. Kalinak, the interior minister, ridiculed journalists who asked about the threats. \u201cThis is what you do, dig up dirt,\u201d he said.Slovakia joined the European Union in 2004 and is generally seen as having a robust legal system. Last year, it was ranked 17th in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index. However, media ownership is heavily concentrated in the hands of a few businesspeople, and dissenting voices often face pressure.Veronika Remisova, an opposition lawmaker, said that Mr. Fico, the prime minister, and Andrej Danko, the speaker of Parliament, had created an environment of hostility for journalists by demeaning and criticizing them publicly. She and other opposition politicians called for Mr. Kalinak, the interior minister, to step down because, they said, the police had failed to protect Mr. Kuciak.On Monday night, candles were lit in Bratislava and other cities in Slovakia and in Prague in memory of the slain journalist and his fianc\u00e9e.Peter Nagy, another journalist, said he and his wife, who is expecting a baby in three months, were planning a demonstration on March 13 to demand accountability.\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be born to a society where people are afraid to speak up and journalists are afraid to work,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cMurder of a journalist is a murder of society, of the voice of public and of our values.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Final Resting Place for Danish Prince Who Yearned to Be King: Not Beside the Queen", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe finally got his wish \u2014 just not the one he coveted the most.In life, Prince Henrik of Denmark railed against what he saw as the ultimate injustice: As the husband of the reigning monarch, Queen Margrethe II, he was not granted the title of king. He was known for years as her prince consort, then just prince.The prince died on Tuesday at 83. His burial after a small funeral service next week will be a significant break with Danish royal tradition.\u201cIt\u2019s a completely new type of royal burial,\u201d said Karin Kryger, an art historian. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented.\u201d\u201cThe sharing of the ashes could be likened to a medieval tradition of burying the corpse in one place and the heart in another,\u201d she added.Henrik\u2019s choice reflects a public grudge he had held for more than 30 years, as he fought an often public battle with his wife, now 77, over his title. They were married in 1967, and he wanted to be king consort, but she wouldn\u2019t let him, historians say. He asked to be a majesty, but again was denied.As he grew older, he frequently shared his grievances with the public. The issue grew into a scandal that saw Danes mostly side with their queen, and perked up ears around the globe.\u201cShe was stubborn,\u201d said Ulla Terkelsen, a senior correspondent for Denmark\u2019s TV 2. \u201cThe title he wanted didn\u2019t exist; there was no precedent. She could have created a title, but she didn\u2019t want to.\u201dAfter her reign, 39 monarchs followed. Prince Henrik is the first royal to choose a different burial site, and he will also not get a public monument.For years the prince\u2019s complaints fell on deaf ears and added to a public image of Henrik as arrogant and detached.When Henrik made his surprising announcement that he didn\u2019t want to be buried beside his wife, as was the custom, their elaborate plans for a shared final resting place went out the window.Those initial plans involved commissioning a glass sarcophagus for two, held by elephants made of silver.The couple\u2019s son Crown Prince Frederik rushed back from the Winter Olympics in South Korea last week to visit his ailing father at a Copenhagen hospital. The cause of death has not been announced.Henrik\u2019s coffin, draped in a Danish flag bearing the royal coat of arms, was taken on a stately procession through the streets of northern Copenhagen on Thursday. Thousands of people lined the route as the hearse was followed by the queen, their two sons, Frederik and Prince Joachim, and other family members to Amalienborg Palace. Thousands paid tribute on social media and left flowers at the royal castles.His final resting place in the private garden of Fredensborg Castle will not be open to the public.But Danes should not take it as a slight against their homeland, said Ms. Kryger, the art historian, who pointed out that in the end, he had chosen Denmark over his native France.\u201cHe chose to have his ashes spread in Danish waters and a funeral service in Denmark,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it shows his love for Denmark.\u201dThe love may be more mutual than years of public mockery of Henrik suggests. With his death, the tide may have turned and changed the public view of the prince.\u201cEarlier, public opinion sided with the queen, but today, people see it as charming when he spoke his mind,\u201d said Ms. Terkelsen, the senior correspondent. \u201cHe didn\u2019t keep a stiff upper lip, but said what he felt.\u201dWhile he never became king, he may have won the kingdom in the end.\u201cHe was a modern royal,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople came to appreciate that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It took a hotel deal to get them here. The cloned Aviary and Office are undeniably expressions of Mr. Achatz\u2019s aesthetic, with his fondness for Rube Goldberg devices, audience participation, old ideas tilted off their usual axis and novel ideas launched into orbit.The wildest notions are reserved for drinks in the Aviary. Mr. Achatz\u2019s food plays second fiddle in both rooms, and plays it beautifully. Yet neither space really shows off his full powers. In this perch above Central Park, the bird is half out \u2014 or, if you look at a different way, half in.Like many Aviary drinks, the one called Science A.F. (ostensibly a reference to the microbiologist Alexander Fleming) is made at the table. A small blue flame compels Scotch and other ingredients in the lower chamber of a vacuum coffee maker to ascend to an upper chamber filled with fruit tea, as dry-ice fog carpets the table. This took about five minutes and produced something that tasted like the fruit punch that might be served at a convention for designated drivers.It does not quite give you your bird\u2019s worth, I think. On the other hand, I admired the balance and complexity of the Wake and Bake, a mutant rye manhattan made with coffee- and orange-flavored vermouth. What I can\u2019t imagine ever loving is being asked by a server to stick my head inside the inflated plastic bag in which it is served, to see that it really did smell like an everything bagel. It did, but it was one of several moments when I felt like a parent helping the Aviary staff to complete a project for the science fair.After a round or two, the alert drinker may become gun-shy. A friend I\u2019d invited for lunch gamely sipped a Boom Goes the Dynamite, which had never cooled below tepid despite having fumed vigorously from the dry ice inside its laboratory flask. Leaving a third undrunk, she asked for a Bloody Mary.\u201cOur Bloody Mary is very unique,\u201d our server said brightly. \u201cIt takes about 15, 20 minutes to make.\u201d\u201cIs it served ... cold?\u201d my friend asked, hope flickering weakly in her voice.It was. A few minutes later, a relatively traditional Bloody was poured over many tiny ice marbles inside the bowl of what looked like a small spittoon. Around the spittoon\u2019s broad brim were arranged five garnishes, or side dishes, or condiments, including chopped razor clam with celery sorbet and a little pillbox of horseradish jelly.When we were alone again, she sighed and said, \u201cI was hoping for a glass.\u201d The Aviary\u2019s Bloody Mary, by the way, costs $38.We had come to try the daytime menu the Aviary recently introduced after two months or so of nighttime-only business.While the drinks gave us a bumpy ride, all was smooth once we embarked on the three-course, $45 lunch, starting with a roasted squash soup and a salad. Both had pieces of fruit and vegetable that had somehow been talked into tasting like more than they were. Finally there was a sandwich of fried, buttermilk- and yuzu-brined chicken thigh with pickles and shredded iceberg lettuce on a bun with more sesame seeds to the square inch than I\u2019ve ever seen. The dressing was a toasted sesame sauce, and, like everything else about the sandwich, it was excellent.These plates run from $11 to $29. Two or three would make for an interesting postcard from the inside of Mr. Achatz\u2019s head. Ordering the whole roster would leave you a couple hundred dollars poorer and no wiser, though. The menu is not designed for that kind of eating.Neither is the Aviary, although it\u2019s hard to say just what it is designed for. Deals between chefs and hotels invariably entail compromise, but Mr. Achatz and Mr. Kokonas may have given up too much here.There\u2019s no sense of arrival, nothing to suggest you\u2019re entering the domain of a restaurant group that has always refused to do things the usual way.You do get that sense when you enter the Office. The Chicago Office is downstairs from the Aviary; in New York it is behind a wooden door just past the Aviary\u2019s cocktail-assembly station. Suddenly faceless hotel luxury gives way to a den of leather club chairs, parquet floors, clothbound books, manual typewriters, contemporary art, eccentric antiques.The two Offices are usually called speakeasies. This one looks to me more like the library of stately Wayne Manor.The theme is tradition. This being an Achatz project, the theme is pushed to its limits and beyond. Micah Melton, the beverage director of both lounges (in both cities), scours auctions and private sales for old bottles of spirits. Some of the older ones go here for $500 an ounce or more, straight up. Others are mixed into what the menu calls \u201cdusty bottle cocktails.\u201dAs a way to get rid of money, this is both alluring and appalling. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to order a $475 old-fashioned stirred from bourbon bottled in 1969. But I couldn\u2019t resist learning what happens when 75 grams of shaved truffle soak in a bottle of Chartreuse. (It\u2019s fascinating, but not more delicious than untruffled Chartreuse.)The short food menu appears to have been printed by letterpress. On it are a number of time-honored plutocratic pleasures, such as cold oysters, foie gras terrine, and a really fine and forcefully seasoned tartare of ivory-veined rib-eye.Steamed mussels in cream with leeks and bacon are $35. If any pot of mussels is worth that much money, this is it. Vegetable crudit\u00e9s may sound like nothing. They\u2019re very much something, a miniature forest of fruits and vegetables treated this way and that, then set on chipped ice with a dip \u2014 a harmonious, understated vadouvan-squash cream the last time I went.The contortions that Mr. Melton and Mr. Achatz put liquor through at the Aviary are as imaginative as cuisine gets; they probably have more freedom than they would if the place were a restaurant. But rather than asking how a Bloody Mary, say, can be improved, or what its essence is, they seem to ask: How would the Aviary serve it?The answer always seems to require equipment. The bird-all-the-way-out drinks especially are like elaborate magic tricks with metal boxes into which the beautiful assistant will vanish. Somehow, the boxes upstage the assistant. The cocktails at the Office are more like close-up card tricks. My favorite is: Mix me a drink and I\u2019ll make it disappear.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s so cold that the steering wheel hurts to touch. Life plays out under streetlight instead of daylight, and the rest of the world seems twice as far away as it did when the leaves were green.Talk to anybody and the conversation veers into two intertwined ideations: vacation and food.It\u2019s a terrific read, and further proof that if you\u2019re looking for a way to understand a place, sending a reporter to the supermarket is a good place to start.Of course, it\u2019s Wednesday, and you may not want to cook from a recipe at all. Midweek in this shop, we cook narratively, with ideas rather than ratios. We think of it as improvisation off a theme.Today\u2019s is lamb and couscous, with dried fruits and nuts. Just massage a few lamb shoulder chops with salt and pepper, some ground cumin and coriander, cinnamon, red-pepper flakes. (You could use curry powder instead. Or a harissa paste. Something warm in its spiciness, nothing bright or acidic.) Then fry them in a big pot slicked with oil and, when they\u2019re crisp at the edges and still quite pink inside, fish them out and put them on a cutting board to rest.While the lamb\u2019s cooking, chop up a handful or two of mixed cocktail nuts, some raisins or prunes or dried currants or cranberries. Add those to the lamb fat in the big pot with a couple of cups of couscous. Stir that all around over medium heat for a few seconds, and then add two cups of chicken stock. Let it all come to the barest of simmers, then give the pot a final stir, put on the lid, turn off the heat and let it just sit, the hot broth filling out the couscous, the fat and the spices and the fruit giving it flavor.That will take about five minutes, during which you can take the lamb from its bones and cut it into cubes. Mix the meat into the couscous, and serve the pot with torn mint leaves and big glops of Greek yogurt. Start to finish, that\u2019s maybe 20 minutes? You could definitely get on it tonight.Then I\u2019ll push west into the backcountry of the Ten Thousand Islands of Everglades National Park, where there\u2019s no cell reception but snook stacked below the edge of the mangroves. (Hey, that\u2019s work, too!) So I\u2019ll be out of your inboxes until late next week. Tejal Rao will sit in my chair while I\u2019m gone, type beautiful sentences at you and tell you what to cook.

{"Headline": "Unfiltered and Unpretentious: A New, Old Wave in Craft Beer", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo last fall, when Mr. Oxton offered his father-in-law, Anthony DiPalma, a retired New York Police Department lieutenant, a taste of Night Shift\u2019s newest product, Village Lager, expectations were scant.But Mr. DiPalma loved it. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I would drink that all day long,\u2019\u201d Mr. Oxton recalled.He thinks that\u2019s because Village Lager tastes like a familiar mass-produced lager \u2014 only with more flavor. The beer is balanced and bready, with faint bitterness.\u201cNothing stands out, but it\u2019s an incredibly delicious, easy-drinking experience,\u201d Mr. Oxton said. While craft beers can seem exclusive to some drinkers, \u201cthere\u2019s something very un-snobby about it.\u201dVillage Lager is inspired by zwickelbier, a centuries-old style of unfiltered German lager named after the spigot that brewers use to taste still-fermenting beer. In a business brimming with over-the-top I.P.A.s and aggressive stouts, American brewers are embracing German tradition to create beers that they believe can have broader appeal.For centuries, German breweries have made unfiltered beers, from malt-rich lagers to wheat ales evocative of bananas and cloves. Though their alcohol levels are moderate, they have multifaceted flavor; the residual yeast and proteins supply a fuller body and a cloudy hue.Recently, AleSmith has started making kellerbiers, a closely related type of unfiltered German ales and lagers. (They\u2019re named for the cool cellars where the beers were matured, and are often more assertive than zwickelbiers.)Mr. Crisp\u2019s keller-style pilsners and Mexican lagers are fermented for shorter periods of time; yeast and proteins remain in the finished product, floating in suspension. The kellerbiers, served directly from the conditioning tanks at AleSmith\u2019s taproom, have a youthful vibrancy. They are raw and lively without being rough-edged.\u201cThere\u2019s something about the creaminess and different flavors you get,\u201d Mr. Crisp said.With unfiltered beers, freshness doesn\u2019t mean they always taste best on Day 1. The flavors of Mr. Suarez\u2019s yeast-rich lagers evolve over several months.\u201cIt\u2019s a different drinking experience from week to week. At one and a half or two months, they\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d Mr. Suarez said, noting that he favors his own pilsners with one or two weeks of age.Mr. Suarez prefers to describe his lagers as \u201cunfiltered\u201d instead of using the German jargon. \u201cI have this rule that I don\u2019t like to use a foreign word,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the word \u2018unfiltered\u2019 helps convey what the beer is better than the term \u2018zwickel pils.\u2019\u201d\u201cZwickel is just a fun word to say,\u201d said Erik Jensen, the brewmaster at Green Flash, which specializes in flavorful I.P.A.s. The low-alcohol lager filled a void in the brewery\u2019s portfolio, as well as its brewers\u2019 refrigerators. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we could have something we really wanted to drink,\u201d Mr. Jensen said.For American brewers accustomed to lobbing grenades at orthodoxy, producing zwickel and keller beers is especially appealing. What these loosely affiliated beers share is a general approach rather than rigid stylistic guidelines.Consider it a return to more classical methods of making beer. \u201cIf you take the long-range view, that\u2019s what beer drinking has been all about,\u201d said Mark Stratton, Artisanal\u2019s German portfolio manager. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new under the sun, as they say, but this seems new to a lot of people.\u201dHere is a selection of kellerbiers and zwickelbiers to sample.Aromas of warm toast, topped by an herbal bitterness, define this distinguished, smooth lager.This creamy, Bavarian-style lager has notes of dough, honey and grass.English yeast is used in this fruity, caramel-accented ale from a family-owned brewery founded in 1386. (Luxe Brands, New York City.)The lager specialist\u2019s classic rendition balances biscuity sweetness with a spicy pop.Pudding-smooth with a handsome poofy head, this lightly lemony pilsner is a great value.Advertisement"}

Federal ownership of these assets can result in sub-optimal investment decisions and create risk for taxpayers.While the Blackstone Group is raising $40 billion for its own infrastructure fund (half of which is coming from Saudi Arabia), it\u2019s hard to see private investors filling in the $1.3 trillion required to fulfill the Trump administration\u2019s vision.To break it down numerically:\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe recent, complacency-shaking declines in stock prices will have forced investors to take more seriously the yardsticks used to assess whether stocks are worth buying. None of the metrics on their own reliably can predict the direction of stocks, but when markets are freaking out and much is a blur, well-chosen indicators can steady the nerves and clarify the mind.The most important indicator right nowIt\u2019s the 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price. A higher yield reflects greater inflation fears among investors \u2014 and a higher likelihood of that interest rates are going up.Stock investors fear higher interest rates for two main reasons:\u2022 Most immediately, they make stock valuations look less attractive\u2022 In the longer term, they can eventually slow economic growth.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has retreated to 2.83 percent Monday, while United States stocks are trading higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all up more than 0.5 percent.Adding to the funThe government inflation figures come out on Wednesday.The valuation questionThe recent volatility in the stock market has stirred up the valuation debate. Put more directly, did the declines take stock prices down to level where they no longer look expensive?Still, history shows why that might not be the case. In 1997, the rule of 20 gave roughly the same answer as we have now, but stocks kept zooming higher. (Of course, that bull run did not end well. By 2001, the stock market was down below 1997 levels.)If you find the debate over valuation unsatisfactory ...There are also technical indicators, which look at how traders react to a wide selection of market measurements. One of the most interesting right now is the 200-day moving average on the S.&P. 500.But at one point Friday, it looked like that was where things were heading. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, or 2539, before recovering and closing the week above 2619, up 1.5% on the day.The 200-day moving average\u2014the continually updated average price of the past 200 days\u2014is considered a strong measure of investor sentiment. If the S&P 500 had continued to fall below the average, it would have conveyed real bearishness. The S&P 500 hasn\u2019t closed below that moving average in 408 trading sessions, going back to around the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, according to LPL Financial.\u2014 Peter EavisIt really is a remarkable achievement by Fuji. Without putting up any cash, they will acquire majority control and ownership of a venerable American icon. In exchange, we \u2013 the existing Xerox shareholders \u2013 will receive (1) an additional, indirect 25% interest in a Fuji subsidiary that just last year disclosed a $360 million accounting scandal caused by a \u201cculture of concealment\u201d and Fuji\u2019s failure to have adequate management systems and (2) a one-time special dividend financed with our own assets.The backstoryAt the end of last year, Mr. Icahn launched a campaign to unseat the Xerox\u2019s board, and late last month, he and Mr. Deason pressured the company to explore a deal \u2014 including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture.Xerox said it \u201cconsidered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the \u2018best path to create value\u2019 for the company.\u201d\u2014 Stephen GrocerHere are some of Mr. Tan\u2019s comments:On concerns the deal won\u2019t win regulatory approval and Broadcom\u2019s offer of an $8 billion breakup fee if it doesn\u2019t:\u201cYou know, I\u2019m kind of a frugal guy.

{"Headline": "Seeking Humanity in a Prison Passion Play", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are more than two million incarcerated people in the United States. We, the public, have seen countless images of them: Arms laced between rusted metal bars; gloomy faces staring at us, backs against a white wall; bodies shrouded in orange jumpsuits. These images pop up over and over in our cultural lexicon, but do little to make us consider the individuals portrayed. Ms. Fleetwood has now collaborated with Aperture magazine on its latest issue, \u201cPrison Nation,\u201d which features the work of more than a dozen photographers and writers. The issue addresses the role photography can play in creating a visual record of mass incarceration that focuses less on prisons and more on the human beings inside. \u201cA lot of the images we see related to incarceration are destructive,\u201d said Michael Famighetti, Aperture\u2019s editor. \u201cWe looked for projects that highlight individuality within the system from different points of view.\u201d Ms. Fleetwood and Mr. Famighetti said the prospect of giving inmates the power to decide how they appear and how to showcase their humanity was central to \u201cPrison Nation.\u201d Often that power is used against inmates, but with the release of the issue and the lineup of public lectures and presentations in New York and other cities across the country that will follow, they hope to change that. Ms. Luster said the performance was held in the prison\u2019s famed rodeo arena, where she made each portrait backstage, under the bleachers. At one point, a camel was in the next stall. However comical the conditions were at times, none of this is visible in her photographs. Ms. Luster said the inmates changed dramatically after putting on their costumes, completely inhabiting their characters. She was not surprised. After all, prison is the ultimate theater. \u201cYou have to be one person to the guard, you have to be another person if someone is threatening you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are all these characters. If you are going to survive in that environment you have to be an actor.\u201d Discussing the profound change in demeanor she witnessed, Ms. Luster remembers one inmate in particular: Vernon Washington, whose nickname was Vicious. He was a champion boxer, and like the other 70 inmates in the play, serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. By the end of one performance, which is about redemption, Ms. Luster recalled another inmate referring to Vernon by his nickname.

{"Headline": "The Mental Health System Can\u2019t Stop Mass Shooters", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSACRAMENTO \u2014 A few years ago, the police brought a 21-year-old man into the crisis unit where I work as an emergency psychiatrist. His parents had called the police after seeing postings on his Facebook page that praised the Columbine shooters, referred to imminent death and destruction at his community college and promised his own \u201cDay of Retribution.\u201d His brother reported to the police that he had recently purchased a gun.When I interviewed the patient, he denied all of this. He had no history of mental illness and said he didn\u2019t want or need any treatment. My job was to evaluate whether he met the criteria to be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital.Each mass shooting reignites a debate about what causes this type of violence and how it can be prevented. Those who oppose further restrictions on gun ownership often set their sights on the mental health care system. Shouldn\u2019t psychiatrists be able to identify as dangerous someone like Nikolas Cruz, the young man charged in the school shooting last week in Florida, who scared his classmates, hurt animals and left menacing online posts?Mr. Cruz had suffered from depression and was getting counseling at one point. He was also evaluated by emergency mental health workers in 2016, but they decided not to hospitalize him. Why, some critics are demanding, didn\u2019t he receive proper treatment? And can\u2019t we just stop angry, unstable young men like him from buying firearms?The mental health system doesn\u2019t identify most of these people because they don\u2019t come in to get care. And even if they do, laws designed to preserve the civil liberties of people with mental illness place limits on what treatments can be imposed against a person\u2019s will.Here in California, as in most states, patients must be a danger to themselves or others because of mental illness before they can be involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. This is a mechanism for getting people into treatment when they are too deep in the throes of their illness to understand that they need it. It allowed me to hospitalize a woman who tried to choke her mother because she was convinced her family had been replaced with impostors, and a man who had sent threatening letters to his boss because he believed she had implanted a microchip in his brain.But the young man who had written about shooting his classmates was calm, cooperative and polite. The posts, he insisted, were nothing more than online braggadocio. He denied being suicidal or homicidal; he had never heard voices or gotten strange messages from the television. He admitted to having been bullied and was resentful of classmates who seemed to have more thriving social and romantic lives. But he adamantly denied he would be violent toward them.What options did I have? It was clear to me that he did not have a psychiatric illness that would justify an involuntary hospitalization, but I was reluctant to release this man whose story echoed that of so many mass shooters.I could fudge it a little, claiming to need more time for observation, and admit him to the hospital anyway. But within the week he would go before a hearing officer to contest being held against his will. The hearing officer would probably come to the same conclusion I had, that he was not dangerous because of a mental illness, and he would be free to go. The only advantage of this version of events would be that the order to release the man who might be the next mass shooter would not be signed with my pen.Maybe the hearing officer would share my trepidation and commit him out of fear of the alternative. Then the hospital would have 14 more days to treat him.The psychiatrist responsible for his care would know how to treat delusions, paranoia, mania, suicidal impulses, self-injurious behaviors, auditory hallucinations and catatonia. But there are no reliable cures for insecurity, resentment, entitlement and hatred.The one concrete benefit of officially committing him would be that he could be prohibited from buying a gun from any federally licensed retailer. Of course, this would do nothing about any guns and ammunition he may already have amassed. Nor would it deter him from getting guns from private-party sales, which are exempt from background checks in many states.I ended up admitting this patient, and he was released by the hearing officer two days later. He never took any medication, never reached the threshold for a federal firearm prohibition and left the hospital in the same state he arrived in. Like so many of his peers, he will not seek out therapy for the longstanding personality traits that seem to predispose him to violence and rage, and there is no way to impose treatment upon him.The reason the mental health system fails to prevent mass shootings is that mental illness is rarely the cause of such violence. Even if all potential mass shooters did get psychiatric care, there is no reliable cure for angry young men who harbor violent fantasies. And the laws intended to stop the mentally ill from buying guns are too narrow and easily sidestepped; people like Nikolas Cruz and my patient are unlikely to qualify.Instead of hoping that imposing mental health treatment on everyone who shows \u201cred flags\u201d will put an end to mass shootings, we should focus on ways to put some distance between these young men and their guns.Advertisement"}

We mean platforms and passageways that feel like greased-up slip-and-slides.If you\u2019ve wondered what that lubey layer was, you\u2019re not alone.Users responded with anecdotes about face planting in Brooklyn, gingerly tiptoeing through corridors and \u201cskating\u201d in Vans across platforms.People have been hurt. Last month, Chris Wilson, 39, a software developer, needed eight stitches after slipping on the escalator at the South Ferry station.\u201cI wasn\u2019t walking down,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t actually doing anything. My foot just sort of slipped out from under me. It was definitely the slickness on the floor.\u201dWe asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Shams Tarek, a spokesman, said the slippery floors are from the combination of rain and snow tracked in from the street, other substances brought in on shoes, and high humidity in stations that traps moisture.The buildup on the subway floor \u2014 from shoes, trash, spills and exhaust \u2014 contains substances that dissolve in water, like salt and sugars, along with oily compounds, which don\u2019t, explained Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University.You just don\u2019t notice the oily stuff until it rains or snows because it\u2019s caked together on the subway tile with everything else.\u201cOnce you add water, whatever didn\u2019t dissolve is going to be oily,\u201d Professor Kumar said. On nonporous subway tiles, where hardly anything is absorbed, the slick stuff just sits on the surface.As for why floors can seem more slippery on snowy days than on rainy days, Professor Kumar theorized, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to carry snow in on your shoes, so you\u2019ll have more water on the snowy days.\u201d(Update: Some readers have speculated that the M.T.A. has changed the kind of cleaning fluid it uses. It has not, Mr. Tarek said.)For now, the M.T.A. said it would continue to mop aggressively after both snow and rain \u2014 the latter of which is expected to fall for much of the rest of the day.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Speaking of dangerous substances, there are local developments on the Tide pod challenge front.If you are determined to participate in the challenge \u2014 safely \u2014 a few local businesses have come up with alternatives.Jonah Bromwich contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Planners of Deadly Charlottesville Rally Are Tested in Court", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThere is one thing about this case that should be made crystal-clear at the outset,\u201d the suit maintains. \u201cThe violence in Charlottesville was no accident.\u201dThe nine named plaintiffs \u2014 students, clergy members and local residents who say they were hurt in Charlottesville \u2014 have accused the event\u2019s leaders of plotting to deprive them of their civil rights by encouraging their followers to arm themselves and partake in violence. (Heather Heyer\u2019s family is not among the plaintiffs.)The defendants \u2014 an array of neo-Nazis, white identitarians and old-line pro-Confederates \u2014 have ridiculed the charges as an act of \u201clawfare\u201d maliciously intended to silence them and destroy them financially.\u201cThe goal here is to break us and keep us from taking to the streets,\u201d said Jeff Schoep, the leader of the National Socialist Movement. \u201cThat should concern all Americans, no matter where you stand on the political spectrum.\u201dAs the case moves forward, it is likely to explore the limits of the First Amendment\u2019s broad free-speech provisions and the principle that incitements to violence are not protected. Discovery in the case may also expose the links between the far-right groups and their often opaque sources of financing.\u201cI thought you could bring a suit under that same strategy,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said, \u201cagainst the groups in Charlottesville.\u201dMost of the defendants are being represented by two less prominent lawyers: James Kolenich, who is based in Cincinnati, and Elmer Woodard, who works in the Virginia countryside about two hours south of Charlottesville.Before the current case, Mr. Kolenich had never represented a member of the alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and is often anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic and anti-women.In order to prove that a conspiracy existed, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers will have to show that the leaders of the rally worked together in planning and encouraging racially motivated violence. Under the law, if a conspiracy is eventually established, all of its participants can be held accountable for the actions of its separate members.Ms. Kaplan called those leaked communications \u201ca lawyer\u2019s gift,\u201d and she used them in drafting her complaint. They seemed to show a Discord channel for the rally filled with calls for violence.\u201cI\u2019m ready to crack skulls,\u201d one person wrote. Others said they planned to go to Charlottesville with wrenches, pipes and wooden sticks. One man claimed he was going with a cache of rifles that \u201cwill shoot clean through a crowd at least four deep.\u201d There were also plans to shuttle people to the rally grounds in what was called a \u201cHate Van.\u201dOne of the defendants, Michael Peinovich, the co-host of a podcast called \u201cThe Daily Shoah,\u201d downplayed the Discord messages as \u201cidle chitchat\u201d in his motion to dismiss. \u201cEdgy humor and memes are part of Internet subculture,\u201d Mr. Peinovich wrote, \u201cand while some may not understand them, and some may find them offensive, the sharing of such jokes and memes cannot credibly be seen as evidence of a conspiracy to commit violence.\u201dAnother defendant, Richard B. Spencer, one of the country\u2019s most prominent white supremacists, wrote in his dismissal motion that \u201charsh and bold words, as well as scuffles, are simply a reality of political protests.\u201dMr. Spencer, who is representing himself after several lawyers refused to take him as client, went on to say: \u201cFree societies, not only in the United States, but around the world, accept this as a cost of free assembly and maintaining a vibrant political culture.\u201dThe chief planner of the Charlottesville event, Jason Kessler, wrote in an email this month that even though he was initially concerned about the lawsuit, he now considers it an opportunity to \u201cgo on offense.\u201d Mr. Kessler said he plans to use the case to attack the \u201choax narrative\u201d that the right-wing marchers were responsible for the violence.\u201cAfter all the lies about the event are laid out before the public and they realize how badly some very powerful people wanted to shut down our free speech rally,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI think the public will be hungrier than ever to hear what we actually went there to say.\u201dIn a different political climate, Mr. Mehlhorn said, the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division might have investigated and sued the planners of the Charlottesville protest.But, he added, \u201cThese days, we do not expect the Justice Department or government lawyers to pursue any of these actions.\u201dSome experts on far-right extremism question whether the lawsuit will reveal anything beyond what is already known about the far-right groups, that they are hardly rich and tend to crowdsource what money they get.Professor Rosenthal said that rather than ruin the far-right groups, the lawsuit may just push them off the streets and back on to the internet, where they existed quietly for years.\u201cBecause the world is cyber,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s tough to put people entirely out of business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company said that, over a month, its response team had worked with emergency workers more than 100 times.Some health researchers applauded Facebook\u2019s effort, which wades into the complex and fraught realm of mental health, as well intentioned. But they also raised concerns. For one thing, Facebook has not published a study of the system\u2019s accuracy and potential risks, such as inadvertently increasing user distress.\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea and a huge unmet need,\u201d Dr. Steinhubl said. Even so, he added, Facebook is \u201ccertainly right up to that line of practicing medicine not only without a license, but maybe without proof that what they are doing provides more benefit that harm.\u201dFor another thing, Facebook is scanning user posts in the United States and some other countries for signs of possible suicidal thoughts without giving users a choice of opting out of the scans.\u201cOnce you are characterized as suicidal, is that forever associated with your name?\u201d said Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland who studies emerging health technologies. \u201cWho has access to that information?\u201dWill Nevius, a Facebook spokesman, said Facebook deleted the algorithmic scores associated with posts after 30 days. The cases involving emergency responders are kept in a separate system that is not tied to users\u2019 profiles, he said.Facebook said it had worked with suicide prevention groups when developing the effort. Mr. Nevius added that publishing a useful study would be complex because of the difficulty in removing personal data and \u201cthe delicate nature of the posts.\u201dTherapists traditionally diagnose depression by observing patients and asking them how they feel. Mindstrong Health, a mental health start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., is observing people\u2019s smartphone use.The company has developed a research platform to continuously monitor users\u2019 phone habits, looking at changes in taps and clicks for hints about mood and memory changes associated with depression.\u201cWe are building digital smoke alarms for people with mental illness,\u201d said Dr. Thomas R.

The start-up recruited 200 volunteers to participate in pilot studies. Dr. Insel said a few of the signals, like changes in users\u2019 keyboard accuracy and speed, correlated with similar motor skills changes that researchers could measure in lab tests.\u201cWe\u2019ve got these really interesting statistical signals with very high correlations,\u201d Dr. Insel said. \u201cBut whether that\u2019s going to work in the real world of clinical care is something we\u2019re looking at right now.\u201dHe added that Mindstrong had tapped law and ethics experts to help examine the implications of its technology and develop ethical frameworks for using it.\u201cYou want to think through all the unintended consequences early on,\u201d Dr. Insel said, \u201cso they don\u2019t come back to bite you.\u201dThe system uses pattern recognition technology to categorize users\u2019 speech, the company said.

{"Headline": "Russia Wanted Trump to Win. And It Wanted to Get Caught.", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThat Russia should have preferred Mr. Trump\u2019s victory to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s is hardly a surprise: The real estate mogul had long been open in his fawning admiration for autocratic leaders generally and Mr. Putin in particular. But in any game of strategy, the best moves are those that accomplish multiple objectives. Friday\u2019s indictment should serve as a reminder that Project Latkha didn\u2019t merely aim to influence the outcome of the election, but also its tone, and Americans\u2019 attitudes toward their own democratic institutions.The bulk of the Russian team\u2019s online trolling efforts were directed at Mrs. Clinton, but the indictment notes that they also took aim at other, Republican candidates; Mr. Trump, Bernie Sanders and the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, were spared. The trio had something more than opposition to Mrs. Clinton in common: A central theme of their campaigns was that the American political system is fundamentally rigged \u2014 the same claim that had so incensed Mr. Putin.This same theme crops up in many of the Russian front groups\u2019 attacks: \u201cHillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa caucus,\u201d one social media post declared. One of the more memorable stunts the Russian team sponsored \u2014 hiring an American to attend rallies dressed as Mrs. Clinton in prison garb, toting an ersatz jail cell \u2014 fits the same pattern: She had to be cast not merely as an inferior candidate, but as a criminal who could win only through corruption.Mr. Trump was vehemently committed to the same message, not only leading those infamous chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d but routinely declaring that if he were defeated \u2014 which polls throughout the campaign suggested was the most likely outcome \u2014 it would only be because Democrats had rigged the vote.In hindsight, it\u2019s natural to think that Russia\u2019s primary aim was to achieve the upset Trump victory we now know occurred. But if they were relying on the same polls as the rest of the world, they would have regarded that as a long-shot. It seems at least as likely that they hoped a strong showing would position a defeated Mr. Trump as a thorn in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s side, casting a pall over the legitimacy of her administration by fuming publicly about how he had been cheated. (They probably could not have imagined that Mr. Trump would do this even in victory, insisting without any evidence that he had lost the popular vote only because of voter fraud.)If we run with the hypothesis that Russia\u2019s core goal was to sow doubt about the integrity and fairness of American elections \u2014 and, by implication, erode the credibility of any criticism aimed at Russia\u2019s \u2014 then the ultimate exposure of their interference may well have been viewed not as frustrating that aim but as one more perverse way of advancing it.That would be a final irony, and an unpleasant one. No less than our \u201cmeddling\u201d in their internal elections, Russia has long resented United States criticism of the country\u2019s repressive approach to online speech. Their use of online platforms to tamper with our presidential race reads not only as an attack, but as an implicit argument: \u201cThe freedoms you trumpet so loudly, your unwillingness to regulate political speech on the internet, your tolerance for anonymity \u2014 all these are weaknesses, which we\u2019ll prove by exploiting them.\u201dUrgent as it is for the United States to take measures to prevent similar meddling in the next election, we should be careful that our response doesn\u2019t constitute a tacit agreement.Julian Sanchez is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making (Bad) Vinegar at Home: A Critic\u2019s Confession", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI never used to think much about vinegar. The word itself, from the French term for sour wine, suggested it was for the most part something to avoid. I knew it was essential for salad dressings, and I loved malt vinegar with fish and chips, though repeated applications never seemed to yield quite enough flavor.As the wine critic for The New York Times, I understood that good vinegar existed, but I never sought it out. Perhaps I had been scarred by harsh industrial versions, and the cloying knockoffs of balsamic vinegar that had somehow kept showing up in my kitchen.Then, a few years ago, some really good vinegar shook me by the shoulders and said, \u201cLove me!\u201dIt was not store-bought, but made by a colleague, the Times photographer Tony Cenicola, who often shoots the tastings by our wine panel. Afterward, he takes away the half-empty bottles to photograph them. What happened after that, I never thought to ask.Back in 2014, though, Tony told me he had been using the leftover wines to make vinegar. He offered me a bottle he had made from aglianico, a sturdy red from southern Italy. It was superb, gently acidic and subtly flavored, fruity with the mildest lingering bite. For me, this opened up a new world of uses for vinegar, like deglazing saucepans and flavoring braised greens.Still, it took me that entire bottle, and another exceptional one that Tony made from leftover Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9, before it occurred to me that maybe I could make vinegar, too.I certainly had plenty of leftover wine. And Tony had told me there was nothing to it. He had simply put the wine into one-gallon glass jugs, covered them tightly with white cotton cloth and left them on top of his refrigerator for an entire year.With great anticipation, following directions from Supreme Vinegar, I combined eight ounces of the mother with the same amount of water and 16 ounces of red wine to make a test batch. But that seemed not enough wine, so I doubled the amount. I covered the top of the crock with cheesecloth, stretched a rubber band around the rim and left it in a dark corner of our Manhattan apartment. The directions advised leaving it for six to 12 weeks. I was imagining gifts of holiday vinegar for my friends.I gave it five weeks before checking. An enormous amount, maybe half, had evaporated, and the mother had formed a firm crust over the top. The vinegar smelled powerfully acetic and tasted overwhelmingly harsh. Thinking it needed to be diluted, I added another bottle and a half of red wine. Then I left it for another five weeks.More evaporation. What remained was indeed vinegar, but it still tasted overpowering rather than gentle and lilting, like Tony\u2019s. Its intensity hurt, actually. I added another bottle and a half of wine and left it for another month.It was now midsummer, more than three months since I had started. I thought I had better ignore the vinegar for a while. And I tried, but it was hard to be optimistic. For one thing, if I was in the vicinity of the crock, I could smell it. And the smell was as potent as ever. The acid aroma mocked me, eating away at my confidence.Then, in November, eight months from the start, I decided I needed to move it along. I lifted the crock from its corner and was surprised to find underneath it a thick, dark, crusted patch, as if a spill had occurred. Putting the crock in a sink, I removed the cheesecloth. The vinegar was practically all gone, except for the thick, matlike crust of the mother.It could not have leaked. Had it evaporated? Had somebody accidentally spilled it? My wife and I had recently engaged a house cleaner who had left a trail of broken light bulbs and cracked soap dishes as evidence of her efforts. I had a suspicion, though I never got to the bottom of this particular domestic drama.It did liberate me, however, from this failed batch. I was determined to try again, though with Tony\u2019s laissez-faire approach. I scraped away the mother crust, rinsed the crock with wine and filled it. I put it away two months ago.Tony has told me that he finds it hard to use any vinegar other than his own. He has counseled patience. \u201cGive it at least a year to get started,\u201d he said.I\u2019m waiting.Exploring the Sweet Subtleties of Vinegar, by Tejal RaoAdvertisement"}

But investigators didn\u2019t learn that until Dec. 12, when a deputy sheriff contacted the mother by email to follow up.Still, investigators were unable to get in touch with Ms. Martinez.\u201cAs part of procedure, Humboldt County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies are typically required to make direct contact with the missing person to confirm status and well-being, as geographical and other factors allow,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cA deputy was not able to make direct contact with Martinez and she was not removed from the Missing and Unidentified Persons System.\u201dOn Thursday, after the newspaper article was published, a deputy again tried to contact Ms. Martinez by phone, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The deputy spoke to the mother, who said Ms. Martinez had tried to contact the office but was unable to speak to a deputy.Finally, at 2:59 p.m. on Thursday, Ms. Martinez returned the deputy\u2019s call, confirming she was alive and well. She was removed from the system, the sheriff\u2019s office said, though her missing person\u2019s report remained online until Friday afternoon.She is one of nine women who remain in contention for the affections of Arie Luyendyk Jr. on the television show, and she was unavailable for interviews on Friday.

{"Headline": "Exploring the Sweet Subtleties of Vinegar", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Edward Lee was growing up in Brooklyn, his grandmother fermented traditional Korean foods at home to stock the pantry, making her own gochujang and doenjang, along with several kinds of kimchi and rice vinegars.He adds a glug of mushroom vinegar to a dish of smoked mushrooms with potato pur\u00e9e, just before it\u2019s served. He brushes fruity vinegar all over rib-eye steaks and pork, after the meat has been browned and finished with butter.\u201cI use vinegar in everything,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cNot just vinaigrettes. The magic, transformative power of vinegar isn\u2019t in vinaigrettes.\u201dThe Food and Drug Administration requires that what is labeled vinegar contain four or more grams of acetic acid per 100 milliliters. That acid, produced when certain bacteria metabolize alcohol, is what broadly defines vinegar and its flavor \u2014 the sharpness on your tongue, the prickling in your nostrils.But vinegar enthusiasts, including a growing group of chefs and home cooks across the country, have a far more nuanced understanding. And what Mr. Lee makes is only distantly related to the harsh, distilled vinegars used for household tasks, or diluted for basic brines.The word comes from the French vin aigre, or sour wine, but great vinegars can be made from the slow, controlled fermentations of many different fruits, vegetables, grains and syrups. They can be cloudy or clear, mouth-puckering or sweet, fruity or gamy, with endless variations.Mr. Rosenblum sees the uptick of interest in quality vinegar as a part of the home-brewing and fermentation movements \u2014 an ingredient with history, and roots all over the world, that also welcomes creativity.Making your own vinegar isn\u2019t foolproof, but part of its appeal is that it requires little in the way of an initial investment, and few tools. (Though serious vinegar-makers may rely on pH meters and other gadgets, a wide-mouthed jar and a piece of cheesecloth are all you really need to get started.)Vinegar, the result of acetic fermentation, simply requires oxygen, bacteria and alcohol. You can start the process with ready-made alcohol \u2014 a bottle of wine, sake or cider \u2014 or create your own alcohol by fermenting fresh peaches or coconut water. From there, the microbes get to work, turning the alcohol into vinegar.Mr. Lee has a space-saving method at his restaurant. He seals fruit with sugar and water in clear plastic bags and stacks these on sheet pans in the walk-in refrigerator. As the fruit rots, the bags puff. But before they burst open, Mr. Lee transfers the contents to finish fermenting in small two- to three-quart jars.He often draws out the process over several months, until the bacteria start to metabolize the acetic acid itself. Now, the vinegar changes, taking on new layers of flavor. Its sharp edges soften. As it ages, it becomes increasingly mellow.\u201cFor me, good vinegar is something that\u2019s alive,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIt has a good shot of umami; it makes your mouth water.\u201dIn her Dallas apartment, the chef Misti Norris ferments a jumble of vinegars in glass containers and covered oak barrels, in a dark, temperature-controlled nook equipped with a dehumidifier that keeps the vinegars around 65 degrees. Some will mature for a few months, others a year.When she began making vinegar a few years ago, she was giving bottles away to friends in the restaurant business, but as the taste and demand for great vinegar have increased, so has Ms. Norris\u2019s production. She plans to sell her vinegars later this year, including some made from local mustang grapes, passion fruit, peony flowers and figs, as well as collaborations with local brewers, made from sour beers and fruit-infused saisons.She collects food scraps and leftover wine dregs, transforming the miscellany into an array of vinegars, from carrot and tomato to sour cherry and brown bread. The kitchen at Fish & Game uses these bottles, and never fresh citrus, to tinker with the acidity in their dishes, seasoning it on snails roasted with absinthe and garlicky herb butter, or using it to dress winter greens.Ms. Emde works with six-gallon steel drums full of pith, seeds, stems, tops, peels and cores fermenting in a base of wine. She lets the vinegars sour naturally, without a starter, and develop acetic acid over time. But since her production is outdoors, she occasionally takes the spent yeast from previous batches and splashes it around the barn. She says it ensures that the microbes she values, the ones she wants in the vinegars, are thriving nearby.Many vinegar-makers will speed up the process slightly with a mother \u2014 a jellylike disk of acetobacteria and cellulose that may form naturally on the top of a vinegar as it ferments, or can be bought online.The earliest vinegars were likely produced in the Middle East, somewhere along the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. Before refrigeration, there was simply no way to put the brakes on the fermentation process: Ripe fruit produced alcohol, then charged ahead in warm climates, turning to vinegar.\u201cVinegar probably wasn\u2019t a culinary ingredient until around 1500 B.C.,\u201d he said. Around that time, it was used not only as a preservative but also as a flavoring agent, poured over noodles in China, and forming the base of dipping sauces.Once vinegar made the leap, it persisted. Like alcohol, vinegar was refined all over the world in different ways, shaping cuisines as both a preservative and a flavoring. Where nipa palms and coconuts grew, vinegar could be made from sap and water. Where rice and sugar cane grew, it could be made from sake and juice.Ms. Norris, the Dallas chef, emulsifies her vinegar made from foraged Texan grapes into melted butter and uses it like a sauce to dress pasta. The more rounded, fruity vinegars end up in her desserts, like a mustang grape and white chocolate tart, made with sunflower and passion fruit seeds.\u201cI think that balance of salt, acid and fat is what makes people want to eat,\u201d Ms. Norris said. \u201cVinegars can add such subtle nuances, and so much character.\u201d\u201cWhen you have a really beautiful aged balsamic, you drizzle a little on a piece of cheese,\u201d said Ms. Bailey, \u201cand it becomes the star.\u201dWhen vinegar makers get talking, they sound a little like wine lovers. They refer to the expression of the fruit, the structure of the flavors, the complexity of aromas in the nose.\u201cWe\u2019re going from rotten fruit to this beautiful, flavorful, elegant acidic thing that you can drink,\u201d Mr. Lee said. After a decade of making vinegar from scratch, he added, the process remains somewhat mysterious to him. \u201cThings are so scientific, and so standardized in the kitchen. We\u2019ve figured it all out. But not vinegar!\u201dAbout 20 percent of the time, the vinegar doesn\u2019t work out, he said. A spore mold finds its way into the jar, ruining the entire batch. Or the liquid becomes too rich in ammonia or somewhat rancid-tasting, or everything turns the bad kind of moldy.His cooks find vinegar\u2019s lack of certainty irritating, but for Mr. Lee, it only underscores his affection.\u201cEvery time I make a vinegar and it works out, it\u2019s like a minor miracle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m over the moon.\u201dMaking (Bad) Vinegar at Home: A Critic\u2019s Confession, by Eric AsimovcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018An Extraordinary Moment\u2019: Explaining the Russia Inquiry", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow likely would impeachment proceedings be if the Russia investigation uncovers obstruction of justice? Could the inquiry unveil President Trump\u2019s tax returns? Why are anonymous sources necessary to our investigative work?Mark Mazzetti, The Times\u2019s Washington investigations editor, discussed the Russia inquiry in New York on Feb. 13 with fellow Times reporters Michael Schmidt and Scott Shane, and Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at The New School. You can view a recording of the panel below._____However, I said \u201cusually,\u201d and almost everything about this episode is unusual. It would be foolish to try to make predictions with any certainty. The expectation is that Mr. Mueller will deliver his findings to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who will then decide how to proceed from there._____Yes, I would assume that Mr. Mueller has access to any financial documents he wants, including the president\u2019s tax returns. As for \u201cbringing charges,\u201d it is generally assumed that the special counsel won\u2019t bring criminal charges against the president if he finds anything criminal, whether it\u2019s financial crimes or something else. The current Justice Department guidance is that a sitting president cannot be indicted, and most legal experts believe that Mr. Mueller will follow that guidance.Instead, it\u2019s generally assumed that Mr. Mueller would make recommendations to Mr. Rosenstein, who would then pass them along to Congress._____I think your frustration is natural, especially because The Times and other news outlets have been covering an investigation that doesn\u2019t have a clear end. And I agree with you that there is a real danger of creating an anti-Russia hysteria that would be dangerous not only in this country but also overseas.At the same time, I\u2019ll defend the amount of attention that The Times has paid to the Russia story and to Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. It is an extraordinary moment: Intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia took active steps to disrupt an American presidential election, and the Justice Department is investigating whether President Trump or his advisers helped assist that campaign. The investigation has already brought the indictment of the former Trump campaign chairman \u2014 albeit on charges unrelated to Russian collusion \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. during the course of the investigation. These are very significant developments, and reason to keep digging on the story._____It\u2019s still difficult to imagine the circumstances under which the Republican-controlled House of Representatives would move to impeach the president. If Mr. Mueller\u2019s report to Mr. Rosenstein contains evidence of obstruction of justice \u2014 or lays out an argument for why President Trump has broken the law in another way \u2014 then that would certainly increase the pressure on Congress to act in some fashion. If such a report goes to Congress, in theory the House Judiciary Committee could begin impeachment proceedings. Again, that\u2019s very difficult to imagine in the current Congress.If the Democrats retake the House in the November election, then obviously the odds of impeachment proceedings would go up significantly._____The president\u2019s personal lawyers said in November that Mr. Trump had begun to cover his own legal costs. Before then, the Republican National Committee had spent several hundred thousand dollars footing the legal bills.Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has used some of its cash to cover the legal fees for Mr. Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. According to campaign finance filings, the campaign paid nearly $238,000 in July and August to the office of Alan S. Futerfas, the lawyer for Donald Trump Jr._____Many readers raise concerns about the use of anonymous sources, and not just on stories about the Russia investigation. Anonymous sources are not ideal, and we should always try to make available as much information as possible about any motivations or rationale the sources have for remaining anonymous.That said, stories about the Russia investigation \u2014 or any sensitive national security issue \u2014 would not be possible without the use of anonymous sources. During an ongoing federal investigation, much of it involving classified information, sources often will only speak to reporters if they are assured that their names won\u2019t be used. We believe it\u2019s important to get the information they have in order to write stories that get to the facts underlying all the facets of this investigation: from Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the 2016 election, to the contacts between President Trump\u2019s advisers and Russians, to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry.But this doesn\u2019t mean we accept any information, grant anonymity and publish it. We always have to assess the motivations and potential biases of sources, and judge the information they provide against information we get from other sources. Readers need to trust that we don\u2019t publish stories that blindly advance the agenda of anonymous people, and it\u2019s up to us to earn that trust._____Not necessarily. Most legal experts say that colluding \u2014 or working together \u2014 with a foreign power during an election is not illegal in and of itself. Where campaign officials could get into trouble is if they were coordinating with Russia to do something that violates American law. If, for example, campaign officials told Russians to break into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers, then the officials could be in legal jeopardy.__________Your friend is right. The C.I.A. has a long history of so-called influence operations to help favored candidates in foreign elections with money or propaganda, and on a few occasions even helping overthrow elected leaders seen as hostile to the United States. Such operations were more common during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union was often assisting a leftist candidate, and frequently involved open assistance as well as espionage. Election meddling by Americans appears to have become rarer in recent decades, though such covert operations sometimes don\u2019t come to light for years.__________You\u2019re right, there has been vastly more attention paid to what happened in 2016 than what could happen in future elections. That\u2019s true of the media, Congress and most of the rest of the government. Occasionally, members of Congress will speak out about how there needs to be a coordinated focus to prevent the same thing from happening in the November elections and, of course, the next presidential election in 2020, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any comprehensive plan to deal with the problem yet. American law enforcement and intelligence officials have already warned that Russian operations are underway to try to disrupt the 2018 campaign, though it\u2019s unclear exactly what they are seeing at this point.View a recording of our panel \u201cRussia and the 2016 Election: What Lines Were Crossed?\u201d here:Michael S.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 There have been far blacker Mondays.\u2022 Kenneth C. Griffin is growing concerned about inflation.\u2022 The Fed\u2019s regulatory action against Wells may have some bite.\u2022 Broadcom puts more pressure on Qualcomm\u2022 How worried should JPMorgan clients be about health care?\u2022 How much more will Wells Fargo have to do?Measured by points, those are steep drops \u2014 the biggest on record for the indexes. The previous largest point declines for each benchmark came in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.But Monday\u2019s plunge was far less impressive on a percentage basis. The Dow\u2019s fall ranked as its 100th biggest, while the S. & P. 500\u2019s slide was the 127th biggest in the index\u2019s history, according to S & P Dow Jones Indices.Here is how Monday\u2019s sell-off stacks up against two other major tumbles.But points are not the best way to compare the magnitude of a stock index\u2019s declines across eras. As the stock market has risen, big point moves have translated into increasingly smaller percentage changes. The Dow and the S. & P. 500 have more than doubled from their closes on Sept. 29, 2008.\u201cBlack Monday\u201d was a petrifying moment \u2014 an even bigger decline in both points and percentage than the stock market crash of 1929. But unlike the 1929 crash, the slide in 1987 did not contribute to a wider economic slump. The stock market recovered its losses by early 1989.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Peter EavisAs the U.S. stock markets look wobbly for the first time in nearly two years, at least one major investor is sounding a bearish tone.In a Jan. 31 letter to investors, Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago hedge-fund firm Citadel, wrote that even though the broader economic backdrop continues to be positive, he sees several warning signs that could turn stock prices downward.The end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy is one factor, Mr. Griffin wrote, that could pressure stocks. But the prospect of inflation, or a rapid rise in the prices of goods and services, is making him especially nervous.\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the nascent signs\u201d of rising inflation in a variety of countries, he wrote. As a result, he added, money managers at Citadel, which runs a variety of hedge funds, are \u201ccarefully positioning\u201d for a surprise, sharp upturn in inflation.Mr. Griffin added that he is also concerned about geopolitical risks, writing that his money managers need to be able to handle negative events if they do occur, \u201cincluding a trade policy misstep or a military conflict.\u201d He did not elaborate.In an interview with CNBC in November, Mr. Griffin said the stock market was in the \u201cseventh inning\u201d of a rally. He said through a spokesman on Monday that he still thinks there are several innings to go before a downturn begins and that he is more bearish on bond prices than stocks at the moment.\u2014 Kate KellyWith 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.The numbers\u202275 percent of companies are reporting earnings above estimates, above the five-year average.\u2022 Companies that are beating estimates are doing so by a 4 percent margin, below the five year average.\u202280 percent of companies have reported revenue above estimates, a record high.\u2022 All 11 sectors are reporting earnings growth.Wells Fargo\u2019s stock is down more than 7 percent Monday, suggesting that investors believe the growth cap will have some bite. With the economy strengthening and interest rates rising, banks can expect to earn higher profits as they make more loans and suffer fewer losses from defaults. Indeed, this optimistic scenario has helped send bank stocks on a tear in recent months. Now, the question is to what degree Wells Fargo will have to sit out the good times.Wells Fargo executives on Friday suggested that the cap would have limited financial impact, saying it would reduce this year\u2019s net profits by $300 million to $400 million, which works out at less than 2 percent of 2017\u2019s earnings. One reason the earnings hit might be small is that the bank can stay within the cap by selling short-term, lower-risk investments that don\u2019t earn much. Another way the bank intends to limit the negative impact is by reducing the amount of deposits on which the bank pays out a relatively high interest rate.Crucially, Wells Fargo said that it hopes to increase the size of its loan book. The hope is that, by shedding the low-risk investments, the bank will create the room to make more mortgages, credit card loans and loans to businesses, while staying within the limit.But it may not turn out to be as straightforward as that.The growth cap comes after a lackluster year for Wells, which reduced its loans 1 percent last year, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent at Bank of America. Investors waiting for catch-up growth at Wells may have to wait still longer. Also, much depends on whether Wells Fargo can now satisfy the Fed\u2019s concerns. Any indication that the bank is struggling to comply with the regulator\u2019s demands could set off more turmoil at the bank. There is also a possibility that the tactic of shedding of low-risk investments while making more loans could increase the overall risk of Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet.Brian Kleinhanzl, a banks analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote on Sunday that the Fed\u2019s action will \u201cmean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,\u201d adding, \u201cWells will also have to maintain the balance sheet while other banks are growing, and we view this as defensive versus peers.\u201d\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 A takeover price of $82 a share, up from its original offer of $70\u2022 A \u201csignificant\u201d breakup fee if a deal were to be halted for antitrust reasons\u2022 A \u201cticking fee\u201d that Broadcom would pay in cash if a deal took more than a year to closeIt said the new \u201cbest and final\u201d offer would be withdrawn if Qualcomm either pushed its annual shareholder meeting back from March 6 (when Broadcom hopes to unseat the entire board) or if it paid more than $110 a share for NXP Semiconductor.Other cryptocurrencies are falling as well. Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin are all down Monday.How far can Bitcoin fall?Simon Tobler, a trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told Bloomberg: \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold the $8,000 level, Bitcoin may fall to $5,000, where the next big support is. The market is lacking big buyers.\u201dMore from Anna Wilde Mathews, Dana Cimilluca and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:In a reflection of the sensitivity of the subject, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon hit the phones Tuesday to assuage clients\u2019 concerns, people familiar with the matter said. So did some of the firm\u2019s health care bankers, who get paid handsomely to help clients with mergers and other deals and worry the move could cost them business.More from Emily Flitter, Binyamin Appelbaum and David Enrich:The settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.From her interview with Judy Woodruff:\u201cI don\u2019t want to label what we\u2019re seeing a bubble \u2014 as a bubble.\u201cBut I would say that asset valuations generally are elevated, and this is a characterization that we have offered up, for example, last summer in our monetary policy report.\u201d\u2022 Getting bigger by merging with another media company doesn\u2019t solve CBS\u2019s problems.

{"Headline": "How Many People Are Watching the Olympics? NBC Uses a Tricky Head Count", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEach day of the Winter Olympics, NBC reports how many viewers watched the previous night\u2019s coverage, and analysts and television executives try to divine what those numbers mean.But NBC isn\u2019t presenting traditional Nielsen ratings, the television standard for decades. Instead, for prime-time viewing, the network primarily cites a recently created standard of its own making called total audience delivery, or TAD. It takes the ratings from the broadcast channel NBC and cable channels like NBCSN that are showing the Olympics and combines them with viewership across various streaming platforms to produce one number.NBC\u2019s number-crunching is only partly a marketing campaign. It is principally the latest attempt at a valid head count in an industry where no one seems to be able to measure the crowd. Viewers are spread too far and wide, no longer huddled around the TV.NBC also used TAD during the Rio Olympics two years ago, but this is the first time it has sold advertising based on it. Guarantees to advertisers about how many people will watch commercials will be based on TAD, not Nielsen household ratings. As television audiences shrink, that is a big deal for the network, which says its national ad sales for the Winter Games recently passed $900 million. And NBC Universal has committed $8 billion for the media rights to the Olympics through 2032.\u201cAdvertisers now recognize that a viewer is a viewer,\u201d said Dan Lovinger, NBC Sports\u2019 executive in charge of sales. He eschewed the idea that there is a fundamental difference between television and digital viewers. \u201cWhat we are doing now is adding it all together and treating a viewer as a viewer.\u201dFor decades Nielsen produced easy-to-compare measurements of how many people watched a program and what percentage of American households they represented. But an exploding array of technologies \u2014 first TiVo and other digital video recorders, and now streaming players like Rokus, computers and phones \u2014 has fragmented viewing across dozens of different platforms, a large factor in the broad decline in television ratings.With billions of dollars in commercial time at stake, content providers, and especially media companies that own expensive sports rights, have raced to keep up. Scripted programming can have a long shelf life and be sold over time in a variety of ways, but the vast majority of sports is watched live, which means broadcasters need to capture every viewer possible and figure out how to count them.The catch is that they aren\u2019t yet in agreement on how to do that.Nielsen ratings for traditional television are based upon averaging every minute of viewing by a representative panel. NBC combines Nielsen\u2019s measures for its television channels with Adobe\u2019s measurement of streaming data to form TAD.Advertising technology is changing constantly, and Nielsen has to carefully decide when a metric is ready for mainstream adoption. Megan Clarken, Nielsen\u2019s president of United States media (and at one time an Olympic-qualifying long jumper), said that a decade ago the company faced pressure to enter mobile measurement. If it had done so, Nielsen would have been pushing ultimately useless metrics to measure viewing on BlackBerry phones.\u201cWhat we do as a company is we watch for that activity, that evolution,\u201d she said, \u201cand what we aim to do is not be ahead of it, but be with it, and certainly not behind it.\u201dWhile analysts said it was smart of NBC to push its own metric for the Games, it is also the right move for Nielsen to proceed carefully as it develops an industry standard for tracking viewers across a \u201cdizzying array\u201d of consumer devices in the digital world, said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia.\u201cEverybody in the digital video industry is pretty much in agreement that 30 to 40 percent of the ad impressions that are delivered out there don\u2019t really exist,\u201d said Mr. Morgan, whose firm works with brands on targeted TV ads. \u201cYet nobody would say 30 to 40 percent of TV\u2019s viewing audience doesn\u2019t exist. So I think Nielsen is very, very afraid of going into a Wild West environment where it is wide open to fraud and bots.\u201dAccording to Nielsen, while measuring authentic digital viewing is difficult, it is no more difficult than doing so for television. But despite the ambiguity of the measuring sticks, advertisers don\u2019t want to miss an opportunity to impress a mass audience over 17 days.\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily want to sit on the sidelines because, \u2018Hey \u2014 funky measurement,\u2019\u201d said Gibbs Haljun, managing director of media investment at GroupM, the media-buying arm of WPP. \u201cThat sort of defeats the point of what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201dWhile NBC sees a strong need for better measurement of non-television viewers, especially in sports, it won\u2019t necessarily be rolling out TAD across the NBC universe. The Olympics are a unique property, with thousands of hours of programming playing out on broadcast and cable channels, unlike a hit drama like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d which would never be shown across a broadcast and cable channel simultaneously.\u201cYou look at the Olympics in Rio and you look at the kind of decline in linear television viewing and the supplement of digital viewing, either simultaneous or delayed, and it is obviously a material difference,\u201d said David Cohen, president of North America at Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm.So far, TAD seems to be doing its job. Across the first four nights of the Olympics, ratings for NBC only were down 15 percent from the comparable nights in Sochi four years ago. But the total audience was down just 7 percent. NBC said it is meeting its ratings guarantees, and has begun selling extra ad inventory that it had held back in case of falling short.Mr. Haljun said that the timing is right for NBC\u2019s metric this year, but doesn\u2019t see it as a long-term solution.\u201cWe\u2019re at this weird point where people agree there needs to be a certified third-party number that\u2019s comparable across networks,\u201d Mr. Haijun said.\u201cBut we\u2019re in the early days of getting there,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are doing different things and have disagreements on the best way to do this.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the event in which Megan Clarken qualified for the Olympics. It was the long jump, not the high jump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Businesses Look at Washington and Say, \u2018Never Mind, We\u2019ll Do It\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisCan private businesses solve public policy problems better than the government? It\u2019s a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House.There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success \u2014 a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school \u2014 there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be.In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dJoining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care?In announcing they would try, they delivered an implicit rebuke of the complex and costly American health care system, suggesting that the best minds in business could do better.\u201cCompanies are now thinking much more about how to solve larger social problems,\u201d said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. \u201cWhen Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, three leaders in their industries, looked around, they realized that health care is a big issue facing them all.\u201dTheir efforts stem from a feeling that, with partisan bickering and constant campaigning consuming Washington, the onus is on businesses to fill the void left by an ineffective government.The notion that big business might shape government policy is nothing new, of course. Lobbyists have been working to sway lawmakers for decades, and the corporate world was an influential force in the tax overhaul passed last year.Yet for the most part, these efforts were narrowly aligned with a company\u2019s self-interest, usually in the form of lowering taxes and loosening regulations. And rarely have business leaders tried to assume operational control of a government function, let alone something as complex and unwieldy as health care.In recent years, however, more chief executives have begun speaking out on issues that at first glance have little to do with the bottom line, including immigration policy, climate change and gay rights.\u201cThe lack of leadership on the national political level has left this vacuum,\u201d said Kathleen Clark, a professor at the Washington University Law school. \u201cFortunately, there are some business leaders who see that there\u2019s a role for them to play.\u201dThe most vivid expression of this new willingness to speak out came last summer after white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Trump equivocated in his response to the violence.Chief executives may seem like unlikely ethical leaders; Wells Fargo, Equifax, Uber and many more companies have faced questions from Congress about practices that have harmed consumers and in some instances cost taxpayers billions of dollars.But companies have also been wading into moral debates for decades. General Motors and Pepsi pulled out of South Africa during the apartheid era. Apple, Disney and Xerox were early in extending health care benefits to gay and lesbian couples.Similar efforts by chief executives today recall \u201can earlier era of corporate statesmanship,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a fellow at New America, a research and policy institute. \u201cA lot of these business leaders viewed a business as having a somewhat broader public mission.\u201dNow, he said, thanks to \u201cthe rise, over the last 15 years, of the importance of social responsibly and social mission, there is a broad movement in business.\u201dEven Amazon\u2019s much-publicized efforts to select a city for a second headquarters could, in a roundabout way, influence local policymakers. Given that the company is unlikely to set up shop in a state with socially conservative laws that might alienate some employees, \u201cAmazon could have an effect not just on prices but on what legislators pass,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.George Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has been promoting democratic ideals around the globe. And Mr. Zuckerberg, through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, is working on ambitious long-term projects involving science, education and justice.There is a big difference, though, between supporting social causes and research and operating a sprawling public works system. Critics will contend that some of these efforts smack of arrogance, and that businesses ought to stay in their lane and focus on offering excellent products and services, not meddle in public policy.\u201cThere is this hubris, thinking that they can do it better,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.There is also a certain irony to the fact that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan said the new company they had formed would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dThe profit motive, after all, is what leads to efficiency and innovation, according to conventional business school wisdom. Operating as a nonprofit \u201cflies in the face of the logic of the capitalist economy,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.It most likely will take years to determine if the three companies can make good on their promise of building a better health care system. Even if they succeed, the rewards may be limited to their employees \u2014 a large figure, but a small portion of the American work force.Nonetheless, the companies\u2019 push is among the most audacious efforts by the private sector to date, and Mr. Dimon did not shy away from the scope of their ambition.\u201cThe three of our companies have extraordinary resources,\u201d he said on Tuesday when the initiative was announced. \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But just one piece of respectful advice: If your generation and mine want to get serious about a gun control crusade, we all need to get out of Facebook and into someone\u2019s face: the N.R.A.\u2019s.This fight can\u2019t be won on Twitter or Instagram. They do get people into the streets. But social media have created a world of faux activism \u2014 \u201cHey, I tweeted about it\u201d \u2014 that the bad guys take advantage of. The N.R.A. is not just in the chat rooms. It\u2019s in the cloakrooms of Congress and state legislatures. And it\u2019s there with bags of money and votes it uses to reward lawmakers who do its bidding and hurt those who don\u2019t.I loved seeing the 100 students from your high school taking buses Tuesday to Florida\u2019s capital to directly press lawmakers. That\u2019s a great start. I hope every high school follows.But, ultimately, nothing will change unless young and old who oppose the N.R.A. run for office, vote, help someone vote, register someone to vote or help fund someone\u2019s campaign \u2014 so we can threaten the same electoral pain as the National Rifle Association, which, according to PolitiFact, spent $203.2 million between 1998 and 2017 funding its candidates, defeating gun control advocates and lobbying. This is not about persuading people with better ideas. We tried that. It\u2019s about generating raw electoral power and pain.Because most of the G.O.P. members of Congress who do the N.R.A.\u2019s bidding care about only one thing: their jobs. The pay of a typical congressman is $174,000 \u2014 and free parking at Reagan National Airport \u2014 and they will sell themselves to whoever can generate the votes to enable them to keep both.Are some Democratic lawmakers cowards, too? You bet. But I can show you plenty who have bucked their party\u2019s orthodoxies on education and trade and who insisted that their much-admired colleague Senator Al Franken had to resign over sexual harassment allegations. And most of them have long dared to lose elections to oppose the N.R.A. This is primarily a G.O.P. problem today.How do we know that? Read the paper or the web. The G.O.P., which claimed to stand for conservative family values, has prostrated itself before the most indecent person to ever occupy the White House \u2014 a man who lies as he breathes, smears poor, nonwhite nations and reportedly had sex with a porn star shortly after his wife delivered their son. But G.O.P. lawmakers are mute on this because President Trump energizes their base and ensures their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport.This is a party whose evangelicals have been telling us for decades that life is so sacred the G.O.P. must oppose abortion \u2014 even in the case of rape, incest or risk to the mother\u2019s life. But Republicans won\u2019t back common-sense gun laws that would protect fully developed human beings \u2014 because the N.R.A. energizes their base and funds their campaigns and ensures their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport.This is a party whose \u201cFreedom Caucus\u201d was so obsessed with our rising national debt that it tried to prevent Barack Obama from spending a dime to stimulate our economy after it went deep into recession \u2014 but just voted to add $1 trillion to the debt for a corporate tax cut without regard for the burden put on our kids. Republicans did so because Trump energizes their base and ensures that they keep their $174,000-a-year jobs and free parking at Reagan National Airport.Trying to embarrass them to act on principle is wasted breath. I suspect they\u2019re already embarrassed. When these G.O.P. lawmakers are alone at home contemplating the pictures of all these kids gunned down in Florida \u2014 thinking about what it\u2019d be like to be one of their parents \u2014 plenty of them probably feel filthy for doing the N.R.A.\u2019s bidding.They know full well that most voters are not asking to scrap the Second Amendment, but for common-sense gun laws that could prevent or reduce more school shootings and would not interfere with any decent Americans\u2019 right to own guns for hunting, sports or self-protection.They know full well that a common-sense banning of all military assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, or mandating universal background checks for gun buyers or to prevent terrorists and the mentally ill from buying guns, would not curb the constitutional right to bear arms.They know full well that they\u2019re in the grip of an N.R.A. cult, whose heart is so frozen, it\u2019s content to watch innocent children and adults get gunned down weekly \u2014 rather than impose common-sense gun limits. They know all of this \u2014 but they suppress it, because they also know if they vote for common-sense gun laws, the N.R.A. will fund their next opponent. Like I said, this is just about raw naked power, and that is what sensible gun control advocates have to generate more of now \u2014 in the form of votes and campaign funding. Otherwise nothing changes.Keep speaking out, Cameron \u2014 but never underestimate what some people will do for a $174,000 job and free parking at Reagan National Airport.Frank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Most Afghans Can\u2019t Read, but Their Book Trade Is Booming", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Nuts come in from Iran and fresh fruit from Pakistan, even though Afghanistan grows both in abundance. Years of bloated foreign aid budgets have produced high salaries, destroying local industries. As a result, about the only thing the country does not import is opium.And books.In a turbulent, troubled society, curling up with a book has become the best tonic around.Unsurprisingly, Afghanistan\u2019s book publishers have capitalized on this. What is more noteworthy is that a major piece of Afghan socioeconomic development is happening without direct foreign aid or foreign advisers.\u201cIt\u2019s an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led process,\u201d said Safiullah Nasiri, one of the four brothers who run Aksos, a book publisher that also operates several bookstores in Kabul. His remark was a deliberate play on international community jargon about shifting to Afghan control of institutions dominated by Westerners.\u201cIt\u2019s really an exciting time in the book world here,\u201d Mr. Nasiri said. \u201cPublishers are all trying to find new books to publish, young people are trying to find new books to read, writers are looking for publishers. It\u2019s a very dynamic atmosphere. And it\u2019s something independent, with no foreign assistance.\u201dKabul, the capital of Afghanistan with a rapidly growing population of more than five million, now has 22 book publishers, many with their own presses, or using the presses at local printing houses. Scores of others are scattered throughout the country\u2019s 34 provinces, even in war-torn areas like Helmand and Kandahar.In the past year, especially, many publishers have been expanding, opening up distribution centers across the country and underwriting either their own bookstores or providing consignments to independent bookstores. Kabul has 60 registered bookstores, according to the government.In the years after the American-led invasion, cheaply printed and brazenly pirated books from Pakistan were as dominant as that country\u2019s fruits and vegetables in the markets of Kabul.Foreign aid underwrote the school system, so the textbook business jump-started the book publishing industry. Because millions of textbooks had to be printed in a short period of time, Aazem and a few other companies invested in their own presses, which went largely idle once the school publishing season was over. Then the new publishers began translating Western books from English into Dari and Pashto, the country\u2019s two main languages.Other publishers sprung up, renting the bigger companies\u2019 presses.\u201cThere was this huge pent-up demand from so many years without new books,\u201d said Dr. Ajmal Aazem, a pediatrician whose father founded the publishing house that bears their name. The Aazem company is publishing books as fast as it can, limited only by a shortage of qualified translators from English into local languages. Aazem\u2019s 2017-18 goal is to print three new titles a day, 1,100 a year \u2014 a huge number for any publisher.The publishing house is festooned with life-size posters of recent book covers, and the bookshop is full of volumes in artfully arranged helical piles or displayed on the walls with English and Persian versions opening from right and left, side by side. The floor in the middle of the sales room has been raised to accommodate the presses on the floor below, making a sort of platform with comfortable armchairs.Piracy remains endemic. On a recent day, even some of the titles in Aksos\u2019 own busy, flagship bookstore were pirated copies of popular books.Publishers are worried. \u201cOn a lot of our books, we\u2019ll sell 1,000 copies, and the pirates will sell 4,000 copies of the same book at lower prices,\u201d Dr. Aazem said. \u201cThe government needs to do more to stop this.\u201dGovernment officials have started enforcing the country\u2019s long-ignored copyright laws, according to Sayed Fazel Hossain Sancharaki, who is in charge of publishing at the Ministry of Information and Culture. \u201cIn the last four months we\u2019ve had four or five copyright cases,\u201d he said. One photocopy shop was closed recently by the government for running off copies of printed books.Realizing that \u201cThe Envoy,\u201d the 2016 memoir by Mr. Khalilzad, the Afghan-American who was the United States ambassador to both Afghanistan and Iraq, would be a big seller here, Mr. Aazem rushed to acquire the Dari and Pashto rights. He was determined to offer a better-quality book at a narrow markup and flood the market before the pirates could do so. But Aksos managed to print a Pashto version first, without rights to it, selling 1,000 copies in three days, he said.Mr. Nasiri, the owner of Aksos, which is also translating a new title every week or so, denied that his company printed pirated books. And he, also, complained about piracy. \u201cWe do have copyright law in Afghanistan, but no one seems to know that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, serious problem.\u201dAksos recently began commissioning original books, too, including \u201cBaghdadi Pir,\u201d a historical novel in Pashto about a British spy in the 1920s during the time of King Amanullah.Mr. Nasiri admitted that his bookstores stock many pirated volumes, even if they do not pirate books themselves.\u201cWe are actually against that, but since almost all books are pirated, we have no option but to accept pirated copies and sell them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do that, it will make business hard for us. This is happening all over Asia.\u201d\u201cWe invested heavily in that book and printed it beautifully, then kept the cost as low as possible to defeat the pirates,\u201d Dr. Aazem said. Promotional posters were distributed to bookstores, showing the avuncular Mr. Spanta, and billboard space and airtime were purchased to advertise it.\u201cAfghan Politics\u201d was out for about a month, however, when an electronic file of the book began circulating on Afghan social media accounts.Furious, the publishers at Aazem closed their doors in protest, hanging black curtains in all the windows and idling the presses until the government promised to pursue book pirates. They\u2019re still waiting.Jawad Sukhanyar and Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The Internet Research Agency alone had a staff of 80 and a monthly budget of $1.25 million. On the advice of a real, unnamed grass-roots activist from Texas, it had focused its efforts on swing states like Colorado, Virginia and Florida.Staffers bought ads with messages like \u201cHillary is a Satan,\u201d \u201cOhio Wants Hillary 4 Prison\u201d and \u201cVote Republican, Vote Trump, and support the Second Amendment!\u201dThey created hundreds of social media accounts on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other sites to confuse and anger people about sensitive issues like immigration, religion and the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 in some cases gaining hundreds of thousands of followers.They staged rallies while pretending to be American grass-roots organizations. A poster at one \u201cpro-Clinton\u201d rally in July 2016 read \u201cSupport Hillary. Save American Muslims,\u201d along with a fabricated quote attributed to Mrs. Clinton: \u201cI think Sharia Law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.\u201dAs the election drew nearer, they tried to suppress minority turnout and promoted false allegations of Democratic voter fraud. The specialist running one of the organization\u2019s Facebook accounts, called \u201cSecured Borders,\u201d was criticized for not publishing enough posts and was told that \u201cit is imperative to intensify criticizing Hillary Clinton.\u201dAfter the election, they continued to spread confusion and chaos, staging rallies both for and against Mr. Trump, in one case on the same day and in the same city.All along, they took steps to cover their tracks by stealing the identities of real Americans, opening accounts on American-based servers and lying about what their money was being used for. Last September, after Facebook turned over information about Russian ad purchases to the special counsel, a specialist named Irina Kaverzina emailed a family member: \u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity (not a joke). So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues.\u201d Ms. Kaverzina continued, \u201cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\u201dFake news, indeed.Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders, desperate to exculpate him, seized on a single word \u2014 \u201cunwitting\u201d \u2014 that the indictment used to describe certain \u201cmembers, volunteers and supporters of the Trump campaign involved in local community outreach\u201d who had interacted with the Russians.It\u2019s true that, as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in an announcement, these particular indictments do not allege that any American knew about the influence campaign, nor that the campaign had changed the outcome of the election. But that\u2019s quite different from saying that there was no collusion or impact on the election. As Mr. Rosenstein also said, the special counsel\u2019s investigation is continuing, and there are many strands the public still knows little or nothing about.Remember, Mr. Mueller has already secured two guilty pleas, one from Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser and another from a former campaign adviser, for lying to federal authorities about their connections to Russian government officials. He has also charged Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his top aide, Rick Gates, with crimes including money laundering. Mr. Gates appears to be nearing a plea deal himself.Advertisement"}

Even if the commission recommends the name change, it will need the approval of city hall. The Kremlin is likely to have a say, and given its desire to improve relations with the United States, it might well scrap the idea.The chance that the city might consider a change, however, unleashed a tsunami of alternative suggestions and commentary on social media sites.They included a slew of streets and alleys named after foreign leaders who have clashed with the United States: the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un; Fidel Castro of Cuba; and Arab leaders whom the Russians consider to have been murdered under the auspices of the United States, like Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Saddam Hussein of Iraq.Colin Powell\u2019s Tube was an odd street name inspired by the infamous United Nations speech the former secretary of state gave in 2003 to validate the American invasion of Iraq, in which he presented pictures of tubes in the desert that were said to be evidence of weapons of mass destruction. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were also mentioned.Like many such games, this one appears to be another wrinkle that has returned from the grave of the Cold War as diplomatic relations have suffered.In the 1980s, United States congressional leaders renamed the area in front of the Russian Embassy in Washington \u201cSakharov Plaza,\u201d to protest the detention of Andrei D. Sakharov, the famed Russian dissident, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and nuclear physicist.Such moves are not limited to Russia, either.Last year, the Iranians also named the street where the Saudi Arabian Embassy sits after Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a clerical leader from the Shiite Muslim minority who was executed in the kingdom.During the Vietnam War, India once changed the name of the street outside an American diplomatic mission to honor Ho Chi Minh.The announcement about \u201c1 North American Dead End\u201d also provoked criticism from opposition members and others who suggested that the name game was at best childish.\u201cThe tribute to the memory of the Russian politician in Washington is perceived as a rebuke in Moscow,\u201d Mr. Gudkov wrote on Facebook. \u201cOur government is ashamed, and so they take revenge in a petty way.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Is Not Tom Brady\u2019s Epilogue", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro FootballMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 The duel was over and a younger, unlikely gun by the name of Nick Foles was at the podium in the M.V.P. room. Tom Brady knows that piece of real estate well. He had occupied it \u2014 no, owned it \u2014 after four superb performances in his five Super Bowl victories.But now Brady was relegated to the other side of the room, 30 yards away and separated by a bolt of fabric hanging from the ceiling deep inside U.S. Bank Stadium. The news media horde that scuffled and pushed before him was cranky.How, the reporters asked in a dozen different ways, could the New England Patriots lose to a Philadelphia Eagles team with a backup quarterback?Brady remained unflappable, just as he had been while throwing for 505 yards and three touchdowns over the previous four hours in a back-and-forth 41-33 loss.Brady\u2019s head swiveled to a questioner.\u201cWe never had control of the game,\u201d he said.He looked the next one in the eye.\u201cThey played better than us,\u201d he said.Then, the grenade was lobbed: \u201cWill you be back next year?\u201dBrady, 40, let his lip curl into a semi-smile and searched in the vicinity from where it had been tossed.\u201cI expect to be back, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, trying to beat back his irritation.Ultimately, he could not.\u201cIt\u2019s 15 minutes after the game ended,\u201d he said. \u201cHave to process this a little bit. Don\u2019t see why I wouldn\u2019t be back.\u201dThere it was out in the open: the question that will consume worried New Englanders throughout the off-season.Brady did nothing to diminish his standing over 60 minutes of football. Trailing by 22-12 at halftime, he led the Patriots on three straight touchdown drives. He pinpointed his receivers like a sharpshooter at a carnival arcade, beating back the Eagles\u2019 celebrations each time they seemed to have put the Pats away.There was little doubt during much of the game that Brady was the best player on the field. That\u2019s no knock on Foles, who finished with 373 passing yards and three touchdowns (plus a fourth he caught himself) and who, most important of all, brought Philadelphia its first Super Bowl championship.Foles all but levitated with joy afterward. He showed up for postgame interviews with his shoulder pads still on and an aw-shucks smile on his face. Heck yeah, he had been nervous.\u201cI\u2019ve never been here before,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there are normal nerves \u2014 you\u2019ve got butterflies. It\u2019s a big game. It doesn\u2019t get any bigger than this. But I felt good, felt calm. I think the big thing that helped me was knowing I didn\u2019t have to be Superman.\u201dBut Foles, 29, was Superman \u2014 at least for one day. He knew it, too, and tried to explain how it felt. \u201cTime does stop,\u201d he said.Don\u2019t tell Brady that.Brady had prompted the postgame questions about his return by making no secret that he intended to play the game for a long time.It became a distraction, and because Brady brought on that distraction, he got crosswise with his coach, Bill Belichick, who rules his team with a firm hand.

But the strain was showing.New England\u2019s usually free-spirited tight end Rob Gronkowski acknowledged that he was considering retirement. He will turn only 29 during the off-season, but he has a long injury history, including a hit to the head in the A.F.C. championship game that sent him to the sidelines and threatened to keep him out of the Super Bowl.\u201cI am definitely going to look at my future, for sure,\u201d Gronkowski said. \u201cI am going to sit down the next couple weeks and see where I am at.\u201dLeave it to Brady to sum up his and his team\u2019s discomfort.\u201cLosing sucks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to be world champs, you have to play in this game.\u201dNo matter what anyone thinks, he knows time hasn\u2019t run out on him.An earlier version of this article misstated the Patriots\u2019 deficit at halftime.

{"Headline": "Limiting the Influence of Tech When You Report on It", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Natasha Singer, a technology reporter for The Times in New York, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.You report on digital privacy, health and education technology. What are your most important tools for doing your job? For people who would rather not reach me through my corporate Gmail account at The Times, I use ProtonMail, an encrypted email service. I also use Signal, an encrypted text messaging and calling service. And I do some online research through Tor, a browser that masks your online address so sites can\u2019t track your physical location. I also use DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn\u2019t store your search history.My wariness of tracking developed when I was a cub reporter in Moscow. On one of my first stories there, I invited a Russian legislator, who was a democracy advocate, to lunch at a restaurant near the Kremlin. She arrived and immediately started combing through a vase of flowers on the table, checking for government listening devices. After that, I often interviewed Russian democracy activists during walks in local parks and forests.It made an impression on me that even the mere idea of being surveilled can chill people\u2019s behavior.Now I view privacy not so much as the ability to keep your personal details away from prying government agencies or companies. Privacy is the right to choose which entities access information about you, control how those entities use your data, check the fairness of data-based decisions made about you, and correct errors.One tool I use on my laptop is Disconnect, a service that shows you the third parties tracking you on every site. When I was reading articles this morning about the Trump administration, Disconnect counted 78 advertising networks, analytics services and others tracking me on HuffPost; 24 trackers on The New York Times site, and 19 on The Washington Post.What could be better about some of these tools?ProtonMail can be cumbersome. The service encrypts your emails before they reach the ProtonMail server. As a result, you can\u2019t search the texts of your emails for keywords if you use the free service. You can search only the subject lines.It\u2019s a constant reminder that ceding to online surveillance is much more frictionless than trying to limit it.Even small user-interface changes could make a big difference. Imagine if the default setting for streaming video services wasn\u2019t autoplay.On a larger level, we\u2019ve seen over the past year how some Big Tech companies initially refused to take responsibility for the spread of fake news and other side effects of their innovations. In that context, platforms that nudge children and adults to stay online are merely one symptom of a much bigger problem.There\u2019s huge hype around the idea that tech can improve education. Same goes for health.So far, however, there\u2019s not much rigorous evidence that learning apps on their own improve students\u2019 educational results. Likewise, there is little hard evidence that health apps by themselves reduce disease.Still, I\u2019m optimistic about the potential for software in health.That\u2019s partly because a few tech companies are participating in rigorous studies, called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, researchers randomly select some volunteers to try a new intervention. By comparing the results in the treated and untreated groups, researchers could identify apps that do make significant health contributions.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your daily life? Right now, my family is on a bit of a Brit TV binge. We just watched the second season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d the fictional series on Queen Elizabeth II, and \u201cThe Coronation,\u201d a glowing documentary featuring the real QE2. And we raced through \u201cPrime Suspect: Tennison,\u201d the prequel to the classic TV police procedural that starred Helen Mirren.Are you doing anything unusual to limit the spread of your data?It may seem quaint, but I still relish the idea that people in a democratic society have the right to be anonymous in public. I think Americans should be able to attend political protests or drive to the grocery store in our pajamas without being recognized by government agencies or companies.Advertisement"}

People are stupid in many different ways, and so too must be the reaction shot Mr. Santos was filming for Giphy, the company that is the best-known purveyor of GIFs, the seconds-long soundless video clips that give people a shorthand to express an emotion or reaction through their phones or computers. Most GIFs are pulled from movies, television shows and other media events. But here at Giphy Studios, the emphasis is on creating original content.\u201cHow about a \u2018shake my head into a face palm,\u2019\u201d said Wallis Millar-Blanchaer, one of the studio\u2019s associate producer and director.It also is a new marker of that increasingly atomized American achievement: fame. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve made it when you\u2019re a GIF,\u201d Mr. Santos said.GIFs (pronounced like \u201cgifts\u201d without the T) are now so ubiquitous that even non-techies in their 40s recognize them when shown on a phone. (\u201cOh those!\u201d they will say. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve see them on Facebook.\u201d) Some 300 million Giphy daily users are sharing 2.5 billion GIFs per day through Twitter, Tinder, text messages, Slack, Gmail and, as of recently, in Instagram stories, said Brad Zeff, the chief content officer of Giphy.In some cases, Giphy Studios asks such companies to help cover production costs; for other brands, it offers the service for free. GIFs featuring actors, musicians and other \u201ctalent\u201d are also made for free, with Giphy staff members assessing pop-cultural relevance in deciding who should get such star treatment.Giphy, which was founded in 2013 and has raised about $150 million from venture capitalists, is still \u201cpre-revenue,\u201d to use start-up parlance. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to turn revenue on in earnest prematurely,\u201d Mr. Zeff said.Part of its strategy is to make this Los Angeles studio a hub for actors, musicians and social-media influencers on promotional tours, where they will film reaction shots based on terms that Giphy users often plug into search boxes. The dissemination, it is hoped, will make them \u201cGIF-amous.\u201d\u201cI really want it to be a stop on a press tour,\u201d said Samantha Scharff, Giphy Studios\u2019 C.E.O., offering a tour of the space. \u201cYou go to \u2018Kimmel.\u2019 You go to Giphy.\u201d There is a miniature golf course that winds through the office and most of the conference and meeting tables double as Ping-Pong tables, as is de rigueur at start-ups. Pillows on couches are stitched with \u201cLMAO\u201d and \u201cOMG.\u201d There are a few different filming rooms, including one with a brick wall that the staff thinks of as its \u201cNew York stage.\u201dAnd upstairs is a steep slide that visitors are encouraged to try. You never know where GIFs might happen. \u201cWe wanted people to come here and hang out and make content,\u201d said Ms. Scharff, whose career path has tracked the decreasing attention span of viewers (from \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d to \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d to producing YouTube videos, to Giphy).It is a risky strategy; part of the appeal of GIFs is that they are organically referential to collective nostalgia for previous pop-culture touchstones \u2014 not choreographed and overtly promotional. She and Mr. Zeff, however, have high hopes that they can change the form from a repurposed clip of existing content into an entertainment medium in its own right. \u201cWe want to be the MTV of the messaging generation,\u201d he said.\u201cHow about a \u2018You are awesome\u2019?\u201d Ms. Millar-Blanchaer said. Then: \u201cLet\u2019s do a \u2018You Got This!\u2019\u201dMs. West posed gamely and emoted as directed.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like an acting exercise,\u201d she said.For nonactors, preening in front of a camera with directors calling out emotions to convey merely with facial expressions and gestures can be cringe inducing.The idea was to make GIFs connecting to \u201cinternet holidays,\u201d which tend to be popular among Giphy users \u2014 in this case National Doughnut Day, Pizza Day, Beer Day, Video Game Day/Gaming Day and Earth Day.Mr. Bruno asked if anyone would object to these. \u201cWe have no reservations or moral compass whatsoever,\u201d one of the bandmates said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do anything.\u201d The group laughed.

President Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner\u2019s news network, CNN, and said before the election that the deal should be stopped.The bigger pictureCecilia Kang of the NYT: For the first time, and after much protest, public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of the chief executive. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed nearly eight years ago, required the disclosure, and firms are now disclosing it in proxy reports for 2017.Companies, lobbyists and some compensation experts spent years criticizing the rule, arguing that it revealed little about pay trends and was of little use to shareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning think tank, on Tuesday noted that Honeywell was the first United States corporation to release the ratio. The company\u2019s C.E.O., Darius Adamczyk, had a total pay package of $16.8 million in 2017, which was 333 times the pay of the median employee.The rule allows certain companies to exclude some foreign employees from the calculation of the ratio. Honeywell excluded workers from several countries where pay is most likely lower than in the United States. \u201cThe 333:1 ratio that Honeywell is reporting most likely would be even wider if Honeywell took all its workers into account,\u201d the Institute said.\u2014 Peter EavisA federal judge in Manhattan, in a brief order, rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Mr. Cohen and his firm, Point72 Asset Management, to temporarily seal a complaint filed last week by Lauren Bonner, an employee of the firm. Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer had asked the judge to seal the lawsuit, which alleges the firm underpays female employees and fosters a hostile workplace for women, pending the resolution of another motion to push the matter into arbitration.Judge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the request to seal the entire complaint was \u201cnot narrowly tailored\u201d and was inconsistent with the \u201cpresumption of public access\u201d to court records.Lawyers for Mr. Cohen had sought to seal the order because it contained details of other employees\u2019 compensation packages. The lawsuit also detailed a testosterone-fueled \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d atmosphere in which men commented frequently on women\u2019s bodies and belittled their abilities.\u2014 Matthew GoldsteinAndrew writes:More from the column:There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note over the weekend shed some light on the answer.\u2022 \u201cCompanies have pointed to a modest increase in investment as one destination for the incremental cash flow from tax reform.

Over the past 2 \u00bd months, S.&P. 500 firms have announced $171 billion of buybacks, $67 billion of which has come this year, a 22% increase from the same period in 2017.In the same note, Goldman also took a closer look at this earnings season.By many measures, corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in the past decade. Goldman points out:\u2022 Companies in the S.&P. 500 are set to report that profit grew 15 percent last quarter. That\u2019s the fastest pace since 2011.\u2022 The percentage of companies beating estimates is at its highest level since 2010. The percentage beating sales forecast is at its highest since 2004.But the stock reaction to S.&P. 500 companies either beating or missing expectations \u201chas been muted relative to history.\u201dThe reason? Investors are more focused on tax reform and earnings forecasts for 2018, Goldman writes. Analysts have raised their 2018 earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 by 7 percent so far this year.Some contextHigher profit margins because of the lower corporate tax rate are driving much of the increase in this year\u2019s earnings forecast. A point that becomes clearer by looking at 2018 sales estimates. Analysts have increased their revenue forecasts by only one percentage point and much of that increase comes from higher oil prices boosting forecasts for energy companies.Remember when the company said that it was changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea and shift its corporate focus to virtual currencies?\u2022 Long Blockchain has named a new C.E.O., Shamyl Malik.\u2022 It plans to spin off its beverage division into the publicly traded Long Island Brand Beverages by June 30, and the company\u2019s last C.E.O., Philip Thomas, will be on the new business\u2019 board.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cWe\u2019re making real progress putting our unique assets to work to serve customers in all the ways they want to shop.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedIn real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.The tech flyaroundThe new offer may have come at an opportune time: I.S.S., the influential proxy adviser, recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for four of Broadcom\u2019s six board nominees.

{"Headline": "Election Losses Test Sri Lanka\u2019s Leader, and the Country\u2019s Direction", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the country\u2019s first postwar national government has stagnated, with the governing coalition partners at each other\u2019s throats. Suddenly, the local vote has become a referendum on the national government\u2019s performance.And, to an extent, the results of the elections may signal what direction the island nation takes in its still-fragile transition from decades of a civil war that killed as many as 100,000 people before it ended in 2009.Mr. Rajapaksa, speaking from his hometown, Tangalle, congratulated his supporters and asked them to celebrate their victory peacefully. Some members of his party went so far as to say that the \u201cpeople have abolished the mandate\u201d of the governing coalition and called on the government to resign.Mr. Sirisena came to power in 2015 with the help of an unlikely coalition of minority groups and as the face of Sri Lankans\u2019 hope that power would be decentralized, the military and corruption would be reined in, and some of the country\u2019s wounds from the long war would be healed.But he has not delivered on his promises. And now, critics say, his party\u2019s apparently miserable performance in the local elections \u2014 against opponents accused of corruption and abuse \u2014 means that the president has missed his chance to carry out his reform agenda.\u201cThis election has made it clear that that window has been closed,\u201d said Jayadeva Uyangoda, former head of the political science department of the University of Colombo. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to open that window again.\u201dMr. Sirisena has led an uneasy coalition government, which he established with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe\u2019s United National Party in 2015. As the local elections neared, the differences between the two leaders spilled out into the open, with the president frequently attacking United and accusing it of holding back his agenda.That bickering ended up helping Mr. Rajapaksa, who had never stopped mobilizing in the wings.\u201cOver the past two years, the coalition government did not do anything significantly new,\u201d Mr. Uyangoda said.\u201cThey had very open disunity, and particularly during the last month of the election campaign, the signal they sent was that this is a government of chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, the people then want a strong government. And Rajapaksa is the candidate for a strong ruler, for the stability of governance.\u201dWhile the voting on Saturday went smoothly in a country that has experienced violent elections, the Election Commission was slow to release results, as parties demanded recounts in many localities.The results released so far, and information broadcast by the local news media, suggested that out of 341 local councils total, Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s S.L.P.P. won 225, the United National Party won 41, and Mr. Sirisena\u2019s Sri Lanka Freedom Party, or S.L.F.P., along with smaller allies, got 14.For the first time in the country\u2019s history, Sri Lanka required parties to field at least 25 percent female candidates in the elections, hoping the quota would increase the number of women on local councils, where they hold just 2 percent of seats.Although the impact of the quota was not immediately clear, some neighborhoods reported increased victories by women. Colombo, the capital city, was expected to get its first female mayor after electing Rosy Senanayake, the current deputy head of the prime minister\u2019s office and a former winner of the Mrs. World Pageant.\u201cIt should be 50 percent women, really,\u201d said Dulani Paranawithana, 20, a first-time voter. \u201cBut that is difficult to imagine.\u201dBoth governing parties were in soul-searching mode, struggling to figure out their next moves and make changes in time to make sure Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party does not ride discontent with the government to victory in the presidential election in 2019. Coalition members were clear that both ruling parties were facing a wave that would be difficult to reverse.Members of Mr. Sirisena\u2019s team said the president would shake up his cabinet in the coming days.\u201cThis election is a setback, but the majority of Sri Lanka is still anti-Rajapaksa,\u201d said Rajitha Senaratne, Mr. Sirisena\u2019s health minister. \u201cThis election has shown that despite everything, the January 8, 2015, coalition, which changed the political culture in this country and ousted the Rajapaksa regime, has remained intact.\u201dMr. Seanartne said the election results showed that the combined votes of all other parties, which essentially joined hands in 2015 to defeat Mr. Rajapaksa, were still more than Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party\u2019s.But it was not clear how Mr. Sirisena, long seen a political survivor, could emerge from this political bind.For decades, he and Mr. Rajapaksa were both S.L.F.P. loyalists, and Mr. Sirisena served as the party\u2019s general secretary for 13 years. In 2015, Mr. Sirisena left the party to run against his own incumbent leader, projecting himself as a unifier above party politics, but soon after becoming president, he took over the party leadership, as well.Mr. Rajapaska\u2019s wing of the party then formed a new party, the S.L.P.P. In hopes of peeling away some of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s support, Mr. Sirisena has backtracked on his own promises of fighting corruption and reining in the military.To many observers, Saturday\u2019s elections showed that not only had Mr. Sirisena failed to make a dent in Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s support base, but his confused signals had cost him much of his own.Advertisement"}

But he\u2019s dealing with a familiar problem: a disagreeable Borough Council.Supported byTINTON FALLS, N.J. \u2014 The new mayor here looked gleefully down at the 6-month old girl, the daughter of a councilman, but opted against the traditional political peck on the baby\u2019s cheek \u2014 it was the germs, he said.Of course, there is not much that is traditional about this first-term mayor, Vito Perillo. He is a 93-year-old World War II veteran who had never held elected office. His campaign consisted largely of knocking on every door in town, accompanied by his campaign manager, and wearing out two pairs of shoes in the process. And he defeated a two-term incumbent who had been involved in the borough\u2019s government for nearly two decades.His surprise victory last fall gave him a national profile \u2014 even Lester Holt of NBC came for an interview. Tinton Falls, a quaint town of roughly 18,000 people five miles inland from the Jersey Shore, was quickly in the spotlight, and it had its new mayor to thank.But now, after several weeks in office, he is running into the kind of traditional problem that plagues mayors across the country: a disagreeable Borough Council.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of pushback, but things are getting better now,\u201d Mr. Perillo said. He had expected to be able to appoint his choice for borough administrator and borough attorney quickly, but the Council was not moving as fast as he hoped.It took more than a month, but he finally has his administrator, Michael Skudera, though he is still waiting for the borough attorney to be approved. He calls his experience with the Council a \u201cbothersome thing,\u201d but chalks some of it up to a political miscalculation.\u201cWhen I ran for mayor, there were two people who ran for Council unopposed, and that was a big mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I should have had two people run with me \u2014 at least I would have had two people on the Council that I could count on.\u201dTinton Falls has a nonpartisan government so the Council does not caucus as political parties or proclaim allegiance to Republicans or Democrats. Mr. Perillo is a registered Republican, though he said that was because of a single vote long ago, adding that he has always been an independent.The battle with the Council has quickly enveloped the entire town. Mr. Perillo\u2019s supporters have launched a Facebook group to back him, while his campaign Facebook has also been pushing his arguments.Soon, hundreds of people were flooding the normally staid Council sessions, loudly cheering on their new mayor. It elicited a rare emotion from Mr. Perillo: surprise.\u201cI don\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public was doing more than I was. There were people who thought I wasn\u2019t being treated fairly.\u201dSome Council members have described their early dealings with Mr. Merillo as \u201cchallenging,\u201d attributing it to the mayor\u2019s inexperience.\u201cHe is very new at politics, and the things that go on in the internal side of it,\u201d said Christopher Pak, a councilman. \u201cBut he\u2019s working hard toward making it work.\u201d\u201cI wanted to find out what was going on actually,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of ticked me off a little bit.\u201dSo he made up his mind to run. Or, more precisely, walk.\u201cI asked a previous mayor, I says, \u2018Mayor so-and-so, how\u2019d you get elected, what was your secret?\u2019\u201d explained Mr. Perillo.\u201c\u2018Vito,\u2019 he says, \u2018You gotta walk.\u2019\u201dIn a stroke of luck in a campaign marked by good fortune, Mr. Perillo\u2019s campaign manager, Steve Leech, was a former postal worker. Perhaps no one was better suited to canvass the 15-square-mile borough.\u201cWe didn\u2019t really see the point of mailing a flier out if we could walk them to people\u2019s doors,\u201d said Mr. Leech, 60, who has also been Mr. Perillo\u2019s next-door neighbor since 1992.So the two men with no political experience (Mr. Leech says did technically serve as campaign manager for a student council president in high school \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m two-for-two now\u201d) set out for a monthslong walkabout.Sometimes they just left fliers, while other times visits led to extended conversations. Mr. Perillo was always proud to end an encounter with a handshake, a grip that even after 93 years \u2014 38 of them as an electrical engineer for the Department of Defense, plus a tour in the South Pacific during World War II \u2014 can still crack a knuckle.His vigor, he says, comes from keeping his body in motion. He tries to play golf at least two times a week, though he laments that he uses a golf cart now, and considers himself a consistent player (\u201cSometimes I wish I could hit it like him,\u201d said his grandson, Mike Perillo-Gentile). Mr. Perillo also belongs to the local Y.M.C.A., regularly completing a demanding circuit of \u201cabout 10 to 12 machines.\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today, is because I keep active,\u201d he said.His campaign was a sparse operation \u2014 aside from Mr. Leech, he relied on his family, especially Mr. Perillo-Gentile, who managed a lot of the online efforts and helped book his interviews. The two men are close; Mr. Perillo was the best man at his grandson\u2019s wedding last October. Though he passed on the bachelor party, he gave a \u201cstandup comedy shtick\u201d toast that Mr. Perillo said had the crowd shouting his name.\u201cThere\u2019s more pictures of him on the dance floor than of me and my wife,\u201d Mr. Perillo-Gentile said.A month after the wedding, it was time to get to work running the town. Except no one had an instruction manual.\u201cI think when he won it was kind of like, \u2018Oh this is really cool,\u2019 but then the next day it was, \u2018Oh, what do you do, we don\u2019t really know how to do anything,\u2019\u201d Mr. Perillo-Gentile said.So Mr. Perillo helped form an advisory team and laid out his plans. The newly minted mayor, who earned an M.B.A. from Fairleigh Dickinson University, was eager to delve into the town\u2019s $24 million budget.\u201cFor the first year, hopefully, I don\u2019t want to see any increase in the budget,\u201d he said. \u201cNo increases. I want to hold the line on the budget, and I hope I can do that.\u201dHe acknowledged that he has some tough negotiations to tackle that may affect the town\u2019s bottom line, including a new contract for the Police Department. But he has surprised people before \u2014 starting with the fact that he is in this position in the first place.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t think I could win I wouldn\u2019t have run,\u201d Mr. Perillo said, before adding, \u201cBut that\u2019s not completely true. I would have run anyway.\u201dFollow Nick Corasaniti on Twitter: @NYTnickcAdvertisement"}

The huge new government demand for credit could push up interest rates in the markets. The Fed may be fine with that, given that it is expected to raise interest rates this year.

{"Headline": "Sinclair Deal With Tribune Hits Complications in Washington", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intent to buy Tribune Media in a blockbuster merger last May, the company predicted that regulators would quickly wave through the deal.At issue is how much power Sinclair, the country\u2019s largest broadcaster, will have over local media markets and national television audiences. Sinclair has argued that by combining forces with Tribune, it will be able to bolster local news coverage and be a stronger competitor to internet giants like Facebook and Google.The Justice Department is concerned that the merger will harm competition in several cities. The agency is looking at whether the deal could also give Sinclair too much power over television advertising and over licensing deals with cable and satellite companies that retransmit their broadcasts.John Newman, a professor at the University of Memphis and a former antitrust official at the Justice Department, said previous big radio mergers \u2014 similar in many ways to the Sinclair-Tribune deal \u2014 had been approved by the Justice Department without a lot of focus on how consumers were harmed.The treatment of the Sinclair deal, he said, shows that \u201cthe D.O.J. is getting more aggressive and looking at consumer welfare, too.\u201dThe Justice Department and Sinclair declined to comment.The two sides are expected to come to an agreement eventually, according to three people familiar with the negotiations who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.The F.C.C. is reviewing the merger separately from the Justice Department, focusing on whether the deal is in the public\u2019s interest. The agency is widely expected to approve the deal.Last week, in an attempt to move closer to a resolution, Sinclair submitted a proposal to sell stations in big markets including New York and Chicago, as well as some smaller stations. The proposal would put many of the stations in trusts, an arrangement that has raised some concern from consumer groups that the company will try to operate them through partners down the road, because it runs some stations that way now.The Tribune stations in New York and Chicago would not go into a trust, but Sinclair said it had reached agreements to sell those stations to third parties that it would partner with later. Selling them will help Sinclair get near an important threshold: owning stations that reach no more than than 39 percent of American households, the limit under F.C.C. rules.In addition, Sinclair\u2019s new plan has not satisfied the Justice Department, which still seeks more divestitures, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation.The government\u2019s demands are an unexpected setback for Sinclair, which predicted its proposal would be met by more sympathy from regulators in the Trump administration.Sinclair\u2019s initial confidence was partly buoyed by a string of regulatory victories last year at the F.C.C., including the relaxation of a television ownership limit last April that enabled its $3.9 billion merger with Tribune.Analysts had expected more corporate consolidation under President Trump, but the Justice Department\u2019s response to Sinclair\u2019s proposed deal for Tribune instead underscores a surprising skepticism toward big corporate mergers, particularly those involving the media industry. In November, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner because of concern that the union of telecom and media giants would have too much power over streaming video entertainment.\u201cClearly, the D.O.J. has honed in on the dangers of concentrated transmission and concentrated media content markets that is harmful to competition and to consumers,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of the public interest group Public Knowledge and a former senior antitrust official the Justice Department.The biggest sticking point for Sinclair appears to be how many stations it would need to sell in order to get its deal approved.In its new proposal, Sinclair asked that it be able to keep multiple stations in greater Greensboro, N.C., greater Harrisburg, Pa., and Indianapolis. The company said it should be able to have two of the top four stations in the local markets after the F.C.C.\u2019s action last November to relaxed rules barring too much concentration among top stations.Sinclair\u2019s filing of an amended plan last week could indicate that the company believes it is close to a resolution with the Justice Department and that it is confident enough to start the process moving again at the F.C.C.The list of divestitures Sinclair proposed in its amended plan could still change, Marci Ryvicker, a senior analyst with Wells Fargo, said.\u201cWe do not believe that this is the final list of the station divestitures,\u201d Ms. Ryvicker wrote in a research note last week.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Our Reporter Uncovered a Lie That Propelled an Alt-Right Extremist\u2019s Rise", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCovering white supremacists poses difficult challenges for Times journalists. Are we simply providing a platform for them to recruit followers and spread hate? Are we casting a sympathetic light on people who should only be condemned? We believe that reporting on racism, anti-Semitism, and the people and groups who espouse them is a crucial responsibility for journalists today. By investigating an emerging leader in a growing extremist movement, we hope to offer Times readers and viewers a deeper understanding of the people and forces behind these groups.__________I had pictured the phone call going a lot of different ways, but I hadn\u2019t quite prepared for this.I thought he might swear at me and then hang up. Maybe he would try to turn the conversation around, attacking me and the credibility of The New York Times. Or maybe he would become contrite and emotional, and finally answer some real questions. But I never thought he would just deny it.As a reporter and video producer, I had been following Elliott Kline, a.k.a. Eli Mosley, for almost five months at this point. He played a key role in organizing the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., where a 32-year-old woman, Heather Heyer, was killed and about 20 others were wounded when a white nationalist drove his car through a crowd of counterprotesters.Eli was in his mid-20s, from a middle-class suburban home, and he had led an unremarkable life, up until the Charlottesville rally launched him forward within the ranks of the loosely organized white-nationalist movement. He rose from a self-described \u201canonymous Twitter troll\u201d to head of one of the largest groups in the so-called alt-right.\u201cI came to the realization around the inauguration that we must take this from an online activist movement to a real-life activist movement,\u201d he told me. \u201cI decided that was my calling.\u201dAfter a few phone calls, Eli agreed to give me an on-camera interview, at Richard Spencer\u2019s apartment in Alexandria, Va. Spencer, 39, plays the big brother to many teenagers and 20-somethings drawn to the alt-right, and his one-bedroom apartment has become a frat house for white nationalists passing through the D.C. area. When I was there, a steady stream of young men (and an occasional woman) flowed in and out. Although Eli lives less than an hour away, he often crashes there on late nights spent drinking and planning the next event. He proudly told me he always gets the couch, while others sleep on the floor.After a short time filming behind the scenes with Eli and his associates, a theme emerged. He kept emphasizing a connection between the military and the alt-right. He said many of his compatriots were veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who had become disillusioned with the American political system after fighting in unwinnable conflicts. In his telling, members of the alt-right were patriotic Americans who had come to their extreme worldview through honorable life experience, not hatred.He mentioned that he too had served in Iraq. But when I asked him to elaborate, he waved off the question. \u201cIt was boring.\u201dBoring? I had heard soldiers say they experienced periods of boredom on deployment, but I had never heard anyone sum up time in a war zone that way. I emailed the Army to verify details of his service. While I waited to hear back from them, my colleagues and I combed through alt-right podcasts in which he talked about his life.The podcasts were laced with the most abhorrent racist vulgarities I had ever heard. Not only did they reveal more about Eli\u2019s war story, but they also gave me insight into how he talked before he became media conscious and sanitized his message. With me, he insisted that the media unfairly applies labels like white supremacist and neo-Nazi to members of the alt-right \u201cto browbeat white people out of identity politics.\u201d But in the podcasts, recorded less than a year ago, he and his friends were unabashedly racist and anti-Semitic. He also spun tales of being embedded with the Iraqi Army, of being on the lookout for Chechen snipers, and of killing \u201cmuds,\u201d a racial slur for Arabs.When I got paperwork back from the Army and the National Guard confirming that he had never deployed, I was not surprised. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t believe he would lie so boldly, first to his fellow members of the alt-right and then to a Times reporter, on camera.His parents declined to speak with me, but I called some of his former friends and fellow soldiers, who told me Eli had wanted to deploy but his timing was off: He graduated from high school in 2010 and went straight on to a couple of semesters of college; by the end of 2011, the last troops had left Iraq. They also confirmed that Eli\u2019s unit in the Pennsylvania National Guard did not deploy anywhere else during the roughly six years he served, and neither did he.I wanted to give Eli a chance to respond to my findings, and I pondered the different ways I could bring it up. I was nervous about confronting him in person. What if he attacked me and my filmmaking partner, Andrew Michael Ellis, upon realizing that he had been found out?I talked with The Times\u2019s security consultant, who helped me outline a contingency plan. But in the end I didn\u2019t have to worry, because he said no to another on-camera interview. Didn\u2019t I have enough material by now, he asked?So I picked up the phone and called him. After informing him that I was recording the call, I launched right in.\u201cThe Army tells me that you did not deploy.\u201dHe paused. \u201cThe Army tells you?\u201dI explained that I had gotten his official records from the Army and the National Guard.\u201cSo did you go to Iraq?\u201d I asked.\u201cI was in Kuwait,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you that before.\u201d\u201cYou told me you went to Kuwait and then you went to Iraq.\u201d\u201cBasically, it\u2019s very similar the way it works,\u201d he said.We talked for a while longer and his story kept changing, but he did not back down. He wavered between blaming a military clerical error and saying that a military form he would send me would clear up the confusion once and for all.He still hasn\u2019t sent me the form, or any other proof that he deployed. He also doesn\u2019t have any photos. (He had already told me that he lost them all when his Facebook account was shut down.)Like many of his peers, Eli was already using an invented name (Eli Mosley was inspired by the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley). So why not make up a few autobiographical details, especially ones to boost his reputation?The movement itself also relies on falsehoods. It includes Holocaust deniers and pseudo-intellectuals who spout unsubstantiated theories about the science behind racial difference. In order to reach mainstream Americans, white supremacists have learned to cloak their racism in disorienting terms like \u201cwhite identity politics.\u201dDeception is baked into the alt-right, so Eli Mosley is a perfect match for the movement.videoAdvertisement"}

It shut down briefly on Friday for the second time in three weeks. Maybe it should just stay closed for good.Let corporations pick up the slack! In fact they\u2019re doing that already, with an innovation and can-do ambition sorely absent in Washington.It was also a roaring, blazing sign of our times, in which the gaudy dreams and grand experiments belong to the private sector, not the public one, and in which the likes of Musk or Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos chart a future for our species beyond our stressed-out planet. NASA no longer leads the way.Lehane noted that democratic governments are designed to proceed with caution, but the pace of change in a digital world of automation and, now, artificial intelligence is brisker than ever. The nimbleness of corporations gives them an edge over hoary, complacent institutions, including those in higher education. Corporations\u2019 creep into that sphere is looking more and more like a sprint.\u201cI think enterprises like Amazon and Google are going to build universities that teach coding and things the nation needs,\u201d Margaret Spellings, the president of the University of North Carolina System, recently told me. Spellings was education secretary under President George W. Bush.Corporations have long been engines of innovation, sources of philanthropy and even laboratories for social policy. But the situation feels increasingly lopsided these days. I\u2019m struck, for example, by the intensity of conversation over the last year about what Facebook and its algorithms should do to stanch the destructive tribalism in American life. It\u2019s true that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s monster has badly aggravated that dynamic, in part by allowing its platform to be manipulated by bad actors. But so has Washington, and we seem less hopeful that it\u2019s redeemable and likely to shepherd us to a healthier place.But companies\u2019 primary concern isn\u2019t public welfare. It\u2019s the bottom line. I say that not to besmirch them but to state the obvious. Their actions will never deviate too far from their proprietary interests, and while tapping their genius and money is essential, outsourcing too much to them is an abdication of government\u2019s singular role. What\u2019s best for Amazon and what\u2019s best for humanity aren\u2019t one and the same.\u201cWhether they do it in the collective interest or in their own is very much in question,\u201d Summers told me. \u201cI use as a parable for a lot of things what happens in developing countries, where the urban electric system doesn\u2019t work well, and therefore the businesses start building their own generators to take care of themselves, and therefore there\u2019s no longer a constituency or pressure to fix the existing electricity system, and meanwhile the society is falling apart.\u201dThere may be something for all of us in Musk\u2019s rocket launch.

Trump himself has framed it this way. When asked about his coming health exam last month, he said, \u201cIt better go well, otherwise the stock market will not be happy.\u201d He used the same phrase when talking about his hard-line position on immigration.Yet, neither of those men held the market out as hostage to a backward agenda and a deranged personality. Trump is running a bottom-line presidency \u2014 as soulless as a Kremlin bot on Facebook \u2014 in which people who know better are asked to stay quiet in exchange for a short-term payoff.Modern presidents, dating at least to Ronald Reagan, have urged voters to ask one question going into pivotal elections: Are you better off than you were before? It\u2019s a reasonable standard. But it has never been the leverage for allowing a democracy to collapse.You heard some uplifting words during the State of the Union address, words with all the staying power of vapor from a sewage vent. But a more honest assessment of what this presidency represents came from Trump when he was in his element, surrounded by Mar-a-Lago cronies. \u201cYou all just got a lot richer,\u201d he told a bejeweled and pink-faced crowd just a few hours after signing the $1.5 trillion tax cut in December.Even as Trump spoke before Congress on Tuesday, he monetized the speech, with donors paying to have their name live-streamed across a Trump campaign web page.A cartoon in Politico showed a naked Trump with a king\u2019s crown and a golf club walking down a red carpet. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d one man says to another. \u201cJust keep thinking about your stock portfolio.\u201dEvangelical Christians were among the first to sign on to a Stormy Daniels proposition. In the infamous words of Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, Trump gets a \u201cdo-over\u201d for the infidelity allegation. Yes, because nothing says family values like a thrice-married man who allegedly cheats on his latest wife just after she gives birth to their son. And Pat Robertson, the mush-headed moralist who still fogs up many a television screen with his gaseous utterances, told Trump last summer, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of everything you\u2019re doing.\u201dFor these self-appointed guardians of the soul, the bargain is bigger than 30 pieces of silver: It\u2019s a promise that Trump will continue to protect their tax-exempt empires, in the name of religious freedom.For Republicans in Congress, the pact is more consequential. They will ignore the pleadings of career law enforcement officials in order to stoke fantasies of a deep-state coup against the president. These politicians are counting on a base that will look the other way as they undermine Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian tampering with the election.It\u2019s a good bet. After Trump called the American justice system \u201ca joke\u201d and \u201ca laughingstock,\u201d after he fired the F.B.I. director because he would not pledge loyalty to him, after he told another top lawman that his wife was \u201ca loser,\u201d after he referred to members of the intelligence community as \u201cpolitical hacks,\u201d it was all quiet on the Republican front.But what happens if the bargain crumbles? What if the market tanks \u2014 as the Dow did in losing more than 500 points a few days ago? Do the sycophants bail? Or do they hold out for something more \u2014 like the lobbyists now drafting legislation and gutting regulations that affect the companies that pay them?Beware, those of you who have made your deal with the Stormy Daniels presidency. You can take your settlement money \u2014 as the people who signed up for the fraudulent Trump University did \u2014 but you still got suckered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mississippi Firebrand Appears Set to Challenge Republican Senator From Right", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 State Senator Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat an incumbent senator in 2014, is expected to announce this week that he will challenge Mississippi\u2019s junior United States senator, Roger Wicker, testing the potency of an anti-establishment message in the Trump era.After months of speculation about his intentions, Mr. McDaniel said in a Facebook video Monday night that he would reveal his decision at a hometown rally in Ellisville, Miss., on Wednesday, the day before the filing period to run in 2018 comes to an end.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a fight, and I can\u2019t wait for you to be on my team again,\u201d he said in the video.Yet even as Republicans familiar with his planning said that Mr. McDaniel would take on Mr. Wicker, there is still uncertainty about which of the two Mississippi Senate seats Mr. McDaniel will ultimately attempt to claim.But Mr. Bryant has firmly refused to offer any such guarantee, and when approached by a reporter at a meeting of the National Governors Association here this weekend, the governor smiled and said: \u201cI think Senator Cochran is doing a great job.\u201dSo with no promise of an appointment, no certainty Mr. Cochran will resign and a filing deadline looming, Mr. McDaniel has returned to his original plan of challenging Mr. Wicker, a mild-mannered and establishment-aligned lawmaker.But Mr. McDaniel is not without assets. He is well known among the state\u2019s conservative activists thanks to his 2014 run, when he outpolled Mr. Cochran in the first Republican balloting, and already has a \u201csuper PAC\u201d airing radio ads and lining up field staff to help his campaign.\u201cMississippi deserves a constitutional conservative who holds the same values as Mississippians and is a consistent and strong voice for them in Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Tommy Barnett, the treasurer of the Remember Mississippi super PAC. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to support a McDaniel run. Bring it on.\u201dThe group had raised over $1 million as of late last month, winning support from a few major Republican donors including the Illinois industrialist Richard Uihlein.To many veteran Mississippi Republicans, though, the specter of yet another bloody Republican primary, whether against Mr. Wicker or for Mr. Cochran\u2019s seat, is stomach-turning.Joe Nosef, who was the state party chairman during the 2014 race, is close to Mr. Wicker but related by marriage to Mr. McDaniel. Noting that he stepped down from his post this past fall, Mr. Nosef said, \u201cWhen I think of the things I\u2019m going to miss about being state chairman, this race, if it happens, isn\u2019t going to rank at the top, middle or bottom of that list.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russian Curler Drops Doping Appeal Ahead of Decision on Closing Ceremony", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlexander Krushelnytsky\u2019s decision on Wednesday to waive a challenge comes as the I.O.C.\u2019s executive board prepares to decide on whether to lift its suspension on the Russian Olympic Committee before the closing ceremony of the Games, which would allow Russian athletes to parade in their own colors, a privilege denied at the start of the Olympics.\u201cIt would be stupid to deny it after two tests proved positive,\u201d he had said before the ruling, in comments reported by the Russian news agency Tass. \u201cThe samples tested had been collected during the Olympic Games, and I am ready to face the verdict that is usually announced in such cases.\u201dKrushelnytsky denies knowingly taking meldonium, a heart medicine that increases blood flow. Russia has opened a criminal investigation into the circumstances that led to the failed tests.Levitin declined to comment when asked about the meeting with Bach.The I.O.C. said in December, when it announced a series of penalties against Russia, that it would consider lifting the suspension for Sunday\u2019s closing ceremony, should Russia act within the \u201cspirit and letter\u201d of its conditions, which included paying a $15 million fine and making a commitment to adhere to the global antidoping code.Russia has resisted paying the fine, with officials there saying it would only be made should there be guarantees of no further sanctions against Russia.The I.O.C. sought to play down the significance of the meeting between Levitin and Bach. Its chief spokesman, Mark Adams, describing the visit as nothing more than \u201ca four-minute birthday meeting\u201d for Levitin, 66, who remains close to Putin and has been discussed as a possible candidate to replace Vitaly Mutko as deputy prime minister. Mutko has been barred for life from the Olympics over his purported links to the doping program.\u201cIt was four minutes,\u201d Adams said to reporters about the meeting between Levitin and Bach. \u201cHe wished him happy birthday. They may have talked about something else in that four minutes, but I really don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s wait and see.\u201dExactly how Russia could be welcomed back remains murky, however. A three-person panel led by a delegate from Aruba will make recommendations to the I.O.C.\u2019s executive board, which will make a decision that could even include a partial lifting of the sanctions against Russia.Nicole Hoevertsz, the I.O.C. executive board member leading that panel, said that the group is not \u201cexcluding any options.\u201d\u201cWe have not reached a final decision yet, we are reaching that moment,\u201d Hoevertsz told reporters in Pyeongchang on Thursday. \u201cWe are looking for the best interests of the I.O.C. and everyone involved.\u201dThe closing ceremony is different from the opening ceremony, where athletes from individual countries march behind a designated flag-bearer. On Sunday, the flag-bearers will march behind one another, before the remaining athletes enter the stadium in mixed groups.Some athletes who are frustrated by the I.O.C.\u2019s handling of the Russia affair have privately discussed avoiding the closing ceremony should the suspension be lifted. Angela Ruggiero, the departing president of the I.O.C.\u2019s Athletes Commission, on Thursday issued a reminder about Rule 50, a clause in the Olympic Charter prohibiting athletes from using the Games \u201cas a platform for protests, demonstrations or the promotion of political, religious or racial propaganda.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sprinkle, a Snapshot, a Sensation: My Dinner With Salt Bae", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookI was thrilled, of course. I had a souvenir of the gracefully stylized and mildly preposterous gesture that is the basis of Salt Bae\u2019s fame, the source of his nickname, and the point of his restaurant. Of course, everybody in the dining room was there for souvenirs, but the other suckers would have nothing to show off but a photo or video. I had a pair of trousers that Salt Bae had seasoned like a steak.The perceptive reader will have already spotted the flaw in my thinking. Because my souvenir would vanish the moment I stood up, the only way to show it off would have been calling my friends to come see me in my chair at Nusr-Et. So in the end I simply pointed my phone at my fly and snapped a picture.A few years ago, restaurants were still a refuge from the electronic grid, places where we could eat and talk without converting existence into digital form. Phone cameras changed that, and now it often seems that the point of going out to eat is to post a digital image proving we were there.Nusr-Et takes this process to its inevitable conclusion. It is a restaurant that recreates many times a night the viral Instagram video through which a man named Nusret Gokce became a meme called Salt Bae; that encourages paying customers to recreate nearly identical videos of Mr. Gokce in action; and invites them to post those videos to Instagram, where they can entice other people to come and see the meme made flesh for themselves. In its perfect circularity, its pure subordination of lived experience to mediated experience, Nusr-Et may be New York\u2019s first true 21st-century restaurant.Because Mr. Gokce has been doing this since 2002, the new restaurant, which opened three weeks ago, is not as much of a mess as you might expect. But on the evidence of my one meal there, it is still messy around the edges because he is now doing it in New York, a city filled with booby traps for the unwary newcomer.Most of the chaos accumulates in drifts around the entrance, where hosts try cheerfully but often ineffectively to dispatch the hungry crowd to empty tables. One of my guests was late so I can\u2019t blame the restaurant for not seating us right away, but once we were all there we passed a strange half-hour at the bar. We felt invisible for a while, then suddenly three people in a row came and promised to find us a table right away, and then they each disappeared. For a long time the only thing that happened was that the bartender couldn\u2019t find the credit card I\u2019d handed over when we\u2019d arrived.When it finally turned up inside a server\u2019s apron, I paid for two rounds of drinks for four people. This came to around $180, including a mandatory 18 percent service charge. This, sadly, is not far from the going rate for cocktails that are made painstakingly, but these weren\u2019t. The house old-fashioned, reportedly made with ginger syrup and Scotch, tasted like rye, sugar and water. Smoked Negronis, poured from a smoke-filled wine decanter, tasted as if they\u2019d been burned.I understood why there was so much meat on display when I saw the menu: It is almost all beef, start to finish. I\u2019ll admit to feeling relief on hearing they were all out of an appetizer called \u201cmeat sushi,\u201d but I did like the tartare, chopped and jazzed up on a tableside cart by a nice waiter named Marco. He finished the job by sprinkling salt flakes from on high, in a pale imitation of the master\u2019s style. Poor Marco, I thought. It must be like having to open for Beyonc\u00e9 when the only song you know is \u201cSingle Ladies.\u201dAfter two pleasant if unremarkable salads we were on to the \u201cspaghetti steak,\u201d strips of very tender seared steak gleaming with melted fat; we were encouraged to twirl the meat around our forks, like pasta.\u201cThis is cuckoo, it\u2019s going to melt in your mouth,\u201d we were told, and it did. For sheer softness, though, it didn\u2019t hold a candle to the lokum. Named after Turkish delight, this is tenderloin in thin slices that are passed over the grill just long enough to mark them. I usually prefer steak that gives me something to chew on, but I was glad to be introduced to lokum.Then we shared a cheeseburger, cut into quarters, and drippingly full of flavor. It would have been better on a fresher roll; it could have done without the potato sticks. The meat was hard to argue with, though.Yet something was missing. Or, to be exact, someone.And then he was there, at our table. He wore a snug, white T-shirt with a thin gold chain under the scoop-neck collar. His black hair was pulled back in an abbreviated ponytail. His eyes were hidden behind round reflective sunglasses. I wonder if he ever wishes he\u2019d worn another outfit on the day \u201cOttoman Steak\u201d was filmed. It is too late to turn back now. Without the scoop neck and the mirrored shades there is no Salt Bae, and Salt Bae was what everybody in the room had come to see.The ritual of carving and salting our Ottoman steak proceeded exactly as I knew it would. No surprises, no speeches, no slips, although he did wear a latex glove in deference to local health codes. Mr. Gokce has only one move, but he performs it with total confidence, and as anybody who\u2019s ever been on a dance floor knows, that\u2019s enough. Somebody at the table captured the whole thing on video, and the four of us took our places as nodes on the global Salt Bae network.Oh, we ate the steak, too. It was rare in patches and medium-rare in others, but apart from that it was terrific. The mashed potatoes were awful, but then Mr. Gokce has never pretended to be Spud Bae.Much as I enjoyed meeting an obliging human meme, I was distracted by unwelcome thoughts all night. The most annoying one was money. The Ottoman steak is substantial, and $130 is not an unparalleled price for a rib-eye in New York. But the spaghetti steak and the lokum were each $70 for what I\u2019d guess was about eight ounces of beef. The salads, a giant step down in appeal, cost $25 each; the clump of potatoes, like most of the other sides, was $15.One day, the prices will stay behind while Mr. Gokce leaves New York to salt other steaks and other laps. Without him, the dining room will be even stranger than it is now.Dessert is the only course that suggests Mr. Gokce\u2019s homeland. There is only one sweet, an imported baklava baked in a round pan and sliced like pizza. Served in wedges, it is much better on its own than with a bland layer of stretchy Turkish ice cream sandwiched inside. With it, you can have a cup of Turkish coffee.I like my Turkish coffee stronger and thicker, but the real missed opportunity here was that it had already been sweetened. Surely the moment calls for Sugar Bae.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Give A.I. the Gift of Gab, Silicon Valley Needs to Offend You", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "Advertisement\nTay said terrible things. She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free \u2014 at least for now.These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. \u201cOuch, that\u2019s not good,\u201d it might say. \u201cHope your ankle feels better soon.\u201d If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company\u2019s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man \u2014 unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.Microsoft\u2019s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. \u201cIt is a problem if we can\u2019t get this in front of real users \u2014 and have them tell us what is right and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints \u2014 and bad press \u2014 Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines \u2014 easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted \u201cchatbots\u201d that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.\u201cIt is more powerful,\u201d said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. \u201cBut it is more dangerous.\u201dIt may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type \u201cwinne tonight drink resttaurant,\u201d it might respond with: \u201ci\u2019m not a fan of wine.\u201d  It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.When Microsoft\u2019s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue. In this case, the system knows enough about the world to identify Adele as a singer.ResponseRankshe's a singer1i don't know who adele is.2she is a singer3lana del rey4i don't know who she is but she is a singer5i don't know who she is but she's a singer6i don't know, i'm not a fan of adele7lana del ray8i don't know who she is, she's a singer9who is adele10i don't know who she is. she's a singer11i don't know who she is but she's a good singer12i don't know who she is. i'm not a fan of adele13i don't know who she is but she is a very good singer14i don't know who she is. she is a singer15i don't know her name. she's a singer16i don't know her name, she's a singer17she's not a singer18i don't know, i've never heard of her before19you don't know her20i don't know her name21i don't know, i've never heard of her22katy perry23i don't know who she is but i don't know her name24i don't really know who she is but i don't know her name25But researchers must also deal with the unexpected. Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude \u2014 or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems \u2014 general dialogue \u2014 is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. \u201cThere is a huge technical barrier here. We really don\u2019t know how to build a personal assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.\u201dIn the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.\u201cWe need people to forgive us when we screw up,\u201d he said. \u201cPushing forward is going to involve some screw-ups.\u201dChat animations are based on data from Microsoft and draw from 50 possible responses for each interaction.Illustrations by Minh UongAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Belarussian Xata, Hearty Fare to Keep the Spirits Light", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City12 PhotosAt Belarussian Xata in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, birch sap comes in a tall carafe, unclouded and pure. The taste is close to water, only water as if just rained down and sipped from a blossom, with a delicate, attenuated sweetness: what a dryad might live on.Two-fifths of the landlocked former Soviet republic of Belarus is cloaked in woods, including remnants of the great forest that rose from the European Plain 10,000 years ago. The Belarusians have drunk birch sap for centuries. Now some in the United States extol the drink as a rival to coconut water, for its supposed restorative powers. We are late to the party.Certainly there is an odd magic at work at Belarussian Xata, where, as the meal progresses, the food grows increasingly rich \u2014 a kind of homage to hyperphagia, the fattening period before hibernation \u2014 yet the spirit stays light. It could be the birch sap or the horseradish-spiked vodka, scouring tongue and soul; the postcard-pretty tables draped with rushnyky, ceremonial embroidered linen towels that follow Belarusians from birth to death, and surrounded by wooden fences with upturned pitchers hanging from the posts; or a shyly charming waiter who whispers, of one particular dish: \u201cOf course my mother\u2019s is better.\u201dTo begin: zakuski, small plates that are not so small. Hog ears are fried into strips, with more crunch than fat. A sushi board becomes a platform for open-faced herring sandwiches, built not on bread but rounds of potato, cucumber and hard-boiled egg; the brininess is tempered by sour cream and a confetti of red onion.The chef, Ilya Frolov, was born in Minsk, the Belarusian capital. He makes honorable, old-country draniki, cakes of grated potato, bound by egg and bronzed in a pan. They might be interleaved with slices of pork neck under a mantle of melted cheese, but are just as good with nothing but sour cream. Kolduni start with the same potato batter, only inside is buried treasure \u2014 meat or mushrooms, in a creamy lather.Fanned out on a platter are swirled bouquets of salo (cured fatback), in three varieties: Belarusian, plush and quick to liquid on the tongue; smoked, its flavor shading toward aged Cheddar; and Hungarian, aflutter with paprika. Stalks of green onion, cherry tomatoes and a broken-down head of garlic crowd around, with splendidly fuming potatoes in a skillet alongside. (A more modest, singular helping of salo is accompanied by batons of rye bread as fat as French fries, crisped in butter, rubbed with garlic and tumbled into a cone of newspaper.)In borscht, the sweetness of the beets is kept in check by salty nubs of pork and beef. Yellow split pea soup, soothing and mild, lands on the table with a pork rib jutting out, the hilt thoughtfully wrapped in foil and the meat smoke incarnate.The main courses bring more pork. For machanka, hunks of rib, shoulder and a peasant-style sausage made in-house are left to commune in a pot for hours and presented with draniki or kerchiefs of blini, the better to soak up the stew. Neat bundles of cabbage divulge pork, beef and carrots, gently sweet. A monumental pork knuckle is braised and then baked until the fat wobbles off its flanks, calling to mind a slow avalanche.The first Belarussian Xata opened in 2012 in the Basmanny District of Moscow, a few blocks from the Belarusian Embassy. Its Brooklyn outpost followed this past September, taking over a two-story building once home to Cafe Glechik, a Ukrainian spot. Marat Novikov, a businessman from Minsk who brought his family to Brooklyn in 1989, as the Soviet Union was reeling from internal unrest, runs both restaurants with the help of his son, Andrey; his daughter, Olga; and her husband, Steve Palanker, a native of Moldova.A few recipes come from Mr. Novikov\u2019s mother, like a perfect dessert of little orbs of tangy yogurt cheese, flecked with poppy seeds and simmered in sour cream. Room, too, should be made for sour cherry dumplings in crimson-stained skins and a trompe-l\u2019oeil chocolate salami conjured out of crushed biscuits, cocoa, hazelnuts and prunes.This is plenty, to be embraced and shared. A night at Belarussian Xata can feel as though you\u2019ve crashed a dozen parties at once, all in full swing. One night, a group of women lingered for hours in a corner, deep in talk and growly laughter; only around 10 p.m. did their first zakuski arrive. They were in no hurry. They knew the value of time.Advertisement"}

Smith argues that it is Kureishi\u2019s willingness to be impious, perverse and rude that gives the novel its singular power: \u201cAll the great energy of \u2018Buddha\u2019 comes from watching the liberty of creative freedom being taken, over and over again \u2014 as if it were a right.\u201d Which, of course, it is. But that\u2019s not always obvious to young artists, particularly those who don\u2019t see themselves represented in the status quo. Reading the novel, Smith \u201cfelt something impossible loosen within me,\u201d she writes in \u201cThe I Who Is Not Me,\u201d the inaugural Philip Roth Lecture, which she delivered at the Newark Public Library in 2016. \u201cIt was a gift of freedom.\u201dA few years after this formative moment, in 2000, she published \u201cWhite Teeth,\u201d her celebrated debut novel. Smith has written four novels since then, and in the past decade, she has also produced a significant body of smart, incisive nonfiction, much of it occasioned by encounters with books and film and visual art, from Kureishi\u2019s novel to Balthasar Denner\u2019s 18th-century painting \u201cAlte Frau\u201d to Jordan Peele\u2019s film \u201cGet Out.\u201d Although her essays range over many topics \u2014 Brexit, Facebook, climate change, cultural appropriation, pleasure versus joy \u2014 she is interested in the making and meaning of cultural artifacts, and in the exchange of feeling that takes place between art and its audience, between text and reader: what she calls \u201cthe essential, living communication between art work and viewer.\u201dAs the title of her new collection suggests, here Smith explores variations on a theme: freedom of language and thought; freedom from received narratives that tend to be foolishly consistent, if not downright constricting; freedom from the \u201cimpossible identities\u201d society so facilely places on people, or from those we too readily adopt ourselves. Most of all, though, she\u2019s concerned with artistic and aesthetic freedom, with the boldness and daring that compel an artist to create even when conditions seem hostile. In 1969, she notes, it was a radical act for a Jewish author to write a foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed, masturbating character like Alexander Portnoy. But in \u201ctaking this freedom for himself,\u201d Smith writes, Roth, \u201cintentionally or not, passed that freedom down\u201d to readers and writers like Smith, who came after him.Freedom is a conceit well suited to a collection of essays. Aldous Huxley called the essay \u201ca literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything\u201d \u2014 and this is Smith\u2019s approach. She writes about her lower-middle-class upbringing by way of the second bathroom in her childhood home: \u201cThe spare room, the extra toilet \u2014 these represented, for my parents, a very British form of achievement.\u201d She mourns her father while celebrating the exhilarating democracy of Italian public parks, and she explores Justin Bieber as love-object through the philosophy of Martin Buber. The essay form\u2019s freewheeling nature arguably accounts for its current popularity. Readers, hip to the conventions of storytelling \u2014 we fill our commutes with podcasts and fetishize long-form narratives \u2014 are drawn to the essay, which lends itself to the unexpected and original. Behind the best contemporary essays you can sense the writer\u2019s beating heart.Smith\u2019s style is casual, discursive, but not collagelike in the current fashion, intimate without being overly personal. Taking her children to \u201cThe Polar Express 4-D Experience\u201d on the same day she sees Charlie Kaufman\u2019s puppet film, \u201cAnomalisa\u201d \u2014 while carrying a pocket book of Schopenhauer around \u2014 yields \u201cWindows on the Will: \u2018Anomalisa,\u2019\u201d an essay that examines Kaufman\u2019s film through its Schopenhauerian fixation on human suffering (the easier to dramatize with puppets): \u201cthe inevitability of it, and the possibility of momentary, illusory relief from it.\u201d Similarly, in \u201cMan Versus Corpse,\u201d the discovery of a \u201cforlorn little hardbacked book\u201d about Italian masterpieces on a table in her lobby leads to a close reading of Luca Signorelli\u2019s painting \u201cNude Man From the Back Carrying a Corpse on His Shoulders,\u201d which in turn opens up into a rambling discussion of existence, inequality (\u201cthe unequal distribution of corpses\u201d), Rothko, Warhol (\u201can enthusiastic proponent of corpse art\u201d), iPhones and her own inability to imagine herself as a corpse, before ending at a dinner party with talk of Knausgaard and his multivolume \u201ccathedral of boredom.\u201dIt is exquisitely pleasurable to observe Smith thinking on the page, not least because we have no idea where she\u2019s headed. \u201cNotes on Attunement,\u201d her well-known essay on Joni Mitchell, recounts the sudden epiphany that took her from \u201cJoni Mitchell-hating pilgrim\u201d to a fan who weeps with joy at her music, touching on Wordsworth, connoisseurship, Seneca, Kierkegaard and the inconsistency of the self along the way. At times she reminds me of a musician jamming, or one of those enviable cooks who can take five random ingredients lying around the kitchen and whip up a meal. Her loose, roving essays cohere because they are rooted in her sensibility, in what Elizabeth Hardwick called \u201cthe soloist\u2019s personal signature flowing through the text.\u201dHow to characterize Smith\u2019s sensibility? Above all, she\u2019s allergic to dishonesty, hypocrisy, sanctimony, cant. \u201cFor many people in London right now,\u201d she writes in \u201cFences: A Brexit Diary,\u201d \u201cthe supposedly multicultural and cross-class aspects of their lives are actually represented by their staff \u2014 nannies, cleaners \u2014 by the people who pour their coffees and drive their cabs, or else the handful of Nigerian princes you meet in private schools.\u201d She takes a wide-lens, Olympian view, often empathizing with both sides of an issue \u2014 her arguments can thus be difficult to pinpoint \u2014 but she is ultimately pragmatic. \u201cOne useful consequence of Brexit,\u201d she writes, \u201cis to finally and openly reveal a deep fracture in British society that has been 30 years in the making.\u201dAt root she believes that art is a realm where knotty issues can be safely explored, and that we should not draw neat boundaries around its subjects. Such is the argument of her much-discussed essay on \u201cGet Out,\u201d which first appeared in Harper\u2019s: It\u2019s a fantasy that \u201cwe can get out of each other\u2019s way, mark a clean cut between black and white,\u201d she concludes in that essay, which also examines the controversy over the white artist Dana Schutz\u2019s painting of Emmett Till. In an open letter, the artist Hannah Black had asked the Whitney Biennial to remove and destroy the painting, on the grounds that Schutz had no right to depict black suffering; the request, Smith writes, was \u201cthe province of Nazis and censorious evangelicals.\u201d The problem with such racial essentialism, she suggests elsewhere in this collection, is that it can run both ways. See the narrow, patronizing tendency to \u201cascribe to black artists some generalized aim,\u201d like \u201cinserting the black figure into the white canon.\u201d This trivializes the formal and technical concerns of the artist, Smith writes, \u201cthe unique problem each art work poses.\u201dSmith is an appreciator of art, a connoisseur, rather than a stern critic. It\u2019s rare that she writes about anything she dislikes. Indeed, if the book has a subtheme, it is joy, a feeling not often discussed outside of New Age circles. It\u2019s an emotion brought about by giving birth, falling in love, taking drugs \u2014 those almost unbearably exquisite experiences that the final essay, \u201cJoy,\u201d recounts \u2014 but also by art: Joni Mitchell\u2019s music, Fred Astaire\u2019s dancing, the defiantly campy street strut of the man in Marc Bradford\u2019s video \u201cNiagara.\u201dOf course, as Smith notes in her foreword, the idea of freedom has taken on new resonance in the past year, and I have often heard it asked whether art that is not expressly political is still necessary or worthwhile. But as Smith writes: \u201cYou can\u2019t fight for a freedom you\u2019ve forgotten how to identify.\u201d Art \u2014 making it, contemplating it \u2014 reminds us what it\u2019s like to feel free.Amanda Fortini is a writer and visiting lecturer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Right-Wing Media Uses Parkland Shooting as Conspiracy Fodder", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut in certain right-wing corners of the web \u2014 and, increasingly, from more mainstream voices like Rush Limbaugh and a commentator on CNN \u2014 the students are being portrayed not as grief-ridden survivors but as pawns and conspiracists intent on exploiting a tragedy to undermine the nation\u2019s laws.In these baseless accounts, which by Tuesday had spread rapidly on social media, the students are described as \u201ccrisis actors,\u201d who travel to the sites of shootings to instigate fury against guns. Or they are called F.B.I. plants, defending the bureau for its failure to catch the shooter. They have been portrayed as puppets being coached and manipulated by the Democratic Party, gun control activists, the so-called antifa movement and the left-wing billionaire George Soros.Mr. Hogg, the high school\u2019s student news director, has become a sensation among many liberals for his polished and compelling television interviews, in which he has called on lawmakers to enact tougher restrictions on guns. Just as quickly, Mr. Hogg attracted the disdain of right-wing provocateurs like The Gateway Pundit, a fringe website that gained prominence in 2016 for pushing conspiracies about voter fraud and Hillary Clinton.In written posts and YouTube videos \u2014 one of which had more than 100,000 views as of Tuesday night \u2014 Gateway Pundit has argued that Mr. Hogg had been coached on what to say during his interviews. The notion that Mr. Hogg is merely protecting his father dovetails with a broader right-wing trope, that liberal forces in the F.B.I. are trying to undermine President Trump and his pro-Second Amendment supporters.Others offered more sweeping condemnations. Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind the site Infowars, suggested that the mass shooting was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d orchestrated by anti-gun groups. Mr. Limbaugh, on his radio program, said of the student activists on Monday: \u201cEverything they\u2019re doing is right out of the Democrat Party\u2019s various playbooks. It has the same enemies: the N.R.A. and guns.\u201dBy Tuesday, that argument had migrated to CNN. In an on-air appearance, Jack Kingston, a former United States representative from Georgia and a regular CNN commentator, asked, \u201cDo we really think \u2014 and I say this sincerely \u2014 do we really think 17-year-olds on their own are going to plan a nationwide rally?\u201d (He was quickly rebuked by the anchor Alyson Camerota.)Some of those who have been spreading the conspiracies are facing consequences.\u201cI made a mistake whereas I tried to inform a reporter of information relating to his story regarding a school shooting,\u201d Mr. Kelly tweeted. \u201cI meant no disrespect to the students or parents of Parkland.\u201d His boss, Mr. Harrison, said on Twitter that he was \u201cappalled\u201d by Mr. Kelly\u2019s remarks.Advertisement"}

Gorman, L. L. Bean\u2019s executive chairman and a great-grandson of Leon Leonwood Bean, the company\u2019s founder, wrote in the post that the changes would affect a small percentage of returns and would have \u201cno impact for the vast majority\u201d of customers.L. L. Bean\u2019s decades-old refund-and-replacement policy, one of the most generous in the retail industry, had increasingly been abused, Mr. Gorman wrote.\u201cA small, but growing number of customers has been interpreting our guarantee well beyond its original intent,\u201d he wrote. Some people had sought \u201crefunds for heavily worn products used over many years,\u201d he added. \u201cOthers seek refunds for products that have been purchased through third parties, such as at yard sales.\u201dCustomers reacted with both support and surprise.But Jen Tedesco, a homemaker in upstate New York, said she was \u201creally disappointed\u201d with L. L. Bean and what she said was a \u201cone size fits all, super-stringent policy that is going to alienate customers.\u201dShe said her family, which includes three children, was willing to spend more at L. L. Bean than at Walmart or Target because of the expectation that the products would last longer.\u201cWe make good money, but we\u2019re not rich and have to make very financially responsible decisions about where we spend our money,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m spending $70 for kids\u2019 snow pants, I need to know that the company is putting enough care, quality and effort into them that they\u2019re not going to break 14 months down the road.\u201dAs shoppers began to drift toward e-commerce, many retailers tried to retain them by offering extended return policies with extremely forgiving terms.But companies often found that accepting returns came at a high cost.A former L. L. Bean employee, Jessica Pikowski, confirmed Mr. Gorman\u2019s view that many customers had abused the returns policy. Ms. Pikowski said she had worked at an L.L. Bean store in Danbury, Conn., during breaks from college, as recently as 2015. She said that up to 70 percent of the returns she and her colleagues processed seemed questionable.She said one man had brought a garbage bag full of clothes that looked and smelled as if they had barely survived a fire. He left with a gift card worth hundreds of dollars.\u201cMost of the people who used the policy abused it,\u201d Ms. Pikowski said. \u201cAnd we weren\u2019t allowed to confront them about it.\u201dImproper returns cost states up to $1.4 billion in lost sales tax revenue and hurt retail employees, according to Appriss.L. L. Bean\u2019s turnaround is similar to a change in policy at the outdoor retailer REI. In 2013, after people bragged of taking used REI products bought at swap meets to the store for cash refunds, the company began requiring customers to make their returns within a year of purchase (with some exceptions: outdoor electronic items have a 90-day return window, but products with manufacturing defects can be returned anytime).Michelle Zaleski of Marlborough, Mass., said she worried that the new L.L. Bean policy could mean the company was reducing the quality of its products. She said she had recently bought a pair of $200 L. L. Bean boots, which she said were already falling apart.Ms. Zaleski said she and her family went out of their way to visit L. L. Bean stores and had spent $3,000 on the company\u2019s products over the holidays. In 15 years of regular buying from the company, she said, she had returned fewer than a dozen items, including one vest, one jacket and several backpacks with broken handles.\u201cL. L.

{"Headline": "The Reinvention of Consent", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "Young people are radically changing how we think about violence, consent and gender.Supported byYELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio \u2014 When Soleil R. Sykes took an internship in Washington during her first year as a student at Antioch College, she experienced a bit of culture shock.She was working at a German think tank and noticed that both in the office and at social events, friends and colleagues were far more casual about touching one another. \u201cAt a mixer before a speech, someone would tap you on the shoulder or I would tap someone on the shoulder,\u201d said Ms. Sykes, 22, now a fourth-year student majoring in political economy. \u201cAt Antioch, people would have asked permission first.\u201dNow, the current crop of pioneers at Antioch are moving the conversation beyond sex to discussions of consent in platonic touch.When Alyssa Navarrette, a third-year student who is studying anthropology and art, came home for her first visit after starting college, she was taken by surprise when her mother hugged her.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be touched and your mom wants to hug you, you should be allowed to say no,\u201d Ms. Navarrette said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having autonomy over your own body.\u201dWhen people get hurt, the community springs into action. Students say that what they and their predecessors have built here isn\u2019t perfect, but that the culture is as close to an ideal as they\u2019ve seen.In a lot of ways, Antioch College exists in a bubble. With a current enrollment of 135 students, it is situated in a small liberal town that is a bluish dot in a largely Republican area of Southwest Ohio. Its first president was the education reformer and politician Horace Mann; Coretta Scott King is among the famous graduates.But students regularly venture outside this cocoon. Antioch\u2019s \u201ccooperative educational experiences\u201d are a cornerstone of the curriculum here, and they compel students, at least four times before graduating, to go on \u201cco-op,\u201d taking on 10-week jobs and internships, usually in places far from Yellow Springs, often arranged or provided by Antioch alumni.If you choose to permeate the bubble yourself and visit Antioch, you will be asked to sign a \u201cstatement of understanding\u201d that you will abide by a policy that requires enthusiastic verbal consent during every stage of every sexual interaction. (Reporters are also required to sign the statement.)Students including Marcell Vanarsdale, 22 and now a fourth-year student, arrived at Antioch mostly unaware of the college\u2019s consent policy. \u201cI think my parents raised me pretty well and taught me respect for people and respect for women, but learning about the S.O.P.P. is definitely the first formal education about consent I ever got,\u201d said Mr. Vanarsdale, who grew up just outside of Chicago and is studying history and performance.He attended several sessions at orientation devoted to the policy, including one led by Planned Parenthood educators, another about the history of sexual relations. \u201cIt was different, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest pull was moving away from the idea that \u2018no means no\u2019 and toward \u2018yes means yes.\u2019\u201dIn its most updated form, the S.O.P.P. is an eight-page document that spells out the tenets of \u201caffirmative consent.\u201d In each stage of a sexual interaction, consent must be verbally requested and verbally given, the policy says \u2014 and \u201csilence conveys a lack of affirmative consent.\u201dIt prohibits the sending of unsolicited sexual text messages and requires partners to disclose sexually transmitted infections. It also dictates that people under the influence of drugs and alcohol cannot give consent. So, strictly speaking, any drunk hookup would be found to be in violation of the policy if one of the parties filed a complaint.\u201cThe S.O.P.P. is Antioch College\u2019s formal attempt at ending sexual violence and sexual harassment while fostering a campus culture of positive, consensual sexuality,\u201d it reads.Before a national audience, the school and the women who created the policy were portrayed as endemic of a politically correct culture run amok that was trying to desexualize sex.During them, programming has included screenings of ethical pornography, a \u201cKiss and Tell\u201d story-sharing event, \u201cDildo Bingo,\u201d a ropes-and-bondage workshop and an Antioch traditional event that students attend dressed to express themselves along the gender continuum.A \u201csex positive\u201d culture has everything to do with the S.O.P.P., Mx. Olson said. \u201cBeing able to talk to a partner or multiple partners about what you like, what you would like to experiment with \u2014 to have a negotiation whether it\u2019s about B.D.S.M. or extra cuddling, whatever gets you going \u2014 those discussions are what make sex wonderful. You have more control of the situation.\u201dThe college\u2019s administration sees this all as a big selling point for the school. \u201cOur students and our alumni have always been very involved with activism, and social justice is in our DNA,\u201d said Mila Cooper, Antioch\u2019s vice president for diversity and inclusion and the director of the Coretta Scott King Center. \u201cThere\u2019s a heightened awareness of sexual violence and sexual assault right now with the MeToo movement, but I do think Antioch has been involved in these conversations long before. It\u2019s not just a policy, you know, it\u2019s part of the education and the culture here.\u201dThe discussions connect back, sometimes directly, to the policy. \u201cThe S.O.P.P. is a reminder of who we are and what we\u2019re here to do,\u201d said Michelle De Le\u00f3n, 23, a second-year student. \u201cIt lets us say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re in a community and you\u2019re in a space with other people and be mindful of the space you\u2019re taking up.\u2019 Women, nonbinary people, queer people, people of color \u2014 we\u2019re not living in a culture that gives them space. We live in a culture where so many are penetrated physically, emotionally and verbally by anyone at any moment.\u201dIn the media, it\u2019s been misunderstood, many Antiochians say. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s a harsh policy,\u201d Ms. Nalubega said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not. It\u2019s saying that when you do touch a person, your touch is exciting and welcoming to that person.\u201dStill, there is a learning curve. Ms. Navarrette, for one, was not used to having honest conversations about sex. \u201cIt can be especially difficult for people of color who are from cultures where women and girls are not supposed to talk about sex,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means you\u2019re a \u2018bad girl.\u2019\u201dMany students have come to embrace it as a good thing. \u201cAt first, it feels almost unnatural and abrupt to say, \u2018Hey, can I do this? Can I proceed with this?\u2019\u201d Mr. Vanarsdale said. \u201cBut then, you see, at least for me, it\u2019s not just what you say but how you say it, getting more comfortable with the language. And I think it takes out a lot of the pressure on both parties when asking is involved and clarity is confirmed.\u201dEnforcement controls how effective a policy can be. The tiny size of the student body is one impediment to ideal outcomes, students say. News of an S.O.P.P. violation being reported to a student community representative or a member of the staff or faculty spreads very quickly. It\u2019s pretty much guaranteed that the person reporting the violation will share mutual friends with the person they\u2019re citing. This can create a real strain on student social dynamics.But the reality is sometimes more complicated. Roger D. Stoppa, the director of public safety at Antioch, said that because a reported violation of the S.O.P.P. is, by definition, an unwanted act in the context of a sexual interaction, it must also be considered a violation of Title IX, the federal law that forbids sex discrimination within any entity that receives federal funding.And federal guidelines prohibit officials from revealing private details of an investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re sworn to confidentiality. We can\u2019t say that we found somebody responsible, and this is the consequence that they got,\u201d said Mr. Stoppa, who is also the school\u2019s deputy Title IX coordinator. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t see anything tangible happen, they just think, \u2018Oh my God, I reported and nobody did anything about it.\u2019 Well, we go through a very thorough process.\u201dSo the student community may ultimately take matters of enforcement into its own hands.In the summer of 2017, a student group organized a concert featuring several local bands, that would take place at the on-campus amphitheater. Nonstudents from beyond Yellow Springs attended. They were asked to sign the document stating that they understood and would respect the S.O.P.P. Several of the men refused to sign; they were approached by students who asked them to sign the document or to leave. They left.\u201cThere is a stigma to not signing,\u201d Ms. Berro said.The dean read a list of complaints, Mx. Sanders said. Some of them came as a surprise, but not all. Mx. Sanders said they and the dean decided they should leave school.Mx. Sanders left Yellow Springs for a while but then returned, moved into an apartment in town and got a job at a restaurant. At another meeting, the dean told Mx. Sanders that they were banned from campus, Mx. Sanders said. The rules were not always closely observed. \u201cI remember once I was walking with a few people, we stopped right at the edge of campus, and someone saw me and got really mad at me,\u201d they said.Word of Mx. Sanders\u2019s behavior had spread around campus. At first, some students weren\u2019t sure how to react because Mx. Sanders was well regarded as an activist.\u201cAt Antioch, we focus so much on inclusion and creating space for marginalized people on campus that I think what has formed is a hierarchy based off of marginalization,\u201d Mr. Vanarsdale said. \u201cIt gives people who have this marginalization attached to their identity some form of power. Todd wasn\u2019t the archetype of what we think toxic masculinity would look like. He wasn\u2019t a heterosexual cis male.\u201dAntiochians take their culture of consent seriously, and students were disturbed to know someone living in their midst was not living by the S.O.P.P. Students began to approach Mx. Sanders, asking for apologies or acknowledgments that the consent rules were being flouted. Mx. Sanders didn\u2019t seem to be chastened.In a manner that perhaps can only take place when an entire community buys into a culture of consent, the community took action.\u201cThere was a meeting of people who have been friends with this person or who had sex with this person or who are the victims, and we all got together and decided we had to do something about it,\u201d Ms. Nalubega said. \u201cSo when we would see him at Birch or at the Emporium or at a party, we would say to him, \u2018You can\u2019t be in this space.\u2019\u201dBy the spring of 2015, it had become more difficult to live in Yellow Springs, Mx. Sanders said. \u201cThere was a posting on a student Facebook page saying I was a rapist and people should avoid me. That was a difficult thing to read. Within a month, I left. I felt like I had been run out of town on a rail.\u201dContemporaries of Mx. Sanders said they tried to compel Mx. Sanders to acknowledge their missteps. \u201cThis is someone who was repeatedly confronted and didn\u2019t change their behavior and then was ultimately not tolerated in the community,\u201d said someone who knew Mx. Sanders but did not want to speak publicly about the matter.Mx. Sanders is now committed to seeking affirmative consent in sexual interactions. \u201cI don\u2019t blame anyone else,\u201d Mx. Sanders said. \u201cI need to be accountable.\u201dIn the fall of 1990, an Antioch student reported a date rape to the dean\u2019s office. The administration promised her that the male student would be removed from the dorm in which they both lived. When he was not removed, a group came together at the Womyn\u2019s Center to plot for change.One of the women activists was April Wolford, now in information technology services at the University of California, Berkeley. She was an elected representative to a community council. She thought it was important to codify the demands \u2014 to create a policy for the administration to formally adopt.\u201cThe first version we wrote was very punitive,\u201d Ms. Wolford said. It was called the \u201cAntioch College Sexual Offense Policy,\u201d and it began: \u201cA sexual offense, as defined herein, committed by a community member will not be tolerated by the Antioch community. If there is reasonable cause to believe that any person has committed such an offense and that person is considered a threat to the community, that individual must be promptly removed from the campus.\u201dSexual offenses were defined as forced physical penetration, \u201cany non-consensual physical contact found to be sexually threatening or offensive\u201d and other incidents of \u201cpersistent sexual harassment.\u201d\u201cBut what we learned from that is that wasn\u2019t the focus of what the community wanted,\u201d Ms. Wolford said. \u201cWe wanted to prevent these assaults. As young people, we didn\u2019t have the tools.\u201dSo they began to discuss consent. \u201cThe challenge was, \u2018How do you get consent in a situation where everyone is so nervous?\u2019\u201d Ms. Wolford said.So the students created not just a policy but an educational curriculum of lectures, discussion groups, presentations from Planned Parenthood and skits in which actors would work through different scenarios where consent should be taught. \u201cIt was so owned by students, it was created by students, and students created education around it,\u201d Ms. Wolford said. The school administration adopted the policy with enthusiasm in the winter of 1991.But over the years \u2014 including a stint as dean of community life in 2011, during which she worked with students to remove S.O.P.P. language about \u201crape culture\u201d in favor of \u201csexual violence,\u201d which she hoped would be less alienating and accusatory toward men \u2014 she has changed her mind.\u201cI have very little patience with the notion that something like this isn\u2019t needed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the policy was meant to stop us from shaking hands without consent. What it does do is sort of say, \u2018Your body is your body and if you don\u2019t want something to happen to it or with it, it shouldn\u2019t.\u2019 And then that can be applied into every social interaction.\u201dAndy Janecko, 19 and a second-year student, wants to create another policy. \u201cI\u2019m really wanting to write a separate policy, that brings consciousness about consent a little bit further,\u201d said Mx. Janecko, who uses they/them/their pronouns. \u201cWe\u2019re missing this whole component of consent in general, teaching people not to touch people at all if you don\u2019t have their verbal consent,\u201d they said, suggesting that it could be called the Nonconsensual Contact Prevention Policy.One reason for the policy, they said, is to protect against people casually touching people who don\u2019t like to be touched or who have disabilities that make unexpected touch painful or unsettling.\u201cI\u2019m also looking for it to help people get justice or get acknowledgments at least for microaggression,\u201d said Mx.

{"Headline": "The Cuttlefish, a Master of Camouflage, Reveals a New Trick", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConsider the cocktail umbrella. Like their larger counterparts, these wee things can be furled and unfurled easily. Once you tire of playing with them, you can lock them into the open position with a little latch before continuing to enjoy your drink.Now imagine you have hundreds of cocktail umbrellas under your skin. This, it turns out, is fairly close to reality for cuttlefish, the sprightly relatives of squids and octopuses, according to new research.Biologists at the University of Cambridge and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., have discovered that cuttlefish, masters of camouflage whose shape-shifting talents have fascinated biologists for decades, can lock hundreds of tiny structures under their skin into an upright position, giving themselves a particular texture, then go on their way without expending any energy to keep up the look.This is the first time anyone has seen anything like this in cuttlefish, a reminder that even much-studied species still have some surprising secrets.Cuttlefish are the chameleons of the sea: Put one in front of a bank of seaweed and he or she will immediately activate a set of reflectors and colored cells in the skin to match their background and fade from view.What\u2019s more, they will mimic the texture of their environment using little nodules called papillae that they extend and retract using muscles. They can make themselves look like a cobbled seafloor, a spiny piece of coral or a hunk of granite.In the current study, as part of an experiment to help understand how cuttlefish control their color and shape, Dr. Wardill\u2019s colleague Paloma Gonzalez-Bellido snipped a nerve that controls one section of the cuttlefish\u2019s skin.One of the two cuttlefish she used in the experiment, as expected, kept its skin smooth and could no longer change color in the portion affected by the surgery, though it swam around healthily enough.The other, however, had had its papillae extended at the moment the cut was made. To Dr. Gonzalez-Bellido\u2019s surprise, they did not relax. Instead, as she perplexedly moved the animal to different water tanks and watched its unaffected side change shape and color quite normally, the papillae stayed up. Only after an hour did they finally subside.It turns out that these papillae can be locked in position if they are dosed with certain neurotransmitters, which that particular cuttlefish had likely just released when the nerve was cut.The researchers believe that cuttlefish use this previously unknown locking mechanism to sustain their disguise as a piece of rock or coral without having to actually hold their muscles in the same posture for an extended period of time.This is similar to a well-known phenomenon in clams and related creatures: When these mollusks want to clam up, they lock the muscles that open and close their shells by altering the chemistry of certain muscle proteins. In both cases, it seems that this approach can save energy for the animal, as it doesn\u2019t have to strain to maintain its pose.Ultimately the study may offer a path toward understanding other mysteries about cuttlefish. If the researchers can decipher the individual neurons that control each of these papillae and understand better how this lock functions, it may lead to deeper insights into how these strange and beautiful creatures hide themselves in plain sight._____Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Meddling Was a Drop in an Ocean of American-Made Discord", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterThe conspirators stand accused of spreading falsehoods online, hiring Hillary Clinton impersonators at rallies and starting Facebook groups that tried to convince minority voters to stay home or cast their ballots for Jill Stein.That these efforts might have actually made a difference, or at least were intended to, highlights a force that was already destabilizing American democracy far more than any Russian-made fake news post: partisan polarization.It has infected the American political system, weakening the body politic and leaving it vulnerable to manipulation. Russian misinformation seems to have exacerbated the symptoms, but laced throughout the indictment are reminders that the underlying disease, arguably far more damaging, is all American-made.The false information and political advertisements that the Russians are accused of spreading could ring true only to those already predisposed to suspect the worst.One Instagram account targeting voters on the right, for instance, implied that Black Lives Matter activists were assassinating police officers. Another targeting black voters implied that the government had implicitly supported the Ku Klux Klan by dismantling the Black Panthers.If this had any effect, research suggests it did so by tapping into existing polarization, rather than creating new divisions.Americans, it said, sought out stories that reflected their already-formed partisan view of reality. This suggests that these Russians efforts are indicators \u2014 not drivers \u2014 of how widely Americans had polarized.That distinction matters for how the indictment is read: Though Americans have seen it as highlighting a foreign threat, it also illustrates the perhaps graver threats from within.This highlights a problem that Lilliana Mason, a University of Maryland political scientist, said had left American democracy dangerously vulnerable. But it\u2019s a problem driven primarily by American politicians and media outlets, which have far louder megaphones than any Russian-made Facebook posts.\u201cCompromise is the core of democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we can govern.\u201d But, she said, \u201cwhen you make people feel threatened, nobody compromises with evil.\u201dThe claim that, for example, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory might aid Satan is in many ways just a faint echo of the partisan anger and fear already dominating American politics.Those emotions undermine a key norm that all sides are served by honoring democratic processes; instead, they justify, or even seem to mandate, extreme steps against the other side.The Russians\u2019 apparent focus on heightening racial division touched on something much deeper than even the Russians may have understood.American democracy can function only when its citizens accept the right of all others to participate regardless of their background.That applies to party divisions. But, increasingly, partisan identity is aligning with racial and religious identity, according to research by Dr. Mason. This, along with deepening partisan distrust, is creating one of the worst possible conditions in a multiethnic democracy: a growing belief that elections are a zero-sum contest for control among racial and religious groups.Russian misinformation hit repeatedly on this fear, spreading fake news and even rally posters that declared the allegiance of Muslim Americans to Mrs. Clinton.Polarization by race, building since the 1990s, poses \u201cthe greatest challenge to established forms of mutual toleration and forbearance since Reconstruction,\u201d the political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky write in their book, \u201cHow Democracies Die.\u201dThe idea that all demographic groups must cooperate rather than compete is one of the most important norms for a multiethnic democracy like that of the United States. The claims pushed in Russian posts demonstrate, precisely because they are so implausible, how rapidly that norm is weakening.The Russian campaign targeted not just democracy\u2019s guardrails \u2014 the norms of cooperation and inclusion \u2014 but also political parties, which are supposed to function as democracy\u2019s guardians. For instance, posts and individuals alleged that the Democratic Party was outright stealing the primary for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 well beyond what actually occurred \u2014 and attempted to sow infighting among Republicans.Although parties compete by design, they also play a stabilizing role, weeding out candidates with anti-democratic or extreme views, for instance, and ensuring that legislators\u2019 individual interests don\u2019t crowd out the state\u2019s ability to govern. Or they\u2019re supposed to, anyway.But the Russians entered a political scene already defined by the parties\u2019 weakness and inability to control their own field.\u201cThe defining characteristic of our moment is that parties are weak while partisanship is strong,\u201d Julia Azari, a Marquette University political scientist, wrote the day after the vote.It may have been party weakness that even gave the Russians a Trump campaign to support. Though the G.O.P. tried repeatedly to halt Mr. Trump\u2019s advance in the primary, it failed, revealing both its powerlessness and its unpopularity with its own voters.\u201cHillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus,\u201d announced a 2016 Facebook post allegedly written by the Russians named in the indictment.Warnings of voter fraud were a frequent theme, and one with some irony; the Russians, it seems, sought to undermine American democracy by suggesting it had already been undermined.But if Americans were susceptible to messages seeking to discredit democratic institutions, it was because many already believed them.And if institutions behave in ways that partisans dislike, for example by issuing a court ruling or releasing a vote tally that hurt their side, those partisans can come to see the institutions as threats to democracy rather than its bedrock foundation.This can lead partisans to believe that by attacking those institutions, they are saving democracy from its enemies within. To the other side, this only affirms suspicion that their opponents are innately anti-democratic and must be excluded. It is a self-perpetuating cycle, one that Russian meddling may have only sped up a bit but that remains almost entirely American-driven.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chris Hughes Made Millions at Facebook. Now He Has a Plan to End Poverty.", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Chris Hughes, as he will be the first to tell you, has too much money. As he relates in his new book, \u201cFair Shot,\u201d he co-founded Facebook, asked his roommate Mark Zuckerberg for 10 percent of the company, received 2 percent instead and became dynastically wealthy as a result.Hughes is acutely aware of how unfair this is. \u201cMost Americans cannot find $400 in the case of an emergency,\u201d he writes, \u201cyet I was able to make half a billion dollars for three years of work.\u201d He\u2019s also aware that the flip side of people like himself having too much money is that tens of millions of Americans have too little. Over 40 million Americans live below the poverty line, including one in five children under the age of 6.There is a simple solution to the problem of people having too little money: giving them some. As Hughes efficiently and compellingly recounts, the proven and far-reaching effects of cash grants include more work; higher incomes; better performance in school and college; less tobacco and alcohol use; and fewer hospitalizations, illnesses and untimely deaths. In short, grants strengthen and empower the poor, making them much more economically and socially productive.\u201cFair Shot\u201d is a short, easily digestible elaboration of this argument, with a very specific proposal for taking from the rich and giving to the poor. At the top end, Hughes wants to raise the marginal tax rate for those earning more than $250,000 per year to 50 percent, both for earned income and for capital gains. At the bottom end, he wants to give a monthly $500 check to (nearly) all adults living in one of the 42 million households making less than $50,000 per year. The resulting America wouldn\u2019t just be healthier and better educated; it would be richer, too, with the economy growing as much as a full percentage point faster than it would without such an intervention. The plan would also, by Hughes\u2019s calculations, \u201clift 20 million people out of poverty overnight.\u201dTo make his case, Hughes weaves together two stories. The first is a straightforward and accessible autobiography. Hughes grew up in bucolic, God-fearing North Carolina, with little money but a strong sense of community. He talked administrators at Andover into giving him more financial aid than they\u2019d originally offered, moved on to Harvard, had a brief but lucrative career at Facebook and became director of online organizing for Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. Then, fatefully, he decided first to buy and then to sell The New Republic, the storied political magazine.Hughes presents the decision to sell his magazine in a few sentences: After spending four years and $25 million trying to \u201cturn the numbers in our financial statements from red to black,\u201d he finally came to the realization that the loss-making publication he bought in 2012 was, well, a loss-making publication. \u201cUnless I had a political agenda to promote or an ax to grind,\u201d he writes, \u201cthere was no future in my ownership.\u201dIn parallel to his autobiography, Hughes tells a wonkier tale of the education of a young philanthropist. Flush with his Facebook millions, he travels to Kenya twice to observe two very different attempts at relieving extreme poverty. The first is a trip with the famed Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs to see for himself the Millennium Villages Project \u2014 an ambitious attempt to give some of the poorest people in the world everything from clean water to cellular connectivity. Then, on his second Africa trip, Hughes joins another economist, Michael Faye, the co-founder of GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that has a much simpler strategy of supplying cash grants to people living on less than a dollar a day.After comparing Faye\u2019s approach with Sachs\u2019s, Hughes concludes that giving poor people unrestricted cash is generally more effective than trying to second-guess their needs by building them schoolhouses or handing them computers. This insight prompts him to get involved in the nascent campaign for a universal basic income in America. Hughes ends up founding the Economic Security Project, a nonprofit devoted to using cash transfers to end poverty.The book\u2019s trickiest maneuver comes when Hughes attempts to synthesize his two stories by explaining how his turbulent tenure at The New Republic colored his approach to the ideal of a universal income. He still believes in a universal cash-transfer policy, it seems, but no longer has the courage of his convictions: \u201cWhat went wrong at The New Republic,\u201d he says, is \u201cthe driving reason why I favor a more modest guaranteed income\u201d instead. But he never convincingly explains why his failure at the magazine plays such an outsize role in his worldview, especially compared with his successes at Facebook and in Obama\u2019s presidential campaign.Hughes\u2019s proposal \u2014 which he himself describes as a \u201cprosaic and incremental\u201d expansion of the earned-income tax credit \u2014 is emphatically not a universal basic income. For one thing, it targets only the bottom 35 percent or so of earners in the country. Worse, it doesn\u2019t even reach all of them. The Hughes plan is restricted to working Americans: people who made more than $6,000 last year, who are looking after dependents under the age of 6 or over the age of 70, or who are enrolled in an accredited college. If you earned less than $6,000, you\u2019ll receive only your previous year\u2019s earnings \u2014 and if those earnings were zero, you\u2019ll receive zero. Those who live at the very bottom of the income spectrum would have to continue to rely on America\u2019s overstretched social safety net, which, in all too many cases, pays them little or nothing.By creating a hard ceiling at $50,000 a year, Hughes also creates a nasty marriage penalty: He\u2019s effectively telling couples where each partner earns less than $50,000 that they shouldn\u2019t get married and form a household. That\u2019s because, if they do so, thereby bringing their joint earnings above $50,000, they\u2019ll lose a combined $12,000 a year in guaranteed income.Hughes quotes Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the architect of a previous attempt at a national guaranteed income, as saying that it failed because it was \u201cboth too much and too little; too radical, too reactionary; too comprehensive, not comprehensive enough.\u201d Yet his plan seems to make exactly the same mistake. Opponents of no-strings cash handouts will not be particularly mollified by the fact that this plan targets merely 42 million households rather than all 120 million households in the country. Proponents of a universal basic income, meanwhile, especially those who see it as insurance for a time when robots drive us all out of work, will be exasperated at the way the plan explicitly excludes the jobless and the neediest.Hughes is attracted to boldness, and played an important part in the achievements of both Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama. But ultimately he\u2019s a better follower than a leader. Fired up by his new cause, he could have published a rallying cry, an inspirational manifesto. Instead, he has delivered a book with more footnotes than passion \u2014 and, for the very poorest, a proposal that seems deeply unfair.Felix Salmon is a financial writer, editor and podcaster.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Manchester United, a Win to Celebrate but Not to Savor", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMANCHESTER, England \u2014 Emblazoned on the great glass frontage of Old Trafford\u2019s East Stand, sandwiched between the soft bronze statue of Sir Matt Busby and the neon red letters of the club\u2019s name, was proof of Manchester United\u2019s complete conversion to the digital age.For a team that has long been so pioneering and so groundbreaking off the field, United has always seemed curiously hesitant when it comes to social media. This was the first club, after all, to realize the potential in soccer\u2019s emerging markets, and then to work out how to monetize that popularity.United, in a very real sense, has sold its soles, but whatever qualms that might have once existed have long since evaporated. Indeed, the policy has proved so effective that most of its rivals have since started to copy it.That enterprising approach has not necessarily been matched online. United latched onto Facebook\u2019s significance early, and the club regularly boasts about its social imprint in its quarterly calls with investors. But it was not until 2013 that United decided that Twitter was not just \u2014 or not only, anyway \u2014 a self-indulgent fad. It was the last team in both the Premier League and the Champions League to join.It waited five more years to decide that YouTube, too, is here to stay. Quite why United has been so reticent to enter this brave new world is not clear, though the most obvious explanation may also be the most convincing: If something does not directly drive revenue, the club\u2019s hierarchy \u2014 and the Glazer family that sits at its head \u2014 has tended not to be especially interested.Whether that is a world this United vintage is suited to is a different matter. As soccer, and sports in general, pivot toward the bright digital horizon, it is worth considering Marshall McLuhan\u2019s adage that the medium is the message. Clubs cannot hope simply to exploit the power and reach of social media without being shaped by them in some way, too.The way audiences consume soccer \u2014 and everything else \u2014 is changing. Fans no longer have to watch a whole 90-minute match. Often, they do not even need to see extended highlights. United\u2019s audience, and those of its peers, may be time-rich, but it is attention-poor. The minute we are not entertained, there is a powerful temptation to skip forward.You can see goals, in clips of no more than a few seconds, on Twitter. The best tricks or the most egregious errors are replicated in the form of even briefer GIFs. A player can now be reduced to a YouTube compilation lasting barely a couple of minutes. This is the future, and in the future, nobody will pay attention to anything for 15 minutes.That is significant for the way all clubs \u2014 and superclubs like United, in particular \u2014 are run. Fans and owners of soccer\u2019s great names have always demanded not just success, but style, too. That is ever more pressing now, in an age when teams must not only be beautiful for all 90 minutes, but look spectacular in bite-size chunks, too.There is a reason teams are prepared to spend unimaginable sums on individual players capable of moments of magic, or those who might create some social media buzz. There is a reason, too, beyond some intangible philosophical preference, that more and more teams are choosing to employ coaches who can deliver an adventurous, expansive approach, rather than simply those with the most trophies on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.That, of course, is where Jos\u00e9 Mourinho comes in, though in truth much the same could be said of his counterpart at Chelsea, Antonio Conte. Neither is an attacking coach in the same way that Pep Guardiola, of Manchester City, or even Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp or Tottenham\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino is. Mourinho and Conte preach a tactically astute, but inherently cautious, approach.That is not to say that either Mourinho or Conte is a bad coach, or that United or Chelsea is a bad team. But watching United recover to beat Chelsea, 2-1, on Sunday, it was hard not to wonder if this was enough, now, given how much soccer\u2019s priorities have changed. Is it enough, as Mourinho said, for a club of United\u2019s scope and scale to have a \u201chumble attitude,\u201d to be diligent and determined, to eke out victory through gritted teeth?It might be, of course, if the reward at the end was a polished silver trophy with ribbons attached. In the Premier League, at least, though, it will not. United\u2019s win here returned Mourinho\u2019s team to second place in the table, above Liverpool, but it remains far adrift of City. Defeat meant Chelsea fell behind Tottenham Hotspur, into fifth.There are still prizes to play for, of course: Both United and Chelsea might soon reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League; one or both might return to that stage next year, too.Neither United nor Chelsea can say the same. Both have fallen behind City \u2014 that much is clear \u2014 but in a sense, they are losing ground to Liverpool and Spurs, too, if only in intangibles: They are not as compelling, not as entertaining, not as much fun. There is a desire, at times, to skip ahead. That is at odds with the demands of the YouTube age. This is the world United has stepped into. Now, it is at its mercy.Advertisement"}

I had recently had a baby and was feeding her in a darkened room as she cuddled on my lap. It was an intimate, tender moment \u2014 except for one detail. She was gazing at me \u2026 and I was on eBay, scrolling through listings for Victorian-era doorknobs.I\u2019m not going to try to explain this particular personal passion. The point is that a good 15 minutes had probably passed before I finally caught sight of my daughter looking at me, her tiny face illuminated by my phone\u2019s blue light. I saw the scene as it would have looked to an outsider \u2014 her focused on me, me focused on my phone \u2014 and my heart sank. This was not the way I wanted things to be.Two years later, I feel that I\u2019ve succeeded. Here are some of the key things I learned on how to navigate a successful breakup and create a better relationship with your phone.Create triggers that will remind you of your goals and make it easier to live up to them. If you want to spend more time reading, leave a book on your bedside table. If you want to cook more, lay out a shopping list for that recipe you\u2019re eager to try. Set up a charging station for your phone that\u2019s not in your bedroom, and buy a stand-alone alarm clock.On the flip side, avoid triggers that will set you up for failure. Delete social media apps from your phone. (Use the clunkier browser versions instead.) Disable notifications, including those for email. (I allow only those from phone calls, text messages and my calendar.) Establish a rule \u2014 for yourself and your family \u2014 of not keeping phones on the table during meals.It\u2019s amazing how often we pick up our phones \u201cjust to check\u201d then look up 20 minutes later wondering where the time has gone. I call these \u201czombie checks,\u201d and they\u2019re nearly guaranteed to be unsatisfying or make you feel like you\u2019re wasting your life.Leave your phone at home while you go for a walk. Stare out of a window during your commute instead of checking your email. At first, you may be surprised by how powerfully you crave your phone. Pay attention to your craving. What does it feel like in your body? What\u2019s happening in your mind? Keep observing it, and eventually, you may find that it fades away on its own.If all else fails, consider your own mortality. How many people on their deathbeds do you think are going to say, \u201cI wish I\u2019d spent more time on Facebook\u201d? Keep asking yourself the same question, again and again and again: This is your life. How much of it do you want to spend on your phone?Advertisement"}

Trump or Bernie Sanders.The accounts focused on issues like immigration, the Black Lives Matter movement and religion. Some were used to encourage minority groups not to vote or to promote accusations that the Democratic Party engaged in voter fraud.In an email written to a family member, a Russian defendant, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina, explained: \u201cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\u201dThe indictment says that the organization staged several political rallies across the country from June to November 2016. Members of the group promoted the events through their social media channels and used accounts registered under false American personas to recruit volunteers.2016 rallies planned and promoted by the organization:The social media accounts were sometimes used to contact and coordinate with local Trump campaign staff members. In June 2016, a volunteer for the Trump campaign agreed to provide signs for a \u201cMarch For Trump\u201d rally staged by the organization. The indictment does not allege that any Americans knowingly conspired with the group.In some cases, the organization offered money to rally attendees for expenses. For one of several \u201cFlorida Goes Trump\u201d rallies held in August 2016, the organization paid an individual to portray Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform in a cage built on a flatbed truck.The group also purchased advertisements to promote the rallies. The indictment said that Facebook ads for the Florida rallies reached more than 59,000 users and were clicked on by more than 8,300.Multiple tweets from Florida rallies on Aug. 20, 2016 mentioned the group\u2019s March for Trump account.The indictment says that from April to November 2016, the group paid for advertisements on social media and elsewhere that expressly advocated for Mr. Trump or opposed Mrs. Clinton.The defendants did not file those expenditures with the Federal Election Commission, although as foreign nationals, they would have been prohibited from making them in the first place.The document also notes that the defendants did not register as foreign agents with the Justice Department, which is required \u201cso that the U.S. government and the people of the United States are informed of the source of information and the identity of persons attempting to influence U.S. public opinion, policy, and law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Too Much Power to the People? A Food Safety Site Tests the Limits", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftDan Laptev, an electronics analyst, was making his way through the Charlotte, N.C., airport this month when he stopped at Starbucks for a light dinner \u2014 a ham-and-cheese sandwich and a cup of hot chocolate. He ate, drank, boarded his flight and got home. And that\u2019s when the trouble started.\u201cI wanted to let people know to stop eating at Starbucks,\u201d he told me.This is the era of internet-assisted consumer revenge, and as scorned customers in industries from dentistry to dog-walking have used digital platforms to broadcast their displeasure, the balance of power has tipped considerably in the buyer\u2019s favor.This is especially true of IWasPoisoned, which has collected about 89,000 reports since it opened in 2009. Consumers use the site to decide which restaurants to avoid, and public health departments and food industry groups routinely monitor its submissions, hoping to identify outbreaks before they spread. The site has even begun to tilt stocks, as traders on Wall Street see the value of knowing which national restaurant chain might soon have a food-safety crisis on its hands.Not everyone is happy about the added transparency. Restaurant executives have criticized IWasPoisoned for allowing anonymous and unverified submissions, which they say leads to false reports and irresponsible fear-mongering. Some public health officials have objected on the grounds that food poisoning victims can\u2019t be trusted to correctly identify what made them sick.\u201cIt\u2019s not helping food safety,\u201d said Martin Wiedmann, a professor of food safety at Cornell University. \u201cIf you want to trace food-borne illness, it needs to be done by public health departments, and it needs to include food history.\u201dRating your Uber driver or Airbnb host is one thing. But when it comes to matters of public health, is there such a thing as giving too much power to the people?Patrick Quade, IWasPoisoned\u2019s founder, told me that he started the site after, he said, he got food poisoning from a B.L.T. wrap he bought at a Manhattan deli. At the time, Mr. Quade, now 46, was working as an interest rates trader at Morgan Stanley. He figured that other people might want a place to report food-borne illnesses quickly and anonymously, without the ordeal of filing a complaint with the local health department.\u201cI could tell that Chipotle was a problem brand,\u201d Mr. Quade said. \u201cThe rate of reporting was averaging nine or 10 times higher than other brands. It was a really powerful leading indicator.\u201d\u201cReports made to these third-party reporting sites have no clinical validation, are made anonymously, and are unreliable,\u201d Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe constantly monitor all available sources of information \u2014 including social media platforms and third-party reporting websites \u2014 to ensure we are aware of any allegation of illness, and we have robust procedures in place to look into any claims that are made.\u201dAfter the 2015 Chipotle incident drew attention to the site, Mr. Quade realized that IWasPoisoned could become a real business. He quit his job at Morgan Stanley, and began to work on the site full time. He now has three employees, a handful of remote contractors and a makeshift office at a co-working space in Manhattan. The company makes less than $20,000 per month in revenue, but Mr. Quade expects that to grow. Soon, he plans to release a mobile app, which will alert a user when walking near a restaurant with an active food poisoning complaint.As it has matured, IWasPoisoned has developed an unusual business model that reflects Mr. Quade\u2019s Wall Street roots. Power users \u2014 like, say, a hedge fund that can profit from knowing about an E. coli outbreak at a major restaurant chain ahead of the rest of the market \u2014 pay up to $5,000 a month for real-time alerts whenever a new report is posted to the site. (Free alerts are also available, but they come only once a day.) Only a handful of clients pay for the premium service, but more have expressed interest in signing up, Mr. Quade said.\u201cThe investment community is more attuned to food safety than ever before,\u201d he said.Health officials and restaurant executives are also using the site to spot early signs of trouble. According to Mr. Quade, public health agencies in 46 states and representatives from more than half of the top 50 restaurant chains in America subscribe to the site\u2019s daily email alerts. More than 25,000 consumers subscribe to the emails as well.On average, the site now receives 150 complaints a day, and every new report is manually reviewed by a staff member before posting to make sure it is at least plausible. The site weeds out obvious hoaxes and joke submissions, and uses technology like IP tracking to help stop users from submitting multiple reviews of the same restaurant.\u201cWith every report, our promise is to make sure it\u2019s a real person who believes they have food poisoning,\u201d Mr. Quade said.One of those words \u2014 \u201cbelieves\u201d \u2014 is perhaps the food industry\u2019s biggest problem with IWasPoisoned. Food safety experts told me that food poisoning victims are prone to what epidemiologists call \u201crecall bias.\u201d A person who gets a violent stomach bug will naturally attribute it to the last thing he or she ate, especially if it came from a restaurant with a history of food-safety issues. But often, given the slow-developing nature of many food-borne illnesses, the culprit is something eaten days earlier, or something entirely unrelated.\u201cA web page like this doesn\u2019t ask what disease you got, or the timing of it,\u201d Professor Wiedmann of Cornell said. \u201cAll of that gets lost.\u201dMr. Quade conceded that point, saying that \u201cwe don\u2019t go out and conduct medical tests\u201d on submissions, and that users\u2019 accounts might not always be reliable. The site allows restaurants to appeal a report, he said, if it has evidence that a customer is lying or mistaken, and it pulls reports off its website after 30 days to limit their reputational damage.But he said that the site\u2019s reports were still valuable as data points to consider in context. And, he added, users want a place to complain.\u201cThey\u2019ll do it, whether we exist or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not there, they\u2019ll just go to Twitter or Facebook.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Here and Now\u2019 Series Premiere: This Great Experiment", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere and Now\u201cHere and Now\u201d is going to be a weird show. That much is implied in the first moments of the series premiere, as a barrage of apparently unrelated images flashes across the screen, followed by a shot of a woman and a little boy playing on the beach. The camera quivers. The sound skips like an old record. The woman gasps, removes her sunglasses, calls out the name \u201cRamon\u201d and scratches four long, deep gashes into her own face with her fingernails. She says something in a language that isn\u2019t English. It\u2019s as though we\u2019ve entered some new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d lodge.But, phew, it\u2019s nothing more than a dream. Or, at least, it seems that way when Ramon Bayer-Boatwright (Daniel Zovatto), a college student who designs video games, awakens in his Portland, Ore., apartment. That same morning, he summons the courage to take his flirting to the next level with Henry Bergen (Andy Bean), a bearded barista who might be Ramon\u2019s soul mate and who is surprisingly eager to accompany him to his father\u2019s 60th birthday party that evening.It\u2019s a good day. The only thing that seems off about it is that Ramon keeps seeing the number \u201c11:11.\u201d First it\u2019s a clock in the coffee shop. Then it\u2019s the dashboard of his elliptical, at the gym, which freezes 11 minutes and 11 seconds into his workout. After a few of these scenes, it occurred to me that the four gashes from his dream also resembled four ones. Ramon tells Henry about a website that claims that people who are \u201ccontacted\u201d by the number 11:11 have \u201csome positive mission to accomplish.\u201d They laugh it off in bed, joking that their hookup is that mission.Still, the extent to which this show is going to be weird doesn\u2019t become clear until the final ten minutes of the episode. At the party, as his depressive philosophy professor father, Greg Boatwright (Tim Robbins), delivers an uncomfortably pessimistic speech, Ramon has a vision. There are four candles on top of a bookshelf, and their flames seem to stretch into, yes, four long, straight, blazing lines. No one else sees it.This tragicomic scene, in which Ramon interrupts Greg\u2019s sad-sack monologue by screaming, cursing and hallucinating, is emblematic of what \u201cHere and Now\u201d seems to be: a pointedly contemporary family drama with supernatural elements. And, if this set piece is any indication, those two facets of the story won\u2019t always coexist so comfortably.The episode plays like a sort of Alan Ball greatest-hits medley. Ball scripted the Oscar-winning suburban lament \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d then created the classic family drama \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d and the less-classic vampire soap \u201cTrue Blood\u201d for HBO. His shows all have political overtones (in \u201cTrue Blood,\u201d vampires \u201ccome out\u201d to humans), and he loves using families as a prism through which to view American life. At his best, Ball creates characters that feel as lovably imperfect as your own parent or sibling; other times, it can feel as if he\u2019s screaming liberal talking points through the screen.Greg\u2019s wife, Audrey Bayer-Boatwright (the great Holly Hunter), is his opposite \u2014 energetic while he\u2019s chronically lethargic, controlling while he\u2019s out of control, obsessively involved in her children\u2019s lives while he barely acknowledges their existence. Twenty years ago, Audrey gave up her therapy practice to found something called the Empathy Project. She wants her son\u2019s new lover, Henry, to be her best friend, because that\u2019s just how cool she is with having a gay son. And although she\u2019s the kind of upper-middle-class white person who can\u2019t throw a house party without bringing in caterers, she does speak to them in fluent Spanish.In his speech, to his kids\u2019 understandable annoyance, Greg refers to their family as \u201cthis great experiment.\u201d Three of the four Bayer-Boatwright children were adopted from countries wronged by the United States. Ramon was born in Colombia. His elder siblings, Ashley (Jerrika Hinton), from Liberia, and Duc (Raymond Lee), from Vietnam, envy him. They call him \u201cBaby Jesus\u201d because, as Duc explains over drinks with Ashley and the male model she brought along from work, their parents \u201cjust calmed down\u201d after they adopted Ramon. He didn\u2019t have to wear the national costumes Audrey forced on the older kids, maybe because he looked \u201cWASP white.\u201dTheir parents\u2019 well-meaning attention to Ashley\u2019s and Duc\u2019s origins have apparently made them both fixated on and resistant to their racial and ethnic identities. They tease each other with slurs like \u201cangry black woman\u201d and \u201cching chong Viet Cong.\u201d Ashley changed her name, at 18, from one of African origin to what she calls \u201cthe whitest name I can think of.\u201d She\u2019s married to a kind, dull white man, the father of her young daughter, and she has a job that\u2019s very different from her parents\u2019 do-gooder professions: She works in the fashion industry. Duc, for his part, is so hungry for his dad\u2019s approval that he\u2019s become a \u201cmotivational architect,\u201d feeding clients a simplified version of Greg\u2019s philosophy with slogans like, \u201cSee it, want it, have it.\u201d Also, he\u2019s celibate.Ramon\u2019s messianic nickname, and his soothing effect on his parents, may well turn out to have some connection to this 11:11 story line. But for now, what\u2019s clear is that there are two factions among the kids: Ashley with Duc, and Ramon with his 17-year-old sister, Kristen (Sosie Bacon), who idolizes Ramon. As their parents\u2019 sole biological child, she has a complex about being \u201cthe boring white chick in the family.\u201d So she escapes from herself, smoking weed, making fake Facebook accounts and wandering around Greg\u2019s party with a rubber horse mask on her head. When she loses her virginity with Ashley\u2019s model, he doesn\u2019t seem to mind that she stays in disguise the entire time.In the meantime, I\u2019m ambivalent. Ball wrote and directed the premiere, which accounts for the strong dialogue. I find Ramon and Audrey fascinating, and Kristen reminds me of Lauren Ambrose\u2019s Claire Fisher, the wonderfully angsty teen daughter from \u201cSix Feet Under.\u201d I loved the conversation in which she reminds her mom, \u201cI am my own person who is not you.\u201d Audrey and Duc haven\u2019t entirely come into focus yet, and Greg is a bit of a sulky, baby boomer dad clich\u00e9. (In \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d terms, he\u2019s a Lester Burnham for Trump\u2019s America.)Most of all, I\u2019m worried the 11:11 stuff and the Bayer-Boatwright saga will never meld into one coherent story. The first episode of \u201cHere and Now\u201d held my attention, though, and that\u2019s all a pilot needs to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Russia, Facebook Sends a Message It Wishes It Hadn\u2019t", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftOn most days, Facebook doesn\u2019t have much in common with President Trump. But at the moment, both are in the damage-control business, as they try to get out from under the cloud of suspicion related to Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.Their goals collided in awkward fashion over the weekend when Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, posted a series of messages on Twitter that were meant to clear up misconceptions about Facebook\u2019s role in the election. Instead, he plunged the company deeper into controversy.Most of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to effect the outcome of the 2016 US election.  I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.He continued: \u201cThe majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn\u2019t align with the main media narrative of Tump [sic] and the election.\u201dNow, Facebook is in the uncomfortable position of reining in an off-message executive, while clarifying that it didn\u2019t mean to bolster the president\u2019s position.\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201dMr. Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and the company declined to make him available for an interview.In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tiny Red Dots Took Over Your Life", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyAs the ranks of tech-industry critics have expanded, it has become harder to tell what common ground they occupy. Across various political divides, there is a sense that Facebook, Twitter and Google exert too much influence on the national discourse; closely connected to this is the widespread concern that we users have developed an unhealthful relationship with our phones, or with the apps on them. But on any more specific claim than that, consensus becomes impossible. The sudden arrival of a new class of tech skeptic, the industry apostate, has only complicated the discussion. Late last year, the co-inventor of the Facebook \u201clike,\u201d Justin Rosenstein, called it a \u201cbright ding of pseudopleasure\u201d; in January, the investment firm Jana Partners, a shareholder in Apple, wrote a letter to the company warning that its products \u201cmay be having unintentional negative consequences.\u201dAll but conjuring Oppenheimer at White Sands, these critics offer broadsides, warning about addictive design tricks and profit-driven systems eroding our humanity. But it\u2019s hard to discern a collective message in their garment-rending: Is it design that needs fixing? Tech? Capitalism? This lack of clarity may stem from the fact that these people are not ideologues but reformists. They tend to believe that companies should be more responsible \u2014 and users must be, too. But with rare exceptions, the reformists stop short of asking the uncomfortable questions: Is it possible to reform profit-driven systems that turn attention into money? In such a business, can you even separate addiction from success?Perhaps this is unfair \u2014 the reformists are trying. But while we wait for a consensus, or a plan, allow me to suggest a starting point: the dots. Little. Often red. Sometimes with numbers. Commonly seen at the corners of app icons, where they are known in the trade as badges, they are now proliferating across once-peaceful interfaces on a steep epidemic curve. They alert us to things that need to be checked: unread messages; new activities; pending software updates; announcements; unresolved problems. As they\u2019ve spread, they\u2019ve become a rare commonality in the products that we \u2014 and the remorseful technologists \u2014 are so worried about. If not the culprits, the dots are at least accessories to most of the supposed crimes of addictive app design.When platforms or services sense their users are disengaged, whether from social activities, work or merely a continued contribution to corporate profitability, dots are deployed: outside, inside, wherever they might be seen. I\u2019ve met dots that existed only to inform me of the existence of other dots, new dots, dots with almost no meaning at all; a dot on my Instagram app led me to another dot within it, which informed me that something had happened on Facebook: Someone I barely know had posted for the first time in a while. These dots are omnipresent, leading everywhere and ending nowhere. So maybe there\u2019s something to be gained by connecting them.That year, we got the very first glimpse of the iPhone\u2019s home screen, in Steve Jobs\u2019s hand, onstage at MacWorld. It showed three dots, ringed in white: 1 unread text; 5 calls or voice mail messages; 1 email. Jobs set about showing off the apps, opening them, eliminating the dots. Eventually, when the iPhone was opened to outside developers, badge use accelerated. As touch-screen phones careered toward ubiquity, and as desktop interfaces and website design and mobile operating systems huddled together around a crude and adapting set of visual metaphors, the badge was ascendant.On Windows desktop computers, they tended to be blue and lived in the lower right corner. On BlackBerrys, red, with a white asterisk in the middle. On social media, in apps and on websites, badge design was more creative, appearing as little speech bubbles or as rectangles. They make appearances on Facebook and across Google products, perhaps most notoriously on the ill-fated Google Plus social network, where blocky badges were filled with inexplicably, desperately high numbers. (This tactic has since spread, obnoxiously, to news sites and, inexplicably, to comment sections.) Android itself has remained officially unbadged, but the next version of the operating system, called Oreo, will include them by default, completing their invasion.What\u2019s so powerful about the dots is that until we investigate them, they could signify anything: a career-altering email; a reminder that Winter Sales End Soon; a match, a date, a \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d The same badge might lead to word that Grandma\u2019s in the hospital or that, according to a prerecorded voice, the home-security system you don\u2019t own is in urgent need of attention or that, for the 51st time today, someone has posted in the group chat.New and flourishing modes of socialization amount, in the most abstract terms, to the creation and reduction of dots, and the experience of their attendant joys and anxieties. Dots are deceptively, insidiously simple: They are either there or they\u2019re not; they contain a number, and that number has a value. But they imbue whatever they touch with a spirit of urgency, reminding us that behind each otherwise static icon is unfinished business. They don\u2019t so much inform us or guide us as correct us: You\u2019re looking there, but you should be looking here. They\u2019re a lawn that must be mowed. Boils that must be lanced, or at least scabs that itch to be picked. They\u2019re Bubble Wrap laid over your entire digital existence.To their credit, the big tech companies seem to be aware of the problem, at least in the narrow terms of user experience. In Google\u2019s guide for application developers, the company makes a gentle attempt to pre-empt future senseless dot deployment. \u201cDon\u2019t badge every notification, as there are cases where badges don\u2019t make sense,\u201d the company suggests. Apple, in its guidelines, seems a bit more fed up. \u201cMinimize badging,\u201d it says. \u201cDon\u2019t overwhelm users by connecting badging with a huge amount of information that changes frequently. Use it to present brief, essential information and atypical content changes that are highly likely to be of interest.\u201dThese companies know better than anyone that dots are a problem, but they also know that dots work. Late last year, a red badge burbled to the surface next to millions of iPhone users\u2019 Settings apps. It looked as though it might be an update, but it turned out to be a demand: Finish adding your credit card to Apple Pay, or the dot stays put. Apple might as well have said: Give us your credit card number, or we will annoy you until you do.The lack of consensus within the mounting resistance to Big Tech can also be found within the perimeter of the dot. After all, it\u2019s where the most dangerous conflations take place: of what we need, and what we\u2019re told we need; of what purpose our software serves to us, and us to it; of dismissal with fulfillment. The dot is where ill-gotten attention is laundered into legitimate-seeming engagement. On this, our most influential tech companies seem to agree. Maybe our self-appointed saviors can, too.John Herrman is a David Carr Fellow at The Times.Advertisement"}

They will not impact the committee\u2019s focus and commitment to continue this investigation.\u201dBut he praised Mr. Patel, saying, \u201cWe value Kash\u2019s dedication and his contributions to the committee\u2019s oversight efforts.\u201dMr. Patel, who did not respond to a request for comment for this article, grew up in Garden City, N.Y., and graduated from the University of Richmond in 2002. He earned a certificate in international law from the University College London Faculty of Laws, according to his Facebook page, and graduated from Pace University\u2019s law school in 2005.He spent part of his career in the Miami area as a federal public defender in Florida before surprising his co-workers there by taking a job at the Justice Department in 2014, according to his Facebook profile.In early 2016, during a court appearance in Houston, Mr. Patel found himself in the cross hairs of Judge Lynn N. Hughes of Federal District Court, who became incensed that Mr. Patel had used the internet credentials of another lawyer to give notice that he would be involved in a terrorism case, and then did not like how he was dressed.\u201cThe last thing I need here, Mr. Patel,\u201d the judge said, according to a transcript of the hearing, \u201cis a bureaucrat who flies down here at great expense and causes trouble rather than actually is a productive member of the team.\u201dAfter working on counterterrorism cases at the Justice Department, Mr. Patel joined the Intelligence Committee last spring as a senior staff member, and has been at the forefront of Mr. Nunes\u2019s inquiry into whether the F.B.I. and the Justice Department abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.Over the summer, Mr. Nunes dispatched Mr. Patel and another member of the committee\u2019s Republican staff to London, where they showed up unannounced at the offices of Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence official.Told Mr. Steele was not there, Mr. Patel and Douglas E. Presley, a professional staff member, managed to track him down at the offices of his lawyers. There, they said they were seeking only to establish contact with Mr. Steele, but were rebuffed and left without meeting him, according to two people with knowledge of the encounter.A senior official for the Republican majority on the Intelligence Committee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter, said the purpose of the visit had been to make contact with Mr. Steele\u2019s lawyers, not Mr. Steele. Still, the visit was highly unusual and appeared to violate protocol, because they were trying to meet with Mr. Steele outside official channels.Ordinarily, such a visit would be coordinated through lawyers, conducted with knowledge of the House Democrats, who were not informed and the American Embassy.In the months since, Mr. Patel has apparently forged connections at the White House. In November, he posted a series of photos to Facebook of him and several friends wearing matching shirts at the White House bowling alley. \u201cThe Dons hit the lanes at 1600 Pennsylvania,\u201d Mr. Patel wrote under the photos.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

But the following evening, a friend called to share a peculiar bit of news: \u201cYou have been elevated to being a martyr.\u201dIn the span of a few hours, messages on WhatsApp and Facebook mourning \u201cmartyr Rahul,\u201d and saying he had been killed in clashes, went viral across Uttar Pradesh State, which includes Kasganj.Candlelight vigils paying respect to Mr. Upadhyay, who is Hindu, lit up the streets of seven districts, some with the participation of local politicians.By the time Mr. Upadhyay found out, there was little he could do: The riots had become so bad in Kasganj that the authorities shut down the internet.\u201cNo media house or politician bothered to visit my place or call me first to confirm that I was indeed dead,\u201d he said. \u201cThe marketplace of rumors had heated up beyond control.\u201dKasganj was not always like this. For much of its history, Muslims and Hindus coexisted peacefully in this dusty city about 100 miles east of New Delhi. As the price of land shot up in the area, the city prospered. Now, rows of mustard-colored crops, markers of the region\u2019s agrarian roots, frame Honda dealerships catering to a population eager to trade bicycles for motorbikes.In the years since Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party rose to power in 2014, violent outbreaks between Hindus and Muslims have become more common in some pockets of India.The clashes began with a flag. On Jan. 26, a group of Muslims gathered in an open square in Kasganj, unstacking rows of red plastic chairs and preparing to hoist a flag into the air to celebrate Republic Day, which marks the enactment of India\u2019s constitution in 1950.Around the same time, dozens of men on motorbikes affiliated with a far-right Hindu student group approached the assembly, asking that the Muslims move the chairs so they could pass. Accounts of what happened next vary.According to a police report filed by Sushil Gupta, the father of Abhishek Gupta, the man who was actually killed, a group of Muslims began taunting the Hindus, shouting \u201cLong Live Pakistan,\u201d and telling them that they would have to chant \u201cHail Pakistan\u201d if they wanted to pass.Shamsul Arafeen, 70, a Muslim tailor who was part of the crowd, remembered the encounter differently, describing a \u201cbig mob\u201d of Hindus who demanded that the Muslims move the chairs before boiling the argument down to religion. Others said the Hindus told the Muslims to go back to Pakistan.\u201cThey started abusing us, saying, \u2018If you want to live in Hindustan, you must chant \u2018Hail Sita and Ram,\u2019\u201d Mr. Arafeen said, using another name for India and referring to two Hindu gods.The confrontation became physical soon afterward, with rioters from both sides throwing stones at each other and burning shops to the ground. Videos of the confrontations spread rapidly. The authorities shut down internet service in the area for hours.By the end of the clashes, which stretched over a week, over 100 people had been arrested, both Hindu and Muslim. Mohar Singh Tomar, an investigating officer with Kasganj\u2019s police force, said it was unclear who started the clashes, brushing aside suggestions that either religious group had received unfair treatment.Purnendra Pratap Singh Solanki, the district president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, took a harder line, characterizing the confrontation as a \u201cpreplanned conspiracy\u201d by a growing Muslim population to target Hindus.\u201cWhat is very problematic for us is that Muslims are ruled by their religion first,\u201d he said. \u201cThey consider themselves Muslims before Indians, whereas the Hindus consider themselves Indians first and then Hindus.\u201d\u201cThe solution to such problems is to control their population,\u201d Mr. Solanki added. \u201cTheir religious education at the madrassas must be combined with nationalism, peppered with nationalism. The problem is they don\u2019t want to get educated at all.\u201dReacting to the violence in Kasganj, R. V. Singh, the district magistrate in Bareilly, also in Uttar Pradesh, described a recent episode involving a Hindu march in a village in his district.At the same time, the always rocky relationship between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan has notably worsened in recent months.Around Kasganj, many people said they were terrified to leave their homes and return to work.\u201cOur children are sleeping on hungry stomachs,\u201d said Mohammad Shadab, 24, who works in a soap factory. \u201cThe kind of fear in the community has never been felt before.\u201dAs for Mr. Upadhyay, he still has not figured out who first reported his death or why he had been singled out. Over the last weekend in January, he fielded over 400 calls from people asking if he had died. \u201cMy mother had to serve endless cups of tea to visitors and convince them that I was alive,\u201d he said.Eventually, Mr. Upadhyay figured that if he could not control social media, he might as well participate.\u201cI am Rahul Upadhyay,\u201d he said in a recorded message sent out into cyberspace. \u201cI am well and I have not even received a scratch.\u201dStill, he said, the damage was done. Hundreds of miles away, in the city of Gorakhpur, posters with his photograph had already been distributed.Near his face was a warning: \u201cWe will take revenge for the death of martyr Rahul Upadhyay.\u201dSuhasini Raj reported from Kasganj, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meatballs That Take a Cue From Turkey", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenWhat kind of meatballs are these? It\u2019s a fair question: Meatballs come in countless variations. You could make them every week for a year, never repeating a recipe. It is a culinary common thread that runs through albondigas, polpettini, boulettes, kofte \u2014 all spherical morsels of finely chopped meat.The origin of the meatball is hardly a mystery. When an animal is butchered, there are a limited number of primal cuts, the tender parts that are turned into chops, steaks and roasts. The rest of the beast is used for stewing or put through the meat grinder to become burgers, sausages, meatloaf or meatballs. For many cooks and diners, the bite-size meatball is the most appealing.All meatballs begin the same way. Freshly ground meat is mixed with seasonings and a bit of bread or rice before being rolled into balls. (Nearly all recipes advise forming them with wet hands.) They are then browned on the stovetop or in the oven, to be eaten as is, simmered in a sauce or added to a soup.This recipe, made with ground lamb, has a Turkish feel, spiced with cumin, coriander, cinnamon and a touch of cayenne. The meatballs are browned in olive oil \u2014 though flattening them into patties to be griddled or grilled would be another good choice \u2014 and served with a traditional yogurt sauce.Some cooks braise their meatballs after browning, which renders them exceedingly moist, soft and tender. In this rendition, I like them straight out of the frying pan, crisp on the outside and juicy inside.The warm, tart yogurt sauce adds tang and richness, especially when made with whole-milk yogurt. It is prepared at the last minute, just before serving. A beaten egg and a little cornstarch are added to prevent the yogurt from curdling when heated.Don\u2019t bathe them in the sauce. Instead, pile the meatballs on a platter and pour the sauce over them. For more flavor and visual appeal, add crumbled feta, and sprinkle with sour sumac powder and crushed red-pepper flakes. (Turkish Aleppo pepper is delicious and not too spicy. Korean red-pepper flakes are a good substitute.)To finish, give it all a shower of chopped mint, cilantro and dill. Pinches of bright yellow turmeric to finish make the dish a showstopper.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2014 Barbarescos: Triumphs and Question Marks", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesThe early reports on the 2014 vintage through much of Europe were not optimistic: rain, lots of it. In some places, it lasted through the spring. In parts of Italy, it carried on through much of the growing season.Farmers depend on rain when it comes at the right time and in the right amount to keep their vines healthy. But too much, combined with warm temperatures and plenty of humidity, can be a disaster, leading to mildew, fungus and rot. Yields can be diminished and, without the utmost care, the quality of the wines can be harmed.Yet to the surprise of many people who follow vintage reports as if they were the gospel, the wines from some areas where gloom was deepest have turned out surprisingly well.At one time, perhaps as recently as 25 years ago, a vintage like 2014 might have been a total washout. Growers did not always have the resources or the know-how to combat such looming problems.But today, regions where growing conditions were once on the cusp of being acceptable \u2014 like the Piedmont, Champagne or the Mosel Valley in Germany \u2014 experience far fewer bad vintages than they once did. The reasons include climate change, and an increased ability to manage vineyards under difficult circumstances.When conditions are not ideal, the best producers know what to do. They have the equipment, philosophy and labor force to get it done. But it means a lot of hard work in the vineyard, examining vines and grapes, bunch by bunch, first trying to provide them with the best chance to prosper, and then looking for evidence of damage and eliminating problems.The Barbaresco region is slightly warmer, lower and more protected than the Barolo zone, and the soils tend to be sandier. As a result, the wines are often a bit more accessible at an earlier age than Barolo. They are required by law to be aged for at least two years before they can be released, as against Barolo\u2019s three years.Even so, these wines are never easy to drink young. Nebbiolo is notoriously tannic, with plenty of acidity, and regardless of how it compares with Barolo, Barbaresco is powerful in its own right. Even the most immediately appealing of the 2014s would benefit from another few years of aging before drinking.In the tasting, we found many good bottles, characterized by freshness, expressiveness and a lovely balance. But the wines were inconsistent. Some were oddly green, or overly astringent. And we were all surprised by how oaky some wines seemed, enough so that the barrel flavors may never integrate.The Slavonian oak allows minute amounts of oxygen to interact with the wine, giving it the structure and stability to age for many years. Since the vats are generally not new, they impart little in the way of wood flavors or oak tannins.New, small barrels of French oak, by contrast, permit a faster exchange of oxygen, which softens the grape tannins more quickly. But the wines absorb oak tannins, which have a markedly different texture than grape tannins, as well as wood flavors. New oak also tends to fix the color of the wine at a darker hue. Some producers prefer that, as nebbiolo naturally fades to a kind of garnet color, which consumers sometimes mistakenly associate with weakness in wines.By the 2000s, many of the producers who had adopted French oak had moderated their use, so the wines no longer had the extreme oaky character of some of the previous vintages. Perhaps that\u2019s why we were taken aback by some of the wines in the tasting, in which the oak was overbearing and out of balance.In the end, we were inclined to like the vintage and look forward to drinking our favorites. Nonetheless, we were puzzled by the inconsistency in the tasting.Jenni suggested that some producers may not have had the resources to manage 2014\u2019s tricky weather conditions, which, as I said, would have required much labor-intensive work in the vineyards. It\u2019s yet another reminder, after a year of devastating hurricanes and destructive wildfires, that nature still often has the last say.BEST VALUEStructured yet approachable, with pure, pretty floral and mineral aromas and flavors.

{"Headline": "The New Face of Portrait Painting", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArts and LettersTHE OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL portrait began with George Washington, who was painted in 1796 by Gilbert Stuart, among the pre-eminent American artists of his time. This tradition, of a painter depicting a president, usually soon after the end of his final term, continued after the advent of photography mostly as a matter of ceremony. For hundreds of years, the presidential portrait was a ho-hum affair, failing to generate headlines or even a worthy anecdote, with the possible exception of Theodore Roosevelt, who was so displeased by Th\u00e9obald Chartran\u2019s 1902 portrait \u2014 he thought it made him look too coy \u2014 that he first hid it in a less-trafficked corner of the White House before finally burning it.For centuries, of course, portrait painting was art. But by the second half of the 20th century, it had almost disappeared. By this time, critics routinely announced the death of painting with every new technological and aesthetic innovation. First there was the proliferation of photography, then the ready-made. Then there was the internet, and social media, whose rise seemed to render the medium of painting \u2014 not to mention portraiture \u2014 completely irrelevant: Why paint someone\u2019s picture in the age of the selfie? Most painters responded by getting weirder, more abstract, more experimental; representational figurative art was anachronistic, inert, crusty \u2014 a form of vanity exclusive to the rich.And there is another reason for figurative paintings\u2019 resurgence as well: We live in a time in which reality is almost daily warped in ways that were unimaginable even 18 months ago. We have swiftly entered an era where the very notion of truth, or facts, is considered fungible. As we reassess the various power structures that landed us here, it is stabilizing and reassuring to look at the work of an artist who is clearly in control of her craft, who is able to depict a reality that is material and grounded in recognition \u2014 of seeing, in the Facebook age, a painting that looks like who it is meant to.6 PhotosThis idea is expanded upon in the work of Amy Sherald, who was Michelle Obama\u2019s choice to paint her official portrait. Sherald uses grisaille \u2014 a method of painting in gray monochrome \u2014 for her subjects\u2019 skin. Because her gradations slyly allude to the mixed and often unacknowledged backgrounds of African-Americans, Sherald\u2019s paintings make an important statement about our racial history. One 2016 image, \u201cListen, You a Wonder. You a City of a Woman. You Got a Geography of Your Own,\u201d features a woman wearing a skirt dotted with black flowers. As if to underline the point, she is suspending a black purse in front of her belly.But an ever-widening chasm exists between 2014 and today. If the news of the world feels every day more like a pulpy political thriller with an unhinged plotline, painters have responded by grounding their work in observable, human reality. Most of this work isn\u2019t overtly political on its surface \u2014 there is Henry Taylor\u2019s monumental 2012 portrait of a woman grilling chicken on a barbecue, or Celeste Dupuy-Spencer\u2019s 2016 painting of a man making a playlist on his laptop, a cigarette-filled ashtray in front of him. But they also suggest that, in a time of chaos, there could be nothing more necessary \u2014 more defiant \u2014 than simply showing life as it\u2019s being lived.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Social Media, Lax Enforcement Lets Impostor Accounts Thrive", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Hilary Mason, a data scientist and entrepreneur, discovered that dozens of automated \u201cbot\u201d accounts had sprung up to impersonate her on Twitter, she immediately set out to stop them.She filed dozens of complaints with Twitter, repeatedly submitting copies of her driver\u2019s license to prove her identity. She reached out to friends who worked at the company. But days later, many of the fake accounts remained active, even though virtually identical ones had been shut down.Yet social media companies often fail to vigorously enforce their own policies against impersonation, an examination by The New York Times found, enabling the spread of fake news and propaganda \u2014 and allowing a global black market in social identities to thrive on their platforms.\u201cThese companies have, in a lot of ways, assigned themselves to be validators of your identity,\u201d said Jillian York, an official at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates digital privacy protections. \u201cBut the vast majority of users have no access to any due process, no access to any kind of customer service \u2014 and no means of appealing any kind of decision.\u201dIn congressional hearings last week, some lawmakers questioned whether social media businesses were doing enough.\u201cI think the companies themselves were slow to recognize this threat,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. \u201cI think they\u2019ve still got more work to do.\u201dLeaders of some social media companies have said they are trying hard to grapple with impersonation. In an earnings call this month, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, said the company was expanding what it calls \u201cinformation quality\u201d efforts, including ways of elevating credible and authentic content on the platform.That policy can leave real users mystified or enraged. In December, Firoozeh Dumas, an Iranian-American memoirist who lives in Germany, repeatedly reported to Twitter at least four accounts impersonating hers. \u201cThey have my photos, they tweet things from my books,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of them seems to be selling things.\u201dYet each time Ms. Dumas reported them, emails show, Twitter\u2019s support team told her the accounts did not meet its definition of abusive impersonation.One victim was Erin Barnes, a publicist and writer in Colorado. A bot sold by Devumi used not only her name and portrait, but also a background photograph of her husband and young daughter. \u201cIt makes my skin crawl,\u201d Ms. Barnes said.The account was suspended only recently, after Ms. Barnes \u2014 alerted by The Times \u2014 reported it to Twitter. \u201cIf you\u2019re using somebody\u2019s photos and name together, then that\u2019s impersonation,\u201d she complained.Twitter appears to be tracking Devumi\u2019s network of bots. Since the Times investigation was published, dozens of Devumi\u2019s most prominent clients \u2014 actors, reality TV stars, authors, business executives and others seeking to buy followers and retweets \u2014 have lost more than three million followers. Close to 55,000 impostor accounts sold by Devumi have been restricted or suspended.Twitter has declined to say whether Devumi\u2019s bots violate its impersonation policy, or how many of its employees are focused on rooting out impersonation. The company\u2019s first line of defense against impersonation is the countermeasures that flag accounts that run afoul of Twitter policies on spam \u2014 violations that can be easier for the platform to identify and stop at large scale.But impostor accounts are still relatively easy to find on Twitter. The Times identified hundreds more of them through Twitter\u2019s own automated \u201cwho to follow\u201d feature: When a user views a known impostor account, Twitter routinely recommends other impostor accounts to follow.One real Twitter account, belonging to Jasmine Artis, a health care worker from North Carolina, was cloned dozens of times. At least 75 of those impostor accounts still exist \u2014 though some have recently been restricted \u2014 each using her picture, her name and a brief bio that refers to the school she was attending when her account was copied. Most of the clones have made only a handful of posts, some in Russian or Japanese. Ms. Artis said she had not been aware of the accounts.Even Twitter\u2019s \u201cverified\u201d users, many of them well known, are being impersonated. There are active fake accounts impersonating the Democratic senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and the journalist April D. Ryan. None appeared to be obvious parodies. Instead, each posted content that mimicked what the real account might tweet.Ms. Caliboso and dozens of her friends reported the fake account to Facebook over a period of weeks. But Facebook representatives repeatedly told her the account did not violate the company\u2019s impersonation policies, she said. Eventually, to protect herself, Ms. Caliboso deleted her real account.\u201cI can\u2019t risk that a client or employer \u2014 past, present or future \u2014 might find that profile,\u201d she said.Social media companies succeed in the marketplace by amassing as many active users as possible, so most make it relatively easy to create new accounts. Neither Facebook nor Twitter requires proof of identity to open a new account, but both require it when reporting impostors. Decisions about whether to take down or suspend an account are automated wherever possible, or farmed out to teams of low-level employees and contractors around the world.As a result, on most social media platforms it is far easier to build a bot than to kill one.\u201cThe reason that they\u2019re so bad at this is that it conflicts with their business model,\u201d said Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and technology expert at the University of North Carolina. \u201cThey try to come up with one set of rules that applies to two billion people, and then simplify it so that a contractor in a warehouse in the Philippines can go click-click-click and apply the policy.\u201dMs. Mason, the data scientist, eventually took matters into her own hands. After she filed dozens of impersonation reports to Twitter in 2015, the company suspended many of the impostors, but left dozens untouched.So she created more than 100 bots of her own, using as many variations of her name as she could think of. Each linked back to her real account, with the message \u201cthe real hmason is over there.\u201d Eventually, Ms. Mason\u2019s homegrown bots, and Twitter\u2019s own efforts, seemed to overwhelm the impostors, she said, and the surge in fake accounts stopped.\u201cWith Twitter, it was easy\u201d to make bots, Ms. Mason said. \u201cI was shocked by how easy it was.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case Against Google", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "FeatureCritics say the search giant is squelching competition before it begins. Should the government step in?Supported byIn the years that followed, those overlapping enthusiasms led to cohabitation, a raucous wedding and parallel careers at big technology firms. The thing is, though, when you\u2019re young and geeky and fall in love with someone else young and geeky, all your nerdy friends want you to set them up on dates as well. So Adam and Shivaun, who took Adam\u2019s last name after marriage, approached the problem like two good programmers: They designed a dating app.The app was known as MatchMate, and the idea was simple: Rather than just pairing people with similar interests, their software would put together potential mates according to an array of parameters, such as which pub they were currently standing in, and whether they had friends in common, and what movies they liked or candidates they voted for, and dozens of other factors that might be important in finding a life partner (or at least a tonight partner). The magic of MatchMate was that it could allow a user to mix variables and search for pairings within a specific group, a trick that computer scientists call parameterization. \u201cIt was like asking your best friend to set you up,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cSomeone who says, \u2018Well, you probably think you\u2019d like this guy because he\u2019s handsome, but actually you\u2019d like this other guy because he\u2019s not as good-looking, but he\u2019s really funny.\u2019\u2009\u201dWithin computer science, this kind of algorithmic alchemy is sometimes known as vertical search, and it\u2019s notoriously hard to master. Even Google, with its thousands of Ph.D.s, gets spooked by vertical-search problems. \u201cGoogle\u2019s built around horizontal search, which means if you type in \u2018What\u2019s the population of Myanmar,\u2019 then Google finds websites that include the words \u2018Myanmar\u2019 and \u2018population,\u2019 and figures out which ones are most likely to answer your question,\u201d says Neha Narula, who was a software engineer at Google before joining the M.I.T. Media Lab. You don\u2019t really care if Google sends you to Wikipedia or a news article or some other site, as long as its results are accurate and trustworthy. But, Narula says, \u201cwhen you start asking questions with only one correct answer, like, Which site has the cheapest vacuum cleaner? \u2014 that\u2019s much, much harder.\u201dFor search engines like Google, finding that one correct answer becomes particularly difficult when people have numerous parameters they want satisfied: Which vacuum cleaner is cheapest but also energy-efficient and good on thick carpets and won\u2019t scare the dog? To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.Soon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?As far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.Froogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201dAdam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.The Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.In a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.At the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.In its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201dStandard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201dIn 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201dThe Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.For decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.Consider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.What eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.The Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.\u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201dGoogle executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.One way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201dLeft unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.Shivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.As the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.But they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.Then there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201dThe more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201dTradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)Shivaun and Adam filled notepads with the names of companies that had complained about Google\u2019s tactics \u2014 eJustice, a vertical-search engine for legal information; NexTag, the fellow price-comparison site; BDZV, a group of German newspapers. They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.\u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.Google responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201dThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.Along the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.Even when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.By the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201dReback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201dIn public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.In the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.And most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201dMicrosoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.Or consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201dIt was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.The implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.\u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201dSome legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201dThose are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.Rather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.Put differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.For the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201dOne of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netanyahu Lashes Out as Israeli Police Wrap Up Graft Inquiries", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has lashed out at the country\u2019s police chief, whom he accused of airing \u201cdelusional and mendacious\u201d insinuations against him, just days before the police are expected to publish recommendations regarding potential charges against Mr. Netanyahu in two corruption investigations, possibly including bribery.\u201cA large shadow has been cast this evening over the police investigations and recommendations in the case of Prime Minister Netanyahu,\u201d he added.Critics said Mr. Netanyahu, now in his third consecutive term in office, was trying to discredit the police in order to delegitimize investigations that could undermine his political future.\u201cClearly it is unjustified,\u201d Barak Medina, a professor in the law faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said of the attack on the police commissioner, Roni Alsheich. \u201cThe prime minister is trying to create a spin and present himself as the victim.\u201dLike other observers, Mr. Medina drew comparisons to President Trump\u2019s criticism of the F.B.I. and Justice Department amid investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election campaign.Though he did not directly accuse the prime minister of involvement, Mr. Alsheich did little to push back when his interviewer suggested that the private detectives were acting on behalf of politicians.\u201cUltimately,\u201d he added, \u201cwe know who these people are. Apparently somebody has to pay them, and therefore this disturbs us greatly.\u201dMr. Alsheich has said that after he went public, some months ago, about what he described as \u201cpressures\u201d applied to the investigators by those collecting information on them, the activity stopped. Mr. Alsheich said on Wednesday that these were not \u201crumors or blah blah blah,\u201d but \u201cfacts.\u201dMr. Netanyahu excoriated Mr. Alsheich for \u201crepeating the delusional and mendacious insinuation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent private detectives against police officers investigating him.\u201dIn the interview broadcast on the respected magazine program \u201cUvda\u201d \u2014 an Israeli equivalent of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u2014 Mr. Alsheich also defended the leader of the police anticorruption unit, Roni Ritman, who has been accused of sexual harassment and recently stepped down.Mr. Netanyahu also struck back at this part of the conversation, although his name once again went unmentioned.He wrote of Mr. Alsheich, \u201cIt is shocking to discover that he is repeating to journalists the no less ludicrous and false insinuation of Ritman, as if the prime minister was involved in the complaint\u201d against the investigations unit chief. Mr. Netanyahu and his lawyer have called for a swift inquiry into the claims they said Mr. Alsheich had implied.The extraordinary clash came amid reports in Israel that the police were likely to present conclusions during the next week regarding the evidentiary basis for charges in two graft cases against Mr. Netanyahu.The police have been investigating Mr. Netanyahu on suspicion of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, according to the Israeli authorities.Mr. Netanyahu has already tried to prepare the public for the likelihood that the police will recommend charges, suggesting that such a move would be meaningless, since, he said, only about half of police recommendations resulted in formal charges.A final decision regarding any indictment of Mr. Netanyahu is likely to be months away and would lie with the attorney general, after consultations with the state prosecutor.\u201cThere will be recommendations, there will also be signs saying, \u2018Bibi is guilty until proven innocent,\u2019 and invalid pressures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am sure that at the end of the day the authorized legal bodies will come to the same conclusion, to the simple truth: There is nothing.\u201dMr. Netanyahu appointed Mr. Alsheich as police commissioner about two years ago, and praised him at the time as a \u201ccreative, original and determined commander who is not afraid to take the initiative.\u201dDavid Amsalem, the coalition chairman for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud Party, accused the police of attempting a coup.\u201cWhen people are being murdered in the streets,\u201d he said on Army Radio, \u201cit is more important than the prime minister having received a cigar.\u201dAvi Gabbay, leader of the center-left Labor Party, called Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s attack \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cillegitimate.\u201dAsked by the television interviewer, Ilana Dayan, a veteran investigative journalist, if the Israeli public would be surprised by the police findings, Mr. Alsheich replied, \u201cThere will be some people who will say, \u2018Wait a moment, this is not what we thought.\u2019\u201dAs for the idea that he could end up being remembered as the police chief who brought down a sitting prime minister, Mr. Alsheich said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but that\u2019s my job.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Not so with an old home that still has its original charm. Plumbing ages, for example, and can crumble when you try to replace a fixture. Champions of older homes will tell you that the structures were built with high-quality materials meant to last, and that is certainly true. But when something does reach the end of its life \u2014 like a decades-old crystal doorknob that falls off in your hand \u2014 you\u2019ll spend days surfing eBay looking for a replacement, because nothing like it exists on Wayfair.\u201cWe\u2019re just a bunch of stupid city dwellers thinking, \u2018Oh, no big deal! I\u2019m going to buy a 150-year-old house and fix it,\u2019\u201d said Stella Gilgur-Cook, who started the Montclair Rehabers group in December after she discovered that repairing the grand staircase of her \u201cVictorian-ish\u201d four-bedroom in Montclair, N.J., was actually a big deal.Mrs. Gilgur-Cook, 41, a health care administrator, and her husband, Josh Cook, 41, who works in video and film production, moved with their two children from a rental in Forest Hills, Queens, last August. The couple did not set out to buy a fixer-upper, but ended up with a house that needed some work. (Don\u2019t they all?)As their first project, they wanted to remove carpeting from the staircase and sand off layers of old paint. But carpet has a way of hiding secrets, and removing theirs revealed serious damage to the top steps. \u201cYou could put your hand between where the step ended and the next riser started,\u201d Mrs. Gilgur-Cook said. \u201cWe freaked out.\u201dThat\u2019s when they decided to call a professional, and promptly learned rule number two of homeownership: Good luck finding one. (Especially one who knows how to restore, not just replace, parts in an old house.)Mrs. Gilgur-Cook interviewed \u201ca whole parade of people.\u201d Some said they could do the work, but then never came back. Others insisted the whole structure had to be ripped out and replaced. She hired one contractor, but the crew quit after sanding the first step. Finally, she found a company that specialized in old staircases and, for $8,000, fixed hers.Old houses woo you with character. Step into a center-hall colonial, and you swoon over crown molding and carved woodwork. But it is the antique kitchen or bathroom that is the real conversation piece. (You think my toilet is funky; I haven\u2019t even told you about my shimmery bathroom wallpaper, a rather bold update made by the previous owners. As I have no idea what lurks behind that sturdy paper, I have resisted removing it and bringing the bathroom back to its original state. Besides, the bling has kind of grown on me.)Mr. Roginski also works as a consultant to homeowners, chastising the ones who have succumbed to the lure of newness and replaced their rattling wood windows with silently sliding, but charmless, double-paned ones, and advising others on how to avoid such a fate.Wondering what to do about your shabby shutters? Read the Old House Guy\u2019s exhaustive treatise on the subject, prefaced with an ominous warning: \u201cWhat one thinks is a simple mistake will destroy a home\u2019s curb appeal. Don\u2019t let this happen to you!\u201dWhen you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either roll up your sleeves and get to work, or need a Xanax.Which brings us to rule number three: Do It Yourself is harder than it looks.Sure, Nicole Curtis can scale a ladder and bring an ornate gable roof back to its original glory in 30 minutes flat on the DIY Network show \u201cRehab Addict,\u201d but try that project with your better half on a Saturday afternoon and you may discover that you\u2019re lacking in this particular life skill. Or, as Mrs. Gilgur-Cook put it, \u201cYou suddenly realize all the adult things you don\u2019t know how to do.\u201dCall in the pros and chances are they will tell you to toss, not fix, your old stuff. \u201cThere\u2019s this phenomenon in the recent world where people don\u2019t try to fix it,\u201d said Gary Tjader, owner of ThisOldToilet, which is based in Los Altos, Calif.Of course, you could always learn how to be handy. Kelly Hobby-Bishop had never done home improvement until 2010, when she moved in with her soon-to-be husband, Sean Bishop, who owned a 1911 Craftsman-style house in Pasadena, Calif., with original built-in cabinetry and a very long to-do list of repairs. \u201cLet\u2019s say this, we were the ugliest house on the block,\u201d Ms. Hobby-Bishop, 36, a storyboard artist, said of the five-bedroom bungalow.But she and Mr. Bishop, 46, also a storyboard artist, set out to restore the house to its once-respectable state on a $100,000 budget. Rather than hire a general contractor, Ms. Hobby-Bishop oversaw the work and relied on a skilled handyman, Manuel Chavez, for many tasks. \u201cHe\u2019s my renovation guru,\u201d she said.Ms. Hobby-Bishop devotes hours to tasks like sourcing old-growth wood to match the existing wood, or arguing with window installers over how to replace a 100-year-old pane of broken glass so it has the same seasoned look as the other panes. \u201cYou have to fight for the character,\u201d she said.If your house is old enough \u2014 built, say, before the American Revolution \u2014 character is unavoidable. \u201cNothing is square, nothing is even, no window is the same size,\u201d said Lindsay DiGiacomo, 35, whose 1756 Mendham Township, N.J., four-bedroom home still has its original windows. Forget sash pulleys; hers are held open with wooden pegs.The house, which Mrs. DiGiacomo owns with her husband, Brian DiGiacomo, 43, a lawyer, has three fireplaces, one with a built-in bread oven and a caldron to boil water. \u201cIt\u2019s so \u2018Little House on the Prairie,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf you go into my attic, the beams that hold up the ceiling are a legitimate tree with bark still on it.\u201dThe couple\u2019s two young sons like to drop bits of \u201ctreasure\u201d into the cracks between the wide, unfinished plank floors. With a flashlight, the DiGiacomos can spot other artifacts beneath the floorboards, perhaps deposited by other children decades ago.Mrs. DiGiacomo has uncovered her own treasures, including a tackle box stored in the attic that held letters, some written in the late 18th century by two brothers named, oddly enough, Will and Bill; a 19th-century receipt for a horse carriage; an election ballot from 1880; and guidelines for how to operate a distillery, once part of the now three-acre property.Modern conveniences like recessed lighting or an open floor plan are not options in a house this old. \u201cEverything that you do, you have to think about \u2014 and really, really think about it,\u201d Mrs. DiGiacomo said. \u201cWill this work for this space? What\u2019s behind this wall?\u201dWhen the 60-year-old wood-shake roof needed to be replaced, Mrs. DiGiacomo had to hunt down a supplier in Canada who could make the shingles and then try to find someone who knew how to handle such a project. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a research-aholic,\u201d she said.Spend enough time trying to figure out what is behind a wall, and eventually you get good at it, even if you didn\u2019t think you ever would. Or at least, that is what I have been told.\u201cWe had no idea what we were getting into,\u201d said Ms. Wroblewski, 44. The roof, foundation and fireplace all needed repairs. \u201cWe thought the work would be a chore, but that it would be worth it in the long run.\u201dInstead, Ms. Wroblewski discovered that she actually liked the process. The turning point came, she said, when the couple removed salmon-covered asbestos shingles from the exterior, revealing gorgeous Victorian cedar shingles beneath. \u201cIt looked like a dollhouse,\u201d Ms. Wroblewski said. \u201cIt was a magnificent thing.\u201dAfter that, they were hooked. \u201cWhen you realize that with the right people you can bring a house back to life and back to its stately place in the town, it feels like a good use of my energy,\u201d she said. It also helps that she found a good contractor.In 2016, the couple moved with their two children to a six-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot house built in 1894 on Upper Mountain Avenue, a grand road of stately homes in Montclair. The house, Ms. Wroblewski said, \u201cis untouched by the passage of time.\u201dTime did, however, leave its mark on the boiler and air-conditioning system \u2014 neither worked when the family moved into the $1.289 million home. A structural beam also needed immediate attention. But where an unseasoned homeowner might be visited by a panic attack, Ms. Wroblewski sees a project. \u201cI never thought I was this person,\u201d she said.As for me, I\u2019m still not convinced I\u2019m that person.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Casting Controversy Derailed a High School Play. Then Came the Threats.", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt started as a local debate over a New York high school production of the musical \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame.\u201d A white teenager was cast in the lead role of Esmeralda, a 15th-century Roma woman, spurring young student activists to object.Last month, after much discussion in the community, Ithaca High School pulled the show, aiming to replace it with something else. But the story doesn\u2019t end there.Those same students are now besieged by an online mob targeting them with threats and racial epithets after the incident was reported in right-wing publications like Breitbart News, then spread to the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer.Via Facebook, the students received pictures of themselves with swastikas plastered on their faces. One parent had what was thought to be her home address (it wasn\u2019t) posted online with a comment seeming to encourage harassment: \u201cDo your thing social media.\u201d Another parent received a profane email, assailing her for embracing \u201canti-white racism,\u201d adding: \u201cI feel sorry for your brainwashed child.\u201dMaddi Carroll, a 17-year-old African-American senior, said the high school\u2019s staging of \u201cHunchback\u201d was initially exciting to her \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t feel like our high school usually put on productions with women of color in starring roles.\u201d\u201cWe were talking about us being younger and thinking about Disney princesses we had to look up to. For us, we really had Jasmine and Esmeralda,\u201d she added, referring also to the \u201cAladdin\u201d character.In the fall, after a white student was cast as Esmeralda for the show, a group of five classmates, including Ms. Carroll, formed Students United Ithaca. They began writing letters and organizing a campaign against the musical.After the outcry, the school board held a community meeting on Jan. 23, when a number of students showed up wearing black in solidarity with the young activists, including Prachi Ruina, who had auditioned for the musical, and was cast in the ensemble.\u201cI call upon you to stop this musical now,\u201d she said to the board. \u201cYou tear a community apart if you don\u2019t.\u201dThe next day, the school board announced that \u201cHunchback\u201d would be pulled and a new production would be proposed.Mike Ellis, the father of the young actress who was originally cast as Esmeralda, said in an interview about the students\u2019 protest: \u201cEven though it involved a sacrifice on my daughter\u2019s part, I think the questions that they\u2019re asking are good, important questions that any school should want to ask itself.\u201dThe Daily Stormer published a post about the high school\u2019s decision. Mainstream national outlets, including Fox News and The Washington Times, amplified the conversation.The comments online became ugly. On a 4chan, an anonymous message board, one post said that the students \u201cneed to be \u2018dealt\u2019 with.\u201d The Students United Ithaca Facebook page was particularly vitriolic, with some members receiving private messages saying, \u201cYou are the real Nazis of this country,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re a pathetic racist scum group.\u201dMs. Ruina was told to go back to India. On Facebook, one African-American student\u2019s personal page was tagged in a public comment that used a racial epithet, saying he \u201cis the reason we are looking for trees.\u201d The student interpreted this as a threat of lynching.The Ithaca High School principal didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, nor did the school district\u2019s superintendent. Dr. Sean Eversley Bradwell, vice president of the Ithaca Board of Education, wrote in an email that the board was \u201cvery concerned about the level of vitriol directed at our students.\u201d He also said the district had received more than 100 angry voice mail messages and 50 emails.The trolling has been taxing for the students. \u201cThis is very, very surreal,\u201d Ms. Carroll said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to handle as a 17-year-old who is in high school right now, applying to college, trying to get ready for that stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations.Citi\u2019s underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years.The message from Citi\u2019s board seems to be that, since the bank\u2019s performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbat\u2019s pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street.But on other yardsticks, the awards can seem highCiti may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bank\u2019s return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of America\u2019s was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan.And the makeup of the compensation mattersC.E.O.s\u2019 compensation is made up of different types of pay:\u2022 Cash salaries and cash bonuses\u2022 Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future.The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is.Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 The decision starts a maximum 75-day clock for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to decide whether to approve or oppose the deal, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Chinese investors have faced heightened scrutiny from Cfius. Since president Trump took office, a half a dozen Chinese deals have fallen apart because of concerns raised by CFIUS, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Raising the breakup fee for antitrust reasons beyond $8 billion. That amount, which represents an already high 6.6 percent of the total deal price, still isn\u2019t high enough for Qualcomm. \u201cA breakup fee in the range proposed by Broadcom does not come close to compensating for those risks,\u201d Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm\u2019s chairman, writes in a letter to Broadcom\u2019s chief, Hock Tan.\u2022 Make unspecified other commitments meant to assuage antitrust regulators.\u2022 Clarify what Broadcom\u2019s intentions are for Qualcomm\u2019s big licensing business.More from Mr. Jacobs\u2019s letter:Our board is open to further discussions with Broadcom to see if a proposal that appropriately reflects the true value of Qualcomm shares, and ensures an appropriate level of deal certainty, can be obtained.If the two sides can\u2019t reach an agreement, then matters may come down to a vote on Qualcomm\u2019s board on March 6. Remember that Broadcom is seeking six of 11 board seats, down from its initial target of unseating all directors.\u2014 Michael de la MercedBritain\u2019s government is often criticized for not clearly communicating the type of deal it wants to strike with the European Union as it prepares to leave the bloc.The dilemma Britain faces.Post-Brexit, Britain\u2019s banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them to operate in any E.U. country with few restrictions. Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.Hence the new plan.The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems. It would allow both sides leeway to strike their own rules once they\u2019ve agreed on their main objectives. And it suggests that a monitoring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set up.Will the E.U. agree to the plan?The bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation. Certain politicians in the E.U. may argue Britain is trying to retain the privileges of the single market while discarding the duties that come with it. Still, some of Europe\u2019s leaders, banks and businesses may support the plan, in the belief that it will minimize disruption and allow the City of London to continue to play a big role in financing the strong economic expansion taking place in Europe.\u2014Peter EavisPeter Thiel.Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Thiel Macro, which invests Mr. Thiel\u2019s fortune, held put options on 1.9 million shares of ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures as of Dec. 31. The investment is designed to pay off if the VIX rises.It\u2019s unclear whether the fund had maintained those positions through last week. But if it had, he would have reaped a big windfall.Investors piled into bets that volatility would continue to decline last year. And those wagers paid off as the VIX spent 2017 trading at historically low levels. But volatility has picked up this year. After trading below 10 to start the year, the VIX spiked to above 37 during the selloff last week. It finished Friday at 19.The law firm Royds Withy King says it has seen a flurry of cases recently involving disputes over cryptocurrency holdings, one of which was recently valued at $1.4 million.The firm said it is currently working on three separate high-value divorce cases where spouses are seeking the disclosure and a potential share of cryptocurrency assets.Off the top of our heads, we\u2019d think that issues would include a) the reporting, or lack thereof, of holdings and b) the value of any digital money portfolios.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Julie Edde, Bei Hu and Suzanne Woolley of Bloomberg:\u201cThere\u2019s sort of, \u2018Everybody should buy a dip,\u2019 which has become folklore in the markets now.

{"Headline": "In Waymo-Uber Trial, Kalanick Recalls \u2018Jam Sesh\u2019 With Rival Engineer", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Basketball players have pickup games. Rappers have freestyle cyphers. Tech entrepreneurs, according to the former chief executive of Uber, riff on big ideas in something they call a \u201cjam sesh.\u201dWaymo, the self-driving-car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, called Mr. Kalanick to the stand during the first full day of testimony in the federal trial. It hoped to reveal how Uber\u2019s win-at-all-costs attitude had pushed the company to acquire Otto, an autonomous-vehicle start-up created by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski.Waymo contends \u2014 and Uber denies \u2014 that the deal was part of Uber\u2019s plan to steal intellectual property from Google\u2019s self-driving-car project, which would later be renamed Waymo, in order to close the gap in an area of technology essential to its business.As he waded through questions from Waymo\u2019s lawyers, Mr. Kalanick, who resigned in June as Uber\u2019s chief executive, offered unusual insight into how deals get done in Silicon Valley and the freewheeling \u2014 some might say self-parodying \u2014 business culture at the biggest technology start-ups.A jam sesh, as Mr. Kalanick explained it, is a business meeting akin to a session in which a jazz ensemble spontaneously works out music. Creative people come in with their own ideas and create \u201cbeautiful music.\u201d Or business plans. The group discussed laser sensor technology that was critical to the operation of self-driving cars. A handwritten note on a whiteboard read, \u201cLaser is the sauce.\u201dBut there was a hangup: Mr. Levandowski wanted to venture out on his own.\u201cI wanted to hire Anthony and he wanted to start a company, so I tried to come up with a situation where he could feel like he started a company and I could feel like I hired him,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said, choosing his words carefully between long sips of water. He polished off four bottles of water in less than an hour on the witness stand.Uber acquired Otto for a reported $590 million in 2016, just six months after it was started. It is unclear how much Mr. Levandowski, already a wealthy man thanks to a $120 million bonus from his time at Google, personally made in the deal. An Uber spokesman, Matt Kallman, said the company had fired Mr. Levandowski in May before Otto could meet any of its performance targets. As a result, he lost out on an estimated $250 million worth of equity in Uber.Waymo contends that the clever solution \u2014 let Mr. Levandowski create his own company and then buy it \u2014 was simply obfuscation for a plot to steal important technology from Waymo.While the deal was unusual, it\u2019s not rare for an executive to want to ensure his independence inside a larger company. Technology giants often have to sell founders of start-ups on the idea that they will maintain some independence, as well as a big payday, in an acquisition. Facebook, for example, acquired Instagram and kept the photo-sharing app a separate unit within the company.Otto is still an independent unit within Uber and is technically a separate defendant in this case.Waymo is trying to portray Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Levandowski as a pair of aggressive, money-hungry conspirators who worked together to steal Google\u2019s intellectual property.Before Mr. Kalanick testified, Uber\u2019s lawyers objected to Waymo\u2019s presenting a text message that Mr. Levandowski sent to Mr. Kalanick with a clip from the movie \u201cWall Street\u201d in which Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, passionately argues that \u201cgreed, for the lack of a better word, is good.\u201d No ruling was made.On Wednesday, Mr. Kalanick is expected to be asked how much he revealed to Uber\u2019s board about Mr. Levandowski and what the engineer had taken with him from Google.In deposition testimony before the trial, Bill Gurley, an investor and a former board member at Uber, said the company\u2019s board had not been shown a due diligence report before the acquisition of Otto.Mr. Gurley, who stepped down from Uber\u2019s board in June, said he wouldn\u2019t have voted in favor of the acquisition had he known the report indicated that Mr. Levandowski possessed files from Google.Nathan Ballard, a spokesman for Mr. Levandowski, said after the session in the federal courthouse in San Francisco that \u201calthough a great many things have been said about Anthony over the last two days, we are confident that he will eventually be vindicated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Glickman, a history professor and boycotts expert at Cornell University.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a concerted thing \u2014 it just took off and took on a life of its own,\u201d Professor Glickman said. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning \u2014 nothing like this has ever happened before with the N.R.A. as far as I know.\u201dThe #BoycottNRA hashtag, the unofficial unifier of the movement, was trending on Twitter on Friday and appeared more than 10,000 times in a single four-hour period on Monday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet.The hashtag has floated around social media since before the Sandy Hook massacre in late 2012, usually bubbling up after high-profile mass shootings only to quickly fade after failing to inspire much action.After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14, two dozen tweets mentioned the hashtag, followed by three dozen more the next day.\u201cThen the floodgates were open,\u201d said Judd Legum, who founded ThinkProgress. \u201cLots of people began moving very, very fast.\u201dThe pressure on companies to cut ties with the N.R.A. soon began sprouting up from various sources.The pair hoped for 5,000 signatures. By Tuesday afternoon, they had more than 200,000.\u201cWe know we\u2019re not going to change this epidemic of gun violence overnight, but this is one of those things people can do right now while we wait for the slow wheels of government to take action,\u201d Mr. Chase said.When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.So far, Amazon has not issued any comment related to the N.R.A.Some companies have resisted calls to sever business relationships with the N.R.A. On Monday, FedEx said that while it disagreed with the N.R.A.\u2019s policies on semiautomatic firearms, it would continue to offer discounts to the group\u2019s members.Many N.R.A. supporters have also vowed not to patronize the brands that ended relationships with the gun group.Still, the boycott effort \u2014 parts of it organic, parts of it carefully orchestrated \u2014 was an impressive show of force against the gun lobby.The organization has more than 100,000 active volunteers it can quickly mobilize to create graphics, send email blasts and fan out over social media.But after Parkland, Moms Demand Action adopted hashtags that others had created and cheered on campaigns that others had organized.\u201cThe more the merrier \u2014 it\u2019s been a cumulative effort of different groups within the same space, all putting pressure on the N.R.A.,\u201d Ms. Watts said. \u201cWhat this has shown is that it doesn\u2019t have to be any one specific group or person \u2014 it\u2019s more about the overall noise than any single hashtag.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Through Forests and Farmlands, Peruvian Sheep Herders of the Pacific Northwest", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThings didn\u2019t just get hairy, they got downright woolly.The encounter left her with not just a scar, but also a deep curiosity about sheep herding (which is why all those sheep were there in the first place). She already knew about the local sheep festival, which was started in Idaho by Basque immigrants who had come over a century ago to tend to the livestock. Now, at 26, she has turned that curiosity into a series that looks at the lives of Peruvian sheep herders who work in Washington State, where Ms. Jaramillo is a full-time freelance photographer.Theirs is an isolated, nomadic existence. They are brought here through a special visa program, which has them working for two and a half year stretches, leading the sheep to graze through forests and plains, on unmarked paths that they know as if they were just going for a stroll around the block. Every two days, they move on to a different area, with a trailer housing the bed and belongings hauled by a beat up truck. Finally, working more or less around the clock \u2014 sheep do not keep 9-5 hours \u2014 they return home for three months before starting the cycle all over again.Ms. Jaramillo said the eight Peruvian herders in Washington State all hailed from the same town, and brought with them a special set of skills that are hard to find locally, at least for $1,250 a month, which is what ranchers pay them. She said a rancher told her that he had hired only a handful of American laborers, but they washed out after a week. \u201cIt\u2019s such hard labor and you have to have an extensive knowledge base,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly chasing sheep, you have to vaccinate them, you\u2019re moving 2,000 sheep up mountainside with very little supplies. In the spring, they\u2019re all brought to the farm and 70 babies are born each day. You have to know exactly what to do.\u201dMs. Jaramillo discovered that finding the right subject was just as difficult. By day she would most likely have to be in the middle of the woods with a shotgun-toting herder and no cellphone service. At night she would have to sleep in a tent pitched next to the herder\u2019s trailer.The herders and their sheep move through hundreds of miles, through forests and farmland, in the summer, she said. Supplies arrive every two weeks, brought by the rancher who hired them. They protect the animals from bears, cougars and wolves, paying attention to strays and weak or ill animals that could be easy pickings for predators.It\u2019s not easy to stay in touch with the world outside, but the herders have found ways. They can pick up a Spanish-language station in Yakima and, when they have a cellphone signal, can dial into a Peruvian station that plays traditional music. Nor has it been easy for Ms. Jaramillo to find them.This work is difficult for other reasons, too, she said, since foreign markets offer wool at lower prices. Also, although the ranch employing the Peruvian herders has a federal license to graze on public lands, there is still opposition from people concerned about the threat posed to natural species by the grazing herds. More recently, the Peruvian workers have been worried about proposals for the U.S. government to take a cut of remittances they send home in order to build the border wall. She said Mr. DeLaCruz had no plans to stop being a herder, despite the loneliness and family separation. She knows this is not an easy decision for him, but she understands why.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Resources for Talking and Teaching About the School Shooting in Florida", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlease let us know what we may be missing, or post your own thoughts, ideas or experiences.__________By now your students know about the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. How are you addressing it in your classroom? Please let us know in the comments.We asked that question on social media on the morning of Feb. 15, and immediately got advice from several teachers.This morning, I\u2019ll be asking them what they have heard, creating opportunity to verbalize as well as acknowledge their feelings. We\u2019ll spend some time either writing or drawing as a way to release the energy. We\u2019ll review lockdown procedures for our school. We will do this daily.I am absolutely heartbroken by the horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida. This morning, it is more critical than ever than we make students feel welcomed at school. Many of your students may come to school with strong emotions and questions and we must provide a safe space for them to cope with this traumatic event.\u2022 Trying to keep routines as normal as possible. Kids gain security from the predictability of routine, including attending school.\u2022 Limiting exposure to television and the news.\u2022 Being honest with kids and share with them as much information as they are developmentally able to handle.\u2022 Listening to kids\u2019 fears and concerns.\u2022 Reassuring kids that the world is a good place to be, but that there are people who do bad things.\u2022 Rebuilding and reaffirming attachments and relationships.Reminding students to report warning signs of mental health issues and possible threats to an adultExplaining why my classroom door will remain locked every day from now on because it is the only tool we have to protect our students inside the classroom.We have to make our schools places where students feel a human connection. Places where they would never, ever think to bring a gun to campus.If there is ever even a whisper that someone has the plan to bring a gun, our teachers and students should be able to communicate freely with law enforcement so that those plans are stopped. There need to be policies that would have allowed physical intervention as soon as yesterday\u2019s shooter posted one of the many disturbing things he did on his social media.We need to protect each other.We will continue to update this post._________Understand What Happened and React to It_________Recognize and Honor the Victims and HeroesAmid this tragedy, there are also stories of great courage and benevolence. Encourage your students to look for \u201cthe helpers\u201d \u2014 those that risked their own lives and safety to help others. What heroic acts have they read about?_________Since 26 people were killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, a nonprofit that tracks school shootings has recorded five a month, on average.Invite students to study the graphic above. What does it say about school shootings in the United States? What does that make them think and feel? Why?More than 40 \u201cactive shooter\u201d episodes in schools have been recorded in the United States since 2000, according to F.B.I. and news reports. Two 15-year-old students were killed and 18 more people were injured last month in a school in rural Benton, Ky. The shootings have become common enough that many schools, including Stoneman Douglas High, run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors.Has your school been affected by gun violence? What measures do you have in place to prevent future violence, or to respond to threats? Ask students to investigate if they can\u2019t answer that question, then discuss: Do you think your school and community are doing enough to prevent future shootings? If not, what else do you think they should do? What do you think individual students can do, if anything?_________Thousands of readers have commented on the article about the Parkland shooting. One by Tom from Vermont sums up what he\u2019s read:The comments here seem so stark and brief. Understandably so, what is left to say? It is becoming so easy to see a headline like the one on this story and shrug. This is the new America. But is it? Something inside me still makes me think we have the resolve to turn this terrible tide.Nathanie Doralus from Florida wrote:As a student, I agree that we\u2019ve become numb to the news of school shootings in the United States. My high school has already had two lockdowns this school year because of students bringing guns onto the campus. It happens so often that I think many feel powerless to stop them so the default is to either ignore them or solemnly shake your head in silence. In some ways, I think it\u2019s an attempt to not live in constant fear while attending school and receiving an education because no one should have to. But in other ways, I think some won\u2019t take it seriously until it hits close to home. If we were taking school shootings more seriously than before, then there wouldn\u2019t have been eleven incidents already in the first month of this year. Very few people take active assailant drills at my school seriously. I think that is just an example of denial and how it\u2019s hard to take something seriously unless it actually happens to you or someone you know. Schools can do more than just increasing their security measures and frequently enacting drills. They can also invest in the mental health and well-being of their students and provide the support some of them need in order to prevent these acts of violence.And Jocelyn Savard from North Carolina shared this perspective:In Boston, there are a series of billboards promoting gun violence awareness. One reads \u201cAmericans killed since the massacre at Sandy Hook\u201d and has a live count of citizen owned gun deaths displayed. I remember walking around a few years ago and being startled at the number. When Sandy Hook happened and my mom told me, I cried for days. Just a few days ago when the notifications showed up on my phone about Kentucky, I barely blinked an eye. Of course, my heart plummeted and I could feel humanity\u2019s downfall one step closer but there was no tears, at church this weekend there was no announcement, no prayer. As a country, we have normalized school shootings so much, made books and movies out of them, make offhand comments about how that guy \u2018looks like a school shooter\u2019, that we are rapidly becoming detached to the horror that we call our home.Do your students agree with these teenagers that \u201cwe are rapidly becoming detached to the horror\u201d of school shootings? Why or why not?How has this latest attack affected them? What do they think we might do to keep from becoming \u201cdetached\u201d?_________The Role of Students: Cellphones and Social Media Technology has allowed the public to witness mass shootings in new and terrifying ways. The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used their cellphones and social media accounts in real time to share their experiences and spread messages of pain, anger and gratitude, as well as calls to action.One student hit her record button while being led out of the school to safety by sheriff\u2019s deputies. On her way, her cellphone\u2019s shaking camera lens passed over several bodies sprawled on the floor.In another cellphone video, several dozen gunshots were audible not far away. \u201cOh my God! Oh my God!\u201d one student shouted.Hiding in a sweltering storage room with about 40 other students, she typed out a text message to her mother, Stacy, for what she thought might be the last time.\u201cIf I don\u2019t make it,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI love you and I appreciate everything you did for me.\u201dAsk your students:Whare are your reactions to these firsthand accounts of the violence that took place in Parkland, Fla.?How have these videos impacted the public conversation around guns and school safety? Why do you think they have had such a dramatic effect? Do you think the fact that your generation is so fluent in social media gives you a voice previous generations did not have? What might be the benefits and drawbacks of that if so?__________The Role of Students: \u201dThey Survived the School Shooting. Now They\u2019re Calling for Action\u201dOn Feb. 15, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School implored lawmakers to act to prevent future violence, calling the frequency of school shootings in the United States \u201cunacceptable.\u201dMr. Hogg, whose younger sister lost two friends in the shooting, called on politicians to act.\u201cWe\u2019re children,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys are the adults.\u201dAs David Leonhardt writes:This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it.Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 students this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices \u2014 in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman \u2014 are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting.While many politicians after the shooting were focused on mental health and safety, some vocal students at Stoneman Douglas High showed no reluctance in drawing attention to gun control.What do your students think about these activist teenagers and their messages? What messages or ideas resonate with them the most?Can their generation effect real change on gun violence? How? What examples are they reading or hearing about \u2014 or witnessing themselves \u2014 that seem to be having an impact? What are their own personal opinions about what should be done, how and why? What can each of us do as individuals, and what can people their age do together?We can\u2019t let innocent people\u2019s deaths be in vain. We need to work together beyond political parties to make sure this never happens again. We need tougher gun laws.If a person is not old enough to be able to rent a car or buy a beer, then he should not be able to legally purchase a weapon of mass destruction. This could have been prevented. If the killer had been properly treated for his mental illness, maybe this would not have happened. If there were proper background checks, then those who should not have guns would not have them.We need to vote for those who are for stricter laws and kick out those who won\u2019t take action. We need to expose the truth about gun violence and the corruption around guns. Please._________The AR-15 and Gun ControlThe New York Times reports that the gunman who killed 17 people and injured others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used an AR-15 assault rifle. This style of rifle was also used in the attacks in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex., among others.Students might watch the video above, then discuss: What are some of the reasons that the AR-15, and other weapons like it, have become so common in mass shootings? How does it compare with other types of guns?The companies that manufactured and sold the military-style assault rifle used by the gunman should be held responsible for the 2012 attack.A lawsuit filed by the relatives said that the AR-15-style Bushmaster used to carry out the shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 26 people, including 20 first graders, was specifically marketed as a weapon of war, with slogans and product placement in video games invoking the violence of combat. The lawsuit claims that such promotions were a deliberate effort to make the weapon attractive to young men, like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman.Ask students: Do you think AR-15-style rifles should be more strictly regulated in the United States? Why or why not?Do you think any other measures should be taken to restrict access to guns? If so, what? If not, what else can be done to prevent more mass shootings like this one?_________Only in the United States?Inevitably, predictably, fatefully, another mass shooting breaks our hearts. This time, it was a school shooting in Florida on Wednesday that left at least 17 dead at the hands of 19-year-old gunman and his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.But what is perhaps most heartbreaking of all is that they shouldn\u2019t be shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the United States do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence.He writes that we should \u201clearn lessons from these tragedies, so that there can be fewer of them. In particular, I suggest that we try a new approach to reducing gun violence \u2014 a public health strategy.\u201dInvite your students to take a look at the graphics from a visual essay he did in November after the church shooting in Texas. What do they see? What questions do the charts raise? To what extent do they agree with Mr. Kristof\u2019s conclusions?___________What do authorities know so far about the shooter? What is not yet known?The man suspected of opening fire inside a Florida high school on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, is a former student who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons, the authorities said.\u2026 In the hours after the shooting, people who knew Mr. Cruz described him as a \u201ctroubled kid\u201d who enjoyed showing off his firearms, bragging about killing animals and whose mother would resort to calling the police to have them come to their home to try to talk some sense into him. At a school with about 3,000 students, Mr. Cruz stayed to himself and had few friends but struck fear in some students with erratic behavior and an affinity for violence.\u2026 In the interview with the Miami news station, the student said Mr. Cruz was a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School when he was expelled last year. He said that students would joke that if anyone were to open fire inside the school, it would be Mr. Cruz. Because of that, students feared him and mostly stayed away from him, the student said.\u201cA lot of people were saying that it would be him,\u201d the student told WFOR-TV. \u201cThey would say he would be the one to shoot up the school. Everyone predicted it.\u201dDo you think this attack could have been prevented? If so, how? If not, why not?What might school administrators, teachers and students be able to learn from this attack to prevent others like it from happening? How could they respond to students who may be showing signs of trouble in school, on social media or at home?What \u2014 if anything \u2014 should students do if they encounter others who display erratic behavior or inclinations toward violence?_________Related Learning Network ResourcesResources: Talking and Teaching About the Shooting in Newtown, Conn.Campus Catastrophe: Resources for Teaching About the Shootings at Virginia TechFilm Club | \u2018Haunted by Columbine\u2019Watershed: Teaching About Gun Control After NewtownAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Artificial Intelligence Is Edging Its Way Into Our Lives", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArtificial intelligence is here \u2014 and it\u2019s bringing new possibilities, while also raising questions. Do these gadgets and services really behave as advertised? How will they evolve in the years ahead? How quickly will they overhaul the way we live and change the way we do business?A month after the Chinese electronics giant Huawei suffered a big setback in its quest to sell its high-end smartphones to Americans, the company\u2019s chief for consumer devices, Richard Yu, said he was still optimistic about Huawei\u2019s prospects in the United States.\u201cWe have won global consumers\u2019 trust, in over 170 countries,\u201d Mr. Yu said at the New Work Summit. \u201cWe very strictly protect consumers\u2019 privacy.\u201dAt the conference on Tuesday, Mr. Yu said that Huawei had no ties to the Chinese government. \u201cWe are a globalized company, just headquartered in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not part of any government. We have to be a company that is independent from every country.\u201dMike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, offered a glimpse of how the social network is applying artificial intelligence to ward off bad actors and keep its platform free of toxicity.Calling the fight against rules violators a \u201ccat and mouse game,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that Facebook\u2019s A.I. efforts had succeeded at certain types of content moderation, such as image classifier algorithms that find and automatically remove nude photos and videos.Now on Facebook, he said, \u201cthe vast majority of nudity and pornography reporting is automatic.\u201dBut the company has since added thousands of human content moderators and struck partnerships with human fact-checking organizations. Mr. Schroepfer implied Facebook has learned that A.I. alone would not do the trick, given the sophistication of bad actors who find ways around the platform\u2019s filters.Mr. Schroepfer also said that human judgment would be required in certain situations, like a comment (\u201cnice jacket\u201d) that could be either an earnest compliment or a sarcastic insult, depending on the context. And when it comes to some of Facebook\u2019s thornier problems, like trying to enforce consistent hate speech policies, human intervention may always be necessary.Michael Kratsios, a deputy chief technology officer at the White House, said at the New Work Summit on Tuesday that regulators should get out of the way of advances in emerging technologies.He cited progress toward a repeal of some regulations on commercial drones, such as rules prohibiting them from flying at night.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s key to get ahead of those regulatory hurdles,\u201d said Mr. Kratsios, who previously worked as chief of staff to Peter Thiel, the libertarian venture capitalist. These regulations, he said, are \u201cputting us at a disadvantage.\u201dUnlike some experts who believe China is poised to dominate the A.I. age, Mr. Kratsios said he wasn\u2019t worried about overseas competition. The United States, he said, has a \u201c30-year head start\u201d in A.I. development.Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, blasted companies like Facebook on Tuesday for addicting children to their products and renewed his calls for more government regulation of the tech industry.Mr. Benioff compared a new Facebook Messenger product for children to candy cigarettes, which he used to pretend to smoke as a boy.\u201cWhat do you think they were trying to get us to do with those?\u201d Mr. Benioff asked onstage at the New Work Summit. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is any different now. They\u2019re focused on the addictive nature of these user interfaces. At some point, we have to say, \u2018Hold on.\u2019\u201dSilicon Valley is nearing the point where moral lines will have to be drawn by the government since the industry is not regulating itself and does not seem to be guided by a \u201cstrong hand of ethics,\u201d he said.There is a \u201ccrisis of trust,\u201d he added, that will become a \u201ctidal wave\u201d among American consumers who are growing wary of tech giants.\u201cI\u2019m trying to protect our industry,\u201d said Mr. Benioff, whose company sells access to business software over the internet. \u201cIf companies aren\u2019t able to regulate themselves, they should have external regulations.\u201dOne of the solutions he suggested was to move decision-making away from algorithms and back toward humans. He cited Facebook\u2019s decision to disband its trending news curation team as an example.\u201cFacebook had a team promoting, sorting and focusing stories, 100 curators that they removed and put an algorithm in their place, and that started the downward spiral that they\u2019re in today,\u201d Mr. Benioff said.He also spoke about the recent ban on kegs of beer at Salesforce offices after he recently stumbled across one while visiting a company he had acquired.Fei-Fei Li, a chief scientist at Google and a Stanford professor, has called on technologists to take a more \u201chuman centered\u201d approach to the creation of artificial intelligence. On Tuesday at the New Work Summit, Ms. Li said that researchers must work to ensure that A.I. embodied human qualities and that it would ultimately operate alongside humans, not replace them.\u201cI often tell my students not to be misled by the name \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 \u2014 there is nothing artificial about it,\u201d she said. \u201cA.I. is made by humans, intended to behave by humans and, ultimately, to impact humans lives and human society.\u201dAt Stanford, Ms. Li was instrumental in the recent rise of \u201ccomputer vision\u201d systems that can recognize people and objects entirely on their own. At Google, she is working to package and sell these and other systems as cloud computing services, delivering the latest A.I. technology to a wide range of businesses.But she said that as Google and other internet giants pushed these techniques forward, academia and the government must help ensure that A.I. evolved into something that enhanced our humanity, created as many jobs as it replaced and operated in safe and predictable ways.In particular, Ms. Li said, academic institutions can help ensure that computer scientists work alongside social scientists in building this new breed of technology.\u201cA.I. has outgrown its origin in computer science,\u201d she said.Ultimately, said Ms. Li, who was born in China, A.I. reflects the people who build it more than other technologies do. For that reason and others, she said, A.I. researchers must work in a way that spans not only many industries but many cultures as well.Tuesday\u2019s first speaker at the New Work Summit was Kai-Fu Lee, who used to lead Google in China and knows a thing or two about American tech giants in China. His prognosis about whether companies like Facebook will ever be able to crack the world\u2019s largest internet market?\u201cThe American products are simply uncompetitive in the China market,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who is now chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on Chinese technology. Even if internet titans from the United States could operate in China, he said, the local competition means they would have a hard time thriving.\u201cMessenger is a much worse product than WeChat,\u201d he said, referring to Facebook\u2019s messaging app and Tencent\u2019s ubiquitous app for chatting, social networking, making payments and other tasks.\u201cAmazon in China is substantially worse than Taobao, JD and Tmall,\u201d he said, referring to three leading Chinese e-commerce sites. And, he said, \u201cApple Pay is much narrower and much harder to use than WeChat or Alipay.\u201dMr. Lee sees other issues that augur against a big Facebook or Google renaissance in China. Multinational companies tend not to hire local managers to lead their China operations. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned about winning in the local market,\u201d he said.Last year, the Chinese government unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030, vowing to create a domestic industry worth $150 billion. This manifesto read like a challenge to the United States, and in many ways it echoed policies laid down by the Obama administration in 2016.John Krafcik, chief executive of the self-driving car company Waymo, took the stage at the New Work Summit on Monday night and spoke out for the first time since his company reached a settlement last week with Uber in a lawsuit over trade secrets that riveted Silicon Valley.\u201cWe were really happy with the outcome that we engineered,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in that case talking about the hardware, but the extra benefit we got from that suit was the ability to understand and ensure that Uber wasn\u2019t using any of our software.\u201dHe called the software Waymo\u2019s \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\u201cThis was a really special case with a really special set of circumstances,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cFor us, this was always about, and really just about, the fact that we needed to ensure Uber wasn\u2019t using our trade secrets.\u201d He added that he did not foresee Waymo suing other former employees.Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s chief executive of its consumer business, which includes its e-commerce operations, doesn\u2019t often make public appearances. But on Monday night, he joined the New Work Summit to discuss the internet retailer\u2019s move into artificial intelligence.His key message: A.I. is everywhere, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will take our jobs.\u201cIf you look at the evolution of technology over the course of decades, tech doesn\u2019t eliminate work; it changes work,\u201d Mr. Wilke said.Amazon has also embedded A.I. throughout the company, he added, with technologists working together with people who run businesses. The company is using machine learning and deep learnings, which are different flavors of A.I., to upgrade internal algorithms, he said.As A.I. technology barrels ahead in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s also starting to pick up steam as a political issue in Washington.So he\u2019s proposing a universal basic income plan called the \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d which would give every American adult $1,000 a month to guarantee them a minimum standard of living while they retrain themselves for new kinds of work.If there are many more white men than black women in the system, for example, it will be worse at identifying the black women. That appears to be the case with some popular commercial facial recognition software.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Comcast is fighting Fox over the British broadcaster Sky.\u2022 How will Powell discuss loose fiscal policy?\u2022 Delta shows pushing back against the N.R.A. has political costs.\u2022 Will the U.S. challenge Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm on national security grounds?Sky investors seem to be betting on the latter option. Its stock jumped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast\u2019s offer.ReactionWhen is an offer an offer can be a fine point under Britain\u2019s complicated takeover rules.That may seem like an odd distinction when Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, announced publicly how much it is willing to pay for an asset to kick off negotiations.The public disclosure of merger talks is triggered under the code when a number of factors occur, such as rumors in the market that a deal is in the works or \u201cuntoward movement\u201d in a takeover target\u2019s stock price.Making a public announcement then starts a countdown clock for a potential acquirer to announce a formal offer under the rules, known as a so-called firm intention to make an offer.The rules are intended to make sure all shareholders are treated fairly and have access to the same information about a deal and to establish an orderly framework for takeovers.- Chad BrayBehind the maneuversComcast had worked on its own offer for Fox, with the chance to expand internationally through Sky being a big reason for bidding. But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval.However, Fox\u2019s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast\u2019s opportunity.Whom to thank for the Comcast bidCritics\u2019 cornerMarket reactionComcast investors don\u2019t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky\u2019s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast\u2019s offer.When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval.Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit.A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump.\u201cIn gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.\u201d(F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.)Update from the hearingIn this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond.He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: \u201cFiscal policy changes can have an effect.\u201d He also said: \u201cWe really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. \u201cWe don\u2019t do fiscal policy at the Fed,\u201d he said.\u2014 Peter EavisThe details\u2022 \u201cRing has raised $209 million so far and was last valued at $760 million, according to Pitchbook.\u201d\u2022 Amazon\u2019s Alexa Fund, which invests in startups that make Alexa compatible devices, was an investor.\u2022 Amazon plans to have Ring operate as a separate business, much as Zappos and Twitch do.Ms. Bartiromo, then, followed up with:Mr. Schultz is one of a number of business executives and celebrities long speculated to be considering a run for president in 2020. The list has included Oprah Winfrey, Mark Cuban, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Bob Iger of Disney and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.On other topicsThe tweet from Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, Delta\u2019s home state, shows that it isn\u2019t easy for companies to find a balance between those who want corporate America to push for more gun control and those who think conservatives are being unfairly maligned.The policy flyaroundIf Cfius intervenes, it would sidestep Broadcom\u2019s move to relocate its headquarters to the U.S., which critics said was aimed in part at preventing such a review. (Broadcom\u2019s C.E.O., Hock Tan, said the redomiciling would happen even if the deal didn\u2019t go through.)More from Diane Bartz of Reuters:Part of the CFIUS\u2019 current concern, which is echoed in Cornyn\u2019s letter, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.That\u2019s what Larry Hutcher, a corporate lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said of the last-minute turmoil that sank an investor group\u2019s bid for The Weinstein Company and led the embattled studio to plan a corporate bankruptcy filing.Beijing\u2019s takeover of the troubled Anbang Insurance Group is another sign that deal making by that country\u2019s moguls is slowing to a halt. It\u2019s not just the Chinese government\u2019s fears of overspending by homegrown businesses, but also growing skepticism from officials in the United States and elsewhere.\u201cRegulators will naturally be somewhat concerned by the reality that often there is an asymmetry of information about the Chinese firms operating internationally,\u201d said Jeremy Stevens, an economist for Standard Bank Group in Beijing. \u201cThis event further underlines this truth,\u201d he added.The China flyaroundTakeaway: the SEC did indeed informally indicate to Circle that regulators would \u201cnot pursue any enforcement action for prior activity\u201d at Poloniex as long as Circle cleans up Poloniex and turns it into a regulated exchange.The SEC seems to be saying here that it\u2019s okay if you broke the rules, as long as you get acquired by a legitimate player before we crack down on you.The virtual currency flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Echoes of Lynchings in Quiet Photos", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensOliver Clasper traveled through the United States seeking spaces where lynchings took place, ranging from the American south to New York City.The scenes in many of Oliver Clasper\u2019s photographs are utterly mundane, bereft of any dazzling camera tricks or rich colors. They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there. Starting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d Given the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.Interviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.On April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201dInterviewed November 2016.In what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201dInterviewed March 2017.On Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201dWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201dInterviewed October 2016.Mary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.After Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201dInterviewed September 2017.Michael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.On the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201dInterviewed October 2017.On March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "London\u2019s Concrete Ladders", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "OpinionThe city is wilder than we think; that\u2019s what\u2019s clear from up above.Supported byLONDON \u2014 It was by climbing London that I fell in love with it.I don\u2019t dislike ground-level London. I have grudging affection for its impractical streets and the unhinged ambition written into its architecture. I like the details: the font on the Underground station signs and the hundreds of sea gulls that perch, looking incongruously seaside and skeptical, on the Millennium Bridge each night. I like the self-conscious solemnity of the faces in the National Portrait Gallery and the variegated gray of the Thames. Most of all, and especially now, I cherish its defiantly global heart. But living in any city takes tensed muscles and a carefully calibrated deafness. There are moments when the desire for escape and a wider sky becomes overwhelming, and it\u2019s then that I go night climbing.I do so because to know a city properly, it helps to touch it and to know the textures and scents of the materials that built it. I have developed strong opinions about brickwork and brick dust and cement and concrete, about the skeleton of London. I have come to love the rich tawny color of the yellow London stock brick, its mellowness stemming from the clay of South East England.I go night climbing because London\u2019s street map in the dark is a majestic thing, a wilderness drawn in light. Unlike the grids of New York and Chicago, it is chaotic. The lights look more like the anarchy of stars than town planning. There are the great gaps, as black as the sky, of Hyde Park and Hampstead Heath.I do it because to stand on the rooftops of a city is to see its secrets.My night climbing is not strictly legal. I slide under fences. I go slowly: My kind of expedition has nothing to do with the bravado of those roof climbers who hang from the edges of chimneys and joists. And I don\u2019t have the kind of arm muscles that mean I can do pull-ups with one hand, so the building needs to have scaffolding. (The scaffolding, though, mustn\u2019t reach all the way to the top, otherwise the roof will be covered in plastic; there will be no view and it will smell like dust and feet.) I am always a little scared. It is a grotesque whimsy to want to dance on top of a skyscraper.Not long ago I climbed newly erected scaffolding to the top of Centre Point, a 380-foot skyscraper in the center of the city. I started climbing buildings while in college, clambering up small spires and saluting Oxford\u2019s gargoyles, but this was different. It wasn\u2019t the first skyscraper I had been up, but it was the tallest, and at its feet is one of the busiest streets in London. Even at half-past one in the morning, Tottenham Court Road still has stragglers: drunkards, shift workers and occasional police officers.It took a long time to get to the top, an hour or more. With a friend I shinned up a lower next-door building, which stood dark and empty, and ran along its rooftop, slipping sideways into its neighbor\u2019s maze of scaffolding bars. At the top it was the kind of height that makes your skin feel too small for your bones, and your knees feel sentient; there were moments when I snorted the sweat on my upper lip through my nose and out through my mouth \u2014 a neat trick if I\u2019d been doing it on purpose.But the view made it worth the fear.I saw London stretched out, sharp-edged, dirty, knowing, witty, tough: a place where knowledge has been pooled and mad theories formulated. It makes sense, then, that night should work on the city like an alchemist. It takes what in daylight are chrome and glass and gray, and turns them to gold.Piccadilly Circus looked suddenly ancient, its lights like offerings to small gods. I could see the unromantic air-conditioning fans whirring on the rooftops of buildings whose marble facades made them look as if they wouldn\u2019t deign to even admit the existence of weather. The Tate Modern, out across the river, stood like a rook among pawns. Late-night crowds on Oxford Street, which, when among them no sane person could love, were beautiful from above in the way that migrating herds are beautiful.Coming back down to earth felt a very grudging concession to necessity. As it always does. The adrenaline carried me through the journey home, and it was only when I got there that I realized my fists were scraped and bloody and my hair so full of dust that the water in my shower ran the color of coffee. But to climb a building is to change the way you see it, irrevocably. When I look at Centre Point now, I no longer see a blocky piece of Brutalism built in 1966. I see a concrete ladder to the cold night sky.London is wilder than we think; that is what is clear from up above.

And the seeming fellow activists who called them to rallies via Facebook, or joined in the free-for-all on Twitter, appeared unremarkable.Except that their English sometimes seemed a little odd.\u201cWe are looking for friendship because we are fighting for the same reasons,\u201d someone purporting to be with an online group calling itself Blacktivist wrote via Twitter to the Rev. Dr. Heber Brown III, a Baltimore pastor, in April 2016. \u201cActually we are open for your thoughts and offers.\u201dIn late October 2016, in Nederland, Tex., the Texas Nationalist Movement got a Facebook message from someone representing a group called Heart of Texas, which planned to organize rallies in favor of Texas secession on the eve of the election. But on a follow-up call, \u201csomething was off,\u201d said Daniel Miller, the president of the Texas Nationalist Movement.Despite their wariness, neither Dr. Brown nor Mr. Miller had any inkling of what was really behind those odd encounters. Heart of Texas and Blacktivist were phony groups, part of a sweeping Russian disinformation campaign that was funded with millions of dollars and carried out by 80 people operating out of St. Petersburg, Russia.The Russian attempt at long-distance choreography was playing out in many cities across the United States. Facebook has disclosed that about 130 rallies were promoted by 13 of the Russian pages, which reached 126 million Americans with provocative content on race, guns, immigration and other volatile issues.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.\u201cSome defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities,\u201d the indictment said. Among others, it said, the Russians contacted \u201ca real U.S. person affiliated with a Texas-based grass-roots organization,\u201d who advised them to focus their efforts on \u201cpurple states like Colorado, Virginia and Florida.\u201dThe indictment did not name the activist, but Mr. Miller said in an interview that the mention had set off a slightly unnerving guessing game in his state as to who the helpful Texan might be. It was not him, he said.\u201cEvery organization in Texas that\u2019s been politically involved over the last few years is sort of eyeing the other ones,\u201d said Mr. Miller, whose group decided not to endorse the Heart of Texas rallies. \u201cMueller\u2019s team needs to clarify this.\u201d (A spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment.)\u201cThe way you\u2019re going about this is deeply offensive to those of us who are from Baltimore and have been organizing here all our lives,\u201d Dr. Brown wrote to the stranger.Seemingly chastened, Blacktivist replied, \u201cThis must be really wrong. I feel ashamed.\u201dThe pastor replied: \u201cPost a public apology. Cancel the event and take your cues from those working locally.\u201dLater, on social media, some puzzled participants complained that no one from Heart of Texas, which had about 250,000 likes on Facebook, had shown up for the group\u2019s own rally.\u201cThe fact that they got people to show up at real-world events is impressive,\u201d said Renee DiResta, the head of policy at Data for Democracy, a nonprofit that has studied the Russian activity. \u201cWhat we have is an engine for reaching people and growing an audience, which is fantastic. But this shows that it can be used for very shady purposes.\u201dBut Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment repeatedly states that the Russian operation was designed not just to provoke division among Americans but also to denigrate Hillary Clinton and support her rivals, mainly Mr. Trump. The hashtags the Russian operation used included #Trump2016, #TrumpTrain, #MAGA and #Hillary4Prison, and one Russian operative was reprimanded for \u201ca low number of posts dedicated to criticizing Hillary Clinton,\u201d the indictment says.They have expressed no regret that they were apparently taken in by the Russian operatives. Instead, since Friday\u2019s indictment, Donald Trump Jr., like his father, has pointed mainly to the fact that it did not accuse the president or his associates of assisting the Russian operation.Jeremy Bowers contributed research.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "James Beard Awards Apply a New Yardstick: Good Behavior", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe James Beard Foundation\u2019s sprawling list of more than 400 semifinalists for the best chefs, restaurants and restaurateurs in the country usually doesn\u2019t get much attention, except from the people who are on it. The real action comes in May, when the winners are announced at a glamorous gala.Some restaurants that topped critics\u2019 lists in 2017 are noticeably absent, omitted by the foundation for either proven or perceived violations of the new code.A committee of 18 food writers, editors and producers is charged with sifting through 23,000 nominations \u2014 from regional judges, restaurants and the public \u2014 to create the semifinal list. In a sometimes contentious meeting in Honolulu last month, they grappled with how best to apply the foundation\u2019s new standards for personal and corporate behavior. Because members signed nondisclosure agreements, they would not publicly discuss why certain restaurants did or did not make the list.\u201cObviously, the names in these categories are presented without context, but we hope that they reflect the foundation\u2019s desire to present awards that will more accurately represent the nation\u2019s true wealth of culinary talent,\u201d Mr. Addison said.There have been calls to strip medals from previous winners, which the foundation has declined to do. Instead, past winners who have faced public charges of sexual harassment or abuse have been barred from voting from now on. (Previous winners make up the bulk of the 600 or so voters who will use the semifinalist list as a ballot to pick the finalists in each category. The same voters then choose the winners.)Others said the guidelines for both the larger group that nominates contenders and the committee that selects the semifinalists were too open to interpretation.The policy, he said in a follow-up phone interview, could be used in an unfairly draconian way. \u201cIt\u2019s a time of adjustment, and people are understandably cautious,\u201d he said.\u201cIn another year and another awards cycle, after this initial period of pulling back, there is going to be a new normal for what has been proven, how it has been reported and what goes on everyone\u2019s best of lists.\u201dAnne Quatrano, the Atlanta chef who oversees the foundation\u2019s awards, agreed that judging the character of a chef or the culture of a restaurant could be challenging. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are in some ways in an awkward position,\u201d she said. \u201cBut really, it\u2019s just making sure we feel comfortable that people on that list have integrity, and that those restaurants have good leaders and that everyone can thrive in their kitchens.\u201d\u201cI think it may be more important that Bloomfield\u2019s talent is heard. But I\u2019m a white dude \u2014 this line is not mine to draw,\u201d Mr. Gold wrote. \u201cAnd whichever side of the question you lean toward, it is hard not to feel queasy at the result.\u201d\u201cWhy, with so much talent out there, with so many compelling restaurants to cover, would you review the one veiled in controversy?\u201d she wrote.The policy is limited to cases in which the behavior has been investigated and publicly exposed. \u201cI don\u2019t think its fair to punish restaurants based on rumors,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Teenagers Are Learning From Online Porn", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "FeatureAmerican adolescents watch much more pornography than their parents know \u2014 and it\u2019s shaping their ideas about pleasure, power and intimacy. Can they be taught to see it more critically?Supported byBut around 10th grade, it began bothering Drew, an honor-roll student who loves baseball and writing rap lyrics and still confides in his mom, that porn influenced how he thought about girls at school. Were their breasts, he wondered, like the ones in porn? Would girls look at him the way women do in porn when they had sex? Would they give him blow jobs and do the other stuff he saw?Drew, who asked me to use one of his nicknames, was a junior when I first met him in late 2016, and he told me some of this one Thursday afternoon, as we sat in a small conference room with several other high school boys, eating chips and drinking soda and waiting for an after-school program to begin. Next to Drew was Q., who asked me to identify him by the first initial of his nickname. He was 15, a good student and a baseball fan, too, and pretty perplexed about how porn translated into real life. Q. hadn\u2019t had sex \u2014 he liked older, out-of-reach girls, and the last time he had a girlfriend was in sixth grade, and they just fooled around a bit. So he wasn\u2019t exactly in a good position to ask girls directly what they liked. But as he told me over several conversations, it wasn\u2019t just porn but rough images on Snapchat, Facebook and other social media that confused him. Like the GIF he saw of a man pushing a woman against a wall with a girl commenting: \u201cI want a guy like this.\u201d And the one Drew mentioned of the \u201cpain room\u201d in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d with a caption by a girl: \u201cThis is awesome!\u201dWatching porn also heightened Q.\u2019s performance anxiety. \u201cYou are looking at an adult,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe guys are built and dominant and have a big penis, and they last a long time.\u201d And if you don\u2019t do it like the guys in porn, Drew added, \u201cyou fear she\u2019s not going to like you.\u201dLeaning back in his chair, Drew said some girls acted as if they wanted some thug rather than a smart, sensitive guy. But was it true desire? Was it posturing? Was it what girls thought they were supposed to want? Neither Q. nor Drew knew. A couple of seats away, a sophomore who had been quiet until then added that maybe the girls didn\u2019t know either. \u201cI think social media makes girls think they want something,\u201d he said, noting he hadn\u2019t seen porn more than a handful of times and disliked it. \u201cBut I think some of the girls are afraid.\u201d\u201cIt gets in your head,\u201d Q. said. \u201cIf this girl wants it, then maybe the majority of girls want it.\u201d He\u2019d heard about the importance of consent in sex, but it felt pretty abstract, and it didn\u2019t seem as if it would always be realistic in the heat of the moment. Out of nowhere was he supposed to say: Can I pull your hair? Or could he try something and see how a girl responded? He knew that there were certain things \u2014 \u201cbig things, like sex toys or anal\u201d \u2014 that he would not try without asking.\u201cI would just do it,\u201d said another boy, in jeans and a sweatshirt. When I asked what he meant, he said anal sex. He assumed that girls like it, because the women in porn do.\u201cI would never do something that looked uncomfortable,\u201d Drew said, jumping back into the conversation. \u201cI might say, \u2018I\u2019ve seen this in porn \u2014 do you want to try it?\u2019\u2009\u201dIt was almost 4 p.m., and the boys started to gather their backpacks to head to a class known as Porn Literacy. The course, with the official title The Truth About Pornography: A Pornography-Literacy Curriculum for High School Students Designed to Reduce Sexual and Dating Violence, is a recent addition to Start Strong, a peer-leadership program for teenagers headquartered in Boston\u2019s South End and funded by the city\u2019s public-health agency. About two dozen selected high school students attend every year, most of them black or Latino, along with a few Asian students, from Boston public high schools, including the city\u2019s competitive exam schools, and a couple of parochial schools. During most of the year, the teenagers learn about healthy relationships, dating violence and L.G.B.T. issues, often through group discussions, role-playing and other exercises.But for around two hours each week, for five weeks, the students \u2014 sophomores, juniors and seniors \u2014 take part in Porn Literacy, which aims to make them savvier, more critical consumers of porn by examining how gender, sexuality, aggression, consent, race, queer sex, relationships and body images are portrayed (or, in the case of consent, not portrayed) in porn.Besides, there\u2019s a decent chance your parents don\u2019t think you are watching porn. Preliminary analysis of data from a 2016 Indiana University survey of more than 600 pairs of children and their parents reveals a parental na\u00efvet\u00e9 gap: Half as many parents thought their 14- and 18-year-olds had seen porn as had in fact watched it. And depending on the sex act, parents underestimated what their kids saw by as much as 10 times.What teenagers see on Pornhub depends partly on algorithms and the clips they\u2019ve clicked on in the past. Along with stacks of videos on the opening page, there are several dozen categories (\u201cteen,\u201d \u201canal,\u201d \u201cblonde,\u201d \u201cgirl on girl,\u201d \u201cebony,\u201d \u201cmilf\u201d) that can take them to more than six million videos. The clips tend to be short, low on production value, free and, though Pornhub tries to prevent it, sometimes pirated from paid sites. Many of the heterosexual videos are shot from the male point of view, as if the man were holding the camera while he has sex with a woman whose main job, via oral sex, intercourse or anal sex, is to make him orgasm. Plot lines are thin to nonexistent as the camera zooms in for up-close shots of genitals and penetration that are repetitive, pounding and \u2014 though perhaps not through the eyes of a 14-year-old \u2014 banal. (There are alternative narratives in L.G.B.T. and feminist porn, and studies show that for gay and bisexual youth, porn can provide affirmation that they are not alone in their sexual desires.)We don\u2019t have many specifics on what kids actually view, in large part because it\u2019s extremely difficult to get federal funding for research on children and pornography. A few years ago, frustrated by the dearth of large, recent United States studies, Rashida Jones, Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus, creators of the 2017 Netflix documentary series \u201cHot Girls Wanted: Turned On,\u201d about technology and porn, paired with several foundations and philanthropists to fund a national survey about porn viewing, sexual attitudes and behaviors. As part of the survey, led by Debby Herbenick, a professor at the Indiana University School of Public Health and director of the university\u2019s Center for Sexual Health Promotion, along with her colleague Bryant Paul, 614 teenagers ages 14 to 18 reported what their experiences were with porn. In preliminary data analysis from the study (Herbenick is submitting an academic paper for publication this year), of the roughly 300 who did watch porn, one-quarter of the girls and 36 percent of the boys said they had seen videos of men ejaculating on women\u2019s faces (known as \u201cfacials\u201d), Paul says. Almost one-third of both sexes saw B.D.S.M. (bondage, domination, sadism, masochism), and 26 percent of males and 20 percent of females watched videos with double penetration, described in the study as one or more penises or objects in a woman\u2019s anus and/or in her vagina. Also, 31 percent of boys said they had seen \u201cgang bangs,\u201d or group sex, and \u201crough oral sex\u201d (a man aggressively thrusting his penis in and out of a mouth); less than half as many girls had.The Indiana University national survey of teenagers asked about other sex behaviors as well. Though the data have not been fully analyzed, preliminary findings suggest that of the teenagers who had had sex, around one-sixth of boys said they had ejaculated on someone\u2019s face or choked a sex partner. The survey didn\u2019t define choking, but the high school and college-age students I spoke to referred to it as anything from placing a hand gently on a partner\u2019s neck to squeezing it.We don\u2019t have longitudinal data on the frequency of ejaculating on a girl\u2019s face or choking among American teenagers to know whether either practice is more common now. And, as David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, told me, fewer teenagers have early sex than in the past (in a recent study, 24 percent of American ninth graders had sex; in 1995 about 37 percent had), and arrests of teenagers for sexual assault are also down. But you don\u2019t have to believe that porn leads to sexual assault or that it\u2019s creating a generation of brutal men to wonder how it helps shape how teenagers talk and think about sex and, by extension, their ideas about masculinity, femininity, intimacy and power.Over the year in which I spoke to dozens of older teenagers at Start Strong and around the country, many said that both porn and mainstream media \u2014 everything from the TV show \u201cFamily Guy\u201d (which references choking and anal sex) to Nicki Minaj\u2019s song \u201cTruffle Butter\u201d (with an apparent allusion to anal sex followed by vaginal sex) to the lyrics in Rihanna\u2019s \u201cS&M\u201d (\u201cSticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me\u201d) \u2014 made anal and rough sex seem almost commonplace. Drew told me he got the sense that girls wanted to be dominated not only from reading a few pages of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d but also from watching the movie \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith,\u201d with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. \u201cShe\u2019s on the table, and she\u2019s getting pounded by him. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve seen growing up.\u201dIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that some adolescents use porn as a how-to guide. In a study that Rothman carried out in 2016 of 72 high schoolers ages 16 and 17, teenagers reported that porn was their primary source for information about sex \u2014 more than friends, siblings, schools or parents.\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to learn about sex,\u201d the suburban boy told me. \u201cAnd porn stars know what they are doing.\u201d His words reflect a paradox about sex and pornography in this country. Even as smartphones have made it easier for teenagers to watch porn, sex education in the United States \u2014 where abstinence-based sex education remains the norm \u2014 is meager. Massachusetts is among 26 states that do not mandate sex ed. And a mere 13 require that the material be medically and scientifically accurate. After some gains by the Obama administration to promote more comprehensive sex ed, which includes pregnancy prevention, discussions of anatomy, birth control, disease prevention, abstinence and healthy relationships, the Trump administration did not include the program in its proposed 2018 budget; it also has requested increased funding for abstinence education. Easy-to-access online porn fills the vacuum, making porn the de facto sex educator for American youth.In the first class, Daley led an exercise in which the group defined porn terms (B.D.S.M., kink, soft-core, hard-core), so that, as she put it, \u201ceveryone is on the same page\u201d and \u201cyou can avoid clicking on things you don\u2019t want to see.\u201d The students also \u201cvalues voted\u201d \u2014 agreeing or disagreeing about whether the legal viewing age of 18 for porn is too high, if working in the porn industry is a good way to make money and if pornography should be illegal. Later, Daley held up images of a 1940s pinup girl, a Japanese geisha and Kim Kardashian, to talk about how cultural values about beauty and bodies change over time. In future classes, they would talk about types of intimacy not depicted in porn and nonsexist pickup lines. Finally, Daley would offer a lesson about sexting and sexting laws and the risks of so-called revenge porn (in which, say, a teenager circulates a naked selfie of an ex without consent). And to the teenagers\u2019 surprise, they learned that receiving or sending consensual naked photos, even to your boyfriend or girlfriend, can be against the law if the person in the photo is a minor.Now, in the third week of class, Daley\u2019s goal was to undercut porn\u2019s allure for teenagers by exposing the underbelly of the business. \u201cWhen you understand it\u2019s not just two people on the screen but an industry,\u201d she told me, \u201cit\u2019s not as sexy.\u201dTo that end, Daley started class by detailing a midlevel female performer\u2019s salary (taken from the 2008 documentary \u201cThe Price of Pleasure\u201d): \u201cBlow job: $300,\u201d Daley read from a list. \u201cAnal: $1,000. Double penetration: $1,200. Gang bang: $1,300 for three guys. $100 for each additional guy.\u201d\u201cWow,\u201d Drew muttered. \u201cThat makes it nasty now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing for being penetrated on camera,\u201d another boy said.Then, as if they had been given a green light to ask about a world that grown-ups rarely acknowledge, they began peppering Daley, Rothman and Alder with questions.\u201cHow much do men get paid?\u201d one girl asked. It is the one of the few professions in which men are paid less, Rothman explained, but they also typically have longer careers. How long do women stay in their jobs? On average, six to 18 months. How do guys get erections if they aren\u2019t turned on? Often Viagra, Rothman offered, and sometimes a \u201cfluffer,\u201d as an offscreen human stimulator is known.Daley then asked the teenagers to pretend they were contestants on a reality-TV show, in which they had to decide if they were willing to participate in certain challenges (your parents might be watching) and for how much money. In one scenario, she said, you would kneel on the ground while someone poured a goopy substance over your face. In another, you\u2019d lick a spoon that had touched fecal matter. The kids debated the fecal-matter challenge \u2014 most wouldn\u2019t to do it for less than $2 million. One wanted to know if the goop smelled. \u201cCan we find out what it is?\u201d asked another.Then Daley explained that each was in fact a simulation of a porn act. The goopy substance was what\u2019s called a \u201cbaker\u2019s dozen,\u201d in which 13 men ejaculate on a woman\u2019s face, breasts and mouth.\u201cWhat?\u201d a girl named Tiffany protested.The second scenario \u2014 licking the spoon with fecal matter \u2014 was from a porn act known as A.T.M., in which a man puts his penis in a woman\u2019s anus and then immediately follows by sticking it in her mouth.\u201cNo way,\u201d a 15-year-old boy said. \u201cCan\u2019t you wash in between?\u201dNope, Daley said.\u201cWe don\u2019t question it when we see it in porn, right?\u201d Daley went on. \u201cThere\u2019s no judgment here, but some of you guys are squeamish about it.\u201d\u201cI never knew any of this,\u201d Drew said, sounding a bit glum.Daley went on to detail a 2010 study that coded incidents of aggression in best-selling 2004 and 2005 porn videos. She noted that 88 percent of scenes showed verbal or physical aggression, mostly spanking, slapping and gagging. (A more recent content analysis of more than 6,000 mainstream online heterosexual porn scenes by Bryant Paul and his colleagues defined aggression specifically as any purposeful action appearing to cause physical or psychological harm to another person and found that 33 percent of scenes met that criteria. In each study, women were on the receiving end of the aggression more than 90 percent of the time.)\u201cDo you think,\u201d Daley said, standing in front of the students, \u201cwatching porn leads to violence against women? There\u2019s no right or wrong here. It\u2019s a debate.\u201dKyrah, a 10th-grade feminist with an athlete\u2019s compact body and a tendency to speak her opinions, didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIn porn they glamorize calling women a slut or a whore, and younger kids think this is how it is. Or when they have those weird porn scenes and the woman is saying, \u2018Stop touching me,\u2019 and then she ends up enjoying it!\u201dTiffany, her best friend, snapped her fingers in approval.\u201cYes and no,\u201d one guy interjected. \u201cWhen a man is choking a woman in porn, people know it is not real, and they aren\u2019t supposed to do it, because it\u2019s violence.\u201d He was the same teenager who told me he would just \u201cdo\u201d anal sex without asking a girl, because the women in porn like it.For years, Gallop has been a one-woman laboratory witnessing how easy-to-access mainstream porn influences sex. Now in her 50s, she has spent more than a decade dating 20-something men. She finds them through \u201ccougar\u201d dating sites \u2014 where older women connect with younger men \u2014 and her main criterion is that they are \u201cnice.\u201d Even so, she told me, during sex with these significantly younger nice men, she repeatedly encounters porn memes: facials, \u201cjackhammering\u201d intercourse, more frequent requests for anal sex and men who seem less focused on female orgasms than men were when she was younger. Gallop takes it upon herself to \u201cre-educate,\u201d as she half-jokingly puts it, men raised on porn. Some people, of course, do enjoy these acts. But speaking of teenagers in particular, she told me she worries that hard-core porn leads many girls to think, for example, that \u201call boys love coming on girls\u2019 faces, and all girls love having their faces come on. And therefore, girls feel they must let boys come on their face and pretend to like it.\u201dThough none of the boys I spoke to at Start Strong told me they had ejaculated on a girl\u2019s face, Gallop\u2019s words reminded me of conversations I had with some older high-schoolers in various cities. One senior said that ejaculating on a woman\u2019s face was in a majority of porn scenes he had watched, and that he had done it with a girlfriend. \u201cI brought it up, or she would say, \u2018Come on my face.\u2019 It was an aspect I liked \u2014 and she did, too.\u201dAnother noted that the act is \u201ctalked about a lot\u201d among guys, but said that \u201ca girl\u2019s got to be down with it\u201d before he\u2019d ever consider doing it. \u201cThere is something that\u2019s appealing for guys. The dominance and intimacy and that whole opportunity for eye contact. Guys are obsessed with their come displayed on a girl.\u201dMany girls at Start Strong were decidedly less enthusiastic. One senior told me a boyfriend asked to ejaculate on her face; she said no. And during a conversation I had with three girls, one senior wondered aloud: \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t want a facial? What are you supposed to do? Friends say a boy cleans it with a napkin. A lot of girls my age like facials.\u201d But a few moments later, she reversed course. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think they like it. They do it because their partner likes it.\u201d Next to her, a sophomore added that when older girls talk among themselves, many say it\u2019s gross. \u201cBut they say you gotta do what you gotta do.\u201d And if you don\u2019t, the first girl added, \u201cthen someone else will.\u201dDrew had firsthand experience with what he had seen in porn not translating into actual pleasure. The first time he had sex, he thought he was supposed to exert some physical control over his girlfriend. But the whole thing felt awkward, too rough and not all that fun. And things that looked easy in porn, like sex while taking a shower or mutual oral sex, didn\u2019t go so well.At one point during sex, Drew\u2019s girlfriend at the time, who was a year older and more experienced, asked him to put his hand around her neck during sex. He did it, without squeezing, and though it didn\u2019t exactly bother him, it felt uncomfortable. Drew never asked if she got the idea from porn, but it made him wonder. Had she also picked up other ways of acting? \u201cLike, how do you really know a girl has had a good time?\u201d he said one afternoon, musing aloud while sitting with some friends before Porn Literacy class. \u201cMy girlfriend said she had a good time,\u201d he went on. \u201cShe was moaning. But that\u2019s the thing: Is it fake moaning?\u201dEven if you know porn isn\u2019t realistic, it still sets up expectations, one senior told me. In porn, he said, \u201cthe clothes are off, and the girl goes down on the guy, he gets hard and he starts having sex with her. It\u2019s all very simple and well lit.\u201d Before he had sex, porn had supplied his images of oral sex, including scenes in which a woman is on her knees as a man stands over her. At one point, he thought that\u2019s how it might go one day when he had sex. But when he talked with his girlfriend, they realized they didn\u2019t want to re-enact that power dynamic.Aside from some private schools and innovative community programs, relatively few sex-ed classes in middle and high school delve in detail into anatomy (female, especially), intimacy, healthy relationships, sexual diversity. Even more rare are discussions of female desire and pleasure. Porn taught A. the basics of masturbation. And porn served as her study guide when she was 16 and was the first among her friends to have sex. She clicked through videos to watch women giving oral sex. She focused on how they moved during sex and listened to how they moaned. She began shaving her vulva (\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone in porn have sex with hair on it\u201d).Porn is \u201cnot all bad,\u201d said A., who was frank and funny, with a slew of advanced-placement classes on her transcript and a self-assured manner that impresses adults. \u201cI got my sexual ways from porn, and I like the way I am.\u201d But what she learned from porn had downsides too. Because she assumed women\u2019s pleasure in porn was real, when she first had intercourse and didn\u2019t have an orgasm, she figured that was just how it went.For A., it wasn\u2019t enough to know that porn was fake sex. She wanted to understand how real sex worked. Rothman and her team did consult a sex educator while they were writing the Porn Literacy curriculum but decided to include only some basic information about safe sex. It came in the form of a \u201cPorn Jeopardy\u201d game during one class. The teenagers, clustered in teams, chose from four categories: S.T.D./S.T.I.s, Birth Control, Teen Violence/Sexual Assault and Porn on the Brain.\u201cS.T.I.s/S.T.D.s for $300,\u201d one student called out.\u201cWhy is lubrication important for sex?\u201d Alder asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s lubrication?\u201d Drew asked.\u201cIt\u2019s lube,\u201d another teenager said, in an attempt to explain.\u201cIs lubrication only the little tube-y things?\u201d a girl with long black hair asked. \u201cOr can it be natural?\u201d\u201cI never learned this before,\u201d Drew announced to the class after it was mentioned that lubrication decreased friction, increased pleasure and could reduce the risk of tearing and therefore of S.T.I.s and S.T.D.s. Drew\u2019s only sliver of sex ed was in sixth grade with the school gym teacher, who sweated as he talked about sex, \u201cand it was all about it being bad and we shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201dAs if to rectify that, Alder offered a quick anatomy lesson, drawing a vulva on the whiteboard and pointing out the clitoris, the vagina, the urethra. \u201cThis is called a vulva,\u201d she said. Alder repeated the word slowly and loudly, as if instructing the students in a foreign language. It was both for humor and to normalize a word that some of them may have been hearing for the first time. \u201cThis is the clitoris,\u201d Alder went on. \u201cThis is where women get most pleasure. Most women do not have a G spot. If you want to know how to give a woman pleasure, it\u2019s the clitoris.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d Rothman said quietly. Alder had just inched across a line in which anatomy rested on one side and female desire and pleasure on the other. It was a reminder that as controversial as it is to teach kids about pornography, it can be more taboo to teach them how their bodies work sexually. \u201cThe class is about critically analyzing sexually explicit media,\u201d Rothman told me later, \u201cnot how to have sex. We want to stay in our narrow lane and not be seen as promoting anything parents are uncomfortable with.\u201d Daley added: \u201cI wish it were different, but we have to be aware of the limitations of where we are as a society.\u201dThe most recent sex-education guidelines from the World Health Organization\u2019s European office note that educators should include discussions about the influence of pornography on sexuality starting with late elementary school and through high school. The guidelines don\u2019t, however, provide specific ideas on how to have those conversations.In Britain, nonprofit organizations and a teachers\u2019 union, along with members of Parliament, have recommended that schools include discussions about the influence of porn on how children view sex and relationships. Magdalena Mattebo, a researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden who studies pornography and adolescents, would like porn literacy mandated in her country. \u201cWe are a little lost in how to handle this,\u201d Mattebo told me.More than 300 schools, youth and community groups and government agencies in Australia and New Zealand use components of a porn-education resource called \u201cIn the Picture\u201d that includes statistics, studies and exercises primarily for teenagers. It was created by Maree Crabbe, an expert on sexual violence and pornography education, who lives near Melbourne, Australia. As she put it during a United States training program for educators and social workers that I attended in 2016: \u201cWe want to be positive about sex, positive about masturbation and critical of pornography.\u201d One key component of the program is often neglected in porn literacy: providing training to help parents understand and talk about these issues.Last year, a feminist porn producer, Erika Lust, in consultation with sex educators, created a porn-education website for parents. The Porn Conversation links to research and articles and provides practical tips for parents, including talking to kids about the ways mainstream porn doesn\u2019t represent typical bodies or mutually satisfying sex and avoiding accusatory questions about why your kid is watching porn and who showed it to them. \u201cWe can\u2019t just say, \u2018I don\u2019t like mainstream porn because it\u2019s chauvinistic,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Lust, whose films feature female-centered pleasure. \u201cWe have given our children technology, so we need to teach them how to handle it.\u201d But she takes it a step further by suggesting that parents of middle- and high-schoolers talk to their teenagers about \u201chealthy porn,\u201d which she says includes showing female desire and pleasure and being made under fair working conditions. I asked Lust if she would steer her daughters in that direction when they are older (they are 7 and 10). \u201cI would recommend good sites to my daughters at age 15, when I think they are mature enough. We are so curious to find out about sex. People have doubts and insecurities about themselves sexually. \u2018Is it O.K. that I like that, or this?\u2019 I think porn can be a good thing to have as an outlet. I\u2019m not scared by explicit sex per se. I\u2019m afraid of the bad values.\u201dTristan Taormino, another feminist porn filmmaker and author, speaks frequently on college campuses and produces explicit sex-ed videos for adults. \u201cThe party line is we don\u2019t want teenagers watching our videos,\u201d she says, noting they are rated XXX. \u201cBut do I wish teenagers had access to some of the elements of it?\u201d In addition to seeing consent, she said, \u201cthey would see people talking to each other, and they\u2019d see a lot of warm-up. We show lube, we show sex toys.\u201dThat may be more than most parents, even of older teenagers, can bear. But even if parents decided to help their teenagers find these sites, not only is it illegal to show any kind of porn \u2014 good or bad \u2014 to anyone under 18, but, really, do teenagers want their parents to do so? And which ones would parents recommend for teenagers? \u201cUnlike organic food, there\u2019s no coding system for ethical or feminist porn,\u201d Crabbe notes. \u201cThey might use condoms and dental dams and still convey the same gender and aggression dynamics.\u201d Also, \u201cgood porn\u201d isn\u2019t typically free or nearly as accessible as the millions of videos streaming on mainstream sites.Al Vernacchio, a nationally known sexuality educator who teaches progressive sex ed at a private Quaker school outside Philadelphia, believes the better solution is to make porn literacy part of the larger umbrella of comprehensive sex education. Vernacchio, who is the author of the 2014 book \u201cFor Goodness Sex: Changing the Way We Talk to Teens About Sexuality, Values, and Health,\u201d is one of those rare teenage-sex educators who talks directly to his high school students about sexual pleasure and mutuality, along with the ingredients for healthy relationships. The problem with porn \u201cis not just that it often shows misogynistic, unhealthy representations of relationships,\u201d Vernacchio says. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn relationship skills from porn, and if you are looking for pleasure and connection, porn can\u2019t teach you how to have those.\u201dCrabbe notes one effective way to get young men to take fewer lessons from porn: \u201cTell them if you want to be a lazy, selfish lover, look at porn. If you want to be a lover where your partner says, \u2018That was great,\u2019 you won\u2019t learn it from porn.\u201d And parents should want their teenagers to be generous lovers, Cindy Gallop argues. \u201cOur parents bring us up to have good manners, a work ethic. But nobody brings us up to behave well in bed.\u201dTo prepare his students to be comfortable and respectful in sexual situations, Vernacchio shows photos, not just drawings, of genitalia to his high-schoolers. \u201cMost people are having sex with real people, not porn stars, and real bodies are highly variable. I would much rather my students have that moment of asking questions or confusion or even laughter in my classroom rather than when they see their partner\u2019s naked body for the first time.\u201d He, along with Debby Herbenick, who is also the author of the 2012 book \u201cSex Made Easy: Your Awkward Questions Answered for Better, Smarter Amazing Sex,\u201d advocate that adolescents should understand that most females don\u2019t have orgasms by penetration alone, and that clitoral stimulation often requires oral sex, fingers and sex toys. As she notes: \u201cIt\u2019s part of human life, and you teach it in smart, sensitive ways.\u201dA., the young woman who said she had never seen an image of a penis until she watched porn, resisted the idea that porn was uniformly bad for teenagers. \u201cAt least kids are watching porn and not going out and getting pregnant,\u201d she said. But recently, she told me that she\u2019d given up watching it altogether. She disliked looking at women\u2019s expressions now, believing that they probably weren\u2019t experiencing pleasure and might be in pain. When Drew watched porn, he found himself wondering if women were having sex against their will. As another student said with a sigh: \u201cNicole and Jess ruined porn for us.\u201dIn the months after the class, A. had created a new mission for herself: She was going to always have orgasms during sex. \u201cAnd I did it!\u201d she told me. It helped that she had been in a relationship with a guy who was open and asked what she liked. But even if Porn Literacy didn\u2019t go into as many details about sex as she would have liked, \u201cin this indirect way, the class shows what you deserve and don\u2019t deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cIn porn, the guy cares only about himself. I used to think more about \u2018Am I doing something right or wrong?\u2019\u2009\u201d Porn may neglect women\u2019s orgasms, but A. wasn\u2019t going to anymore.Drew, who had once used porn as his main sex educator, was now thinking about sex differently. \u201cSome things need to come to us naturally, not by watching it and seeing what turns you on,\u201d he told me. The discussions about anatomy and fake displays of pleasure made him realize that girls didn\u2019t always respond as they did in porn and that they didn\u2019t all want the same things. And guys didn\u2019t, either. Maybe that porn clip in which the nice, tender guy didn\u2019t excite the girl was wrong. What Drew needed was a girl who was open and honest, as he was, and with whom he could start to figure out how to have good sex. It would take some time and most likely involve some fumbling. But Drew was O.K. with that. He was just starting out.Maggie Jones is a contributing writer for the magazine and teaches writing at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s M.F.A. program.

{"Headline": "A Murder Trial Stirs Emotions About Canada\u2019s Relations With Indigenous Population", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBATTLEFORD, Saskatchewan \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s push for reconciliation of Canada\u2019s troubled history with its Indigenous people particularly resonates here in the town of Battleford, in the central part of Saskatchewan Province.And now there is the verdict in the Gerald Stanley trial.Mr. Stanley, a local farmer, had been charged with second-degree murder in the death of Colten Boushie, a 22-year-old Cree man from the nearby Red Pheasant Cree Nation.In August 2016, Mr. Boushie and four other Indigenous people drove onto Mr. Stanley\u2019s property. Mr. Stanley, 56, testified at trial that he believed their goal was robbery, which he and his son tried to prevent.In what the farmer called an unintended accident, Mr. Boushie was killed by a bullet to the back of his head that came from a semiautomatic handgun Mr. Stanley fired during a confrontation with the group.For the past 17 months, the case had been hotly debated in Battleford, stirring deep feelings here about the treatment \u2014 both past and present \u2014 of the province\u2019s Indigenous population.Ben Kautz, a member of the municipal council in Browning, Saskatchewan, wrote, under his full name, in a Facebook page for farmers, now defunct, that Mr. Stanley\u2019s \u201conly mistake was leaving three witnesses.\u201d He has since stepped down from the council.At the same time, many non-Indigenous people in Saskatchewan view Mr. Boushie\u2019s death as an injustice, including a group that stood in front of the courthouse on Thursday in bone-chilling cold holding signs and banners calling for justice.Mr. Boushie\u2019s family and their supporters were angry about the police inquiry, which they called flawed and inadequate, contending that it initially focused more on the actions of the five young Indigenous people than on the killing of Mr. Boushie. They also said the case exposed a lack of progress in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s reconciliation effort.\u201cIf we are making progress why would it have exploded so much when he got shot?\u201d Jade Tootoosis, Mr. Boushie\u2019s cousin, asked the other day in the living room of their grandmother\u2019s house at Red Pheasant. \u201cI pity them because I don\u2019t understand why they feel so much hate for someone they don\u2019t know.\u201dEleanore Sunchild grew up in the Thunderchild Cree First Nation north of Battleford. Now she runs a legal practice in town that specializes in resolving claims by former pupils of mandatory boarding, or residential, schools the federal government established in the 19th century.Ms. Sunchild, 45, said her home province was the national laggard on reconciliation.\u201cSaskatchewan is just beginning, I don\u2019t even know if we have really started on reconciliation,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that Indian people deserve a break because we\u2019ve been victimized. I\u2019m saying that both sides have to take accountability and responsibility for what got us into this situation in the first place.\u201dLast year, an association of rural municipalities in Saskatchewan passed a resolution asking the federal government to expand self-defense laws.Both groups say their efforts are directed against criminals, not Indigenous people.Alvin Baptiste, Mr. Boushie\u2019s uncle, gave a tour of Red Pheasant to visitors this week. He acknowledged that some of the reserve\u2019s young people, along with white youths in the area, passed too much of their time with drinking, drugs and petty crime. For that he blamed the lack of job opportunities since the decline in oil prices, the lingering effects of the residential schools on families and the general dysfunction of the reserve.A relatively new and well-maintained school is an exception in the area. No footprints lead through the snow to a hockey arena seemingly too large for the 500 or so people who live there. Money and energy to keep it operating ran out some time ago.Pointing to the community center across the street, Mr. Baptiste said that its basketball programs had stopped and that the building was used only for wakes and ceremonial occasions. Next to it are the abandoned gas pumps and building of what had been Red Pheasant\u2019s only store.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to do on this reserve, there\u2019s nothing for them,\u201d he said, referring to young people.Evidence presented at the trial showed that the group in the car, while driving on a flat tire, had tried to steal a car at another farm before going to the Stanleys. In court, Mr. Stanley\u2019s lawyer acknowledged that a toxicology report showed that Mr. Boushie was \u201cso impaired it\u2019s hard to believe that he could function at all.\u201dChris Murphy, a lawyer retained by the Boushie family, said that a junior constable was initially put in charge of the investigation, forensic experts were not brought in and the car in which Mr. Boushie died was left uncovered, its doors open, for two rainy days, washing away evidence.The police force declined to comment.Mr. Stanley testified at trial that he grabbed his semiautomatic pistol to fire two warning shots. He said he was trying to turn off the engine of the car the men were driving while holding the pistol when the fatal bullet fired in what he testified was a complete surprise.Experts brought in by Mr. Stanley\u2019s lawyer said that on rare occasions, bullets can briefly linger inside guns and rifles after a trigger is pulled \u2014 although neither those experts nor ones with the police were able to recreate the flaw using Mr. Stanley\u2019s gun and ammunition.For Ms. Tootoosis, the social media hatred prompted by the killing of her cousin may also prove to be his legacy.\u201cUltimately Coco\u2019s death needs to have a purpose,\u201d she said using the family\u2019s nickname for Mr. Boushie. \u201cIt\u2019s brought to light such a divide, and the question now isn\u2019t what is the government do about it, what are the courts going to do about it? It\u2019s, \u2018What am I going to do about it?\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jurors in Nanny Trial Prepare to Hear Emotional Case", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree are parents. Three have relatives who struggle with a mental illness. Five live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.They are among 12 jurors and six alternates ready to hear the case of a nanny accused of stabbing to death two young children in her care in an affluent part of the neighborhood six years ago.\u201cIf you don\u2019t get emotional during this trial then maybe you need to check your pulse,\u201d Justice Gregory Carro said in response to one prospective juror\u2019s question about her ability to be impartial given the emotional nature of the case. He said he did not expect jurors to be robots.One juror, a native of New Mexico living in the Financial District and a former elementary schoolteacher, expressed reservation about being empaneled. Her aunt has schizophrenia and her family had to care for her daughter, the juror said. She said her sister also has a mental illness and that \u201cthe system has failed her.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could put that aside,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very torn by that.\u201d She later said she could judge the case fairly.Another juror, an Upper West Sider originally from Kansas and the daughter of a doctor who served as an expert in criminal trials, is a physical therapist who works with patients with psychiatric issues. She also spent a summer caring for her sister\u2019s children. When she learned that she had been selected as a juror she became upset and told Justice Carro that she felt stressed by the process. She later apologized and said she had \u201csome anxiety over being chosen,\u201d but could keep an open mind.A third juror, a native New Yorker from East Harlem, said his sister struggled with depression as a teenager and noted: \u201cI like to weigh the facts and hear people out.\u201dA fourth juror, also from the Upper West Side, said he had read news accounts about the murders but could be fair.The 12 jurors and six alternates also include a bank supervisor from Washington Heights studying criminal justice, a Michigan native raising two young children in Hudson Heights, a Transit operator, a senior property manager from Harlem, a window treatment and upholstery designer originally from Mississippi, a lawyer living on the Upper West Side and an actor who is also a taxi driver. At least 13 are black, Hispanic or Asian. Ms. Ortega is a naturalized American citizen from the Dominican Republic.Prosecutors are expected to argue that Ms. Ortega, 55, killed Lucia Krim, 6, and Leo Krim, 2, because she was angry with the Krims for asking her to work too hard. Defense lawyers will ask the jury to find Ms. Ortega not guilty by reason of insanity, meaning that she did not understand the consequences of her actions when she killed the children she cared for during two years. The start of the trial was delayed for years while Ms. Ortega\u2019s lawyers built a case for the insanity defense. It is expected to last at least three months.\u201cShe did have a choice,\u201d a visibly flustered potential juror said after a prosecutor explained that Ms. Ortega pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. \u201cHer job is to be a nanny, to take care of children, correct? Not to hurt the kids.\u201d\u201cI am not going to sit here and listen to \u2014\u201d the potential juror said before pausing. \u201cI just can\u2019t. I could not sleep last night.\u201dJustice Carro immediately interrupted her: \u201cYou\u2019ve said enough,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cThank you.\u201dThe woman was later excused.\u201cThere will probably be emotional testimony and evidence,\u201d Justice Carro said at one point. \u201cYou can\u2019t let that affect your fact finding.\u201dMs. Ortega is charged with two counts of murder in the first degree and two counts of murder in the second degree. If found guilty, she faces life in prison. If the jury determines she is not guilty by reason of insanity she faces time in a mental hospital.The trial will put the Krims face-to-face with Ms. Ortega, the nanny they once regarded as family.Mrs. Krim said she found comfort in discovering reminders of her children all around her, like the street art on a construction site, a stencil of a boy holding a sign with colorful hearts. She connected the image to Leo.\u201cI felt that maybe the universe was trying to tell me something, that it was helping me to realize that there was a beautiful \u2018new\u2019 relationship waiting to be developed with Lulu and Leo,\u201d she wrote.\u201cThe night of their deaths had been a nightmare, the kind you want desperately to wake up from, but it keeps hitting you that you can\u2019t and you never will,\u201d Mr. Krim wrote.The next morning, Mr. Krim said he felt like he did not \"want to do anything ever again.\u201d But his surviving daughter, Nessie, 3 looked at him and said, \u201cDaddy, I\u2019m hungry,\u201d he recounted. \u201cAnd I knew I had to take care of her and Marina.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Noah Hagey, a partner in the San Francisco-based law firm BraunHagey & Borden, which is representing Mr. Sam Rainsy, called the legal action \u201can opportunity to bring unique transparency to some of the Hun regime\u2019s most insidious methods for controlling and manipulating ordinary citizens.\u201dGenevieve Grdina, a spokeswoman for Facebook, declined to comment directly on the petition, but she said that anyone with a public Facebook page could purchase targeted ads to reach particular audiences, and that Facebook made every possible effort to identify and eliminate click farms and fake pages.Duong Dara, who manages Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook presence, said Mr. Sam Rainsy\u2019s petition revealed a misunderstanding of the nature of advertising.\u201cYou can see many billboards on the street, and people are willing to pay for more advertising, and it brings more business,\u201d Mr. Duong Dara said. \u201cThis is normal and simple and everywhere. It\u2019s part of business. It\u2019s not like you are stealing or you are trying to get fake \u2018likes\u2019 and fake whatever.\u201dHe said the emails purporting to show huge Facebook ad spending by the Cambodian government were \u201cfake information,\u201d but he declined to provide a more accurate figure.In another case, a student was jailed for 18 months for calling for a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d on Facebook. No pro-government Facebook users have ever been prosecuted along similar lines.Huy Vannak, an under secretary of state at Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry who often speaks on behalf of the government on media-related matters, said on Thursday that Mr. Sam Rainsy\u2019s petition was \u201cstupid and funny.\u201d He said Facebook was a level playing field where both the government and the opposition were free to promote their pages and make appeals to voters.\u201cI just tell stupid Sam Rainsy that if he plays Facebook, he should know about this,\u201d Mr. Huy Vannak said. \u201cFacebook has room for everyone to pay and boost their Facebook \u2018likes.\u2019 This is reality. If he wants more \u2018likes\u2019 on his Facebook, he can pay the money to Facebook, and then he will get more \u2018likes\u2019 if he wants.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He disappeared.\u201cI\u2019m not cold, and I\u2019m not heartless,\u201d a soft-spoken Ms. Graswald said, sitting in a conference room in her lawyer\u2019s office here on Friday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m a person with feelings. I love people. I love Vince. I love his family. I love my friends and his friends. I didn\u2019t just go out and coldheartedly let him die. I tried to help him. I tried to paddle toward him. It\u2019s just not fair how they\u2019re portraying me as a coldblooded murderer or killer.\u201dSuspicion over Ms. Graswald started growing not long after Mr. Viafore disappeared, driven in part by behavior that some saw as strange, like posting a video of herself doing a cartwheel on Facebook and singing \u201cHotel California\u201d in a bar. (\u201cThat\u2019s how I dealt with it,\u201d she later said.) For Mr. Viafore\u2019s family, the doubts about Ms. Graswald have not ebbed.Laura Rice, Mr. Viafore\u2019s sister, said that the details of what preceded her brother\u2019s drowning remain unclear. \u201cAt the end of the day, nobody knows what happened,\u201d she said in a telephone interview on Saturday night. But she described Ms. Graswald\u2019s admissions to detectives and guilty plea as fuel for her misgivings.\u201cShe definitely did something, otherwise she would have fought it,\u201d Ms. Rice said. \u201cShe still took a plea. An innocent person doesn\u2019t take a plea.\u201dMs. Graswald, 37, was taken into custody 10 days after Mr. Viafore\u2019s disappearance, after encountering investigators near Bannerman Castle as she left a wreath of fake flowers attached to a life preserver as a tribute. (Mr. Viafore\u2019s body was recovered in May.)In the interview on Friday she defended her behavior. She said she was hungry, thirsty and tired. \u201cI was just being cooperative,\u201d Ms. Graswald said. \u201cI also felt like I couldn\u2019t leave, that I couldn\u2019t walk away at any time.\u201dProsecutors said that she knew she was the beneficiary of life insurance policies belonging to Mr. Viafore worth about $250,000. She had also said that Mr. Viafore had pressured her to do sexual acts that she did not want to do, which the authorities also contended could have been a motivation to kill him.But she disputed that.\u201cI was just at the wrong place at the wrong time, bottom line,\u201d Ms. Graswald said, noting the rough conditions the couple ran into on the water. \u201cI was in danger, too, just as much as he was. I just happened to survive, and now I\u2019m guilty?\u201dProsecutors noted that there was \u201clittle direct precedent, if any,\u201d of a conviction for removing a plug from a kayak. Tests had found that removing the plug from the kayak was not enough in itself to cause the kayak to capsize, prosecutors said, and Mr. Viafore was not wearing a life jacket or a wet suit and the couple had alcohol with them on the trip. And in a case that would have largely turned on Ms. Graswald\u2019s vacillating statements, prosecutors also said that her admissions did not add up to a direct confession.(Prosecutors declined to address the case last week. \u201cThe case is over and as such we have no further comment,\u201d said Christopher P. Borek, the chief assistant district attorney.)Ms. Graswald maintained her innocence, but she said she had \u201cno faith in the system whatsoever.\u201d Over the summer, she weighed the prospect of life in prison if she were convicted against being released by the end of the year, if she pleaded guilty. (By pleading guilty to criminally negligent homicide, she acknowledged that she knew of the missing plug, rough weather conditions and his lack of safety gear, but that she did not intend for him to die.)She left prison just days before Christmas after being detained for about 32 months.Ms. Graswald, a native of Latvia, came to the United States after finding a job as a nanny in Greenwich, Conn. She was a university student studying English and German, hoping to become a teacher or translator, and taking some time off. But she ended up staying.She met Mr. Viafore in 2013. He was outgoing, and their interests overlapped: They liked hiking and shooting pool. They both led active social lives. They became engaged in February 2014. His proposal was spontaneous, she said; they were at a hibachi steakhouse, and the ring was a slice of onion from the grill.The two of them fought over the sexual acts that she felt pressured to do. When she told investigators she felt relieved, she said, she was not referring to his death. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cI felt relief that the pressure was over.\u201d She said they were looking forward to their wedding, set for Aug. 15, 2015 \u2014 exactly 15 years after she came to the United States.Ms. Rice, Mr. Viafore\u2019s sister, said she knew the couple fought. She said she did not know the details of their sex life, but added that there were other sources of friction in their relationship and that Ms. Graswald had a temper. Ms. Rice said that Mr. Viafore was frustrated that Ms. Graswald was not working and that he had to support her. He had called off the engagement but continued supporting Ms. Graswald, Ms. Rice said. She believed her brother was close to ending the relationship.Ms. Rice also said that the family believes Ms. Graswald should have spent more time in prison, but ultimately, she supported the agreement because of the toll the case has taken. Still, it is not over: The family has sought to keep Ms. Graswald from receiving the life insurance money. (Ms. Graswald said the money, if she gets it, would pay for her legal expenses.)\u201cWe have to keep going through this,\u201d Ms. Rice said.Ms. Graswald declined to say where she was living after her release. But she described her life as being in a \u201chibernating state.\u201d She goes to church and visits with friends, she said, and does little else. She is on parole and her immigration status is unclear, meaning she could be deported.\u201cI\u2019m kind of just living day by day for now,\u201d Ms. Graswald said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect. I almost just want to go to Europe and leave it all behind. I don\u2019t want any of that to follow me. I want to leave it all behind, but it\u2019s not so simple.\u201dAdvertisement"}

PETERSBURG, Russia \u2013 Operating from St. Petersburg, they churned out falsehoods on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. They promoted Donald J. Trump and denigrated Hillary Clinton. They stole the identities of American citizens. They organized political rallies in several states, and hired a Clinton impersonator for one event, in West Palm Beach, Fla.One sign of his connection to the trolls, according to the indictment: In what appeared to be something of an inside joke, people working for the Internet Research Agency paid an American to hold a sign outside the White House \u2014 \u201cHappy 55th Birthday, Dear Boss\u201d \u2014 to celebrate Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s birthday (June 1) in 2016.The troll farm soon drew notice in Russia: news outlets reported that it employed 250 people in 12-hour shifts to provide a round-the-clock flow of pro-Kremlin posts and comments, praising Mr. Putin and excoriating President Barack Obama and President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. Monthly salaries ranged from $1,100 for a junior analyst to $1,400 for a blogger to $4,200 a month for senior management.Mr. Bystrov, who is believed to be 59, has avoided reporters and declined interview requests.A young tech entrepreneur, Mr. Burchik, 31, joined the company in October 2013 and became its executive director, the No. 2 official, by March 2014, according to the indictment.According to online records, he registered a company in 2009 called Add1.ru that was behind a 2014 hoax. In that hoax, a young woman in aviator sunglasses calling herself Zoe Foreman spent hours spamming politicians and journalists about a horrific \u2014 and fictitious \u2014 chemical plant explosion in Louisiana.Throughout the troll farm\u2019s operations to interfere in American politics, including the election, \u201cBurchik was a manager involved in operational planning, infrastructure and personnel,\u201d according to the indictment.The business news website RBC reported on Friday that Mr. Burchik claimed not to know English well enough to understand what he had been accused of. \u201cIf a few hundred million Americans are so worried about the activities of a regular Russian small-business man from the IT-sphere doing website development, then it seems the situation in the country is completely grave,\u201d he said.Mr. Burchik told Komsomolskaya Pravda, a Russian tabloid, that he was not concerned about being detained while traveling abroad. \u201cI love my country. In Russia there are many beautiful places where you can go,\u201d he said.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.Mr. Burchik has worked on several small government projects in St. Petersburg. In 2015 he was awarded a contract worth about $20,000 to develop and publish a newspaper called Dvortsovy Ukrug, for the administration of one of St. Petersburg\u2019s municipal districts, according to government documents.That same year, another municipal district government awarded him a similar contract to prepare a film about its activities. And in 2012, he won a $4,500 contract for organizing a program for promoting \u201ctolerance and prevention of drug addiction\u201d for local schools.Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova obtained visas to visit the United States in 2014 \u201cunder false pretenses for the purposes of collecting intelligence to inform the organization\u2019s operatives,\u201d according to the indictment. They are said to have embarked on what amounted to a three-week reconnaissance tour, visiting California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Texas. Along the way, they bought SIM cards, cameras and drop phones and discussed \u201cevacuation scenarios\u201d and other security measures.According to the indictment, Ms. Bogacheva oversaw the data analysis group for the \u201ctranslator project.\u201d A woman with the same name was listed in 2013 on the website of ITMO, a prestigious science university in St. Petersburg, as a doctoral candidate. She worked there from 2011 to 2014, as an engineer in the eScience Research Institute, according to a university spokeswoman. Many of the school\u2019s graduates have gone on to work for the Russian government or for large tech companies.Ms. Krylova became the No. 3 person at the troll farm, according to the indictment. According to what appears to be her LinkedIn profile, she is a graduate of the Moscow State University of Printing Arts, where she studied with the faculty of advertising and public relations.She was the head of the Federal News Agency, which is believed to be Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s flagship media outlet. The agency is known for its exclusive coverage of Russian private armies on Syria\u2019s front line.Mr. Polozov ran the troll farm\u2019s I.T. department and oversaw the purchase of space on computer servers inside the United States to set up virtual private networks that masked the agency\u2019s Russian location, according to the indictment. After a co-conspirator traveled to Atlanta in November 2014, he gave Mr. Polozov a summary of his trip and expenses.According to business records and Mr. Polozov\u2019s page on the Russian social network Vkontakte, Mr. Polozov runs a software company called Morkov, which was registered in 2013, and began to recruit web developers and programmers in early 2014.\u201cIn need of people with knowledge of website promotion for full-time work,\u201d he wrote in a Vkontakte post on May 28, 2014. \u201cIf interested, send me a personal message. You can send your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 immediately.\u201dThe greatest possible mistake is to neglect the Russians. Consider them weak. Offend them. Never offend the Russians. The Russians are never as weak as you think they are. God forbid you expel the Russians or take something from them. The Russians always come back. The Russians will come back and take back what is theirs. But when the Russians return, they do not apply force proportionally. They destroy everything in their path.Not much is known about the Bovdas, including their relationship. According to the indictment, she was the head, and he the deputy head, of the \u201ctranslator project,\u201d the troll farm\u2019s campaign to target Americans with messages on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, starting in April 2014. The project employed hundreds of people and, by the summer of 2016, was spending $1.2 million a month. It hid activities through a web of shell companies. According to the indictment, Ms. Bovda and Mr. Bovda both worked for the troll farm for about a year, from November 2013 to October 2014.According to the indictment, Mr. Aslanov oversaw many of the operations targeting the United States election. An investigation by RBC, a newsmagazine, found that Mr. Aslanov was in charge of the \u201cAmerican department\u201d of the troll farm. It reported that Mr. Aslanov arrived in St. Petersburg in 2000 from his hometown Ust-Kut, in the Irkutsk region. His Vkontakte profile says he graduated from the Russian State Hydrometeorological University in St. Petersburg in 2012, and a university page indicates that he studied economics and wildlife management.The RBC report says that he spent several months in the United States in 2009, visiting New York and Boston. His work at the troll farm included registering legal entities in the names of his employees.Ms. Kaverzina grew worried after Facebook revealed last September that it was cooperating with the authorities to look into Russian advertising on the platform. \u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the F.B.I. busted our activity (not a joke),\u201d she wrote to a relative, according to the indictment. \u201cSo, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues,\u201d she added. \u201cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\u201dMr. Podkopaev was an analyst for the \u201ctranslator project.\u201d He conducted research on the United States and drafted social media messages for the organization, according to the indictment.Ivan Nechepurenko reported from St. Petersburg, and Michael Schwirtz from New York.

{"Headline": "Netanyahu, Linked to $300,000 in Bribes, Says He Won\u2019t Quit", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe coalition is stable, and no one, me or anyone else, has plans to go to elections,\u201d he declared in Tel Aviv. \u201cWe will continue to work together with you for the citizens of the State of Israel, until the end of our term,\u201d in late 2019.Beloved by his base and respected even by his adversaries as a guardian of Israel\u2019s security, Mr. Netanyahu remains the dominant figure on the Israeli stage, his combined 12 years as prime minister closing in on the record of David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s principal founder.And he has defended that position in part by steadily chipping away at the institutions that balance the powers of his office in ways that seem to echo the aggressive tactics of President Trump, except that he was doing it before there was a President Trump.He and his governing coalition have campaigned to curb the activist Israeli judiciary, demonized the rambunctious press as a bastion of left-wing partisans, attacked the funding of nongovernmental organizations whose worldview they see as hostile and, as the police closed in, he has done his utmost to discredit them, too.Mr. Netanyahu rode to power in 2009, after his predecessor, Ehud Olmert, faced indictment on charges of taking tens of thousands of dollars in cash payoffs. Mr. Olmert, who was deeply unpopular after leading Israel into a humiliating Lebanon war, was politically doomed the moment Israelis heard the news, but Mr. Netanyahu also has a far more commanding hold on power.Mr. Olmert\u2019s coalition had depended on the support of potent rivals like Tzipi Livni and former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who pushed for Mr. Olmert to resign after his history of payoffs became known.But with no acknowledged successor of any stature waiting in line, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition is essentially a captive to him.Much as Republicans in the United States Congress see Mr. Trump as their best shot of retaining power, even if they do not like everything about him, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing and ultra-Orthodox allies prefer Mr. Netanyahu, whatever his faults, to being shut out by a left-of-center government.Mr. Olmert\u2019s political base was \u201cless tolerant to allegations of corruption than Netanyahu\u2019s,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, while \u201cthe more right-wing base is less open to any initiatives that may topple their leader.\u201dThere are other differences, including sheer shock value. News of Mr. Olmert\u2019s payoffs landed like a thunderbolt after surfacing in the unexpected testimony of his longtime benefactor in an open courtroom. But the outline and most of the details of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s alleged misdeeds have been dribbling out for more than a year through nearly daily leaks in the Israeli news media.Indeed, the biggest surprise contained in the recommendations the police released Tuesday night \u2014 saying there was evidence to prosecute Mr. Netanyahu on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges \u2014 was that a key witness against him was a rival for his job, Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party.Mr. Lapid, who has been gaining strength in the polls, told investigators that, while finance minister in a previous coalition, he had opposed an effort by Mr. Netanyahu to enhance a tax benefit that would have benefited an Israeli movie producer. The police said that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s tax effort was in exchange for lavish gifts from the producer Arnon Milchan.Mr. Netanyahu and his allies sought to impeach Mr. Lapid\u2019s testimony as nothing more than crass political self-interest.\u201cThis is the same Lapid who promised to bring me down at any price,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said.\u201cYou are a lousy snitch,\u201d the head of the governing coalition, David Amsalem, called Mr. Lapid. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201dHe added: \u201cYou cannot represent us in the world when every foreign leader that you meet knows you have been accused of serious offenses.\u201dThere were also demands for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s resignation in the opposition and across much of the news media, and a demonstration against him was called for Friday in downtown Tel Aviv.As a legal matter, the case now goes to state prosecutors and the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, a onetime Netanyahu aide. After closely supervising the investigation, Mr. Mandelblit will now decide whether to file formal charges. If he does, it will be a first against a sitting prime minister in Israel.Getting to that point, which would require a hearing at which Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers could argue against indictment, could take months.As a political matter, however, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-leaning governing coalition holds just 66 of 120 seats in Parliament, so any cracks in solidarity could quickly prove fatal.Within 24 hours, however, three crucial partners had indicated that they would stay by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s side for the moment. The finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, whose center-right Kulanu party holds 10 seats, signaled late Tuesday that he would not make any decisions before the attorney general\u2019s decision on an indictment.Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, whose Yisrael Beiteinu party has five seats, recalled how he was forced to resign as foreign minister after being indicted on corruption charges in 2012, but won acquittal and resumed his post a year later.\u201cThis is why until a prime minister is convicted at court, he can continue,\u201d Mr. Lieberman said.The education minister, Naftali Bennett, who leads the right-wing Jewish Home party, which has eight seats, said that replacing the government \u201cshould be done at the voting station.\u201dBut he allowed that the police recommendations were \u201charsh\u201d and called into question the prime minister\u2019s ability \u201cto be a leader and role model for the citizens of Israel.\u201d\u201cA prime minister is not meant to be perfect or live an over-modest lifestyle, but he needs to be someone people look at and say, \u2018This is how one should act,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTaking gifts in large sums over a long period of time is not living up to this standard.\u201dSpeaking in Tel Aviv, Mr. Netanyahu did not dispute that he had accepted gifts from Mr. Milchan, the Hollywood producer, and James Packer, an Australian billionaire, but he accused the police of inflating their value in order to reach what he called \u201ca magic number,\u201d the figure of one million shekels, or about $283,000.While the police portrayed his connection to the Israeli-born Mr. Milchan as \u201ca bribery relationship,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu insisted they were longtime friends. And he said investigators had ignored two instances, involving an automotive company and a television channel, in which his actions had been adverse to Mr. Milchan\u2019s business interests.\u201cHow could I on the one hand be acting in Milchan\u2019s favor and on the other against him?\u201d Mr. Netanyahu asked.\u201cWhen Ehud Olmert was forced to leave his post after an indictment was issued, that happened with full public confidence in the law enforcement agencies,\u201d the journalist Ben-Dror Yemini wrote in an op-ed article in Yedioth Ahronoth. \u201cIf Netanyahu is forced to leave his post in the coming number of months, that will happen amid an awful crisis of confidence among his supporters, who aren\u2019t exactly a negligible minority.\u201dIsabel Kershner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

If you\u2019re a man, you don\u2019t wring your hands as you read; you clutch your crotch.So I\u2019ve tried for years now to limit my exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Following the advice of the President\u2019s Cancer Panel, I eat organic to reduce exposure to endocrine disruptors in pesticides. I try to store leftover meals in glass containers, not plastic. I avoid handling A.T.M. and gas station receipts. I try to avoid flame-retardant furniture.Those are all common sources of toxic endocrine disruptors, so I figured that my urine would test pristine. Pure as a mountain creek.As I waited for the lab results, I continued to follow the latest research. One researcher sent a bizarre video of a mouse exposed to a common endocrine disruptor doing back flips nonstop, as a kind of nervous tic.Finally, I heard back from Silent Spring Institute. I figured this was a report card I had aced. I avoid all that harmful stuff. In my columns, I had advised readers how to avoid it.Sure enough, I had a low level of BPA, best known because plastic bottles now often boast \u201cBPA Free.\u201dBut even a diligent student like me failed the test. Badly. I had high levels of a BPA substitute called BPF. Ruthann Rudel, a toxicologist who is the head of research at Silent Spring, explained that companies were switching to BPF even though it may actually be yet more harmful (it takes longer for the body to break it down). BPF is similar to that substance that made those mice do back flips.Sigh. I thought I was being virtuous by avoiding plastics with BPA, but I may have been causing my body even more damage.My urine had an average level of an endocrine disruptor called triclosan, possibly from soap or toothpaste. Like most people, I also had chlorinated phenols (perhaps from mothballs in my closet).I had a high level of a flame retardant called triphenyl phosphate, possibly from a floor finish, which may be \u201cneurotoxic.\u201d Hmm. Whenever you see flaws in my columns, that\u2019s just my neurotoxins at work.Will these endocrine disruptors give me cancer? Make me obese? Make my genitals fall off? Nobody really knows. At least I haven\u2019t started doing random back flips yet.Yet my takeaway is also that chemical industry lobbyists have rigged the system so that we consumers just can\u2019t protect ourselves adequately.They are running the show, and we consumers are their lab mice.Advertisement"}

These heavily circulated snapshots have focused instead more on the quirky personalities, underdog efforts and curious moments that have always been a part of the Olympics but now spread to a wider audience.But let\u2019s just say they are also very much teenagers.Gerard stayed up late watching \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d on Netflix and slept through his alarm the day of his gold medal run. He called his morning \u201chectic.\u201d After winning the gold, he promptly let out an expletive heard on television. The internet found its first hero of the Games. For her part, Kim did not finish her breakfast sandwich the morning of her event, tweeting she was \u201changry\u201d (a combination of hungry and angry) minutes before her gold medal performance. Neither the figure skater Adam Rippon nor the skier Gus Kenworthy was favored to win a gold medal before the Games. But both had garnered news media attention as openly gay, outspoken members of the American team. Before the American delegation entered the opening ceremony, which Vice President Mike Pence attended, Kenworthy tweeted: It went viral. Four days later, after winning a bronze medal in the figure skating team competition \u2014 and incurring the wrath of internet trolls \u2014 Rippon wrote on Twitter: Kenworthy had a disappointing 12th-place finish, but found his own shining moment. Unbeknown to him, cameras caught him kissing his boyfriend. In the men\u2019s 15-kilometer cross-country race, Dario Cologna of Switzerland won the gold, Simen Hegstad Kruger of Norway took silver and Denis Spitsov, a Russian, earned the bronze. But it was the last finishers \u2014 not the first \u2014 who created the race\u2019s most memorable moment. They included Pita Taufatofua of Tonga, Sebastian Uprimny of Colombia and, por fin, German Madrazo of Mexico. Madrazo told reporters he had learned to ski only a year ago. Taufatofua skied on snow for the first time a few months before the Games. The group lifted Madrazo on its shoulders when he crossed the finish line almost 26 minutes after Cologna won the race. When the halfpipe snowboard king Shaun White regained his Olympic crown, he also returned to the top of social. But not only for his performance. Advertisement"}

And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone X shows.\u2014 Peter EavisWith the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation.They may want to keep fretting, though.Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday. Stocks moved higher. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index closed up 1.2 percent and is now just 3.2 percent off the high it reached just before its plunge at the start of this month.\u2014 Peter EavisBut the two remain far apart on price.From the statement accompanying the letter:The Qualcomm Board believes the meeting led to further progress toward a possible negotiated transaction on key issues other than price. The Board authorized providing Broadcom with a mark-up of Broadcom\u2019s previously released draft merger agreement that, if agreed to by Broadcom, would resolve all issues between the two companies other than price.ButBroadcom reiterated in the February 23 meeting that its reduced $79.00 per share proposal is its best and final proposal. The Qualcomm Board is unanimous in its view that each of Broadcom\u2019s proposals, including its prior $82.00 per share proposal, materially undervalues Qualcomm, and the Board encourages Broadcom to enter into mutual due diligence and price negotiations.Lt.

{"Headline": "A Crazy Idea for Funding Local News: Charge People for It", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe plan, for any would-be entrepreneur brave enough to try it, goes like this: Hire some very good journalists; just one or two are O.K. to start. Turn them loose on a large metropolitan area \u2014 try San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston or any other city going through waves of change, and whose local press has been gutted by digital disruption.Have your reporters cover stuff that no one else is covering, and let them ignore stuff that everyone else is covering. Don\u2019t do movie reviews, stock market analysis, Super Bowl coverage or anything else that isn\u2019t local. Instead, emphasize coverage that\u2019s actionable, that residents deem necessary and valuable for short- and long-term planning \u2014 especially an obsessive focus on housing and development, transportation, education and local politics.Package it all in a form that commands daily attention \u2014 probably a morning email newsletter \u2014 and sprinkle it with a sense of community, like offline and online networking events for readers.How will you fund all of this? This is the most important part: Shun advertising. Instead, ask readers to pay for it with real money \u2014 $5 or $10 a month, or perhaps even more. It will take time, but if you build it right, you just might create the next great metropolitan news organization.This plan may sound simplistic, almost like a joke. Wait, Sherlock, your big idea is to create a really good product and charge people money for it? Haven\u2019t people tried this before?Less than you might think. The short history of digital media is lousy with advertising, which promotes all the wrong incentives for online news \u2014 volume over curation, aggregation over original coverage, speed over accuracy.Yet few entrepreneurs have jumped on the subscription bandwagon for local news. The reluctance makes sense; local markets are by definition small, and journalism is expensive.But after studying Ms. Lessin\u2019s and Mr. Thompson\u2019s methods, I suspect there\u2019s a market for subscription-based local coverage. Someone just has to build it.How? Consider Ms. Lessin\u2019s plan for The Information, the tech news service she started in 2013 after spending eight years at The Wall Street Journal. Back then, online subscriptions seemed antiquated; many companies had experimented with charging users, but most had failed to win large numbers of subscribers, and the big money in media was in ad-supported sites aiming for rapid expansion through viral traffic.\u201cPeople thought no one would pay for news, especially tech news,\u201d Ms. Lessin told me last month. \u201cThe problem was the news business hadn\u2019t been focused on a key question: How do I deliver a differentiated product that people would pay for?\u201dHer idea for differentiation was to charge a lot for The Information \u2014 a subscription is $399 a year, close to what The Wall Street Journal charges for print delivery \u2014 but she would offer readers quality instead of volume.The Information publishes just two or three stories a day, often scoops and analysis, including a handy daily roundup of the most important stories in tech that day.Mr. Thompson\u2019s overhead is low: He is the only writer of Stratechery, which has become required reading among tech executives and many others in the industry. He declined to divulge any subscriber numbers, other than to say he\u2019s doing very well.A high-priced subscription site may well have a natural audience ceiling. Ms. Lessin declined to divulge her subscriber base but said it was \u201csignificantly north of 10,000,\u201d which is lower than the audience for many ad-based digital publications.Sure, there are reasons to be skeptical that this model could work in local news. Many subscribers to The Information and Stratechery think of the publications as a business expense \u2014 they work in tech or finance, wealthy industries that will pay just about anything for business intelligence.Yet there are striking overlaps between what those publications do and what a subscription-based local news start-up would look like. For one thing, a lot of those wealthy people also live in undercovered urban and suburban areas; if they\u2019re paying for news about tech, wouldn\u2019t they also pay for in-depth investigations into their kids\u2019 school district, their city\u2019s mayoral race or the traffic clogging their commute?There\u2019s also the opportunity to pay for a sense of community. The Information \u2014 through the Slack chat service, conference calls and in-person meet-ups \u2014 constantly brings subscribers together to talk about the industry. A local news start-up could do the same, selling not just news but a sense of belonging.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the subscription news business, you\u2019re not selling articles,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Why do they pay?\u201cNews happens in tech every day, and I do the thinking for them,\u201d he said. A subscription-based local news business would offer the same value: \u201cYou\u2019re selling people a feeling of being informed, of being good citizens \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re selling.\u201dNow we just need someone to build it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Books to Help You Understand Millennials and Beyond", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistWhen will someone stick up for millennials? We have been sheltered by our parents, swindled by our universities, deadened by our therapists, and for all this our reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press. Rising to our defense is Harris (our peer, born 1988, as the book\u2019s cover notes), a familiar provocateur from the internet\u2019s left flank. Harris contends that America has stiffed our generation, filling childhoods with homework and extracurricular activities. All of this ostensibly served to prepare us for college and fruitful careers, when really all it resulted in was the \u201calmost inevitable heartbreak\u201d of falling short of our parents\u2019 expectations and ours.Harris spins a recognizable story of a hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages. He uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork. And for what? \u201cEvery authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we could, and we did, but the market hasn\u2019t held up its end of the bargain.\u201dHe brings a fresh, contrarian eye to some of the usual data points. He sees in the Obama-era nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but \u201ca goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand.\u201d For rising tuition costs at America\u2019s public universities, he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures. He argues that millennials\u2019 deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors, who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers. He also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and YouTube stars. And he makes a surprising case that sexting isn\u2019t as harmful as it\u2019s cracked up to be.As generational advocates go, we could do worse than Harris. But he ends his book with a fatalism nearly as flippant as the generational critiques he loathes. Despite this moment of political fellowship among millennials, he writes off the possibility of meaningful change coming from government or social movements once we take over. I\u2019m not optimistic myself, no, but what is our generation if not rich in skills we may yet put to good use?Eler, who is the visual arts critic for The Star Tribune in Minnesota and also a millennial, has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy, self-expression and sex. In the selfie she finds \u201can aspirational image\u201d essential to \u201cbeing seen by others online.\u201d She sees the selfie as a lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem; she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes. And not all selfie-takers, she proves, are as oblivious as imagined.Unfortunately, Eler\u2019s book would have benefited from a more careful edit. Her discursive style is sometimes whimsical, but mostly distracting. She dwells on a topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie-related stories. Fake news in the 2016 election gets at least seven pages; the macaque who took a selfie and then saw PETA sue for his copyright gets just two. She provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad Tinder conversations but glosses over the July 2016 Facebook Live stream by Diamond Reynolds after her husband, Philando Castile, was shot by the police. And while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well, a section on social-media surveillance at Standing Rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting a meeting she had over coffee with a protester.In spite of its flaws, though, Eler\u2019s book alights on the source of the selfie\u2019s power: It is the easiest way to assert one\u2019s humanity in our hyper-networked world. Perhaps our much-fussed-over narcissism is not a flaw but a survival tactic.Her new \u201ciGen\u201d pities rather than disdains those born after 1995, arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled a new generation with profound psychological problems, including sleep deprivation, depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear. They drink less and have less sex; they socialize less without their parents present; they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall; they eschew church and even spirituality; they kill themselves more (but others less); they wait longer to get drivers\u2019 licenses and give birth. Twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students, which she supplements with first-person accounts from members of iGen. She concludes by offering this advice: \u201cDo not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of yourself. It is not your lover. Do not continuously turn your attention to it when you are talking with someone in person. It is not your best friend.\u201dTwenge is right to highlight smartphones\u2019 contributions to our malaise. In one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from a text sent without an immediate response, and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less in-person socializing, which breeds loneliness.She could stand to incorporate some of Harris\u2019s alarm about the economy. She duly recognizes income inequality as a prime source of iGen\u2019s anxiety about its future. But while she discusses how smartphones do their harm, she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market. Instead she tells marketers how to exploit iGen\u2019s diminished expectations, which struck me as tacky and not particularly useful, besides. The kids may spend too much time on their phones, but they know better than to trust brands.Jack Dickey, a 27-year-old millennial, is a staff writer for Sports Illustrated.Advertisement"}

All I knew, as I flipped through the book, was that the words were bouncing around the page:I had never bought a book of poetry before \u2014 at that age, doing so had never crossed my mind \u2014 but I bought \u201cEndless Life,\u201d kick-starting a habit of impulse purchasing that continues to this day. I spent time with it. Ferlinghetti\u2019s \u201cspontaneous\u201d transgressions of punctuation and spacing appealed to a kid who was warming up to the intoxicating provocations of punk rock, and I can\u2019t be alone in having had that response. Unscientific polling over the years has led me to believe that Ferlinghetti (like E. E. Cummings and Charles Bukowski) used to be something of a gateway poet for young people in America, and a residue of nostalgic fondness remains even for those readers who have moved on to ostensibly more sophisticated stuff. (If you\u2019re looking for a contemporary analogy, one can hope that thousands of Rupi Kaur fans will eventually find their way to, say, Louise Gl\u00fcck and Nikky Finney.) Whenever I\u2019m visiting San Francisco, I still make a pilgrimage to City Lights, the North Beach bookstore, founded by Ferlinghetti, that stands as a kind of Plymouth Rock for American poetry and progressive thought.But how does Ferlinghetti\u2019s work hold up now? (Ferlinghetti himself has held up well. At press time, he is still alive and nearing his 99th birthday.) As a publisher, a patron of the arts and a free-speech pioneer, he has been rightly celebrated for decades; he played a crucial role in the defense of Allen Ginsberg\u2019s \u201cHowl,\u201d even winning an obscenity case for daring to publish that zeitgeist-capturing incantation.It seems self-evident that the passing of years has done \u201cUnderwear\u201d no favors. At the same time, it would be churlish to deny that Ferlinghetti has given the popular canon many indelible lines. For a while in the 1950s and 1960s, his voice stood out amid a mounting dissident chorus; in these days of hashtagged political resistance, it is not uncommon to come across portions of his stanzas reconstituted as memes on Instagram and Facebook:Based on passages like that, it\u2019s not much of a stretch to put Ferlinghetti in the company of skilled songwriters. He knows how to craft a hook. His lines have an easy, welcoming flow. (In this book, the poems are arranged chronologically and fluidly, as if they were part of an \u201cAbbey Road\u201d-like symphonic collage or a Hollywood highlight reel.) He has a gift for helping you hear what needs to be said, free of impenetrable filters. He is allergic to willful obscurity and \u201cour little literary games,\u201d as he declared in one \u201cHowl\u201d-referencing populist manifesto that he titled, with characteristic directness, \u201cPopulist Manifesto No. 1\u201d:Does the occasionally tossed-off imperfection of the poems give them a kind of time-capsuled charm? If you\u2019re willing as a reader to be forgiving, it can be a blast to go back to the way the words bounce. And Ferlinghetti himself can\u2019t resist the pull of the past. In \u201cPlan du Centre de Paris \u00e0 Vol d\u2019Oiseau,\u201d this is how he remembers it:Jeff Gordinier, a former Times reporter, is the food and drinks editor of Esquire magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Parents of Shooting Victims, a Support Network That Keeps Growing", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA child is shot to death. Maybe at school, maybe at the movies. It is all over TV, all over Twitter, just like the last mass shooting.Then the cameras go away, and the parents are left in a wilderness of heartbreak. They do not know how to plan a funeral, where to get a therapist. They\u2019re not aware that scammers will try to fund-raise off their grief, that conspiracy theorists will question their tragedy, or that \u2014 hard to believe \u2014 they might, eventually, be O.K.But lots of people do know.Some mourn in private. Some confront politicians, join gun-control groups and flock to rallies. But whether they turn to advocacy or not, many gravitate toward one another, checking on each other by Facebook or phone whenever another gunman strikes.In a gun-control debate that often splinters along ideological lines, no one speaks more powerfully than those who survived a high-profile shooting, or the families of those who did not. The power of their testimonials goes beyond their authenticity: They, unlike politicians and advocates, can usually avoid the accusation that they are politicizing a tragedy.The difference is that mass-shooting survivors have yet to win any major victories on the federal level. So they do what they can, hoping that when the next mass shooting happens, more people will take to their cause.\u201cThe more people that are affected in some way, the more people care; yeah, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take,\u201d said Jenna Yuille, whose 54-year-old mother, Cindy Yuille, was one of two people shot and killed at the Clackamas Town Center outside Portland, Ore., in December 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, but that\u2019s part of what it\u2019s going to take.\u201dAt an Everytown training event in the spring of 2015, Ms. Yuille met Erica Lafferty, the daughter of one of the Newtown victims, Dawn Hochsprung, Sandy Hook\u2019s principal. They were around the same age; their mothers had died three days apart. The connection was instantaneous.When they heard about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday \u2014 Ms. Yuille in a text from her boyfriend, Ms. Lafferty when she glanced at CNN \u2014 Ms. Yuille texted Ms. Lafferty to check on her.They felt the same, they said: Tired.\u201cIs it bad that we\u2019re feeling so numb? Is it bad that I haven\u2019t cried?\u201d Ms. Lafferty asked Ms. Yuille on Friday, during a joint interview. \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t.\u201d\u201cSame,\u201d said Ms. Yuille, 29. \u201cI know there are other people, especially in Oregon, that see me as a leader on this issue, and being a spokesperson on this issue, so I worry about that. I don\u2019t want to let people down.\u201d\u201cExactly,\u201d said Ms. Lafferty, 32, who works for Everytown. \u201cLike, if I slow down, am I going to disappoint anyone? Am I going to disappoint myself?\u201dMany families, of course, do not want to be the faces of anything. They want to struggle in quiet, if not quite in peace. Some of the families of the Newtown victims have never spoken publicly about their ordeal. And some family members, Ms. Phillips said, continue to support gun rights.\u201cPeople who are affected in a personal way become lifelong dedicated volunteers to this,\u201d said Robert Bowers Disney, the vice president for organizing at the Brady Campaign. \u201cIt just fundamentally changes people\u2019s lives and experiences.\u201dThe Phillipses have been to the scene of almost every major shooting since their daughter died, usually letting local authorities and charitable organizations know that they are there if families need them. In Florida, they are planning to offer to connect the families of the teachers killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to the daughter of a teacher killed at Columbine in 1999.\u201cThey may not be wanting to talk, but when you tell them, \u2018I lost my daughter in the Aurora theater massacre,\u2019 they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh \u2026 my God,\u2019\u201d Ms. Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s that initial, \u2018Oh, you get this.\u2019\u201dThey offer advice on grim matters like psychological treatment (you don\u2019t need a grief counselor, they say; you need a trauma therapist) and how to fend off scammers who pretend to raise money for families, only to keep it for themselves.Increasingly, they have had to warn people about the online trolls who will inevitably inundate them with claims that the shooting was a government hoax.Some people take months to get in touch. Others, angry, want to talk about activism even before they bury their loved one. One man in Las Vegas who had lost his wife in the country music festival shooting knew no one else in town. So, while he waited for his wife\u2019s body to be released, he turned to Lonnie and Sandy Phillips. They are still talking.One of the first people the Phillipses spoke to after beginning this work was Nicole Hockley, whose son, Dylan, was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary.Ms. Hockley waited a month to meet with the Phillipses, and even then, she wondered if it was too soon. \u201cIt can also be scary to potentially see your future self from a path that you didn\u2019t choose,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also knowing that other people have survived and have found ways to keep walking forward \u2014 that can help as well.\u201dMs. Hockley, the co-director of the anti-gun-violence group Sandy Hook Promise, now tries to let the families of each successive wave of shooting victims know that they can lean on her for support when they are ready. She is careful to put aside her political agenda in those conversations, she said, not wanting to exploit their grief.Ms. Hockley heard about Wednesday\u2019s Parkland shooting while on a work trip to Los Angeles. She crumbled as she learned that it was a school.By Thursday, she was on a plane to Florida.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Ski Team That Sleeps Together Wins a Lot of Gold Medals Together", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPYEONGCHANG, South Korea \u2014 Norway has one of the smallest men\u2019s Alpine teams on the World Cup circuit, and only about 2.5 million men in the country to build a team from. And yet the Norwegian skiers are dominating the Olympics again.In an era in which every world-class athlete seems fixated on personal brand-building and competing for the most Facebook likes and Twitter followers, the Norwegians embrace an altogether different approach to success. It is a contrarian mix of humility, egalitarianism and basic respect \u2014 plus sharing an absurd amount of meals over the course of a schedule that has them spending roughly 250 days together every year.They get along so well and feel so strongly about collegiality that they even share beds sometimes.\u201cWe believe there is no good explanation or justification for why you have to be a jerk to be a good athlete,\u201d Jansrud, the defending Olympic super-G champion, said. \u201cSo we just won\u2019t have that kind of thing on our team. You have to get along with everyone.\u201dIn all, there are five time-honored, if unconventional, team dictums that they insist account for the outsize number of championships Norway\u2019s team has won the past two decades.A second rule is that there is no class structure, even though Jansrud and his veteran teammate Svindal have combined to win 18 Olympic and world championship medals as of nightfall Thursday.\u201cWhen I joined the team I was just a teenager who still had a poster of Aksel on my bedroom wall because he was a national hero,\u201d Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, 25, said.On his first day with the team, Kilde went to the team dinner \u2014 the Norwegians always try to eat together \u2014 and discovered he was seated at the head of the table.\u201cThere are no rookies and no champions on the team,\u201d said Kilde, now ranked 13th in the World Cup standings and one of six Norwegians in the top 30. \u201cWe\u2019re all equals.\u201dAnother team maxim: The social fabric of the group is paramount.\u201cWe have a saying,\u201d Svindal said. \u201cThere is almost no skill or ability you can have that is so good it allows you to ruin the social qualities of the team.\u201dSvindal explained the social quality of the team was essential because some days their training runs might last only two minutes \u2014 if that\u2019s the only fun you have every day, you\u2019re going to hate your job.\u201cAcross 250 days together, your life off the snow has to be really good,\u201d he said.Along those lines, there is another team canon.\u201cWe say that you talk to each other, not about each other,\u201d Lars Maeland, the team\u2019s strength and conditioning coach, said.Finally, there is one overriding, hard-and-fast team rule:Friday night is taco night.Eating tacos on Friday nights is a national tradition in Norway. Wherever the Norwegian men\u2019s Alpine team is in its rolling-stone existence \u2014 parts of every summer are spent on mountains in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 the entire team gathers on Fridays. The taco-prep duties rotate through the group. If possible, girlfriends and wives attend as well.\u201cThat might be another, more unofficial, rule,\u201d Maeland said. \u201cOur girlfriends are also good friends.\u201dSo, yes, the Norwegian men\u2019s team, which is about a dozen racers \u2014 or roughly one-third as many skiers as there are on some of the large European teams \u2014 is a close-knit group that gets along.But what does team bonding really have to do with skiing fast? Team members are actually competing against one another in an individual sport; there is no team score at the end of each race. Also, plenty of skiers have had success with little involvement with a national team.Jansrud, a gold medal contender at the Pyeongchang Games in the super-G, Alpine combined and downhill events, insisted that everyone\u2019s getting along leads to good results.\u201cThere are no secrets in terms of individual tactics or techniques on the team; we share everything we know,\u201d he said.Also, since ski racing is an unforgiving sport, with just one winner in each race, winning cannot be the only source of happiness, or else losing passion for the sport is inevitable. \u201cIf you have teammates who consistently lift you up, then the environment will make you happy,\u201d Jansrud said. \u201cYou\u2019ll work harder and stay motivated. You\u2019re giving yourself your best chance to win.\u201dPutting team togetherness first was a concept passed down by past Norwegian Alpine luminaries like Lasse Kjus and Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who combined to win 36 Olympic and world championship medals from 1992 to 2004.Svindal, who joined the Norwegian World Cup team directly from the national junior program more than a decade ago, recalled how Kjus and Aamodt pulled him aside shortly after his promotion to explain that the team would always be his home.\u201cThey told me, \u2018This isn\u2019t an N.B.A. team or something like that \u2014 you can\u2019t be traded or sold to another team,\u2019\u201d Svindal said. \u201cWe\u2019re all here for life. Those two guys created a culture of unity, and all we had to do was preserve it.\u201dBut the togetherness extends in ways that would be wholly unfamiliar to an N.B.A. team. On the road, the racers \u2014 national sporting celebrities in Norway \u2014 not only share hotel rooms, they sometimes share hotel beds.\u201cWe don\u2019t often stay in five-star hotels, and single rooms are very rare unless we\u2019re traveling with an odd number of athletes,\u201d said Leif Kristian Nestvold-Haugen, who has been on the team for about a decade. \u201cAnd sometimes our rooms will have two double beds or just one queen bed. So then it\u2019s two guys in the same bed. We don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a big deal.\u201dVisualize, if you can, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant sharing a hotel room on the road \u2014 let alone a bed.Shrugging his shoulders with a grin, Nestvold-Haugen agreed that was unlikely.\u201cMaybe that\u2019s another part of our system that forces people on the team to get along,\u201d he said.Still, everything is not always entirely peaceable.Around the dinner table, it\u2019s a group of alpha males who all want to be the best and think they know the answer to all kinds of things, from skiing to politics to economics, said Nestvold-Haugen, who is ranked 23rd in the World Cup standings. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually have a clue about those things, but we debate them anyway and we disagree,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it never goes farther than that.\u201dFrom May to August, the team \u2014 en masse \u2014 usually conducts the bulk of its off-season strength and conditioning training together in the Oslo area. Other ski teams \u2014 the Americans come to mind \u2014 scatter in the off-season, except for short periods spent at the team\u2019s headquarters in Utah.For parts of two years beginning in 2016, there was a kerfuffle that tested the Norwegian team\u2019s noted harmony. Henrik Kristoffersen, a 23-year-old whose impressive results this season will make him a top contender in the slalom and giant slalom, tangled with Norway\u2019s national federation in a battle over an individual sponsorship agreement. In each season, Kristoffersen eventually joined the team and signed an agreement to abide by its regulations.Those protocols do not officially include things like contributing positively to the social fabric or participating in taco Fridays.\u201cBut definitely, everyone understands those rules,\u201d said Svindal, the 35-year-old team elder.That seems to be working.\u201cI just wanted to win,\u201d Svindal said Thursday afternoon as he sat next to Jansrud at the postrace news conference. \u201cAnd I know he wanted to win.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When Sharp began studying the history of nonviolence, it was seen \u2014 and dismissed \u2014 as a tactic used by saints and pacifists: sitting in front of bulldozers, appealing to the consciences of men with none.Sharp\u2019s major contribution was to demonstrate that nonviolent struggle is not only effective, it\u2019s superior to armed struggle in most circumstances. Nonviolent action is not an appeal to a dictator\u2019s conscience. It is a war, but fought without arms.Every leader, no matter how despotic, relies on the consent of his people. If they withdraw their consent \u2014 stop carrying out orders \u2014 the regime falls.Some groups are vital pillars of governing regimes \u2014 typically the police, the military, political officials and wealthy businessmen. They can also be labor unions, farmers, older people, young people. The job of the resistance is to pull out these pillars from supporting the dictator.Some examples:International sanctions target a dictatorship\u2019s important officials and civilian friends \u2014 and try to persuade them they would be richer under a different government.In Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, the civil rights movement boycotted downtown stores owned by politically influential backers of the city\u2019s segregationist policies, turning them into opponents of those laws.In Serbia, old people provided the critical support for Slobodan Milosevic, who relied on nationalism to keep himself in power after starting four Balkan wars. During his re-election campaign in 2000, the resistance group Otpor figured out how to turn this constituency against him. It had young people provoke the government into jailing them and calling them spies and traitors. This got many a Grandma angry.People have more power than they think.But they are often trapped by their perception of helplessness. \u201cOne must strengthen the oppressed population themselves in their determination, self-confidence and resistance skills,\u201d he wrote in \u201cFrom Dictatorship to Democracy.\u201dNonviolent protest involves more than walking around with a sign. Sharp\u2019s first work, \u201cThe Politics of Nonviolent Action,\u201d a three-volume series published in 1973, lists 198 tactics that movements use. Marches and parades are just two. The other 196 include holding mock awards ceremonies, staying home from work, skywriting, rude gestures, suspending sports matches, performing guerrilla theater, staging work slowdowns \u2014 even withholding sex.The list, of course, does not include tweeting and liking posts on Facebook. It is nevertheless still a thought-provoking source of ideas. (The liberal group MoveOn.org recently use a form of skywriting: It hired a plane to fly a banner over the districts of three California members of Congress during the debate over Trumpcare..)What can the resistance to Trump make of Sharp\u2019s ideas?Don\u2019t just work through institutions. Work around them.The civic protest groups formed since the 2016 election have two goals. Some aim to win elections in 2018. Others aim to influence the vote of members of Congress now. That\u2019s the major work of the several thousand Indivisible groups around the country, for example.This is straightforward. \u201cThe best impact is to use the power of local groups and nonviolent movements to exert pressure in the ways the system was designed to receive pressure,\u201d said Elizabeth Beavers, who covers foreign policy issues for Indivisible.Indivisible modeled its tactics on those of the Tea Party, and they are smart ones: Go in person to see your own member of Congress. Focus on the issue he or she will vote on next.But the strategy has had only limited success. Most members of Congress need not worry about the general election, in part thanks to gerrymandering. But they do worry about a primary challenge \u2014 and Trump remains very popular among Republican primary voters.Sharp, of course, didn\u2019t focus on how to use institutional structures, because dictatorships, by definition, don\u2019t have them. He wrote about how to work outside institutions by building mass social movements.Is that relevant to the United States today? Unlike most of Sharp\u2019s eager readers abroad, Americans have plenty of established avenues for citizens to take power. We just don\u2019t use them.The challenge for any movement in the United States is to get people involved. And one way to do that is to build social movements.Activism begets activism. \u201cAsk who got involved and started a group through the Women\u2019s March,\u201d said Paul Engler, who with his brother, Mark, wrote \u201cThis Is an Uprising.\u201d\u201cA huge portion of activists will raise their hands,\u201d Engler said. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t activated by phone calling. But protests generate more and more energy.\u201dPeople won\u2019t march every week, however. Nor should they. Marches should be saved for extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, we may be facing one soon: the slow-motion assault by Trump and his allies on the Robert Mueller investigation \u2014 a Saturday Night Massacre by drip poisoning.MoveOn.org (together with other groups) is asking people to sign a pledge to march if Trump fires Mueller, replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, or does something else that disables the investigation. It\u2019s smart to pre-organize times and routes, and to warn the administration there will be mass resistance \u2014 although the vast majority of people who will march are unlikely to sign up in advance.A social movement demonstrates commitment and numbers, adding power to the insider strategy. It can produce momentum \u2014 or the illusion of it \u2014 keeping the resistance and its issues in the news. Perhaps most important, it builds habits of participation.\u201cThe opposition has recently shifted to focus on the midterm elections,\u201d said Jamila Raqib, Sharp\u2019s closest colleague and the executive director of the Albert Einstein Institute. \u201cMy reading of Gene\u2019s work is that this is perhaps a missed opportunity\u201d \u2014 the wrong use of this unique moment\u2019s energy. \u201cA lot of people are recognizing they have a role to play in our democracy. This is an opportunity for us all to figure out what that role is to get through this crisis \u2014 and the next one.\u201dThat requires more than the sporadic march. Fortunately, Sharp has 196 other ideas.Diversify and decentralize.People get involved, and stay involved, if they feel useful, competent and valued.Otpor in Serbia recognized this. The group\u2019s leadership decided that people could do anything and call themselves Otpor if they followed two rules. \u201cIf you were anti-Milosevic and nonviolent, you could go naked with \u2018Otpor\u2019 painted on your chest,\u201d said Milja Jovanovic, an Otpor founder.Mark Engler said that Act Up, formerly known as the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, used this strategy well: \u201cThey had a lot of little working groups, which enabled them to be creative.\u201d Its activists draped a giant condom over the house of their nemesis, Senator Jesse Helms. They chained themselves to the New York Stock Exchange to protest the high price of the AIDS drug AZT. Act Up was always doing something \u2014 usually something outrageous and highly photogenic.\u201cThat had a huge role in elevating public awareness about AIDS and keeping it in the public eye and forcing politicians who didn\u2019t want to touch the issue to respond,\u201d Engler said.Act locally. \u201cTrump is such an attention magnet,\u201d said Wikler of MoveOn.org. \u201cHe\u2019s drawn a lot of focus and fear and anxiety toward Washington. But there\u2019s an extraordinary wave of activism across the country.\u201d Wikler\u2019s recommendation \u2014 the recommendation of everyone I spoke to \u2014 was for people to get involved in whatever they cared about. Raise money for the local library or bail fund. Speak out for MeToo or Black Lives Matter. Form a reading group or a walking group.Effective political action isn\u2019t innate. You have to learn it \u2014 and it starts with connecting with your neighbors. \u201cMovements that have been successful paid attention to that institution building and capacity building,\u201d said Raqib. \u201cIn our context, it\u2019s how do we move people from this sense of apathy or helplessness.\u201dSharp\u2019s fundamental takeaway, Wikler said, \u201cis that people power can overcome what seems like intractable odds.\u201d He added: \u201cNot that it always happens \u2014 but it can happen and does happen. In the moment when political power is almost entirely concentrated in hands of people willing to do things that seem ghastly to the majority of Americans, a reminder that public mobilization has overcome even greater odds is a light in the darkness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Companies Cut Ties to the N.R.A., but Find There Is No Neutral Ground", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWithin hours of announcing its decision to end a credit card relationship with the National Rifle Association, the First National Bank of Omaha found itself thrust into the center of the resurgent national gun debate.Its Twitter and Facebook pages were flooded with comments. Some customers applauded the 160-year-old bank\u2019s decision. Others said they would take their business elsewhere.In the aftermath of the deadly school shooting in Florida last week, businesses were making the same financial and moral calculus, quickly discovering that there is no neutral ground. As pressure mounted across various social media platforms on Friday, a number of corporations, including several car-rental companies, MetLife insurance, Symantec security software and the car pricing and information site TrueCar, abruptly announced plans to cut ties with the organization.Over the last couple of years, social media has become the preferred vehicle for the rise of consumer activism, turning the everyday purchase of dresses or shoes or, now, renting a car or buying insurance, into a form of protest or demonstration of ideology.For companies like MetLife that are caught in the middle of these angry social media storms, actions tied to divisive social issues can be a lose-lose proposition. A year ago, Nordstrom first faced calls for a consumer boycott because it carried the Ivanka Trump line of clothing. But it quickly drew another round of boycott cries from the other side of the ideological spectrum when it quietly stopped selling her products.Marketing experts say it\u2019s difficult to determine whether calls for boycotts can truly have an impact on a company\u2019s business. Rather, they say, once-angry customers either forget or move on to the next event or debate.\u201cMemories fade. The intensity of the feelings that people have on this subject right now will feel different one month or five months from now,\u201d said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.And after a gunman used an accessory called a bump stock in a mass shooting in Las Vegas last October, two retailers, Walmart and the outdoors store Cabela\u2019s, removed the products from their websites.But in the days since the Florida school shooting, the push for boycotts and meaningful change has mobilized faster than with previous mass shootings. Professor Schweitzer noted that reflected the fact that the survivors are teenagers who are well versed in the usage and power of social media.Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.Leading retailers including Cabela\u2019s, Walmart and Bass Pro Shops also came under renewed boycott calls on Twitter for selling guns or sponsoring N.R.A. events. The retailers did not respond to emails seeking comment.\u201cNorth American and Allied Van Lines no longer have an affiliate relationship with the N.R.A. effective immediately,\u2019\u2019 the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have asked them to remove our listing from their benefits site.\u201dEven companies that do not have ties to the N.R.A. nevertheless rushed to distance themselves from the group. Wyndham Hotels said in a statement that it ended its relationship with the trade group in late 2017. Best Western Hotels & Resorts tweeted to dozens of customers that it \u201cdoes not have an affiliation with and is not a corporate partner\u201d of the N.R.A.With lists of companies circulating widely, Facebook users swarmed the profiles of Avis, MetLife and others, announcing their plans to end their patronage and switch to competitors.Rob Bradford, a designer who travels frequently, said Friday morning he would take the $600 he spends each year renting vehicles from Avis to competing rental companies if Avis did not disavow the N.R.A.\u201cI know that boycotts work, especially in the age of social media,\u201d he said. \u201cI will go out of my way to avoid businesses associated with that group even if that means spending more money.\u201dBy Friday afternoon, Avis Budget Group, which owns the car rental companies Avis and Budget, said it had decided to end its discount partnership with the N.R.A., effective on March 26, according to a representative.Late Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, which calls itself the largest privately owned bank holding company in the country, said that it would not renew its contract with the trade group to issue an N.R.A.-branded credit card.The card had been advertised as \u201cthe official credit card of the N.R.A.,\u201d and cardholders were offered a $40 credit with their first purchase.But the move drew strong, even extreme, reaction on the bank\u2019s Facebook page.\u201cYou are doing the right thing by dropping the NRA,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cThey are a hate group with blood on their hands. Thank you for walking away from them.\u201dBut the opposing viewpoint was evident as well. \u201cI discontinued my account with you last night for discontinuing the relationship with the NRA,\u201d another user wrote. \u201cI will encourage all NRA members and gun supporters to do the same. There are 100 million gun owners and 5 million NRA members. Good luck.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As F.B.I. Took a Year to Pursue the Nassar Case, Dozens Say They Were Molested", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than a year, an F.B.I. inquiry into allegations that Lawrence G. Nassar, a respected sports doctor, had molested three elite teenage gymnasts followed a plodding pace as it moved back and forth among agents in three cities. The accumulating information included instructional videos of the doctor\u2019s unusual treatment methods, showing his ungloved hands working about the private areas of girls lying facedown on tables.But as the inquiry moved with little evident urgency, a cost was being paid. The New York Times has identified at least 40 girls and women who say that Dr. Nassar molested them between July 2015, when he first fell under F.B.I. scrutiny, and September 2016, when he was exposed by an Indianapolis Star investigation. Some are among the youngest of the now-convicted predator\u2019s many accusers \u2014 265, and counting.The three alleged victims then at the center of the F.B.I.\u2019s inquiry were world-class athletes; two were Olympic gold medalists. Nearly a year passed before agents interviewed two of the young women.The silence at times drove the victims and their families to distraction, including Gina Nichols, the mother of the gymnast initially known as \u201cAthlete A\u201d: Maggie Nichols, who was not contacted by the F.B.I. for nearly 11 months after the information she provided sparked the federal inquiry.\u201cI never got a phone call from the police or the F.B.I.\u201d during that time, Gina Nichols, a registered nurse, said. \u201cNot one person. Not one. Not one. Not one.\u201dThe F.B.I. declined to answer detailed questions about the speed and nature of its investigation, or to provide an official who might put the case in context. Instead, it issued a 112-word statement asserting that the sexual exploitation of children \u201cis an especially heinous crime,\u201d and that \u201cthe safety and well-being of our youth is a top priority for the F.B.I.\u201dThe statement also said that the many allegations against Dr. Nassar \u201ctranscended jurisdictions\u201d \u2014 an apparent suggestion that internal efforts to coordinate among its bureaus and with other law enforcement agencies partly explained the inquiry\u2019s slow tempo.The agency left unaddressed the oft-repeated claim by U.S.A. Gymnastics officials that after initially presenting the sexual assault allegations to the F.B.I. in July 2015, they came away with the impression that federal agents had advised them not to discuss the case with anyone. The ensuing silence had dire consequences, as the many girls and young women still seeing Dr. Nassar received no warning.Among them was Emma Ann Miller.By the summer of 2015, Emma Ann, the only child of a single mother, was both a competitive dancer and just another Michigan kid immersed in the joys and dramas of middle school life. She got braces, with baby blue rubber bands that matched her eyes. She began receiving Snapchat attention from boys.And once a month, she went to Suite 420 in a six-story office building close to Michigan State University in East Lansing, where her solicitous doctor, who encouraged everyone to just call him Larry, molested her.According to her lawyer, Emma Ann had about a dozen sessions with Dr. Nassar between the summers of 2015 and 2016. The pain of the procedures increased, and her self-confidence plummeted.\u201cWhenever he asked if my lower back hurt, he would always find a way to touch me down there,\u201d she said, explaining that Dr. Nassar would say that her pelvis was in need of adjustment. \u201cWhether or not I said my back hurt, he would always find a way to, to. \u2026\u201dThe young girl paused.\u201cI think I\u2019ve blocked out a lot of what he did to me,\u201d she said finally.Only three years ago, Dr. Nassar was a popular doctor among the athletes he treated for U.S.A. Gymnastics, known for being goofy but maybe a bit too attentive. His treatments, which gymnastics officials believed were at the cutting edge, were also in demand at Michigan State, where he worked, as well as at Holt High School, and at a gymnastics academy called Twistars.Issues had cropped up: a parent raising concerns about his behavior at Twistars; a female athlete or two at Michigan State complaining to no avail about inappropriate exams. In 2014, a university investigation of another complaint cleared Dr. Nassar of misconduct, but he was now required to have a third person present when treatment involved sensitive areas of the body \u2014 and to wear gloves.Still, the doctor was trusted enough to conduct his procedures \u2014 including one called \u201cintravaginal adjustment\u201d \u2014 without supervision when treating the country\u2019s best gymnasts at the Karolyi ranch, the exclusive and secluded national team training camp, about 60 miles north of Houston. Gymnasts of international caliber, like Ms. Nichols, of suburban Minneapolis, would spend a week each month at the ranch, under the exacting supervision of the revered coach Martha Karolyi.But at the ranch in late spring of 2015, Ms. Nichols\u2019s personal coach, Sarah Jantzi, overheard the 17-year-old girl talking with another elite gymnast, Aly Raisman, about Dr. Nassar\u2019s invasive and inappropriate techniques. The alarming information was quickly shared with the girls\u2019 parents and, by June 17, with officials at U.S.A. Gymnastics.Gina Nichols, Maggie\u2019s mother, recalled telling Steve Penny, then the president of U.S.A. Gymnastics, that the police had to be called immediately. But he insisted that she not tell anyone, she said. The organization would take care of alerting law enforcement.Weeks of silence passed, Gina Nichols said, interrupted occasionally by admonitions from Mr. Penny to keep quiet about the matter \u2014 although the United States Olympic Committee has said that U.S.A. Gymnastics reported that one of its physicians had been accused of abusing athletes \u201cand was in the process of contacting the appropriate law enforcement authorities.\u201dU.S.A. Gymnastics eventually retained what it called \u201can experienced female investigator\u201d \u2014 a specialist in workplace harassment. After completing her interviews, the investigator recommended on Friday, July 24, that Dr. Nassar be reported to law enforcement.Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman competed the next day at the U.S. Classic in Chicago. Gina Nichols said that she saw Mr. Penny at the event and that he told her: We\u2019re working on this. Keep it quiet.On Monday, July 27, gymnastics officials contacted the F.B.I. in Indianapolis, where U.S.A. Gymnastics has its headquarters. The next day, its chairman, Paul Parilla, and its president, Mr. Penny, met with F.B.I. agents who, they later said, assured them they had come to the right place. Forty-one days had passed since U.S.A. Gymnastics first received the report of the sexual abuse of one of its charges.At this moment, F.B.I. agents in Indianapolis were also immersed in the child-exploitation case of Jared Fogle, the longtime pitchman on Subway television ads. Mr. Fogle was arrested that summer on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child and distribution of child pornography, and later sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison.The gymnastics officials provided the agents with contact information for three gymnasts: Ms. Nichols, Ms. Raisman and someone emerging as the central complainant: McKayla Maroney, then 19, a retired Olympic gold medalist who by the summer of 2015 had become a minor celebrity, struggling in public to find her next purpose in life \u2014 a struggle she has since indicated was related to serious emotional issues stemming from the abuse.They also turned over copies of videos of Dr. Nassar demonstrating his technique as he chatted clinically about pulled hamstrings, buttocks and trigger points. Reporters for The New York Times have seen the videos, which show him kneading the legs of girls before his ungloved hands begin to work under a towel, between the girls\u2019 legs.\u201cIt\u2019s not a fun place to dig,\u201d Dr. Nassar says to the camera.\u201cDo the hand-shaky thing,\u201d he adds later, demonstrating how he shakes his hand vigorously when it is deep between a girl\u2019s legs.W. Jay Abbott, who at the time was the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. bureau in Indianapolis, said on Thursday that while he did not watch the videos, he vividly remembered the reactions of colleagues who had.\u201cI will never forget sitting around the table and thinking, What?\u201d said Mr. Abbott, who retired in January. \u201cAnd the reaction of my special agents who were very well versed in this was one of disgust. That is why we worked it with such urgency.\u201dHe added: \u201cAt the time, it was being portrayed as a legitimate medical procedure. But to the layman, like ourselves, we were \u2014 \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u2019\u201dThe next day, U.S.A. Gymnastics quietly, even surreptitiously, relieved Dr. Nassar of any further assignments. It later issued a statement saying: \u201cU.S.A. Gymnastics understood from its meeting with the F.B.I. that it should not take any action nor communicate anything that might interfere with the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation.\u201dAll the while, Dr. Nassar continued his uncommon treatment techniques on young patients.Emma Ann Miller remembers the summer of 2015 as her \u201cbest summer ever.\u201dShe competed in a dance competition in Las Vegas, where she performed to a song from \u201cLegally Blonde,\u201d and won a trophy that was two and a half feet tall \u2014 about half her height. She spent time at a sleep-away Bible camp, where she went kayaking, horseback riding and zip-lining, and had water balloon fights.\u201cWe T.P.\u2019ed the boys\u2019 cabin down the hill and had a Silly String fight with two of the other girls\u2019 cabins,\u201d Emma Ann said with a laugh. \u201cSomeone threw a frog into one of the girls\u2019 cabins. It was so much fun.\u201dBut then there were those monthly visits to the office of Dr. Nassar \u2014 doctor to \u201call of these super-high-up Olympians\u201d \u2014 who had treated her mother for years for injuries related to a car accident. Given that Emma Ann had known him her entire life, he was almost like family, an intimacy reflected in the half-dozen photographs of her that he displayed in his treatment room.Dr. Nassar first molested her when she was 10, she recalled. She remembered the pants she was wearing \u2014 black leggings with white flowers, from A\u00e9ropostale. She was having back and neck issues, and he had her remove the leggings and put on loose shorts. In a medical supply room that doubled as a treatment room, he began exploring \u201cdown there.\u201d\u201cHe was like, \u2018Is this O.K.?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018Just hang in there.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know how it felt. I just knew that it hurt.\u201dIn the summer of 2015, the treatments hurt even more. She had tried wearing three pairs of underpants or especially tight shorts \u2014 anything to keep Dr. Nassar\u2019s fingers from probing her. Now that she was older, she began lying that she was having her period.At some point, Emma Ann told her mother that she preferred not to be alone with Dr. Nassar. That did not end it. She said he continued to abuse her while positioning himself so that her mother couldn\u2019t see what he was doing. He would grope the girl beneath a white towel meant to convey propriety, all the while chatting with her mother, a kindergarten teacher.How\u2019s your class going?\u201cI knew that he had helped my mom, so I had to persuade myself into thinking that he also helped me,\u201d Emma Ann said. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t really sure.\u201dEmma Ann now knows that she was not alone. The growing number of other girls who say they were being molested between the summers of 2015 and 2016 includes Alexis Alvarado, 19, who began seeing Dr. Nassar in 2010 for a stress fracture in her back. He began that treatment by massaging her legs, but then his hands crept up until, she said, his fingers were inside her. She was 12.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize what he was doing was wrong,\u201d Ms. Alvarado said. But she explained that he \u201cthought everything could be fixed through the butt.\u201d That is why her gymnastics teammates in Lansing, Mich., called him the \u201cbutt doctor.\u201dThe monthly appointments continued through the summer of 2015 and into the next year. So did her shame, and dread.The same was true for Hannah Morrow, of Naperville, Ill., who will turn 18 on Tuesday. Several times a year, starting when she was 11 or 12, she took the four-hour car ride to see Dr. Nassar, looping around the bottom coast of Lake Michigan. At some point, she started listening to playlists she compiled to help keep her mind off what was about to be done to her.She\u2019d try to get hooked on a new song to sing in her head, over and over. Her favorite, \u201cI Write Sins Not Tragedies\u201d by Panic! At the Disco, included the line: \u201cIt\u2019s much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.\u201dAs with Emma Ann Miller, Hannah also began wearing tighter pants and underwear that covered more of her buttocks, in the unrealized hope that it would dissuade him. She struggled to reconcile his outsize reputation with what he was doing.\u201cIf all of those Olympians loved him, there\u2019s nothing wrong,\u201d Hannah remembered thinking. \u201cEven though I feel weird with what he\u2019s doing, I guess I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d make excuses: He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s too close to my butt, or that he brushed over my boobs.\u201dIn late July or early August, F.B.I. agents asked Ms. Maroney to travel to Indianapolis from her home in California to discuss the allegation, according to her lawyer, John Manly, but she declined. It is unclear why an agent did not travel to see her in person. As a result, the first substantive interview of an alleged victim in a child-molestation case was conducted by telephone.Meanwhile, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Raisman continued their gymnastics pursuits \u2014 both competed at the P & G Championships in Indianapolis \u2014 but they still had received no word from any law enforcement official about the allegations now lodged with the F.B.I.Some of the delay appears to have been related to questions concerning federal-versus-state jurisdiction, as well as jurisdiction within the F.B.I. itself. Although the Indianapolis bureau had received the information, the alleged sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar had taken place in Texas, at the Karolyi ranch, and in Michigan, where he lived and worked. And Ms. Maroney lived in California.According to Mr. Abbott, his agents in Indianapolis did not have the case for long. \u201cWhen we consulted with the U.S. attorney, we knew right away that we would not have venue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was never really our case.\u201dMr. Abbott said that his agents conducted some interviews, but he declined to say with whom. He also said written reports were sent within weeks to F.B.I. offices in Michigan and Los Angeles.The retired agent emphasized how the sensitivities and difficulties of child-exploitation cases can contribute to the length of investigations. \u201cYou are dealing with victims who sometimes don\u2019t want to be interviewed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is extremely delicate. And you also have the parents of minors who are sometimes not comfortable with interviews.\u201dAsked why federal law enforcement officials did not notify people \u2014 other gymnasts, parents, coaches \u2014 that a potential child molester was in their midst, Mr. Abbott said, \u201cThat\u2019s where things can get tricky.\u201d\u201cThere is a duty to warn those who might be harmed in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everyone is still trying to ascertain whether a crime has been committed. And everybody has rights here\u201d \u2014 a reference to both the alleged victims and the person being accused.The Nassar case might have been further complicated, he said, by the fact that \u201cthere was a vigorous debate going on about whether this was a legitimate medical procedure.\u201dU.S.A. Gymnastics officials said that around this time they were told that pertinent interviews had been completed and that the case had been transferred to another jurisdiction. Indeed, on Sept. 12, Ms. Maroney was directed by U.S.A. Gymnastics to contact the F.B.I. East Lansing office.According to Mr. Manly, the retired gymnast\u2019s mother, Erin Maroney, \u201ccalled repeatedly,\u201d but received no follow-up response.Two weeks later, on Sept. 27, Dr. Nassar announced on Facebook that he was retiring from the women\u2019s national team staff, notwithstanding a note he had posted in late June saying he would remain with the team through the summer of 2016.He did not elaborate.In April 2016, Ms. Raisman shared a gold medal with the national team at the Pacific Rim Championships in Seattle, while Ms. Nichols damaged a knee during training, underwent surgery, and was out for several weeks \u2014 a reminder of the physical toll of the sport. Meanwhile, neither she nor her parents heard anything about the federal investigation that U.S.A. Gymnastics had instructed them to remain silent about.The Raisman family was similarly frustrated. According to a person close to the family, Ms. Raisman and her mother, Lynn, repeatedly reached out to Mr. Penny to find out about the status of the federal investigation, only to be told that an F.B.I. agent would be getting in touch with them.Finally, the absence of information about the federal investigation \u2014 and the increasing concern of the victims and their families \u2014 prompted Mr. Penny and Mr. Parilla, the U.S.A. Gymnastics officials, to visit the F.B.I.\u2019s Los Angeles bureau in early May. Mr. Parilla lives in Southern California, as does Ms. Maroney, and Mr. Penny stopped in Los Angeles while returning from an overseas trip.\u201cAs time passed, concern about a perceived lack of development prompted Board Chair Paul Parilla and C.E.O. Steve Penny to report the matter a second time to a different F.B.I. office,\u201d U.S.A. Gymnastics said in a statement to The Times on Friday.Through a lawyer and a spokeswoman, Mr. Parilla and Mr. Penny declined to be interviewed for this article.The visit appears to have jump-started the federal investigation into Dr. Nassar. Agents asked for more information, including a list of the members of the national women\u2019s gymnastics team. And on May 17, the F.B.I. finally interviewed Ms. Maroney in person.It had been 294 days since the F.B.I. was first notified of accusations against Dr. Nassar.A few weeks later, on June 13, Gina Nichols received an email from Michael Hess, an F.B.I. agent then based in Los Angeles. \u201cI am looking into a complaint that was filed involving alleged misconduct by an individual associated with U.S.A. Gymnastics,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen you have a moment, please give me a call at the below numbers.\u201dIt was a stressful time: Her daughter was preparing for the Olympic trials. But several days later, the gymnast went to a suburban Minneapolis building, not far from her home, to meet Mr. Hess, who had flown in from Los Angeles.In addition, a person close to the Raisman family said that the F.B.I. also contacted Ms. Raisman in the summer of 2016. While Mr. Manly \u2014 who represents Ms. Raisman, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Maroney \u2014 applauded the diligence of Mr. Hess, he expressed amazement that so little had been done for so long.\u201cGiven who these women were, all competing for their country, and given that these assaults had occurred in different states and countries, there was an obvious need to have a multilayered, multijurisdictional investigation,\u201d Mr. Manly said.Gina Nichols, who had been instructed by U.S.A. Gymnastics not to talk about the matter, recalled that while venting in a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Hess, the agent told her:You can talk to anybody you want.That August, in Rio de Janeiro, Ms. Raisman had an Olympics for the ages, demonstrating poise and leadership as she won three medals, including gold. But Ms. Nichols, returning from her knee injury, was ultimately not invited to join the Olympic team \u2014 even as an alternate.Meanwhile, Emma Ann Miller continued to keep her treatment appointments with Dr. Nassar. But the abuse had worsened, and she no longer felt like the bubbly teenager she had been only a year before. She stopped taking selfies because she felt ugly and fat. She\u2019d cry if she received an A-minus on a paper or test, thinking it was evidence of her stupidity.\u201cI didn\u2019t even want to order a drink at Starbucks because I was so scared I\u2019d mess it up,\u201d Emma Ann said.Her mother, Leslie Miller, struggles now with her rage. \u201cLook at what he did to my happy girl,\u201d Ms. Miller said, in tears. \u201cLook at all the people who could\u2019ve stopped him earlier. My goal is to find every single one of them in the haystack \u2014 expose them all, so this will never happen again.\u201dIt was only a matter of time.On Sept. 12, 2016, The Indianapolis Star published an in-depth investigation detailing allegations that Dr. Nassar had repeatedly molested two gymnasts when they were young. One woman had filed a criminal complaint with the police in Michigan. The other, initially described only as an Olympic medalist, had filed a lawsuit against the doctor and U.S.A. Gymnastics in California. Neither was involved in the F.B.I. inquiry.Suddenly, the Nassar case took on urgency. As other girls and women began calling the Michigan State University Police to file complaints, their numbers eventually growing into the dozens, their abuser did what he could to mask his behavior, including throwing hard drives containing more than 37,000 images and videos of child pornography into the trash for pickup in the morning.But trash pickup in his neighborhood was late that day, allowing a police officer to find the horrifying material while executing a search warrant on behalf of the university police.By the close of 2016, Dr. Nassar was in custody. By the close of 2017, he had been convicted of myriad state charges, as well as federal child pornography charges, based in large part on that state search warrant. Given that he has been sentenced to nearly two centuries in prison, Dr. Nassar will likely die there.In recent weeks, a communal catharsis has played out, as dozens and dozens of empowered victims or their proxies have confronted the doctor at sentencing hearings. The angry but resolute words of Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols have echoed in the courtrooms of Michigan.So, too, have the words of the lesser-known accusers, those girls and young women who report they were abused in the year after allegations were first presented to the F.B.I. in Indianapolis: the likes of Alexis Alvarado and Hannah Morrow \u2014 and Emma Ann Miller, who in November turned 15.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Holt High School. Lawrence G. Nassar did work there, but it is not his alma mater. An earlier version of this article also misstated the number of medals Aly Raisman won at the Rio Olympics. It was three, not six (she has six Olympic medals over all).Susan C. Beachy, Elisa Cho and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

How does this line set the tone for, and introduce the subject of, the rest of the book?3. The first character we meet is Mollie Burkhart, whose family becomes a main target of the Osage murders. How does Grann signal to us early on what the murderer may be after?Week Two4. Grann describes the discovery of oil on Osage land as a \u201ccursed blessing.\u201d How do you think it\u2019s a blessing, and how is it a curse?5. How trustworthy do you find the different authorities that appear throughout the book to investigate the murders? Authorities such as William Hale, who Grann initially describes as a \u201cpowerful local advocate for law and order,\u201d as well as the frontier lawmen, the brothers who conduct autopsies of the bodies, the local sheriff and, later, the F.B.I.?6.

{"Headline": "What Makes Public Radio \u2018Very Personal\u2019 Magnifies Its #MeToo Cases", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf all the realms of media that have been shaken by the #MeToo movement, perhaps the most surprising has been public radio, the home of virtuous journalism and thoughtful, warm-voiced commentary.Like Fox News, Vice Media and NBC News, the tweedy world of public broadcasting \u2014 a complex ecosystem of local stations and national syndicators, with NPR at the center \u2014 has seen some of its most popular figures fall in recent months, including Garrison Keillor, Leonard Lopate, Jonathan Schwartz and John Hockenberry.As a result, station schedules around the country have been remade, and listeners have gotten a glimpse at the sometimes startling working conditions that are not picked up by the microphone on their favorite shows. According to accusations by these organizations, and reporting by some of their journalists, this includes a range of behavior from inappropriate comments to unwanted kissing and touching.\u201cThe relationships that people have with the presenters and reporters on NPR feels very personal,\u201d said Vivian Schiller, a former chief executive of NPR who has also held senior positions at Twitter, The New York Times and elsewhere.\u201cPeople make assumptions about who these people are based on their voice and what feels like an intimate, one-on-one relationship,\u201d Ms. Schiller added, \u201cso the potential for backlash is that much greater if you feel that you have been betrayed.\u201dIn some cases, the behavior they are accused of has been recounted in detail, though rarely by the management of the institutions they worked for. Jon McTaggart, the president of Minnesota Public Radio, disclosed some details of its review of Mr. Keillor\u2019s case at the same time that journalists there published their report.\u201cIf I am guilty of harassment,\u201d Mr. Keillor said, \u201cthen every employee who stole a pencil is guilty of embezzlement.\u201dMost of the accusations of harassment and improper behavior have been made against men in their 60s and 70s. That perhaps exacerbates an already present generational divide in public radio, where a younger generation of practitioners is being increasingly drawn to the freedom offered by other audio formats like podcasting.\u201cThe public radio environment is bursting at the seams with younger media makers who have embraced formats like podcasting as their primary means of expression,\u201d said Matthew Lasar, the author of \u201cRadio 2.0: Uploading the First Broadcast Medium.\u201d \u201cA new public radio world is emerging, and, intentionally or not, these difficult and painful changes feel like part of that transition.\u201dIn an email, Mr. Lopate declined to comment on the specifics of his situation, but said: \u201cI will say that in my case I still haven\u2019t been given a cause for dismissal and my alleged misdeeds are so negligible, I suspect the station saw the #MeToo environment as a convenient time to make a programming decision.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Schwartz said he had no comment.Whether such departures will affect fund-raising from listeners \u2014 usually a station\u2019s largest source of income \u2014 may soon become clear. Mike Savage, a veteran of public radio and a former NPR board member who now works as a consultant, said he had heard largely positive reports from stations around the country about fund-raising and membership.\u201cI don\u2019t think listeners view these acts as a problem with the quality of journalism or with these organizations themselves,\u201d Mr. Savage said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bump in the road.\u201dWNYC held a one-day pledge drive in late December, after Mr. Lopate and Mr. Schwartz were fired, and the station had its hosts address the controversy and promise transparency. The station declined to disclose the full results of that drive, though it said last week that listener donations in December and January were up 11.5 percent from the same period a year before.In December, 577 people canceled their memberships and cited the news about Mr. Lopate and Mr. Schwartz as the reason \u2014 out of a total of 247,000 members, according to the station.The station will begin its full five-day pledge drive on Feb. 26. Anne O\u2019Malley, the vice president of membership of New York Public Radio, said in a recent interview that it had not decided yet whether to address these issues as part of the drive, as the station had in December.\u201cIt would be disingenuous to say that it\u2019s not something we\u2019re thinking about,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Malley said. \u201cBut so far, we haven\u2019t changed the pledge drive goal, and we haven\u2019t changed our plans.\u201dNew York Public Radio had $93 million in revenue for the year that ended in June, with 39 percent of that coming from member contributions and 33 percent from corporate underwriting, according to publicly disclosed finances.Of course, New York Public Radio is just one part of the wider public radio universe, which also reaches into rural pockets of the country far from the media hubs of New York and Washington. In those places, the local public station may serve as a vital news source, but the success of its pledge drives may depend on other factors, said Mark Vogelzang, the president of Maine Public, which presents radio and television.\u201cUp here in Maine,\u201d Mr. Vogelzang said, \u201cdigging out from a big snowstorm probably has more of an effect on pledge drive participation than Garrison Keillor.\u201dA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated where Garrison Keillor was when the picture was taken. He was in a studio in St. Paul, Minn., but it was not a Minnesota Public Radio studio.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mexico Spyware Inquiry Bogs Down. Skeptics Aren\u2019t Surprised.", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 American officials have rebuffed repeated requests from Mexico to help investigate the use of government spying technology against innocent civilians, wary that Mexico wants to use the United States as cover in a sham inquiry, senior American officials say.The Mexican government has been on the defensive for months, battling revelations that surveillance technology it acquired has been used to spy on some of the nation\u2019s most prominent human rights lawyers, academics and journalists.But after reviewing the request, American officials decided not to get involved, leery that the Mexican government had little interest in actually solving the case because a serious investigation might implicate some of its most powerful figures, senior American officials said.In particular, American officials were worried that the Mexicans would try to trumpet the involvement of the United States to lend an appearance of credibility to a whitewash, the officials said.After it became clear that the technology had been used much more broadly than that, the Mexicans sent a list of questions to American law enforcement officials to show their seriousness about investigating.But the questions required no more than a basic computer science degree to answer, one American official said. The Mexican government \u2014 which operated the surveillance technology itself \u2014 was more than capable of solving the case on its own if it wanted to, the official said.The F.B.I. declined to comment.There are many potential reasons Mexican officials, if they were serious about investigating, might want American help, even if they did not necessarily need it. The Mexican public is deeply suspicious of its government, so the participation of American law enforcement officials could help build trust in the findings.But more than six months after the investigation was announced, some of the American concerns appear to be bearing out, according to victims of the spying and their lawyers, who have had access to the case files.The government inquiry has failed to make headway in many basic areas, they contend. Prosecutors handling the case have yet to question any of the officials responsible for operating the surveillance technology, according to the victims\u2019 lawyers and their review of the case file.The Mexican government declined to offer specific comments on the investigation but said it remains \u201cin the phase of exhausting different lines of investigation.\u201d It also said that it had been in constant contact with the group of forensic analysts that first discovered the existence of the spyware, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs, and that it had sought counsel from other national and international experts.The Citizen Lab seemed taken aback by the assertion.\u201cThat\u2019s a surprising statement, given that we have had exactly one meeting with them and have received no further follow-up,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher there. He said the Citizen Lab answered the government\u2019s questions at that meeting, in October, and even suggested a list of evidence to preserve for the investigation.The spying software, known as Pegasus, infiltrates smartphones to monitor every detail of a person\u2019s cellular life \u2014 calls, texts, email, contacts and calendars. It can even use the microphone and camera on phones for surveillance, turning a target\u2019s smartphone into a personal bug.But investigators have not even identified the government employees who operate the technology, or visited the offices where the spying operation was conducted, according to interviews with the victims and their lawyers and the the case files.Prosecutors have for now also declined to examine the servers used by the officials who operated the spying technology, according to the case files and the lawyers. Those servers, according to cyber-forensic analysts and the Israeli manufacturers of the spyware, would contain a record of every attempted hack on every single target.\u201cIt is highly likely that the political actors who were using this software are now keeping this investigation from making any progress at all,\u201d said Mario Ignacio \u00c1lvarez, a former deputy at the nation\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cThis is still a country where it is better to pray to the Virgin of Guadalupe for justice than to the authorities.\u201dThat is not to say that the case file is empty. It already stands several feet tall, stacked with sheaths of documents. But they are often as pointless as they are copious, lawyers for the victims of the spying contend.Investigators have included printouts of basic Google searches related to the case, including some of the victims\u2019 Facebook pages. And the bulk of the file is dedicated to the rolling responses from about 2,000 municipalities that were asked by prosecutors if they possessed the software. The requests include townships of fewer than 500 people with annual budgets that are a fraction of the roughly $80 million that the Mexican government spent to purchase the surveillance system.\u201cOnce more we have entered into a bureaucratic labyrinth that will take us nowhere,\u201d said Leopoldo Maldonado, a lawyer for a journalist protection group, Article 19, which is representing several victims in the case. \u201cThis is not a serious investigation.\u201dOne of the documents contained in the case file, according to those who have reviewed it, is an admission by the nation\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office that it purchased the software. But the prosecutors assigned to solving the case are employed by the attorney general\u2019s office \u2014 offering little hope to the spying victims that the agency will vigorously investigate itself.\u201cWe knew from the beginning that it would be very hard to have a real investigation, but this is a clear demonstration of the lack of an independent system in Mexico,\u201d said Carmen Aristegui, one of Mexico\u2019s most renowned journalists, who endured dozens of hacking attempts using the Pegasus spyware. \u201cWe are the political targets of a government that combats its critics with illegal tools.\u201dLawyers for the victims have taken the government to court, hoping to force a more thorough inquiry.In written responses to the suit, prosecutors say they are waiting for the opportune moment to review the servers and question participants in the hacking program, but have not refused outright to do so.They also claim that the cutting-edge malware does not allow them to track the targets, according to documents in the case file. \u201cThe software has no reporting function that offers a registry of numbers that might have been intercepted,\u201d according to the file.But this is at odds with the description of the spyware given to The Times last year by its manufacturer, the NSO Group. Officials at the company said the contracts were based on a specific number of spying targets, and that the system installed on site at the government agency tracked every time it was used.Even critics accustomed to the Kabuki dance of independent investigations in Mexico, where officials publicly promise to root out corruption but do little to punish the culprits, have expressed surprise. To some, the lack of an investigation is almost as worrisome as the spying itself.Prosecutors insist they need the phones of the spying victims to proceed with their investigation.But forensic experts \u2014 as well as victims of the spyware in Panama, where the former president has been charged with illegal espionage \u2014 say the target\u2019s phone is unnecessary to conduct an inquiry. The servers, they say, are all that is really required.One of the most glaring omissions in the file, the victims\u2019 lawyers say, is the contract that the Attorney General\u2019s office signed with the software manufacturer. While some of that and other material is secret for reasons of national security, the government says, there are other leads that prosecutors appear to have ignored.For instance, they have not questioned the individual in charge of the division that used the spyware, Tom\u00e1s Zer\u00f3n, a close ally of the president, according to the case files and the lawyers. The office, known as the Criminal Investigation Agency, was run by Mr. Zeron at the time of the hacking.Mr. Zer\u00f3n, through an aide, declined to comment.Independent groups, meanwhile, appear to be making some progress in unearthing details about the purchase of the software.This month, the group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity said it had discovered a link between an individual who was working for the Attorney General\u2019s office and the company that sold the software to the law enforcement agency.Salvador Camarena, an investigative editor with Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity, whose team has been looking into the companies associated with the sale, was himself a target of spying. But unlike other victims, he chose not to file a complaint with the government.\u201cI saw it as a waste of time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy on earth would they want to investigate themselves?\u201dBut in recent weeks, Mr. Camarena decided to file a complaint to review what the government had done.\u201cIt was journalistic curiosity,\u201d he said, \u201cto see what I could find out about who targeted me.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A tale of three tech companies earnings.\u2022 CBS and Viacom are talking about getting back together.\u2022 A shake-up in Airbnb\u2019s C-suite\u2022 Why Europe matters for Facebook.\u2022 Regulators are worried that Bitcoin\u2019s price is being manipulated.\u2022 Jeff Immelt has gone from C.E.O. to V.C.\u2022 And when will Congress raise the debt ceiling?Apple reported record profit and sales, Amazon easily beat expectations, and Google-parent Alphabet posted a loss because of the new tax law.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:Apple\u2022 $61.6 billion \u2014 Revenue from iPhone sales, up 13 percent from a year earlier.Critics CornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:\u201cApple has long followed Mies van der Rohe\u2019s design precept that \u201cless is more.\u201d Now it\u2019s doing the same financially. The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge. But that\u2019s OK \u2013 persuading customers to pay more arguably requires as much genius as getting people to adopt the technology in the first place.\u201dAmazonCritics cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:Amazon.com is going gangbusters. But some of the nearly $700 billion internet retailer\u2019s fastest-expanding \u2013 and most profitable \u2013 businesses could be ones that irritate users. Over time, that could sully the company\u2019s image.AlphabetCritics cornerJennifer Saba of Breakingviews:Alphabet is stuck at the letter G. The holding company of Google was created to safeguard against conventionality and let moonshot ideas, like self-driving cars, flourish. Almost three years in, it\u2019s basically still just Google. Which means, in turn, that the A in Alphabet stands mainly for advertising.It wouldn\u2019t hurt Alphabet to put more energy into revenue sources that don\u2019t start with a G.Why now\u2022 Walt Disney\u2019s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.Critics cornerTara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly:\u201cCBS isn\u2019t safe from the industry\u2019s broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom won\u2019t provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities. Those synergies may amount to some $500 million based on what past deals have yielded, according to Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. That could create quite a lift for CBS\u2019s earnings.\u201dBelinda Johnson is moving up. Laurence Tosi is moving out. And don\u2019t expect the company to go public this year.Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company\u2019s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis.Between the linesThe context The company lineHere\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson:\u201cShe takes critical functions that might be seen as constraints in other companies, and clears a path so they can become competitive advantages and facilitate the growth of the business.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies:\u201cHaving worked with Belinda over the years and at Airbnb, I have been consistently impressed by her ability to anticipate issues and leverage strategic opportunities. She combines technical expertise with great care for her colleagues.\u201dAnd here\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi:\u201cHe helped Airbnb establish a rigorous financial discipline, aided our expansion into new businesses including into luxury rentals, which is now one of our core businesses, and helped us develop new and innovative ways to grow Airbnb and our businesses.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSome of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook.Facebook\u2019s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe.The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook\u2019s future growth. The company\u2019s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe\u2019s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States\u2019, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.That\u2019s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin\u2019s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg.The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday.More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex.\u201cThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,\u201d said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. \u201cIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.\u201dThe digital money flyaroundDetails, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point.The contextWhile a potential joint venture between Alphabet and Aramco isn\u2019t necessarily connected to the latter company\u2019s IPO, if a deal is struck before the offering, advisers to the company could pitch the pact as a way for investors to bake in technology valuations.It isn\u2019t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company \u2014 and therefore command a higher multiple \u2014 but it\u2019d be interesting to see bankers make that argument.\u2014 Stephen GrocerFrom the release:\u201cI am excited to join NEA because they understand how to work with visionary entrepreneurs to build successful technology and health care enterprises,\u201d Immelt said. \u201cI have a passion for these sectors and I am eager to work with NEA and its partners to develop great businesses, nurture talented leaders and grow diverse teams.\u201dand:\u201cJeff is deeply knowledgeable about the complex global innovation landscape we\u2019re operating in today and he understands how businesses must evolve to compete and win in that environment, particularly across industrial and medical technologies,\u201d said Scott Sandell, Managing General Partner, NEA.(Worth noting: Mr. Immelt\u2019s successor at G.E. is struggling to turn that company around. See below.)\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s where our colleague Peter Eavis says investors should focus:Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Today\u2019s a big day for tech earningsThe Treasury secretary argued that the cuts would eventually pay for themselves, but conceded that it wouldn\u2019t happen this year.The policy flyaroundAnalysts\u2019 takes:\u2022 Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch write, \u201cThis shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.\u201d\u2022 Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \u201cIn short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell\u2019s first press conference.\u201d\u2022 Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton said, \u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation.\u201dAnalysts over at Deutsche Bank think so. They wrote in a research note yesterday:As the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), G.E. increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.G.E. is the last survivor of the index\u2019s 12 original components from when it started in 1896, and has been in it continuously for more than 110 years.\u201cWe will be looking at how the company, from the board on down, handles the allegations,\u201d said Karen Wells, who directs the investigations and enforcement bureau at the state gambling commission.She said allegations in the settlement agreement weren\u2019t disclosed before the commission granted Wynn a license in September 2014, or at any point before The Wall Street Journal report.Shares in Wynn Resorts fell more than 3 percent yesterday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Fit All of Asia (and a Food Cart) Into a Museum Cafe?", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe way to the heart is through food,\u201d said Jay Xu, who became the director of the museum in 2008, four months before the stock market crash, and shepherded it through its darkest financial hour. \u201cSometimes museum food is too highbrow,\u201d he said. \u201cOur vision is to make Asian art and culture\u201d \u2014 including cuisine \u2014 \u201cessential to everyone.\u201dMr. Chau and Mr. Chen, both 35 and of Taiwanese descent, seem particularly well poised for such a challenge: In 2011, they started making bubble tea \u2014 a milk-tea drink with submerged tapioca pearls \u2014 using organic milk, house-made syrups and tea leaves instead of powders. While bubble tea had long been available in the United States and a staple of Asian-American childhoods, the Boba Guys\u2019 approach helped widen its appeal among non-Asians and earn annual revenues in the millions.Still, when the museum first contacted them last May, \u201cwe thought we had no shot,\u201d Mr. Chau said. They weren\u2019t chefs.Fortunately, they didn\u2019t have to look far for one \u2014 in the back room of one of their shops in San Francisco, Mr. Hong had been quietly selling Korean fried chicken under the name Sunday Bird for the past year.But the restaurant soon caught the attention of food-world luminaries like Anthony Bourdain and had to install a bouncer, with waits of up to two hours, before Mr. Hong decided to decamp for San Francisco.For the museum, he said, he didn\u2019t want to assemble \u201cthe Top 100 hits of Asian food.\u201d His cooking is rooted in a dual heritage: The son of South Korean immigrants, he split his childhood among Texas, Alabama and New Jersey. He envisioned a menu that was nostalgic \u2014 \u201cThe best feedback to hear is \u2018I grew up eating this,\u2019\u201d he said \u2014 but not hidebound by tradition, and his partners agreed.\u201cI think there\u2019s a third culture,\u201d Mr. Chen said, that arises when children are raised in a culture different from their parents\u2019. \u201cWe see it as more of a remix, rather than, \u2018Hey, this is authentic.\u2019 It gives you a license to create.\u201dBy August, the three men had made it through the first round of pitches to the museum. Now Mr. Hong was going to cook for Mr. Xu and his colleagues. The plan was to plate the food until the last course, when they would wheel in the cart. It couldn\u2019t be just for show \u2014 they had to be able to lift the cart\u2019s lids and reveal mantou (steamed buns) for dipping into condensed milk, matcha and caramel.It wasn\u2019t an act of theater; it was a prototype. A key part of their proposal was introducing such carts into a setting where they might seem incongruous. Even as museums have reached out to a broader audience, the image persists of them as hushed, immaculate spaces where the paramount rule is \u201cDo not touch.\u201d Mr. Hong, Mr. Chau and Mr. Chen were determined to change that.On the morning of the tasting, the museum\u2019s representatives arrived and the procession of plates began, followed by the cart, somehow conjured together. The next day, the call came: The job was theirs.\u201cThey were the only ones with a street cart,\u201d Mr. Xu said with a laugh. The first Chinese-American director of a major art museum in the United States, he grew up in Shanghai with a love for stinky tofu; Mr. Hong\u2019s dishes awoke memories, and at the same time felt new.\u201cThey fit who we are as a museum,\u201d said Akiko Yamazaki, the museum board\u2019s chairwoman, who with her husband, Jerry Yang, a founder of Yahoo, has pledged $25 million toward the museum\u2019s expansion.She, too, is a third-culture kid: The daughter of Japanese parents, she was raised in Costa Rica, where her mother had to improvise Japanese dishes out of available ingredients. She likes how Mr. Hong and his partners bridge different cultures and high and low, turning elegant dishes into egalitarian snacks.The museum cafe is set to reopen in mid-March as Sunday at the Museum, although it will be open every day but Monday. The name is a nod to Mr. Hong\u2019s Sunday Bird and the importance of taking a day off to relax, which Mr. Hong neglected in his days in high-powered kitchens.Prices will be gentle. Higher-end tastings and tea flights will be available in a private donors\u2019 room, and Mr. Chau and Mr. Chen have been lobbying to build a secret tearoom, modeled after one at Boba Guys\u2019 headquarters that can be entered only by pushing on a bookshelf.\u201cIt\u2019s a little kitschy, but we love it,\u201d Mr. Chau said.Mr. Hong is brimming with ideas for the menu, including Thai khao man gai (literally translated as chicken fat rice), Chinese cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) and Burmese laphet thoke (tea leaf salad). He\u2019s been consulting fellow chefs for recipes. Asked which dish might be the most challenging, he said: \u201cEvery dish feels like that. Even Korean food I feel like I know, but I don\u2019t really know.\u201dHis standards are high: \u201cIf it\u2019s not as delicious as this place I go to in Chinatown \u2014 \u201d He paused, then said with a sigh, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be as good as guys who\u2019ve been doing it for generations.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Copycat Threats and Jittery Nerves Force School Shutdowns Across the U.S.", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom New Jersey to Kansas to Texas, the aftermath of the Florida high school shooting has turned the routine of going to class into a nerve-racking proposition, as schools have ordered new lockdown drills, beefed up security and in some cases closed down entirely.Since the killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday, teachers and administrators have been working to avoid a repeat in their own schools, while in many cases having to react to copycat threats or jittery nerves misinterpreting innocent sounds as approaching gunfire.There were metal detectors and bag checks at B.M.C. Durfee High School, in Fall River, Mass., on Friday morning, after an anonymous Snapchat post warned the school could turn into \u201cFlorida part 2.\u201dIn Nutley, N.J., the superintendent, Julie Glazer, shut down schools for all 4,100 students in the district after a parent reported seeing a video that included images of a student firing a gun and a school building. (The police said that there was no \u201cimminent threat\u201d and that the student was cooperating with them.)\u201cAs both the superintendent of the Nutley Public Schools and as a parent, and because of the nature of the world in which we live, there was no other decision to be made,\u201d the superintendent said in a statement.Law enforcement officers have been busy rushing to schools. A Broward County deputy accidentally shot himself in the leg on Thursday while answering a mistaken report of a shooting in a school not far from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High.A community college south of Seattle that serves 17,000 students locked down its 80-acre campus on Friday morning as the police investigated reports of shots fired. No evidence of a shooting was found.Some of the incidents have led to arrests on charges that include making threats or false reports.Among those arrested: A 16-year-old student who, the local authorities said, got off a school bus in Macon County, N.C., threatened to return the next day and kill people, then mimed raking the area with gunfire; an 11-year-old girl in Davie, Fla., who was accused of leaving a note under an assistant principal\u2019s door threatening to bring a gun to her middle school and kill people; and two high school students at Brooklyn Prospect Charter School who were accused of threatening on Snapchat to \u201cgun down\u201d their school, according to Sgt. Brendan Ryan of the New York Police Department.Mindful of the Florida shooting, administrators supplied Jennings Senior High School in Jennings, Mo., with portable metal detectors and wands to search for weapons at the championship basketball game being held Friday night, said Rhonda Key, the principal. Dr. Key said this would not be permanent. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing this because it\u2019s so fresh,\u201d she said.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to scare them,\u201d Dr. Key said. \u201cBut when you talk about these things, you must also say there is a real world out there.\u201dSome districts sent messages on Friday that parents found disconcerting. \u201cWe assure you that all rumors are being thoroughly investigated,\u201d read one from the administration of the Haldane Central School District in Putnam County, N.Y. \u201cAt this moment, there is no credible threat to the district.\u201d\u201cNeedless to say, I am freaking out,\u201d wrote one parent on Facebook.At Da Vinci Arts Middle School in Portland, Ore., a drama teacher, Nicole Accuardi, took a different tack after listening to the fear and sadness expressed by many of her students.During the day on Thursday, her 150 or so drama students cut out paper hearts and stuffed them in their pockets. At a routine end-of-day assembly, on Ms. Accuardi\u2019s cue, they stood up, threw the hearts in the air and sang \u201cYou Are My Sunshine\u201d to the surprise of the other teachers and students. Many joined in.Many schools and districts have developed protocols for handling school shootings since 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 students and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.But those protocols would probably be revised, education officials said, with lessons learned from the latest shooting.\u201cThere has to be an autopsy to really understand what went wrong and what went well,\u201d Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Friday. \u201cI was really concerned the first day that there was too much self-congratulation by the pundits on TV. The first responders did an unbelievable job. The teachers did an unbelievable job. But kids were killed, people were killed.\u201dFor instance, she said, it appeared that despite a well-honed intruder plan, the suspect in the Parkland shooting, an expelled former student named Nikolas Cruz, may have been able to take advantage of his knowledge of dismissal procedures to slip into the school at the end of the day, according to the authorities.But Ms. Weingarten also cautioned about overreacting. Not every threat was equally serious, she said: \u201cWe have no idea these days what\u2019s a Russian bot and what\u2019s a copycat.\u201dSome schools took pains to try to keep nerves calm. At Dysart High School in El Mirage, Ariz., the principal took extra steps to make sure students knew the previously scheduled drill on Thursday was, in fact, just a drill. The reminder was included in the morning announcements, and was reiterated on the public address system several times throughout the day, said Zachery Fountain, a district spokesman.Eureka High School in California postponed its drill that had been scheduled for Thursday, partly because officials were concerned about the mental state of students, said Fred Van Vleck, the district superintendent.\u201cWe determined it was best to allow the teachers the time in the classroom to have the conversations with students, rather than running them through drills at this point,\u201d he said.But across the country, other officials were on edge as rumors and hoaxes flew at broadband speed. In the East Texas school district of Redwater, the superintendent, Kelly Burns, said the schools would be closed Friday, \u201cto address a rumor about a possible shooter.\u201dIn Topsham, Me., an elementary school was evacuated on Friday morning in response to a threat, following frenzied speculation about a different threat to the high school.\u201cThese are unsettling times. I too am a parent, and understand the fear and anxiety that school incidents generate,\u201d Brad Smith, the superintendent, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe are pleased that neither situation proved to be as significant as initially reported.\u201dIn Kansas, the Atchison County sheriff\u2019s office and the local school district declared a lockdown Friday while investigating a threat. The lockdown was quickly lifted, and the sheriff\u2019s office said on Facebook, \u201cWe apologize for the panic this may have caused.\u201dReporting was contributed by Claudio Cabrera, Elizabeth A.

{"Headline": "Corruption Charges Suggested for Netanyahu", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli police recommended on Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, casting a pall over the future of a tenacious leader who has become almost synonymous with his country. The announcement instantly raised doubts about his ability to stay in office.All told, the police accused Mr. Netanyahu of accepting nearly $300,000 in gifts over 10 years.Mr. Netanyahu, addressing the nation live on television shortly before the police released their findings around 9 p.m., made clear that he would not step down. \u201cI feel a deep obligation to continue to lead Israel in a way that will ensure our future,\u201d he said, before embarking on a 12-minute defense of his conduct.\u201cYou know I do everything with only one thing in mind \u2014 the good of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cNot for cigars from a friend, not for media coverage, not for anything. Only for the good of the state. Nothing has made me deviate, or will make me deviate, from this sacred mission.\u201dThe police recommendations must now be examined by state prosecutors and the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, a former military prosecutor and onetime Netanyahu aide.The final decision about whether to file formal charges lies with Mr. Mandelblit and is subject to a hearing beforehand with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers. Reaching that threshold alone could easily take months.According to the police, expensive cigars, jewelry and pink champagne flowed into the prime minister\u2019s official Jerusalem residence in quantities sufficient to stock a small cocktail lounge. The generous patrons included Arnon Milchan, the Israeli movie producer, and James Packer, an Australian billionaire.But it is the favors Mr. Netanyahu may have given his wealthy friends in return that could herald his downfall. A formal bribery charge would be by far the most serious outcome, and the most ominous for his political survival.Mr. Netanyahu, who has emerged as one of President Trump\u2019s most ardent allies, is serving his third consecutive term since his election in 2009, and his fourth overall since the 1990s. If he were to remain in the post through July 2019, it would set a record for total time in office, surpassing that of the state\u2019s founder, David Ben-Gurion.Mr. Netanyahu has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to fight on, saying that no police recommendation would prompt his resignation.His longevity attests to his political agility and to his perfection of a campaigning and governing style in which he casts his political foes and critics as enemies of the broader body politic. Though he has formed previous governing coalitions with those to his left, his current government is often described as the most right-wing and religious in Israel\u2019s history. And he has presided over an increasingly bitter relationship with the Palestinians in the territories Israel has occupied for more than a half-century, whose hopes of soon gaining a state of their own have dwindled as Israeli settlements expand.But while Mr. Netanyahu has prepared the public for this moment for months, and made strenuous efforts to discredit those investigating him, he has not prepared Israel or his government for the possibility that he may be unable to continue to lead. He has designated no successor, and no single member of his own coalition has emerged as ready to step into his shoes. Meanwhile, a centrist opposition, led by Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party, has been gaining strength.In a twist straight out of a political thriller, a key witness against Mr. Netanyahu, according to Israeli news reports Tuesday night, turned out to be Mr. Lapid himself, who had been Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s finance minister in a previous coalition.According to a police statement about their recommendations, Mr. Netanyahu promoted the extension of a 10-year tax exemption to expatriate Israelis returning to the country, \u201ca benefit that has great economic value for Milchan,\u201d who has long worked in Hollywood. But the Finance Ministry blocked this legislation, saying it was against the national interest and fiscally unsound.The Israeli law enforcement authorities have handled the cases with great caution, wary of the possibility of bringing down a prime minister who might then be proved not guilty in court, not least with Israel facing increasing security threats on its northern and southern frontiers.But Israel\u2019s constant state of alert has led some critics to argue all the more that a prime minister so focused on fighting his own legal battles cannot be entrusted with fateful decisions of peace and war.Opposition politicians pounced Tuesday night, demanding that Mr. Netanyahu step down, be ousted by his coalition or at least declare himself \u201cincapacitated,\u201d as former Prime Minister Ehud Barak urged on Twitter, calling the police findings \u201chair-raising.\u201d\u201cMost of you are honest people,\u201d Stav Shaffir, of the left-leaning Zionist Union party, wrote on Twitter, addressing Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. \u201cIf you have a drop of concern for the future, fulfill your obligation. Free Israel from this madness.\u201dBut some coalition members denounced both the investigation and Mr. Lapid\u2019s role in it. \u201cIn a democracy, a regime is changed in an election and not through the army or police,\u201d the coalition\u2019s chairman, Dudi Amsalem, told Walla News.And Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, whose center-right Kulanu party holds 10 seats in Parliament, giving it the power to sink Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government, signaled just before midnight that he was not prepared to leave the coalition, saying on Facebook that he would wait for the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether to indict Mr. Netanyahu.Projecting aplomb, Mr. Netanyahu announced that he would attend a conference of local authorities in Tel Aviv on Wednesday morning.Mr. Netanyahu long ago earned the nickname \u201cthe Magician\u201d for his uncanny knack for political endurance, and even his most ardent opponents have been hesitant to write him off.At what point he might be legally required to step down, short of a final conviction, is likely to be a matter of increasingly heated debate, though public opinion and political pressure could in the end play a decisive role.Israel\u2019s Supreme Court has ruled in the past that government ministers or deputy ministers, once indicted, may not remain in their posts. Whether that principle should also apply to the elected prime minister is an open question.Mr. Netanyahu would be something of a test case as Israel\u2019s first sitting prime minister to be formally charged.Pre-empting the police recommendations, Mr. Netanyahu told the public to expect them and did his best to minimize their importance.\u201cAny fair-minded person will ask themselves how people who say such delusional things about the prime minister can investigate him objectively and make recommendations in his case without bias,\u201d he wrote on a Facebook post last week, accusing the police commissioner, Roni Alsheich, of having an agenda.In December, Mr. Netanyahu told a gathering of his right-wing Likud Party supporters: \u201cThe vast majority of police recommendations end in nothing. Over 60 percent of the police recommendations are thrown in the trash. Over 60 percent of the police recommendations don\u2019t get to an indictment.\u201dExperts have disputed those figures, however, and the prime minister\u2019s opponents have begun quoting from an interview he gave in 2008, at the height of Mr. Olmert\u2019s legal troubles, to turn the tables on Mr. Netanyahu.Describing Mr. Olmert as \u201cup to his neck in investigations,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said of his political rival at the time: \u201cHe does not have a public or moral mandate to determine such fateful matters for the state of Israel when there is the fear, and I have to say it is real and not without basis, that he will make decisions based on his personal interest in political survival and not based on the national interest.\u201dIn some ways, though, Mr. Netanyahu has been here before.During his first term in office, in the late 1990s, the police recommended that he be charged with fraud and breach of trust in a complicated case in which Mr. Netanyahu was suspected of acting to appoint an attorney general who would be sympathetic to a minister under investigation for corruption, in return for that minister\u2019s political support. Ultimately, the attorney general closed that case, citing a lack of evidence.This time around, the police recruited a state\u2019s witness, Ari Harow, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s former chief of staff and once one of his closest confidants.Among those caught up in the shipping investigation are David Shimron, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s personal lawyer and second cousin, and Yitzhak Molcho, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lifelong friend and close adviser, whom he has sent on his most delicate diplomatic missions since the 1990s. Mr. Molcho and Mr. Shimron are partners in a law firm as well as brothers-in-law.Follow David M.

{"Headline": "Israel Moves to Expel Africans. Critics Say That\u2019s Not Jewish.", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 On a recent weeknight, about two dozen Israelis, mostly in their 20s, gathered in a Jerusalem basement to hear the story of an Eritrean man who is facing deportation.The meeting was one of many similar events taking place across the country in what has become a particularly Jewish backlash against the government\u2019s tough new deportation policy.Petitions opposing the policy poured in from Israeli doctors, pilots, retired diplomats, professors, rabbis, architects and musicians, many arguing that a nation formed by refugees in the aftermath of the Holocaust has a special obligation to treat refugees with more compassion.In a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 36 Holocaust survivors, many of them refugees from the ghettos and concentration camps of Europe, beseeched him \u201cto learn the lesson\u201d and not to expel Africans seeking asylum in Israel.\u201cAs a country founded by refugees,\u201d said another letter signed by 850 Jewish clergy and delivered to Israeli embassies and consulates in the United States and Canada, \u201cand whose early leaders helped craft the 1951 International Convention on the Status of Refugees, Israel must not deport those seeking asylum within its borders.\u201dLike much of the Western world, Israel is grappling with how to balance its right to protect its borders and prevent illegal immigration with showing compassion and humanity. But the government\u2019s decision has struck a particular chord here and among Jews abroad since the modern state of Israel has served as a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution and was largely built by immigrants.The issue is also testing what it means to be a Jewish state: to preserve its Jewish majority, or to be governed by Jewish values, including the ideal of \u201ctikkun olam,\u201d or repairing the world.\u201cEvery country must guard its borders,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in announcing the policy last month. \u201cIt is important that people understand that we are doing something here that is completely legal and completely essential.\u201dHe cited the \u201cplight\u201d of residents of south Tel Aviv, where many of the migrants are concentrated. In the past, he has also said that the influx of Africans threatened Israel\u2019s Jewish majority.Many of the solidarity events are taking place under the umbrella of a grass-roots movement, \u201cStop the Deportation,\u201d which was started by students. In addition to the meeting in the basement studio of a Jerusalem yoga teacher, there was a gathering this week in a bar in Kiryat Shemona, a town on Israel\u2019s northern border, and another in the southern city of Beersheba in the Negev desert.Another initiative, \u201cMiklat Israel,\u201d Hebrew for Israel Sanctuary, and known informally as the Anne Frank Home Sanctuary movement, signed up about 500 Israeli families from scores of towns and communities willing to adopt asylum seekers and, if necessary, hide them in their homes.First conceived by Susan Silverman, a rabbi and the sister of the American comedian Sarah Silverman, the idea was partly inspired by the story of another Eritrean who was so moved by Anne Frank\u2019s diary that he translated it into Tigrinya while in a camp in Ethiopia, then carried it with him on his journey to Israel, convinced that its people would receive him.\u201cWe are exploding the myth that ordinary Israelis don\u2019t want them,\u201d said Rabbi Nava Hefetz, one of the group\u2019s leaders, adding that the small team of volunteers couldn\u2019t keep up with the flood of phone calls and emails.\u201cWe are talking about the history of the Jewish people,\u201d she said, \u201cfrom the exodus from Egypt to the terrible tragedy of the Holocaust. Refugeedom is in our DNA. Seeking asylum is in our blood.\u201dEven secular Israelis have taken to citing biblical verses like Leviticus 19:34: \u201cThe stranger who resides among you shall be to you as one of your citizens; you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\u201dAnd liberals hark back to the decision of Menachem Begin, the prime minister who brought Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud Party to power in 1977, to welcome several hundred Vietnamese boat people.But Israelis are divided, with many others eager to see the departure of the Africans. Officials here routinely refer to them as \u201cinfiltrators\u201d because they sneaked across the border from the Egyptian Sinai, and insist that the majority \u2014 young men of working age \u2014 are economic migrants, not refugees.\u201cIsrael is too small and has its own problems,\u201d Israel\u2019s justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, said in a Facebook post. \u201cIt cannot serve as the employment agency for the African continent.\u201dMany, including the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel, David Lau, and his father, Yisrael Meir Lau, a former chief rabbi and child Holocaust survivor, reject the comparisons with the Holocaust. The migrants, they note, are not being sent to extermination camps and their Israeli sympathizers will not be risking their lives by harboring them.About 60,000 African migrants have surreptitiously crossed into Israel over the once-porous border with Egypt since 2005, most of them Sudanese or Eritreans who cannot be sent back home because of international conventions that prevent the repatriation of asylum seekers to home countries where they could face persecution. The influx stopped in 2012, when Israel constructed a steel barrier along the 150-mile border with Egypt.Of the thousands of Eritreans and Sudanese who have filed asylum requests in Israel in recent years, only about 10 have received refugee status. Some Sudanese refugees from war-torn Darfur have been given a special humanitarian status but most of the other asylum requests have not been processed.At least 20,000 African migrants have since left Israel. Mr. Netanyahu said he had made it his mission to deport the rest. He and his ministers have alluded to secret understandings with third countries in Africa, without naming them.The migrants say the main destination is Rwanda, but the Rwandan government has denied signing any secret deal. It says its policy toward Africans in need of a home is one of \u201copen doors,\u201d but only to those who come voluntarily.Migrant and human rights organizations say many Africans who left Israel for Rwanda and Uganda did not find work or receive legal status. Many are said to have continued on their journeys, often putting themselves in grave danger.Interior Minister Aryeh Deri told a parliamentary committee this week that Israel had deported more than 5,000 non-African illegal immigrants since last year, proof that the government policy was not racist; more than 20,000 Ukrainians and Georgians have sought asylum in Israel in recent years.Under increasing public pressure, he clarified that the new policy would apply only to single African men who had not formally submitted an asylum request by Jan. 1. It would not apply to families or the roughly 5,000 children of asylum-seekers who had been born in Israel. The migrants have until April 1 to accept the cash and flight or face detention.Yonatan Jakubowicz, director of the Israeli Immigration Policy Center, an organization supportive of the government\u2019s arguments, said he thought that Israel had taken a \u201cvery balanced\u201d position in \u201clooking for that middle ground,\u201d and that other countries could learn from it.In the Jerusalem basement, Mr. Tehehaymanut said he had initially hoped to go to Libya, and from there to Europe. But the Bedouin smugglers dropped his group off in the desert in the middle of the night and told them to walk straight ahead toward the lights of Israel.Israeli soldiers received them with smiles, food and drink. \u201cWe did not come to eat,\u201d Mr. Tehehaymanut said. \u201cJust to live.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Our rules: No emotional entanglements, and neither of us wants to hear about the other\u2019s sexual activities (directly or from third parties) or be embarrassed by word of trysts spreading among friends. This requires a lot of discretion. I don\u2019t know if she has acted on our arrangement yet, but I\u2019m too scared to! I\u2019m terrified that someone will spot me on a date. So, I haven\u2019t done anything yet. Any advice?MACLet\u2019s start with the notion that every long-term relationship is its own ecosystem. Just because many of us have a personal horror story to share about extracurricular sexual activities in relationships is no reason to conclude that you and your partner can\u2019t pull this off, Mac, if you\u2019re determined to.My skepticism here goes to temperament. The first serious rule breaking I did was as a teenager in Vermont. I pretended to sleep over at a friend\u2019s house, when in fact we fled Brattleboro for New York City (in a teenager-driven car \u2014 terrible!) to see Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s free concert in Central Park. Nothing bad happened, but nothing good happened, either. I don\u2019t recall a note of music. All of my energy was laser focused on the prospect of being caught. Some of us aren\u2019t cut out for the high wire, Mac.You prize your relationship, so you perform a rational balancing act: weighing the (probably slim) chances of violating your agreement against the (graver) dangers to your relationship. Think again about whether you really want sex with someone other than your partner. You may not be up for the risks. If so, revisit the subject with your mate. (Or find a job that includes lots of time on the road.)Our 31-year-old son is a medical resident at a hospital. The choice to go into medicine was his, but we paid for his entire education \u2014 college and medical school. The problem: He hates what he\u2019s doing, the hours, the culture, etc. But he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019d rather do instead. What is my role in advising him?MAGGIEBe a supportive mom (and try not to drive yourself crazy with the sunk costs of his education). Suggest he visit the career counseling office at his (undoubtedly exorbitant \u2014 sorry!) school. He surely has options for using his medical skills outside of the \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d hospital rat race. But sadly, at a certain point, we grown-ups have to make our own decisions about what constitutes satisfying work.My wife\u2019s friend gives parties in her own honor: birthdays, life achievements, etc. Invites go out to \u201ccherished friends\u201d a month in advance, and inevitably, a week beforehand, we receive a spreadsheet assigning us specific food or liquor to bring \u2014 all signed with praying hands emojis. This has happened several times. When the spreadsheet comes, I send regrets, often with white lies. But I would rather be honest: \u201cYou can afford your own parties!\u201d (We\u2019ve entertained her many times, without asking her to bring a thing.) May I be honest?ANONYMOUSAside from the praying hands emojis (which strike me as thin gratitude), the only part of this woman\u2019s behavior I don\u2019t care for is her failure to mention that her parties are potlucks when she makes her invitations. You are entitled to know the terms of the deal up front. This would also spare you (white) lying.But what you call being \u201chonest\u201d sounds like a desire to \u201ccorrect.\u201d This woman is not a close friend. (You identify her as a pal of your wife.) And by now, you know exactly how her parties work. If you don\u2019t like them, stop saying yes. But she\u2019s not asking for your opinion. Better simply to decline her invitations and let everybody give the parties they like.From my balcony, I have a view of a postcard-perfect mountain about 100 miles away. The view would be impressive were it not for a single very tall tree about a mile away. Would it be egregious to identify the property where the tree lies and offer its owner removal at our expense, or should we leave nature as it is?CHRISIt\u2019s hard to imagine a single tree ruining your view \u2014 unless it\u2019s the one the Keebler elves live in? But I get how your thoughts might wander to tree removal, gazing at the (obscured) mountain from your balcony. Personally, I would find it aggressive if someone knocked on my door and asked me to remove a tree. (I love my trees. And I would want much better compensation than gratis removal.) Do you really want to walk down that road?Still, you may be able to ask in a super-charming, unentitled way. And for all we know, the owners pray nightly for someone to come around and offer to cut down their looming tree. You\u2019ll only know if you ask. But if you do, be prepared to take no for an answer very quickly, O.K.?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Black Panther\u2019 Poised to Shatter a Hollywood Myth", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "The film is expected to take in at least $250 million worldwide this weekend, disproving the notion that movies rooted in black culture cannot be global blockbusters.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Ticket buyers around the world are poised to smash another one of Hollywood\u2019s most entrenched beliefs.\u201cOne by one, these unwritten Hollywood rules about what audiences supposedly will and will not support are falling by the wayside,\u201d said Jeff Bock, a senior analyst at Exhibitor Relations, an entertainment research firm. \u201cI think about it like a wall crumbling. In terms of \u2018Black Panther,\u2019 no studio can say again, \u2018Oh, black movies don\u2019t travel, overseas interest will be minimal.\u2019\u201dDisney, which has been on a box office tear, decided several years ago to make a concerted effort to promote diversity and equality on screen. But \u201cBlack Panther\u201d also arrives at a time when studios have started to respond to growing pressure to make their big-budget movies more inclusive, driven in part by the recent #OscarsSoWhite movement. And with audiences increasingly inclined to stay home and watch Netflix, producing movies featuring lead characters with different skin colors, genders and sexualities is proving to be good business.Attendance at theaters in North America, the world\u2019s largest movie market, dropped 6 percent in 2017, hitting a 22-year low. At the same time, studios are more reliant than ever on ticket sales. Their home-entertainment businesses \u2014 negatively impacted by the rise of streaming services \u2014 are collapsing to an alarming degree. The major studios reported an 18 percent drop in holiday home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, compared to a year earlier.\u201cHollywood can no longer afford to take any moviegoer for granted,\u201d Mr. Bock said. \u201cThat is causing them to look at underserved groups where there is pent-up demand, and the black audience is one.\u201dDisney, which spent roughly $350 million to make and market \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d remains cautious about declaring global victory, noting that the film will not arrive in crucial markets like China and Japan until next month. The movie, focused on one of Marvel\u2019s lesser-known superheroes and set in the fictional country of Wakanda, will be playing in 70 percent of the world by Friday, with its rollout having started on Tuesday in the United Kingdom.\u201cI\u2019m done living in a world where I don\u2019t get to be who I am,\u201d Nick Robinson, playing the lead role, says in the \u201cLove, Simon\u201d trailer. \u201cI deserve a great love story.\u201dStudio chiefs keep their jobs by delivering hits, and they try to do that by avoiding constructs that have fizzled in the past. For years, female superheroes were held back by the argument \u2014 a ridiculous one in the eyes of many critics \u2014 that male ticket buyers would stay home if a woman led the action. The failures of the critically derided films \u201cCatwoman\u201d in 2004 and \u201cElektra\u201d in 2005 were used as proof. As studios have become more reliant on overseas ticket sales, they have shunned movies that focus on black characters by citing lackluster foreign interest in films like \u201cDreamgirls\u201d in 2007 and Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cMadea\u201d series.Some film executives even cite \u201cGet Out\u201d as a cautionary example. That Oscar-nominated horror movie, about racism in the liberal white suburbs, collected a robust $176 million in North America but a comparatively slight $79 million overseas.Disney\u2019s willingness to withstand that kind of resistance reflects the emphasis that Robert A. Iger, the company\u2019s chief executive, has put on diverse casting and storytelling across the Magic Kingdom. As he said at Disney\u2019s most recent shareholder meeting, referring to inclusion and equality: \u201cWe can take those values, which we deem important societally, and actually change peoples\u2019 behavior \u2014 get people to be more accepting of the multiple differences and cultures and races and all other facets of our lives and our people.\u201dKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, and Alan F. Horn, Disney\u2019s movie chairman, were eager to make \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d But it was ultimately Mr. Iger who pushed the movie ahead, overruling those who worried that it would not generate adequate sales of related toys.Asked how Mr. Iger has communicated that message about diversity \u2014 in meetings? by royal decree? \u2014 Mr. Feige responded, \u201cIt\u2019s a combination.\u201dWhatever the route, the directive has been received. Disney recently released Pixar\u2019s \u201cCoco,\u201d centered on the festive Mexican holiday honoring the dead and with characters voiced by an all-Latino cast. Before that came \u201cMoana,\u201d which gave Disney a Pacific Islander princess.The new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies have been paragons of diverse casting. Coming up are live-action versions of \u201cMulan,\u201d with a mostly Asian cast, and \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d with a largely black cast. Disney\u2019s big-budget \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d directed by Ava DuVernay and starring Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Michael Pe\u00f1a and Mindy Kaling, arrives on March 9.\u201cWe wanted to make a film with a cast that looks like you,\u201d Ms. DuVernay said at a Disney fan event last year, \u201cthat looks like the real world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of Disney\u2019s movie chairman.

{"Headline": "The Alt-Weekly Crisis Hits Nashville. And Democracy.", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeeing The Scene on the auction block might not be surprising, but it\u2019s still heartbreaking. In a shortsighted effort to make the paper more appealing to buyers, SouthComm laid off some passionate, immensely talented journalists and seriously overburdened those who remained. Some of them are people I know because I once wrote for The Scene, and I have spent more than 20 years watching the difference this newspaper has made to my city.When classified ads \u2014 the bread and butter of the newspaper business \u2014 migrated online, newspapers big and small suffered. In towns like Nashville, midsize cities too small to sustain more than one daily paper, alt-weeklies morphed from journalism\u2019s irreverent younger siblings into necessary institutions. They covered news the shrinking dailies no longer touched, and they served as urgent competitors in areas where the dailies still invested resources, such as politics.In 1998, Nashville\u2019s Gannett-owned morning daily, The Tennessean, bought the evening daily, the 122-year-old Nashville Banner, and then promptly shut it down. But reporters for The Scene were still right there, still holding politicians accountable and covering local arts in the kind of depth the daily never even aspired to.\u201cA lot of the work that alt-weeklies do now fills in the gaps\u201d created by understaffed dailies, said the former Scene editor Steve Cavendish. \u201cIt\u2019s investigative work. It\u2019s cultural work. There\u2019s nobody else writing culture in this city. There\u2019s nobody else writing food in this city. There\u2019s nobody else writing arts in this city. The only place you see that coverage, really, is in The Scene.\u201dEqually important is what alt-weeklies bring to political reporting. The history of Southern politics is a history of cronyism, and the situation is hardly better now \u2014 and hardly unique to the South. Too often, public servants answer to special interests like the N.R.A. and the Koch brothers out of fear of facing well-funded primary challengers they have little chance of beating. In statehouses and city halls across the country, the only thing standing between an oligarchy and a true republic is often a local newspaper reporter working on an ancient laptop to shore up the bulwark of truth.In this climate, the importance of vibrant community alt-weeklies will continue to grow. While The Scene faces economic challenges, it is still a profitable newspaper. But it desperately needs a buyer willing to invest in its future \u2014 and, when necessary, to look beyond the quarterly bottom line to what the newspaper brings to this community.\u201cThe financial pressures on these papers are going to require a different kind of owner,\u201d Mr. Cavendish said in an interview. \u201cThere needs to be a new level of civic ownership that doesn\u2019t require a pound of flesh to be taken out every quarter, or every year.\u201dThe owners of a local newspaper need to understand that they have not invested in an engine for quarter-over-quarter shareholder profit. They have entered into a crucial compact with their fellow citizens. They have invested in the city itself.In sanctioning modest profits and sometimes fitful growth, the new owners of The Scene will earn the privilege of uncovering conflicts of interest that public servants would prefer to keep hidden, demanding access to public records the public doesn\u2019t yet know are theirs, helping people who are enduring injustice, and championing people who are quietly making a difference.Owning a local newspaper is not the way to wealth. It\u2019s the way to something far more important than wealth. In this age of \u201calternative truth,\u201d the real news, for all its deadline-driven mistakes, is our best hope for surviving the now-daily challenges to American democracy.The Nashville Scene is for sale. Someone who cares about the fate of this city \u2014 and this country \u2014 should buy it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "$2.4 Billion Deal for Chelsea Market Enlarges Google\u2019s New York Footprint", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a tech takeover.Chelsea Market sits directly across Ninth Avenue from the company\u2019s headquarters at 111 Eighth Avenue, which is larger than the Empire State Building and covers the entire block between 15th and 16th Streets.But it is only the latest example of an internet behemoth, and even smaller tech companies, expanding rapidly in New York City.Amazon, Facebook, Salesforce, a cloud computing company, and Spotify, a music streaming service, are all enlarging their footprints here by hundreds of thousands of square feet. Employment at technology firms has grown three times faster in New York City than in the rest of the private sector, adding more than 50,000 jobs since the end of the recession in 2010, according to a report by the state comptroller.\u201cThe modern tech sector began on the West Coast when it was about developing new technology and programming,\u201d said Scott Rechler, chairman of RXR Realty, a Google landlord at Pier 57, a new mixed-use space on the Hudson River that is scheduled to open this year. \u201cIt\u2019s now about the implementation and application of technology. And that\u2019s presented an opportunity for New York, the business capital of the world. The talent pool is here.\u201dNeither side has made clear what Google\u2019s plans for the building are, and whether the popular food market will stay in place. But getting rid of tenants with leases would be a long-term process.At the end of 2017, tech firms accounted for 29.3 million, or 8 percent, of the 398 million square feet of office space in New York City, according to CBRE, a real estate company. In a snapshot of recent tech-sector activity, those companies have leased or renewed leases for 21 million square feet of office space in the last 10 years alone. If telecom companies are included, that number jumps to 26.8 million.Nine years ago, tech firms had only 17.6 million square feet of office space, or 5 percent of the office market.The tech firms generally prefer industrial spaces to the brass and glass towers of Midtown. Chelsea Market, where Google already leases 400,000 square feet of space, is a former factory building with expansive floors.Amazon has taken office space in what was once a warehouse at 450 West 33rd Street, although the owner, Brookfield, recently gave the building a face-lift and glass walls.Facebook has grown substantially at 770 Broadway, a landmark cast-iron building that was once a department store, on an entire block bounded by Eighth and Ninth Streets, between Broadway and Lafayette Street.But that trend may be changing, said Mary Ann Tighe, a broker and chief executive of CBRE in the New York region. When companies grow and need a more robust infrastructure, she said, some tech firms are migrating to traditional office towers.Salesforce, the cloud computing company based in San Francisco, moved its three Manhattan offices into a 41-story skyscraper at 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue. The Salesforce logo replaced the MetLife branding atop the building.And Spotify, the music streaming company, is moving from 620 Sixth Avenue and several other locations into nearly half-a-million square feet at the 4 World Trade Center skyscraper in Lower Manhattan.But it was Google that prompted real estate brokers, landlords, city officials and economists to sit up and take notice of the burgeoning tech sector a decade ago.In 2006, the company moved into 111 Eighth Avenue, a massive onetime shipping terminal, with tenants that included Verizon, Sprint, Web MD and BarnesandNoble.com. The building sat atop a high-powered fiber artery snaking along Manhattan\u2019s West Side. Employees used Razor scooters to navigate the blocklong corridors lined with work spaces, commissaries with free drinks and granola, and massage and game rooms.Google became a siren for other, smaller tech firms to move to the neighborhood, which was beginning to shrug off its industrial roots.In 2010, Google bought the building, also from Jamestown, for $1.8 billion, a breathtaking sum at the time. Not so long ago, blue-collar tenants had paid a very modest $6 per square foot for space there.But Google\u2019s need for space continues unabated. The company has been unable to dislodge the other tenants at 111 Eighth Avenue as quickly as it had hoped. The company has leased large blocks of space nearby, at Pier 57; at 85 10th Avenue, another former Nabisco cookie factory, between 15th and 16th Streets; and at Chelsea Market.Facebook has about 5,000 employees now in the Chelsea neighborhood, occupying a total of 900,000 square feet.Owning Chelsea Market would enable the company to create a campus akin to its headquarters in California, albeit one that is more vertical. Chelsea Market, like 111 Eighth, has been a front-runner in the evolution of the Chelsea neighborhood from an industrial zone to an area known for inexpensive space for food producers, restaurants and office tenants, and now as a tech-sector hub.An earlier version of a chart with this article misstated the number of tech workers in San Francisco in 2013. It was 79,000, not 7,900.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The One Item That Will Change Your Weeknight Cooking", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteIn that dark age, even well-equipped kitchens did not have so much as a single professional sheet pan, let alone the two or three deemed indispensable today.Sure, there were deep-sided roasting pans, cookie sheets, and narrow, thin-gauge jellyroll pans \u2014 all perfect for their designated purposes.However, as useful as regular sheet pans are, their capaciousness can be unwieldy when you\u2019re dealing with just a halved acorn squash or that quartet of trout fillets you\u2019re planning for dinner tonight. Even worse, sheet pans can also be too big to fit into the dishwasher, especially if you\u2019ve used more than one.And this is why I\u2019ve made room for yet one more tool in my already overstuffed kitchen cabinets. For home cooks everywhere, it\u2019s time to get acquainted with the adorable and versatile quarter-sheet pan.Measuring approximately 9 by 12 inches, it\u2019s the helpful little sibling of your standard-size sheet pans.I can fit four in my oven all at once, which makes them highly flexible when you want to cook several things at the same time. Then I can toss them into the dishwasher, where they scarcely take up more room than my plates.For example, what if you wanted to cook up a wintry dish of paprika-rubbed chicken legs, potatoes and turnips in the oven all at the same time? If you arranged all those ingredients together on one large pan, you\u2019d be hard pressed to get the timing just right so the vegetables and chicken all come out evenly cooked and gorgeously caramelized.Separating the chicken and vegetables onto two small pans, however, gives you a lot more control. You can remove each pan from the oven exactly when its contents are perfectly done, without worrying about over- or undercooking.Here, it means pulling out the chicken and letting it rest while cranking up the oven to crisp the potatoes and turnips. You\u2019ll have juicy chicken, crunchy potatoes, and a lot less stress getting them there.The same logic can be applied to a sheet-pan supper of sausage Parmesan and garlicky broccoli. Using two pans prevents the sausage juices and tomato sauce from seeping all over the broccoli, making it soggy.Or, in the case of cumin-rubbed pork chops with brussels sprouts and crispy sage leaves, while the ingredients would all taste great cooked together on one large sheet pan \u2014 the rendering pork fat mingling gorgeously with the sprouts and sage \u2014 it would automatically make the vegetables unfit for any vegetarians at your table. And keeping the meat away from the vegetables encourages the porky edges to crisp, which is always a good thing in a chop.If you can find the space to store a few of these quarter-sheet pans (maybe stacked inside your larger sheet pans), buying them isn\u2019t at all expensive. They cost less than $10 each. I\u2019d suggest starting with two, and if you find yourself reaching for them often, you can always pick up a couple more.Whether you use big pans or small, once you immerse yourself in the tasty, convenient world of sheet-pan suppers, you won\u2019t want to stop.And to drink...To nobody\u2019s surprise, sausage parmesan with garlicky broccoli, with its cooked tomato sauce, sausages and cheese, is a natural with red wine, particularly one with lively acidity. Sangiovese is the obvious choice, especially the less expensive wines of Chianti and Montalcino. Why less expensive? Those are the wines that are least likely to taste oaky, a quality that would clash with this dish. Look for Chianti Rufina, Chianti Classico and Rosso di Montalcino. Other good options include Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo and Etna Rossos. If you would prefer a white, look for a fresh, vibrant wine, likewise not influenced by oak. Options include Orvieto from Umbria, verdicchios and perhaps Soaves and Etna Biancos. Want something bubbly? Try a good Lambrusco from Emilia-Romagna. ERIC ASIMOVcookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russians Bought Bank Accounts From California Man, Mueller Says", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a lucrative business. For several years, Richard Pinedo, a Southern California computer science major, would open bank accounts in his name and sell them online to shadowy purchasers for cash. In other cases, he served as a middle man, buying accounts in other people\u2019s names and flipping them on the internet.The operation was illegal, \u201cdesigned to circumvent the security features of large online digital payment companies,\u201d according to court papers. The company Mr. Pinedo set up, Auction Essistance, brought in tens of thousands of dollars between 2014 and December 2017.Some of that business, it now appears, was done with a Russian operation that used social media platforms to sow political discord around the 2016 presidential election.The connection was apparently unwitting. Mr. Pinedo\u2019s lawyer, Jeremy I. Lessem, said in an interview that Mr. Pinedo had no knowledge of his clients\u2019 identities or motivations and \u201caccepted full responsibility\u201d for his actions. Mr. Pinedo had no connection to Mr. Trump, his company or his campaign, the lawyer said.\u201cTo the extent that Mr. Pinedo\u2019s actions assisted any individuals, including foreign nationals, with interfering in the American presidential election, it was done completely without his knowledge or understanding,\u201d Mr. Lessem said.In a rare statement, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, backed up that assessment. He said that prosecutors had \u201cno evidence and there is no allegation he was a witting participant in the Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. elections and political processes.\u201dA knock at the ranch-style home where Mr. Pinedo lives in suburban Santa Paula went unanswered on Friday.According to prosecutors, Mr. Pinedo obtained thousands of bank account numbers by registering accounts in his own name or buying them in the names of others online.Many of the accounts used stolen American identities, the authorities said. Though Mr. Pinedo \u201cwas not directly involved in the registration of these accounts using stolen identities,\u201d they wrote, \u201che willfully and intentionally avoided learning about the use of stolen identities.\u201dAnd though he did not know the precise identity of his Russian clients, Mr. Pinedo \u201cfrequently\u201d bought and sold account numbers with people he knew were outside the United States, the prosecutors said.Several of those account numbers were ultimately sold to Russians involved in the election influence operation, the documents show. They were used by the Russians to open PayPal accounts and allowed the Russians to get around company security measures meant to verify the identity of account holders.The PayPal accounts were then used to make purchases, including on social media accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based operation at the center of the Russian disinformation campaign. In total, the Russians obtained and used 14 bank account numbers between June 2016 and March 2017. It is unclear how many were purchased from Mr. Pinedo.\u201cSome PayPal accounts were used to purchase advertisements on Facebook\u201d promoting fake social media accounts created by the Russians, the papers said.Their goal, as has now been well documented, was to sow discord in the American political process. And it included efforts designed to aid the presidential candidacy of Donald J. Trump and hurt that of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\u201cWe offer services that will enable you to get back onto eBay or Amazon ranging from pre-made eBay & Paypal accounts or verification tools,\u201d the site said. \u201cWe guarantee our accounts are legitimate and not hacked or stolen like most other sellers offer.\u201dAt the time he was running Auction Essistance, Mr. Pinedo also appears to have been working as a marketing director of SEO Distortion, a digital marketing company, according to a LinkedIn page bearing his name that was taken down late Friday. According to that profile, Mr. Pinedo received an associate degree in computer science from Ventura College in 2009.\u201cRicky Pinedo is not your typical person who has a love for technology or is computer crazed,\u201d it reads. \u201cHis ever-changing need for more advanced challenges and goals had spawned the beginning of starting a company that hones in on bringing businesses to the world wide web.\u201dLouis Keene contributed reporting from Santa Paula, Calif.

{"Headline": "Does Australia Prefer Secrecy to Transparency?", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 43______But it\u2019s not exactly a subject for live television \u2014 at least not with me explaining it \u2014 so I thought I\u2019d return to the issue here in this week\u2019s newsletter.Countries like Turkey, Cambodia, China and Cuba have also made a habit of creating and enforcing laws that allow for maximum control over government information.At a time of rising nationalism worldwide, \u201cnational security\u201d has effectively become a catchall category \u2014 a legitimate concern expanded to include documents, digital communication and political issues that may not have much to do with national security.As Gaven Morris, the news director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, put it: \u201cConsistently, we\u2019ve seen overreach where governments seek to suppress information because it is embarrassing, not because there is a genuine security risk.\u201dBut there are actually several other areas of public life in Australia that make journalism more difficult, or that reveal the degree to which this country tolerates a lack of transparency.A few examples:\u2022 Campaign FinanceAustralia\u2019s campaign finance system is riddled with loopholes and delayed disclosures.At the federal level, it takes more than six months (up to 19 months in fact) for the public to learn how much parties have raised and from whom. Donors are identified only if they have contributed more than 13,500 Australian dollars, or about $10,000, which means individuals and corporations can anonymously make multiple donations without the public knowing. At the same time, Australian politicians are not required to explain what they do with the money.\u2022 Suppression OrdersFor example, there is a major case of global interest working its way through the courts now. It\u2019s subject to a suppression order, and I cannot legally tell you about it.In other cases, courts have ordered that already published journalism be removed from Australian news sites, even though the information in them could be found elsewhere \u2014 undermining public trust in both journalism and the justice system.\u2022 Defamation Without any equivalent to the American First Amendment, freedom of speech in Australia is more negotiable and often subject to litigation.Suing for defamation is relatively easy in Australia, with presumptions favoring those who sue. Journalists, media organizations \u2014 and increasingly anyone who publishes on social media platforms \u2014 routinely lose in court or expect to lose and settle. The costs can be high, even prohibitive, stamping out some stories before they are ever written.Now, it may be that there are strong arguments for restricting information and limiting journalism \u2014 arguments that I, as a journalist, may have a harder time fully agreeing with.But regardless of whether you think our tribe is full of sensationalists to be protected against or heroes to be lauded, it\u2019s worth asking: Why are governments increasingly so insecure about letting us all see what they are up to?On that happy note, here are some examples of journalism worth fighting for, and smiling at, along with a weekly recommendation that crosses generational lines.____________It almost sounds like science fiction, but it\u2019s really just science: climate change.______Read it and then Tweet it out so the bots can see it.______What do love and cryptocurrency share? More than you might think.______This week, in addition to all things espionage, we have news, science, sports, Netflix, a new Australia Diary and some serious Margot Robbie coverage.______I just finished reading \u201cWonder,\u201d by R.J. Palacio, about a 10-year-old boy born with several genetic abnormalities who dreams of being \u201cordinary.\u201dIt\u2019s meant to be a children\u2019s book (I read it after my son finished it), but adults could also benefit from what the book has to teach, about kindness, humor and the awkwardness of family and friendship.At a time when so much seems so serious, yes, including the top of this newsletter, \u201cWonder\u201d is a wonderful sigh of emotional accessibility.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syria Cease-Fire Must Take Effect Immediately, U.N. Chief Warns", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe secretary general\u2019s anger was matched by that of his colleague, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations\u2019 top human rights official, who pinned responsibility for the prolonged misery in Syria and other conflict zones on the five permanent members of the Security Council.\u201cSecurity Council resolutions are only meaningful if they are effective,\u201d Mr. Guterres said at the opening of a session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. \u201cEastern Ghouta cannot wait. It\u2019s high time to stop this hell on earth.\u201dMore than 500 people have died in the rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta in the past week, including 24 in the 24 hours since the cease-fire resolution was passed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, and hospitals remain a target. The sound of jets and helicopters could be heard flying over the capital in the direction of eastern Ghouta on Monday.Sounding the same theme as the secretary general, Tareq al-Dimashqi, a resident of eastern Ghouta, wrote in a Facebook post that the suburb had become an \u201cuninhabitable hell\u201d after he toured the area on Sunday, saying it was the first time he had left his shelter in a week.Eastern Ghouta\u2019s features had been \u201cerased, replaced by desperation and misery,\u201d he wrote after a ride on his scooter that he said was interrupted when government shelling forced him to take cover in a shop.President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and his Russian and Iranian allies appear to be exploiting the wording of the resolution, which did not set a firm date for the cease-fire to take effect and excluded attacks on opposition forces identified as terrorists, who make up some of the estimated 580 opposition fighters entrenched in eastern Ghouta.Efforts to combat terrorism do not supersede obligations under international law to protect civilians, Mr. Guterres pointedly reminded his audience, taking aim at Syrian, Russian and Iranian representatives who have stated their determination to keep up military action against terrorist groups.Mr. Guterres demanded that aid agencies be granted access to deliver humanitarian assistance to the nearly 400,000 people in eastern Ghouta who have been besieged for years, and to evacuate hundreds of critically ill patients whose transfer to hospitals less than an hour\u2019s drive away has been resolutely blocked by the government.Speaking immediately after the secretary general, Mr. al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, spread responsibility beyond the powers fighting there. With six months remaining in his term and no intention of extending it, he apparently felt free to be blunt.\u201cSecond to the criminally responsible \u2014 those who kill and maim \u2014 the responsibility for the continuation of so much pain lies with the five permanent members of the Security Council,\u201d he told an audience that included several heads of state and dozens of foreign ministers.Alongside eastern Ghouta, he said Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Yemen had become \u201csome of the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times\u201d because governments had failed to heed warnings and to prevent the rising horrors.The Security Council\u2019s five permanent members should surrender their \u201cpernicious use of the veto,\u201d he said, and accept an initiative from France, one of the five, that would prevent its use where a mass atrocity has occurred.Britain, a permanent member, and 115 countries have expressed support for that proposal. \u201cIt is time, for the love of mercy, that China, Russia and the United States join them,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said.On Monday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered a daily humanitarian truce in eastern Ghouta that would start on Tuesday, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. There was no sign that the cease-fire had taken hold, and it was not clear what effect the Russian announcement might have given the numerous players in the conflict \u2014 most notably those supporting the Syrian government, and Iranian-backed forces.The timing of the humanitarian pause, about 72 hours after the resolution passed, would coincide with when Russia had originally proposed that the cease-fire start. The pause would run for five hours a day, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., and there would be no outright ban on attacks during the rest of the day, in line with the cease-fire loophole allowing attacks on fighters identified as terrorists.The pause would be accompanied by the creation of a \u201chumanitarian corridor\u201d so that civilians could leave, although the location of the corridor was not announced.The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, which is based in Paris, said that within 24 hours of the resolution\u2019s approval, two more hospitals in eastern Ghouta had been hit by airstrikes. It added that there were 31 attacks on 26 medical facilities in the week that ended on Sunday. At least 541 people were killed and thousands wounded in that time it said.\u201cI am ashamed of the U.N. Security Council,\u201d Ziad Alissa, the organization\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cThe most powerful nations in the world are unable to enforce the most basic standards of human rights. Failure to enforce these resolutions calls into question the very reason for this process. They are disconnected from reality.\u201dSyria\u2019s director of forensic medicine, Dr. Zaher Hajo, told Syrian news outlets that 36 people had been killed by rebel mortar shelling in Damascus and government-held suburbs \u201cin the past few days,\u201d among them women and children, and that 200 had been wounded.The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported that mortar shells fired by the rebels had fallen on facilities belonging to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent near Harasta, a government-held suburb north of Damascus.Nada Homsi and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Speechwriter Resigns Amid Abuse Accusations", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 David Sorensen, a White House speechwriter, resigned on Friday after a news report detailed accusations from a former wife who said he had abused her during their marriage.His resignation came two days after Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary, submitted his own resignation after his two former wives publicly accused him of being abusive to them when they were married.Mr. Sorensen denied Ms. Corbett\u2019s account, and insisted that she was the abuser. Responding to a Facebook message on Friday evening, Mr. Sorensen called his former wife \u201ccreative\u201d and later emailed a lengthy statement disputing her account. In the statement, he called her claims \u201cmalicious\u201d and without \u201cauthentic evidence.\u201d He also included photographs that he said were evidence of injuries she left him with during confrontations.He added, \u201cAlthough I had hoped to never have to think about or discuss the woman who spent years physically attacking, threatening and lying about me \u2014 and relentlessly and cruelly bombarding me with unimaginable fits of rage \u2014 this incident is an opportunity to highlight the grossly underreported and unacknowledged issue of female-on-male domestic violence.\u201dAsked why he did not fight to keep his job, Mr. Sorensen said in a Facebook message: \u201cI didn\u2019t want the White House to have to deal with this distraction. It should be able to focus on continuing President Trump\u2019s historic accomplishments for the American People.\u201dA former policy adviser to Gov. Paul Richard LePage of Maine, Mr. Sorensen began working for the Trump administration in May. Julie Rabinowitz, a spokeswoman for Mr. LePage, said in a statement on Friday that the governor had been unaware of the accusations, and that none had been made during Mr. Sorensen\u2019s time in that office.\u201cWithout an allegation or evidence, there was nothing upon which the governor could take action,\u201d she wrote.In a statement, Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, confirmed Mr. Sorensen\u2019s departure.\u201cBefore we were contacted by the media, we learned last night that there were allegations,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cWe immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations and he resigned today.\u201dLike Ms. Corbett, Mr. Porter\u2019s former wives also said they had told the F.B.I. about being abused \u2014 in their cases, more than a year ago. But the background checks were still underway for both men at the time of their resignations, and there is no indication that the White House conducted its own review of either aide.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018An Endless War\u2019: Why 4 U.S. Soldiers Died in a Remote African Desert", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "More than 16 years after 9/11 spurred a broad fight against terrorism, some Americans say it\u2019s time to look at how the country is deploying its forces.Reporting from the desert of Niger to a small town in Georgia, The New York Times reconstructed how four American soldiers lost their lives \u2014 and why they were in Africa to begin with.KOLLO, Niger \u2014 Cut off from their unit, the tiny band of American soldiers was outnumbered and outgunned in the deserts of Niger, fighting to stay alive under a barrage of gunfire from fighters loyal to the Islamic State.Jogging quickly at a crouch, Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black motioned to the black S.U.V. beside him to keep moving. At the wheel, Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright tried to steer while leaning away from the gunfire. But the militants, wielding assault rifles and wearing dark scarves and balaclavas, kept closing in.Sergeant Black suddenly went down. With one hand, Sergeant Wright dragged his wounded comrade to the precarious shielding of the S.U.V. and took up a defensive position, his M4 carbine braced on his shoulder.\u201cBlack!\u201d yelled a third American soldier, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, checking for the wounds. Sergeant Black lay on his back, motionless and unresponsive.Cornered, Sergeant Wright and Sergeant Johnson finally took off, sprinting through the desert under a hail of fire. Sergeant Johnson was hit and went down, still alive.LIBYASaharaNigerALGERIAArlitMALICHADNIGERSahelTongo TongoNiameyBURKINAFASONIGERIA300 milesLIBYASaharaNigerALGERIAArlitMALICHADNIGERSahelTongo TongoNiameyBURKINAFASONIGERIA300 milesLIBYANigerALGERIAArlitNIGERMALITongo TongoNiameyNIGERIA300 milesGulf of GuineaAt that point, Sergeant Wright stopped running. With only the thorny brush for cover, he turned and fired at the militants advancing toward his fallen friend.These were the last minutes in the lives of three American soldiers killed on Oct. 4 during an ambush in the desert scrub of Niger that was recorded on a military helmet camera. A fourth American, Sgt. La David Johnson, who had gotten separated from the group, also died in the attack \u2014 the largest loss of American troops during combat in Africa since the 1993 \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d debacle in Somalia.The four men, along with four Nigerien soldiers and an interpreter, were killed in a conflict that few Americans knew anything about, not just the public, but also their families and even some senior American lawmakers.The deaths set off a political storm in Washington, erupting into a bitter debate over how the families of fallen soldiers should be treated by their commander in chief. In a call with one of the families after the ambush, President Trump was accused of diminishing the loss, telling the soldier\u2019s widow that \u201che knew what he signed up for.\u201d Mr. Trump angrily disputed the claim, leading to a public feud.But beyond the rancor, dozens of interviews with current and former officials, soldiers who survived the ambush and villagers who witnessed it point to a series of intelligence failures and strategic miscalculations that left the American soldiers far from base, in hostile territory longer than planned, with no backup or air support, on a mission they had not expected to perform.They had set out on Oct. 3, prepared for a routine, low-risk patrol with little chance of encountering the enemy. But while they were out in the desert, American intelligence officials caught a break \u2014 the possible location of a local terrorist leader who, by some accounts, is linked to the kidnapping of an American citizen. A separate assault team was quickly assembled, ready to swoop in on the terrorist camp by helicopter. But the raid was scrapped at the last minute, and the Americans on patrol were sent in its place.They didn\u2019t find any militants. Instead, the militants found them. Short on water, the patrol stopped outside a village before heading back to base the next morning. Barely 200 yards from the village, the convoy came under deadly fire.Four months later, tough questions remain unanswered about the chain of decisions that led to American Special Forces troops being overwhelmed by jihadists in a remote stretch of West Africa.How did a group of American soldiers \u2014 who Defense Department officials insisted were in the country simply to train, advise and assist Niger\u2019s military \u2014 suddenly get sent to search a terrorist camp, a much riskier mission than they had planned to carry out? Who ordered the mission, and why were the Americans so lightly equipped, with few heavy weapons and no bulletproof vehicles?More broadly, the deaths have reignited a longstanding argument in Washington over the sprawling and often opaque war being fought by American troops around the world. It is a war with sometimes murky legal authority, one that began in the embers of the Sept. 11 attacks and traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was expanded to Yemen, Somalia and Libya before arriving in Niger, a place few Americans ever think of, let alone view as a threat.The ashes of the fallen twin towers were still smoldering on Sept. 14, 2001, when Congress voted overwhelmingly, with virtually no debate, to authorize the American military to hunt down the perpetrators. It was a relatively narrow mandate, written for those specific attacks, but it has become the underpinning of an increasingly broad mission around the globe. For more than 16 years since that vote, American service members have been deployed in a war that has gradually stretched to jihadist groups that did not exist in 2001 and now operate across distant parts of the world.The result has been an amorphous and contested war that has put Navy SEALs in Somalia and Yemen, Delta Force soldiers in Iraq, and Green Berets in Niger in harm\u2019s way.30 Nigerien soldiersand one interpreterFive killed11 American soldiersFour killedFive killed30 Nigerien soldiers and one interpreter11 American soldiersFour killedThe deadly ambush in October happened on a continent still largely viewed through the lens of humanitarian catastrophes \u2014 a place where most Americans are accustomed to expending dollars, not lives. A military report on what happened, which was supposed to be released in January, is still under review. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters that the investigation runs \u201cthousands of pages.\u201dThe fallout is already underway. A draft of the report has called for the Pentagon to scale back the number of ground missions in West Africa, and to strip commanders in the field of some authority to send troops on potentially high-risk patrols.Perhaps even more significantly, the ambush has exposed holes in the argument that the Pentagon has made under three different administrations: that in many far-flung places, American troops are not actually engaged in combat, but just there to train, advise and assist local troops.After the ambush, members of Congress from both parties said they knew little about the American military presence in Niger, expressing alarm.\u201cThis is an endless war without boundaries, no limitation on time or geography,\u201d Mr. Graham continued, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly where we\u2019re at in the world militarily and what we\u2019re doing.\u201dHis Democratic colleagues claimed equal bewilderment. On the same episode, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said he had also been unaware that there were so many American troops in Niger. He called into question whether the authorization passed in the wake of Sept. 11, and other decades-old war power authorities, left the executive branch with carte blanche authority to send troops into danger without asking Congress first.The Pentagon\u2019s chief spokeswoman, Dana W. White, declined to comment \u201cuntil the investigation is complete.\u201d\u201cWe have to get the investigation right,\u201d she said.But relatives of the fallen soldiers echoed many of the lawmakers\u2019 concerns. Some of Sergeant Wright\u2019s family members did not realize he was in potential danger at all. He had told his maternal grandmother he was in Africa doing \u201cpaperwork.\u201d Some now ask who, and what, the sergeant \u2014 their sergeant \u2014 was sent to fight.\u201cAre we protecting the United States? Who knows?\u201d asked Ginger Russell, one of Sergeant Wright\u2019s aunts. \u201cYou don\u2019t think of your military in Africa. You\u2019re talking to people who didn\u2019t even know how to pronounce \u2018Niger.\u2019 We had to look it up on the map to see exactly where it happened.\u201dThe Wright family is well aware of how the military works. It can trace its lineage in the armed forces to the War of 1812. Sergeant Wright\u2019s father, Arnold, had been a soldier, and his mother, Terri, had been in the military, too.But in a family of military men and women stretching back more than 200 years, Sergeant Wright was the only one who didn\u2019t make it home, the family says.Now one of Sergeant Wright\u2019s older brothers, Will, who served in the Army and was deployed to Afghanistan, is considering joining the military again. The idea pains their father.\u201cWe\u2019ve paid our dues,\u201d he said.Sergeant Wright grew up in the rural town of Santa Claus, Ga., and the towns around it. The streets have names like Rudolph Way and December Drive. At Christmas time, he played Santa Claus for his family.Growing up, he was always trying to outdo his brother, a stellar athlete. When the boys were both playing football, he asked for his jersey number to be 46 \u2014 double the number on his brother\u2019s back \u2014 because \u201che was going to be twice as good,\u201d their father recalled.He was not a natural star but, urged on by his father, he was a tenacious competitor and was in the starting lineup when he was a senior, the year his Bulldogs beat their rivals.\u201cHe came out there to get in the fight every day,\u201d said Brian Fitzgerald, who coached Sergeant Wright.He briefly attended Georgia Southern University as a mechanical engineering major. But he came home and worked on gutters, finding the life unfulfilling. He told his best friend, Alton Bass, that he wanted to join a Special Forces unit.\u201cHe didn\u2019t just want to be any person,\u201d Mr. Bass recalled. \u201cHe wanted to be something special.\u201dHe decided to enlist in the Army in 2012, training at Fort Benning, Ga., and at Fort Bragg, N.C. His buoyant swagger helped hide a fear: he hated parachuting. But he sent his girlfriend a video from one jump. About 30 seconds into the descent, he turned the camera on himself: \u201cAnd that\u2019s how you jump out of an airplane, babe.\u201dBefore he left for Niger last summer, Sergeant Wright took his grandmother\u2019s hand at a going-away party and told her, \u201cThis is the girl for me, Granny, you\u2019ll like her,\u201d Elaine Trull, his grandmother, recalled.A few days before the ambush \u2014 on Sept. 24, his 29th birthday \u2014 Sergeant Wright called his grandmother. She missed the call, so he left a message.Ten days later, two soldiers came to Ms. Trull\u2019s home around midnight. As soon as she saw them, she knew.She still has the message that her grandson left on his birthday.\u201cI\u2019m glad I missed it because he left me a voice mail that I can play over and over,\u201d she said. \u201cThree times in that voice mail, he said, \u2018Granny, I love you.\u2019\u201dThree days after Sept. 11, 2001, Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, was sitting in a pew at the National Cathedral in Washington. It was raining, and the cathedral was teeming with dignitaries. Former Presidents Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford exchanged solemn handshakes. There were many hugs in the cavernous room, but little chatter. Everyone still looked shellshocked and frozen.Ms. Lee was in the same teary, emotional state that seemed to have engulfed everyone in Washington. The cousin of her chief of staff had been on United Airlines Flight 93, the airliner that had crashed near Shanksville, Pa.When the dean of the cathedral, the Very Rev. Nathan D. Baxter, spoke from the pulpit, Ms. Lee scribbled his words on her program.\u201cLet us also pray for divine wisdom, as our leaders consider the necessary actions for our national security,\u201d the reverend said. \u201cThat as we act, we not become the evil we deplore.\u201dWith those words, Ms. Lee said, she knew how she was going to vote on the war authorization measure before the House that night.There was no mention of \u201cAfghanistan,\u201d \u201cOsama bin Laden,\u201d or \u201cAl Qaeda\u201d in the short resolution known as the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F. It simply said that Congress authorizes the president to use \u201call necessary and appropriate force\u201d against the nations, organizations or people that \u201che determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided\u201d the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 \u201cto prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations, or persons.\u201dIn the House chamber, \u201cYea\u201d votes are registered with green lights, and \u201cNay\u201d are red. Ms. Lee looked up after voting. There was only one red light \u2014 hers. Ten people didn\u2019t vote. All the other lights were green.Several of Ms. Lee\u2019s colleagues, mostly women, came up to her in the cloakroom afterward, she said, urging her to change her vote. She didn\u2019t. She was from a military family and had grown up near Fort Bliss, in El Paso. Her father, a World War II veteran in the \u201cBuffalo Soldiers\u201d 92nd Infantry Division of African-American troops, called her that night.Among all the hate mail and death threats that she received in the weeks after, Ms. Lee remembered her father\u2019s words: \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t send our troops into harm\u2019s way without knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201dIn the years since the vote, there have been many debates as the war has expanded to branches of Al Qaeda that did not exist when 9/11 occurred and to new groups \u2014 like the Shabab (Somalia), Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen), the Islamic State (Iraq, Syria, Libya and numerous other countries), Boko Haram (Nigeria) and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Mali, Libya and other parts of northwestern Africa).The mood in Congress has also changed since that night when the House voted in favor of the resolution. Ms. Lee has found many more colleagues in Congress with reservations. Last June, when she made another of her many attempts to repeal the 2001 war authorization, a majority of the members of the House Appropriations Committee supported her.The committee approved Ms. Lee\u2019s proposal, but the House Republican leadership eventually killed her amendment. The debate over the authority continued in the Senate until mid-September, only a few weeks before the ambush in Niger.In fact, the war authorization passed by Congress more than 16 years ago has been used so often to justify the deployment of American troops that some administrations have tried to sidestep criticism by finding other legal powers to invoke, including for American troops in Niger.On Feb. 20, 2013, President Barack Obama sent a short letter to Representative John A. Boehner, then the speaker of the House. Citing the 1973 War Powers Act \u2014 not the 2001 war authorization, which the administration was already under fire for using too often \u2014 the president said the Pentagon would deploy 40 troops to Niger to set up a drone base, conduct reconnaissance flights and help facilitate intelligence gathering for French forces in Mali. The troops, and others to follow, would also provide training and assistance for local Nigerien forces, he said.Now, in the aftermath of the ambush in Niger \u2014 and declarations by members of Congress that they did not know the extent of America\u2019s involvement in the country \u2014 the debate is happening again. Many lawmakers are focusing broadly on the 2001 resolution, the overarching blanket that has been used to justify the deployment of many American troops in hot spots around the world.Ms. Lee says she plans to try again this year.\u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous slope that we\u2019re on,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, who sided with Ms. Lee in the Appropriations Committee but later heeded Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s request to stop it from going to a full vote until the administration could weigh in.Mr. Cole said that American troops should be in West Africa. But, he said, America\u2019s elected representatives should be given a chance to give the go-ahead first.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have people who are in harm\u2019s way and we know we are putting them in a dangerous situation, there ought to be a more thorough discussion of it,\u201d Mr. Cole said.Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black planned parts of his memorial service before he deployed to Niger.It\u2019s something that service members often do. Sergeant Black wanted his mourners to hear \u201cFinnegans Wake,\u201d the 19th-century Irish folk song that later inspired James Joyce\u2019s novel.In the song, Tim Finnegan dies from a fall. But when his mourners accidentally spill whiskey on his corpse, he revives, exclaiming, \u201cThunderin\u2019 Jaysus, do you think I\u2019m dead?\u201dAt the memorial service in Sergeant Black\u2019s hometown, Puyallup, Wash., one of his eulogists explained the choice: \u201cHe wanted people to have fun, even though they were feeling this heavy loss.\u201dThe loss of Sergeant Black was felt keenly in his hometown, where he was remembered as a childhood chess whiz, collegiate wrestler and master of languages. Hans Zeiger, a Washington state senator who was a few years behind him in school, remembers being awed by his intellect.Sergeant Black was fiercely competitive. After a chess tournament in which his brother won a trophy and he did not, he spent the entire summer after fourth grade learning how to perfect his game.Many years later, he taught himself obscure local dialects so he could communicate with people he met on far-flung deployments in the military. He also spoke French and Arabic.When Sergeant Black suffered a rare chess loss, he analyzed what went wrong.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to lose the same way ever again,\u201d said Phil Watson, who grew up playing chess with him.One of his many victories came in his senior year of high school, when he won the 2000 Washington Junior Open with a perfect score, according to Chess.com.The same persistence was evident in wrestling, which he began in high school. Despite being dogged by heat injuries during a high school wrestling camp, he kept at it until he collapsed from heat stroke. After five days in the hospital, he went back and completed the camp, according to his family. He wrestled on the varsity team at Central Washington University, where he graduated in 2002.\u201cHe was a scholar who could win a bar fight,\u201d Mr. Watson said.After college, he moved to Mammoth Lakes, Calif., and worked as a ski instructor and in construction, and met his wife, Michelle, whom he married in 2005.Four years later, he enlisted in the Army, where his family said he found the sort of challenges he always craved, including tough physical training as well as medical studies on nights and weekends.As he prepared to deploy to Niger, Sergeant Black told his father, Hank Black, that he loved him.\u201cI placed my hands on his shoulders and prayed for his safety,\u201d Mr. Black recalled.\u201cThat prayer was not answered,\u201d Mr. Black would later say at the memorial service for his son. \u201cAnd unimaginable grief entered our lives.\u201dSome family members of the fallen soldiers have chosen not to speak about it. Special Forces soldiers value being what they call \u201cquiet professionals,\u201d who don\u2019t seek attention for the dangerous work they do. Before he deployed to Niger, Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson told his family that if he died, he did not want to see his name in the news, said his mother, Debbie Gannon.\u201cI\u2019m going to honor his wishes,\u201d she added in response to a request for an interview.To understand how these men got to Niger, it\u2019s necessary to go back to Aug. 7, 1998, the day that nearly simultaneous truck bombs exploded at two American embassies in East Africa: one in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and the other in Nairobi, Kenya.The attacks, which killed more than 200 people and wounded 5,000 more, thrust Osama bin Laden onto the F.B.I.\u2019s 10 most-wanted fugitives list and started decades of coordination with Kenya to fight terrorism in East Africa.\u201cThose bombings were the wake-up call to say to the United States that there is a threat emerging in Africa,\u201d said Gen. Carter Ham, a former head of the United States Africa Command.Africa had always been more of an afterthought when it came to American military policy. Even today, the United States has 5,000 to 6,000 troops on the entire continent \u2014 compared with 40,000 in Japan, 35,000 in Germany, 25,000 in South Korea and 14,000 in Afghanistan.But Islamist militancy has spread in many parts of Africa, and after the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States doubled down on its counterterrorism strategy on the continent. The Bush administration expanded its presence through new basing agreements and training exercises. The Pentagon moved to build military ties with allies like Morocco and Tunisia, and sought to gain long-term access to countries like Mali and Algeria.More than 1,800 service members were stationed in Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, to conduct counterterrorism operations. Within a few years, that had grown to 4,000 American military personnel and civilian contractors, making it the Pentagon\u2019s only permanent base on the continent.By the end of the Bush administration, American Green Berets were training African armies to guard against infiltration by Qaeda militants. And within the first year of the Obama administration, a string of killings, bombings, kidnappings and other attacks against Westerners and security forces in North and West Africa raised fears that Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in the region, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, was taking a deadly turn, posing a larger security threat.Then an American-trained officer overthrew Mali\u2019s elected government, setting the stage for more than half of the country to fall into the hands of Islamist extremists.France, the former colonial power, eventually intervened. It struck deep inside Islamist strongholds in northern Mali, blunting an Islamist advance and dispersing the militants, who had created one of the largest havens for jihadists in the world.That\u2019s when President Obama informed Congress that he was sending troops to Niger to help French forces and train local soldiers.A month after, American commandos carried out dual raids in Africa, capturing a militant in Libya who had been indicted for his role in the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings, and clashing with the Shabab in Somalia in retaliation for the mall attack.Mr. Obama, at a news conference three days after the raids, declared Africa a place \u201cthat you\u2019re seeing some of these groups gather.\u201d\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have to continue to go after them,\u201d he added.But Mr. Obama also pursued another counterterrorism strategy: relying more on allied or local troops, with a limited American combat role.Militants kept attacking, striking the Radisson Blu hotel in Mali in 2015, the Splendid Hotel in Burkina Faso in 2016 and a beach resort in Ivory Coast in 2016. Westerners, including Americans, were killed. The United States responded by training African militaries, hoping to get them to fight back without committing American troops to another big war, like in Iraq or Afghanistan.By the time President Trump took office in 2017, administration officials showed few signs of backing away from Mr. Obama\u2019s overall strategy in Africa. But the Trump administration stepped up drone strikes in Somalia, and the Pentagon presented the White House with a plan that envisioned at least two more years of combat against Islamist militants there.The plan for Somalia includes new rules quietly signed by Mr. Trump last fall for counterterrorism operations outside of conventional war zones. Mr. Trump removed several limits that Mr. Obama had imposed in 2013 on drone strikes and commando raids, loosening vetting requirements before offensive strikes and dropping assessments that every person targeted poses a specific threat to Americans.While the American counterterrorism efforts in Libya and Somalia drew more attention, Niger had become a place increasingly surrounded by jihadist threats.Brian McKeon, a former top Pentagon official, recalled visiting Niamey, Niger\u2019s capital, in 2015. Military briefers offered him a sobering assessment: The Islamic State threatened from the north, Al Qaeda from the west and Boko Haram from the south and southeast.Niger, with American help, was trying to cope with the cascade of threats. \u201cThe Nigeriens were doing a hell of a lot with not very much,\u201d Mr. McKeon said.The United States military presence in Niger grew from about 100 personnel in 2013 to about 800 troops now. Five years ago, Niger\u2019s government would not have been able to send military patrols outside the capital, said J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Africa Center. That has changed.\u201cIncreasingly, their military patrols are up and along their borders,\u201d said Mr. Pham. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing they\u2019re out there in risky settings. But the downside is, the risks to U.S. forces with them increase.\u201dThe Pentagon\u2019s explanation of what happened to its soldiers in Niger has shifted repeatedly.Within hours of the attack, Defense Department officials said the American ground patrol had been ambushed during a routine reconnaissance mission in which it was simply advising and assisting Nigerien troops.Weeks later, American officials began privately acknowledging that the ambushed soldiers had been diverted from their low-risk patrol and sent several hours away, toward the border with Mali. The change in plans was completely unexpected, and came as the soldiers were already on their way back to base.But an opportunity had suddenly presented itself, American and Nigerien officials now say. Just hours before, American intelligence officials had intercepted a call on an electronic device associated with Doundoun Cheffou, a former cattle herder believed to be a senior lieutenant in a shadowy local group that had recently pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.If captured, Mr. Cheffou, code-named Naylor Road by the military, could lead American forces to Mr. Woodke, said Rudy Atallah, the former director of African counterterrorism policy for the Pentagon.For more than two years, Mr. Cheffou\u2019s group had carried out attacks on Nigerien troops, only to rush back across the border to Mali, taking refuge in a wooded, no-man\u2019s land. French security officials say the Islamic State branch has 40 to 60 core members, but is often joined by sympathetic villagers.American officials rushed to get a surveillance aircraft over the spot of scrubland in southwestern Niger from where the signal had emanated, one American official said. Mr. Cheffou was a \u201cTST,\u201d in military parlance \u2014 a time-sensitive target. Getting there quickly was crucial.\u201cDoundoun is a terrorist, who is recognized as a leader of the group who conducts operations in the border area,\u201d said Niger\u2019s minister of defense, Kalla Moutari. \u201cWe had intelligence confirming the presence of this terrorist,\u201d he added, noting that, \u201con the basis of this information, action was taken.\u201dMilitary officials quickly ordered up an assault team of American, French and Nigerien commandos based in Arlit, 700 miles northeast of the capital, to go after Mr. Cheffou, officials say \u2014 part of a broader counterterrorism mission named Obsidian Nomad.The Nigerien forces at Arlit were specially trained and equipped by the Pentagon for counterterrorism operations like this one. They were accompanied by American Special Forces advisers who had arrived in the country roughly a month before, officials say.It is not clear how many Americans and Nigeriens were assigned to the helicopter assault mission, or who approved the operation. Such raids have been conducted in Somalia, but the tactic was unusual for the American military in West Africa. Senior American officers who have served in West Africa say it probably would have required Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the head of the military\u2019s Africa Command, in Stuttgart, Germany, to approve such a high-level mission.The scramble to pull together a raid and hunt down Mr. Cheffou upended what had been a fairly uneventful day for the four American sergeants already out on patrol.They were part of a group of 11 American and 30 Nigerien soldiers with a very different assignment: to visit a number of villages to meet with residents and leaders. It was considered routine, low risk and something they were well equipped for.Their convoy was composed of eight vehicles: two pickup trucks and a sport utility vehicle for the Americans, and five trucks for the Nigeriens. Most had medium machine guns, capable of being fired by standing and aiming from the bed of the truck. The unit\u2019s vehicles, the only ones assigned for the deployment, were lightly protected but relatively low profile. They could quickly travel overland on missions that were less dangerous than those in Iraq and Afghanistan.Their weapons were similarly configured. The Americans in the group \u2014 an Army Special Forces team called Operational Detachment-Alpha Team 3212 \u2014 had been operating in Niger for a little over a month. Most of the team carried M4 carbines, with sights and suppressors for their rifles, according to the video footage. At least one soldier had a single-shot grenade launcher.For visiting local villages in an area that was supposed to have little militant presence, the team\u2019s weapons and vehicles made sense. But if attacked by a larger, more aggressive force, Team 3212\u2019s members would barely have enough rifles and machine guns to defend themselves.And their trucks, lightly protected with open beds, would leave any passengers inside exposed to enemy fire. Soldiers traveling in the lone S.U.V. could also wind up dangerously confined \u2014 with little ability to shoot back \u2014 inside the vehicle.Starting around 6 a.m. on Oct. 3, the Americans and their Nigerien counterparts headed out from their base in Ouallam, 60 miles north of Niamey, to villages to meet with community leaders, according to two of the Nigerien soldiers on the mission. In the afternoon, their assignment completed, they began to head back to base.Before they got there, a new order came in: provide backup to the assault mission gearing up in Arlit. The plan was not for Team 3212 to join the raid, officials say, but to get close enough to pursue escaping militants or help out as needed.So, without warning, the Army soldiers out on a daylong patrol with their Nigerien trainees were turned around, pushing deeper into potentially hostile territory, lightly equipped for a new mission that exposed them to risks their commanders did not anticipate.It is not clear who gave the order for Team 3212\u2019s new mission. Officers who have served in the region say such a change would require approval and tasking from at least several higher levels \u2014 most likely starting with a major in Niamey and a lieutenant colonel in Chad; a task force commander stationed in Germany; and possibly a two-star general overseeing all special forces operations in Africa, also from Germany, where the United States Africa Command is based.But soon, the plans changed yet again. Back in Arlit, the preparations for the raid were falling apart. Bad weather or mechanical problems scotched the assault team\u2019s helicopter mission, and American spy agencies determined that Mr. Cheffou and a handful of fighters had left the location, officials say. They believed the trail had gone cold.Still, Team 3212 and the 30 Nigeriens with it were moving into position to back up a raid that was no longer happening, officials said. The same chain of command ordered the team to press on \u2014 now on its third assignment in 24 hours. Could the team salvage some of the mission by searching the site where Mr. Cheffou had been, collecting any scraps of information left behind that might offer clues about his hide-outs and network?By this point, current and former military officers and counterterrorism specialists say the team and its chain of command had made some crucial mistakes that would come back to haunt the soldiers.But the American Special Forces had faced virtually no enemy contact during months of patrols in the region, Pentagon officials said. The Nigerien troops who set out alongside the Americans had been to the area where the ambush occurred a total of 19 times without incident, said Brig. Gen. Mahamadou Abou Tarka, a senior Nigerien officer.This led to a general complacency, and a false sense of safety, which took root both in the rank-and-file members of the unit and in their commanders, American and Nigerien officials said. Although the Americans in Team 3212 were well trained, they were new to Niger, and some of the soldiers were on their first tour. They were accompanied by Nigerien troops, who are classified as special forces but are, in fact, their trainees.The sense of urgency and risk that infused the planning around the raid from Arlit seemed to recede once that mission was scrubbed and Mr. Cheffou vanished \u2014 even though he and his fighters may have remained in the area Team 3212 was entering.As the team pushed on toward the location, running on a set of plans hastily put together, the air support assigned to the raid dropped off. French forces that had been alerted to stand by to support the impending operation also stood down. The team, assigned to support a priority mission, was on its own, current and former American military officials say.Raids are typically carried out between the hours of midnight and 5 a.m., when darkness allows troops to take advantage of one of the tools Americans have at their disposal: Night-vision devices.MALIAkabarBissaoTiloaTongo TongoNIGERMangaizeDakala20 milesMALIAkabarTiloaTongo TongoBani BangouNIGERSoumatMangaizeTibili20 milesMALIAkabarTiloaTongo TongoBani BangouNIGERSoumatMangaizeTibili20 milesEven though the mission was scrubbed, Team 3212 apparently stuck to the same schedule. The Americans and Nigeriens bedded down in sleeping bags next to their vehicles, according to one of the Nigerien soldiers. They rose while it was still dark and pushed through to the militant campsite, hidden under a canopy of trees and set back in the rocks just shy of the Mali border.It was empty, the two Nigerien soldiers said. But someone had been there recently: They found tea, sugar and flour, and an abandoned motorcycle. The tracks in the sand indicated that other motorcycles had sped away. They also found signs of weapons, including 14.5-mm rounds that are fired by antiaircraft weapons capable of heavily damaging most lightly armored vehicles. A case of 12.7-mm heavy machine gun bullets was also found, one Nigerien soldier said.The team gathered material from the campsite and began the long drive back to base as the sun was rising. They had traveled no more than 20 miles of the approximately 110-mile journey back when they approached the first village on their route, a speck on the map known as Tongo Tongo.They were tired and out of water, said one of the Nigerien soldiers who survived. They decided to take a break just outside the village, near a well. A group of villagers approached them, and one offered to run to the village to get them the bucket. He returned sometime later, and they filled their bottles with water.It is unclear who approved the pit stop. But whatever the reason, the delay \u2014 in a location close to Mr. Cheffou\u2019s campsite \u2014 made the team more vulnerable with each passing moment in unfamiliar territory. The team had been out for more than a day, pushing through the desert in easy-to-spot vehicles, giving the militants and their web of spotters time to plan an ambush.The village chief walked out to meet the convoy, explaining that several children were sick. The unit began distributing medicine, the Nigerien soldiers said. Some of the soldiers saw men speeding out of the village on motorbikes, they said, possibly to alert the militants.\u201cHow did the terrorists know that the white people were in our village giving out medicine?\u201d said Boubacar Hassane, 45, a villager who was hoeing his millet field outside of the village that day.Some soldiers had the impression that the chief was trying to delay them. He was later arrested, and his phone contained the numbers for known terrorists, including one connected to Mr. Cheffou, Nigerien officials said.Around 11:30 a.m., the patrol left for home. But right outside the village, the convoy came under attack from militants with small arms, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.Early in the firefight, Team 3212\u2019s leader, Capt. Michael Perozeni, and a radio operator, Sgt. First Class Brent Bartels, were both shot and wounded, probably reducing the team\u2019s ability to communicate to higher command, a military official said.In the first radio transmission, the Americans said that Team 3212 was in enemy contact, according to military officials. But they did not call for help for another hour. It\u2019s unclear why. For troops in Niger, radio communications are often plagued by distance and terrain. Whatever the reason, the team was unable to talk with French air support and had to communicate through officers in Niamey, according to a draft report of the investigation.TONGO TONGODirection of incoming fireAMBUSH SITETONGO TONGODirection of incoming fireAMBUSH SITETONGO TONGODirection of incoming fireAMBUSH SITETONGO TONGODirection of incoming fireAMBUSH SITESatellite photograph taken on Oct. 10, 2017, by DigitalGlobe, via TerraServer.At some point, the convoy split up, leaving at least two of the vehicles cut off under heavy gunfire. Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, Sergeant Wright and Sergeant Black were in the black S.U.V.Somehow, it was left behind.Roughly two hours after the ambush began, the first sign of air support arrived. French Mirage jets flew in low and fast. Behind them came French helicopters with American Special Forces stationed in Mali. The helicopters evacuated the American wounded and the other members of the team who made it to the landing zone.The Pentagon has long asserted that the Americans killed were not left behind, and that teams of Nigerien and French forces were in the area immediately, looking for them.The video of the ambush suggests otherwise. At least two of the dead American soldiers were shown stripped of their equipment and photographed by the Islamic State militants at close range. For a period of time, American troops were in the hands of their enemy.That night, the American Special Forces unit from Arlit arrived in helicopters run by a civilian contracting company and recovered the bodies of Sergeant Wright, Sergeant Black and Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson.It wasn\u2019t until Oct. 6 that locals found the body of Sgt. La David Johnson.Twelve days after Sgt. La David Johnson\u2019s death, Mr. Trump called his widow.The conversation did not go well.The call came about 3:30 p.m. as a limousine with Sergeant Johnson\u2019s widow and her two children sat at Miami International Airport, waiting for the plane carrying her husband\u2019s body.Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida and a friend of the family, said she was in the car and heard the president\u2019s comment that Sergeant Johnson \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201dThe president denied saying it, but for many Americans, the exchange and the public fight it set off is the most enduring part of the ambush.Sergeant Johnson had been planning to buy the couple\u2019s first house when he returned. Shortly before heading off to Niger last year, he learned his wife was pregnant.Before joining the Army, he worked in the produce section of the Walmart in a suburb of Miami where he grew up. It was a rough neighborhood, and he was raised by aunts and uncles after his mother died. But friends and family remembered his playful positivity and determination.\u201cSmall resume bout me,\u201d he wrote on Facebook in 2012. \u201cI don\u2019t drink nor smoke, never got arrested, gotta job.\u201dHe was best known around Miami as the Wheelie King, because he commuted to work each day on a bicycle with no front tire, listening to headphones and riding a continuous wheelie that would stretch for miles.From an early age he loved to pull things apart and put them back together. A knack for customizing cars led him to mechanic school, then to the military.He was a regular churchgoer and liked to cook. His sister, Torneisha Ghent, said he had been counting the days until he could come home and see his family.When he finally did return home, it was to live television coverage of his grieving widow, Myeshia Johnson, bent over his coffin as she wept.For at least three of the Americans who died in the ambush, their final moments were recorded.Helmet-camera footage from Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson was apparently seized by the militants after his death. It was later provided to a news agency in Mauritania, the Agence Nouakchott d\u2019Information, or A.N.I. The New York Times, seeking details that would help explain how the attack occurred, bought rights to the video from the news agency last month. (A.N.I. said it did not make any payment to obtain the video.)Times reporters, working with a digital forensics expert, were able to verify the video\u2019s authenticity and piece together the final stages of the attack. But because the video shows the deaths of the service members and also includes packaged Islamic State propaganda footage, Times editors decided not to publish the video itself.In the footage, the three Americans \u2014 Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, Sergeant Black and Sergeant Wright \u2014 are cut off in the desert scrub, under intense fire.Sergeant Black goes down first. Sliding out of the black S.U.V. to help him, Sergeant Wright, the former football player, grabs his friend by the flak jacket and hauls him to the wheel well for cover. He then changes places with Sergeant Johnson and aims over the hood.The gunfire is coming closer now, from a 45-degree angle.Sergeant Wright and Sergeant Johnson begin sprinting flat out. The militants are almost on top of them.Sergeant Johnson, wearing the body camera, trails behind. He is hit and goes down. Sergeant Wright stops running, turns and fires at the militants from behind a bush. The force of his weapon bends the wispy branches like a powerful wind.The militants are moving toward Sergeant Johnson, who is lying exposed on the ground.For several long excruciating breaths, Sergeant Wright keeps the militants away. But there\u2019s only so much one soldier can do. The militants shoot Sergeant Johnson several more times, and then turn all of their fire on Sergeant Wright.He holds them off for as long as he can.Advertisement"}

In addition to Mr. Trump, they address topics like why they team up with corporations and whether they\u2019re imposing their values on other cultures.While the mood in many parts of the world seems to have darkened, Mr. and Ms. Gates say in their letter that they remain militantly optimistic about global progress.\u201cThe headlines are filled with awful news,\u201d they write in the letter. \u201cEvery day brings a different story of political division, violence or natural disaster. Despite the headlines, we see a world that\u2019s getting better.\u201dThey expanded on some of those themes and fielded questions about other topics in the recent interview. It was held at bgC3, a company that oversees many of Mr. Gates\u2019s independent projects, including for-profit investments in clean energy.But when asked about the growing criticism that big technology companies like Facebook and Twitter have faced over their role in spreading misinformation, Mr. Gates said he hadn\u2019t \u201cseen great solutions,\u201d though \u201cI\u2019m hopeful they\u2019ll come.\u201d\u201cThe whole tech world should look at these criticisms, look at these effects, you know, try to make sure that without giving up what\u2019s good about that, that we can reduce some of it,\u201d he said.When asked if the national reckoning over sexual harassment had affected her investments through Pivotal, Ms. Gates said that it hadn\u2019t so far, but that it had encouraged her to use her voice to encourage more women to speak out.\u201cI want to make it O.K. for women to talk about their real experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a long time coming that the sexual harassment stuff worldwide comes out.\u201dMs. Gates has made family planning a focus of her work with the foundation. She said the Trump administration\u2019s decision last year to expand a ban prohibiting American aid to any health organizations that provide or discuss abortion in family planning had caused \u201cchaos\u201d in the field \u2014 forcing them to stall their work as they figured out how to adhere to the rules.And in their annual letter, Ms. Gates, 53, is blunt in her view of the way Mr. Trump communicates.\u201cI wish our president would treat people, and especially women, with more respect when he speaks and tweets,\u201d she writes.A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Gates, 62, said he was particularly worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to cut foreign aid, which the Gates Foundation considers critical in the global battle against disease and poverty. He said that he was reassured that Congress had so far resisted the president\u2019s demands to cut aid and that he and his wife had increased their visits to Republican members of Congress to stress the importance of maintaining the aid budget.\u201cAlthough we disagree with this administration more than the others we\u2019ve met with, we believe it\u2019s still important to work together whenever possible,\u201d he writes in the letter. \u201cWe keep talking to them because if the U.S. cuts back on its investments abroad, people in other countries will die, and Americans will be worse off.\u201dOne of the questions in the letter is about what happens when the two of them disagree. Mr. Gates wrote, \u201cWhen I get really enthusiastic about something, I count on her to make sure I\u2019m being realistic.\u201dMs. Gates said they tended to avoid hashing out their disagreements in front of bigger groups at the foundation, saving them for private discussions, which they have on walks.\u201cHaving a little bit of grist in the system is actually a good thing,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The cause? Fears the economy was heating up, which would lead to a pickup in inflation and Federal Reserve raising rates faster than anticipated.But in the week since the S.&P. 500 has stage a comeback. The index is up 7.6 percent and on pace for best week since 2014, according to Bloomberg. In fact, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 2 percent the past two days despite the latest inflation data coming in much higher than expected.So what happened to those concerns about inflation? One explanation for why stock investors shrugged off the inflation data was a very weak report on retail sales. Investors seemed to take that as evidence the economy is not overheating and that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a very slow pace.Two weeks ago when the sell-off started, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow forecast for first-quarter G.D.P. fell to 3.25 percent from 5.4 percent two weeks ago.\u201cWhile it does appear that inflation is accelerating, it appears much less likely that the economy is really taking off and forcing the Fed into a more aggressive rate hiking cycle,\u201d write the strategists over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The bigger pictureA rising rate environment is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks. Jodie Gunzberg, the head of United States equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, points out that since 1971 the S&P 500:ProPublica\u2019s article centers on the bureau\u2019s handling of investigations into Wells Fargo. It reports that Mr. Mulvaney ordered restrictions on the accessing of personal data of Wells Fargo customers, a move that hampered the bureau\u2019s investigations. An exemption on the freeze was later granted to enforcement staff looking into Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance business. But ProPublica added:Mulvaney\u2019s order has had effects beyond enforcement, hampering the bureau\u2019s efforts to monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer protection rules and conduct research on financial products, according to several staffers. The freeze has even stymied state attorneys general, according to two C.F.P.B. staffers and one attorney for a state office.The tax overhaul requires funds to hold onto investments for three years to qualify for the lower rate. They\u2019ve been getting around it by creating single-member LLCs in Delaware to receive carried interest payouts.More from Miles Weiss of Bloomberg:Four LLCs have been created under the name of Elliott Management Corp., the hedge-fund giant run by Paul Singer. More than 70 have been established under the names of executives at Starwood Capital Group Management, the private-equity shop headed by Barry Sternlicht.The headline reason is his belief that Silicon Valley is too intolerant of conservatives and libertarians.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation report was higher than expected. But weaker retail sales tempered those fears \u2014 at least for equity investors.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeTo some, the bond market is a particularly prescient predictor of economic trends. So is it picking up on an inflationary surge that the Federal Reserve likely will take too long to recognize?But the overheating fears may be overdone. Yesterday\u2019s January inflation report was hardly conclusive. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that the January increase \u201cprobably overstates the underlying trend.\u201dStill, even though there are reasons to believe that while the U.S. economy is breaking out of its recent rut \u2014 thanks to big tax cuts and a revival of the global economy \u2014 it may not be as vibrant as it looks.The economic flyaroundNestl\u00e9 added that its future is likely to contain more deals in the several-hundred-million range of the Blue Bottle Coffee takeover. \u201cThe sweet spot is in small to mid-sized deals, but we don\u2019t want to rule out anything,\u201d its C.E.O., Mark Schneider, said.The deals flyaroundHe also offered this ambition: \u201cI want you to be able to take an Uber and get into the subway \u2014 if the trains are running on time, you\u2019ve got real-time data \u2014 get in the subway, get out and have an Uber waiting for you for right now. Or know that there\u2019s a bike right there for you that gets you where you\u2019re going in the fastest manner.\u201dWhether the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C. are the best venues for this type of regulation is something Congress will have to decide. Neither agency has experience in overseeing virtual currencies, so assigning responsibility to one (or both) will require increased appropriations to develop rules and effective oversight.\u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.

Pervasive stereotypes about older workers, he said, include the perception among employers (and even among many older adults themselves) that \u201cthey\u2019re not tech-savvy, and that they can\u2019t learn new things.\u201dNot true. Although aging brains might take a little longer to learn new tech skills, Dr. Charness said, \u201cthey can still do it.\u201dSome older adults are proving his assertion, not only in mainstream high-tech careers, but also in \u201ctech enabled\u201d positions. These are jobs \u2014 often part time or done remotely, with flexible schedules \u2014 that do not require an advanced degree in computer science or years of experience but do involve some digital proficiency.\u201cThat\u2019s an important distinction,\u201d said Sara Sutton Fell, chief executive and founder of FlexJobs, an online service specializing in remote and flexible employment. \u201cThese are really viable professional opportunities, especially for retirees.\u201dFollowing are older adults who have found second careers in jobs in which technology is the common thread, drawing on their backgrounds and experience to flourish in rapidly changing industries.In 2004, when Geri Lafferty accepted a severance package from E-Trade Financial rather than relocate, she wanted a job that gave her more flexibility. \u201cI stumbled on the idea of virtual assistant,\u201d said Ms. Lafferty, now 67, who lives in San Francisco. A new field at the time, this involves working remotely to help small, typically one-person businesses \u2014 solo-preneurs, as she calls them \u2014 with their administrative and marketing operations.Ms. Lafferty figured her new job would involve doing most of the things she used to do as an executive assistant in marketing. She was wrong about that. \u201cI had to learn a lot of technology,\u201d she said.Her business now thrives. \u201cShe keeps up with the changes,\u201d said one client, Lisa Tener, a writing coach based in Saunderstown, R.I., who has worked with Ms. Lafferty since 2009. Ms. Tener said her virtual assistant had mastered \u201ca very complicated and often consuming customer-relationship management platform\u201d to help her marketing efforts. \u201cI am almost helpless with it myself,\u201d she said.Ms. Lafferty, who took webinars and tutorials to learn the latest digital tools of her trade, dismisses the idea that the job is beyond the grasp of her cohort. \u201cYou can\u2019t be afraid of the tech,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned. You really can\u2019t break the computer by pushing the wrong button.\u201dAt Manufacturers Hanover bank in the early 1980s, Ann Donnelly was a management trainee involved in the rollout of what was then a groundbreaking new technology: A.T.M.s. When the bank merged with Chemical and later Chase, she ended up becoming a higher-level program manager, involved in many tech-driven initiatives.She left the corporate world about 10 years ago and eventually took a part-time job at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Manhasset on Long Island. Ostensibly a cashier, she has recently been lending her expertise to the store\u2019s management, looking at ways to improve efficiency during peak sales times. Right now, she says, this work \u2014 which inevitably involves technology \u2014 is on a small scale and informal. She is fine with the situation.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t need to run big programs like I did in the past,\u201d said Ms. Donnelly, now 64 and living in Bayside, Queens. \u201cI\u2019d be more interested in helping introduce some younger people to the concept of program management.\u201d (Program managers have been defined as \u201csuper\u201d project managers, focused on the strategy and accomplishment of major organizational initiatives.)Although the technology has changed, she said that some of what she experienced as a young manager in a giant financial institution still applies. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to manage projects and programs that will always be usable, regardless of technology,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to live that to learn that.\u201d When he was in his 30s, Earl Fong, a San Francisco resident, returned to school to earn a graduate degree in computer science.

Now back in San Francisco and working as a software developer for the nonprofit Kiva Microfunds, Mr. Fong, now 67, prides himself on being a \u201ccode wrangler\u201d: someone who is adept with all kinds of software code.He may be decades older than many of his fellow wranglers, but Mr. Fong says they all face a similar challenge when it comes to staying relevant. \u201cAnybody in tech has to be constantly in learning mode,\u201d he said.Marcy Brown, 65, retired from a career as a paralegal to become a \u201cgray nomad\u201d with her husband, touring the country in an RV. While on the road, Ms. Brown, an Indiana native, started a new career as a transcriptionist. \u201cIt was typing depositions, and I\u2019d been in a law office, so I knew the format,\u201d she said.Ms. Brown was not daunted that she would need to become fluent in a professional transcription program to do the job remotely. Her business eventually expanded beyond the courts, and she now transcribes everything from oral histories to college lectures.Although she and her husband sold the RV and now live in what she calls a \u201csticks and bricks\u201d home in Gravois Mills, Mo., she continues doing her transcription work and has expanded her digital competencies. For one recent legal project, she had to put audio time stamps on portions of the transcription that were inaudible. This required another advanced program that she mastered.Yet she is modest about her tech skills. \u201cI posted a video on Facebook the other day that I made out of photos and music, and someone said, \u2018You are so smart,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, it\u2019s mostly trial and error.\u2019\u201dWilliam Jones, 55, started his computer career in the 1980s, working in mainframes for a credit card company in his native Birmingham, England.

Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.\u2019s rule.The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: \u201cCourts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition\u2014tell the S.E.C.\u2014Congress imposed.\u201d By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers.One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don\u2019t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.\u2019s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation.\u2014 Peter J. HenningWhy?There didn\u2019t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish.Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday\u2019s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on.In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained.\u2014 Peter EavisBroadcom\u2019s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders. From the news release:Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS\u2019s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP\u2019s activist stockholders.Let\u2019s take a look at the math\u2022 Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price.\u2022 Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn\u2019t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year.The bet on the shareholder meetingBroadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm\u2019s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees.A Qualcomm representative didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe deals flyaroundLittle in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey\u2019s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cIf these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place.During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter.The tower would be the first major project under New York City\u2019s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area.Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software.Here\u2019s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor\u2019s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: \u201cWe are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.\u201dGlassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants.Skadden\u2019s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.The judge overseeing the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T\u2019s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not \u201cmade a credible showing\u201d that the White House had singled it out for retribution.The decision puts a crimp in AT&T\u2019s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal.AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list \u2014 but could call him during the trial if needed.The trial begins March 19.Symptom A: Albertsons buying Rite Aid to gain scale and enter the pharmacy businessSymptom B: Walmart\u2019s online sales growing just 23 percent in the fourth quarter, after it splashed out on Jet.com, Bonobos and more\u201cIt\u2019s the battle of the old generation versus the new generation,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. \u201cAnd right now the companies that are gaining share is the new generation.\u201dCritics\u2019 cornerElsewhere in Amazon newsFrom Peter Eavis:For the first time \u2014 and after much protest \u2014 public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of their C.E.O.s.

{"Headline": "The Politics of Sex (Scandals)", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo people, how do you think the sex scandal in Missouri will affect the Democrats\u2019 attempt to take control of the Senate?That was actually a test. Which part of the sentence got your attention? Sex or the fate of the November elections? I\u2019ll bet that tells a lot about your character.Actually, it\u2019s easy to talk about both. The House could change hands! If it does, do you think it will involve the Pennsylvania district where Republican Tim Murphy, a strong anti-abortion conservative, had to resign after he got caught urging his lover to have an abortion if she got pregnant? Or the district next door, where the former lover has announced she\u2019s running against a Democratic incumbent?Everything\u2019s a tea leaf, simmering in sex. This week Linda Belcher, a Democrat, won a special election for the Kentucky State House of Representatives in a rural district that had previously been controlled by a Republican. This was seen in some circles as a sign that the Democrats were going to ride an anti-Trump wave in November and retake control of Congress.\u201cThe results here show that if we can win in this district we can win anywhere,\u201d said the chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party.Well, there were a couple of details. Belcher had actually represented the district before, then lost in 2016 to Dan Johnson, a right-wing Republican whose Facebook posts included one depicting the Obamas as apes and another announcing: \u201cAllah sucks. Mohammed sucks. Islam sucks.\u201dJohnson, who was also the bishop of an evangelical church, killed himself in December after he was accused of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old parishioner. Belcher defeated his widow, who is refusing to concede, claiming \u201cwidespread voter fraud.\u201dThis does feel kind of \u2026 unique to be a bellwether.The Missouri story has the advantage of being way less depressing. The sex appears to have been totally consensual until the point when the governor tied his naked lover to a piece of exercise equipment and took her picture.See, you\u2019re already getting interested and I haven\u2019t gotten anywhere near the connection to the November Senate races.Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, is a 43-year-old up-and-comer who was rumored to nurture presidential aspirations until the recent unpleasantness. In his campaign announcement he introduced himself as \u201ca Navy SEAL, native Missourian and most importantly, a proud husband and father.\u201dNow, he admits that when he was gearing up to run for office in 2015, he had an affair with his hair stylist. We are a pretty jaded country at this point, and this news alone would hardly be the sort of thing that would cause his constituents to faint. Or even, probably, mention over coffee.As usual, the problem came with the details. Greitens, according to the story everyone in Missouri who is not in a coma now knows, invited the woman to his home for a series of assignations \u2014 presumably when the wife and kids were off premises. At one point he took her into the exercise room for sex, taped her hands to some rings, blindfolded her and then \u2026 snapped her picture.\u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019re never going to mention my name,\u2019\u201d the woman recounted later. Otherwise, she said, the governor warned \u201cthere will be pictures of me everywhere.\u201d This was during a confession to her husband, who secretly taped the whole thing. Really, I think it\u2019s possible to feel sorry for the hair stylist.This week, a grand jury indicted Greitens for taking the picture \u201cin a manner that allowed access to that image via a computer.\u201d Which turns out to be a felony.Greitens\u2019s wife, Sheena, is standing by him. The governor is going around talking about his tax plan, which does not seem to be the first thing on most people\u2019s minds. The Republican-dominated legislature is gearing up for inquiries, possibly with an eye to impeachment.This story leaves those of us who do not live in Missouri with several questions. One of which, of course, is, \u201cWhat kind of person is this?\u201d Another is whether the scandal will have any effect on the upcoming Missouri Senate race, in which Senator Claire McCaskill is one of the most vulnerable of all the Democrats running for re-election.Her opponent, Attorney General Josh Hawley, has strong connections with Greitens and something of a history of attempting to be holier-than-thou on matters relating to sex.Hawley has criticized McCaskill for not being faster to call for Senator Al Franken to resign, but he still hasn\u2019t demanded that his governor step down. Just this week he attempted to link McCaskill with Harvey Weinstein, claiming that she gave Weinstein \u201ca taxpayer-funded advertisement for his movie.\u201d This would have been a meeting McCaskill had in 2014 with Philomena Lee, a woman whose attempts to find the baby she\u2019d given up for adoption in her youth had been made into a Weinstein film.So far we have a photos-of-naked-woman-taped-to-exercise-rings sex scandal on the Republican side and a meeting to talk about adoption issues for the Democrat.Can\u2019t wait to see what happens next. Maybe another state can come up with sadomasochism in the sauna.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tragedy at Sea 3,000 Miles Away Resonates in Pakistani Village", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGujrat JournalGUJRAT, Pakistan \u2014 The family, faces torn with grief, huddled around their phones, replaying voice messages sent from 3,000 miles away.\u201cI can\u2019t talk too loudly or they\u2019ll take my phone away,\u201d said a panicked, hushed voice in one. \u201cDon\u2019t call me because it will make the ringer go off, they\u2019ll hear it and I\u2019ll get caught,\u201d it cautioned in another. And finally, \u201cPlease tell the agent to send the money to Libya.\u201dThe 16 bodies that have been found arrived in Pakistan earlier this month. Seven of the confirmed dead were, like Mr. Shabir, from tiny Gujrat, in northern Punjab Province, which has been rocked by the disaster.Mr. Shabir left his hometown here, near Pakistan\u2019s border with India, with his 24-year-old cousin, Mazhar Hussain, in December. Their families say the pair collected around $13,000, a fortune for even the well-to-do, to pay a local smuggler who guaranteed safe passage to Europe. When news of the capsizing trickled back to Gujrat, the young men\u2019s families tried frantically, but unsuccessfully, to reach them.Azhar Hussain says he knew his brother Mazhar was dead when he saw a photo of his body posted on Facebook, circulated by Pakistanis in Libya to help confirm victims\u2019 identities.Azhar Hussain covered his face with his shawl as Mr. Shabir\u2019s older brother, looked at the picture of Mazhar Hussain\u2019s grayish body, covered in sand. With Mr. Shabir\u2019s death not certain, the men remained glued to their phones, scouring gruesome photos for his face.The houses serve in a sense as billboards for smugglers, proof of money to be made abroad. Ansar Burney, a Pakistani civil rights activist who works to end people smuggling, said the message was persuasive. \u201cIf I\u2019m living in these rural towns, I\u2019d be convinced I should go, too,\u201d he said.For Mr. Shabir, the appeal was hypnotic. \u201cWe begged him not to go,\u201d his mother, Hamida Bibi, said between desperate prayers for her son. \u201cBut he had made up his mind long ago.\u201dHis cousin, Mazhar Hussain, the oldest son in his family, also was drawn by the lure of fantastic wealth and hoped to send money home. \u201cNow, we\u2019re left with nothing,\u201d his brother Azhar said. \u201cWe sold what land we had to collect money for his ticket to Europe. My parents are old, and I can\u2019t find steady work. It\u2019s like we lost everything when we lost him.\u201d\u201cThe Saudis took an initiative to reduce all overseas labor, Pakistanis included,\u201d said Jabbar Chaudry of Pakistan\u2019s Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, adding, \u201cThe educated and semi-educated youth no longer have legal windows of opportunity.\u201dWith legal options for migrant workers shrinking, the Libyan route to Europe has become popular. According to the International Organization for Migration, in January about 240 Pakistanis crossed into Italy from Libya, making them the third largest nationality represented. By comparison, only nine were reported in January 2017.The cousins reached Libya by air and, according to their families, had legitimate visas. \u201cThey took a flight from Lahore to Dubai, then Kuwait to Turkey, then they reached Libya,\u201d Azhar Hussain said. \u201cThey would call us from a different airport every day for a few days.\u201dIn Libya they joined the tens of thousands trying to reach Europe, and fell into the hands of smugglers demanding more money. Some of the men\u2019s last messages relayed the horror of being captive and beaten while others around them were tortured. Pressed for money, their families begged the smuggler in Gujrat to help and eventually came up with $1,000 more to secure the men\u2019s journey onward.This new path through Libya should get more scrutiny, said Mohsin Waheed Butt, an officer with the Pakistani Federal Intelligence Agency. \u201cImmigration officers, they need to inquire why people are going to Libya,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind of a person is going to Libya right now? It\u2019s obvious these guys are going for only one thing.\u201dBut Mr. Burney, the rights advocate, believes the government is on some level complicit, saying: \u201cThese smugglers are flush with cash. They\u2019re getting Libyan visas in the dozens, and they\u2019ve bought off the immigration officers sitting at the airport, too.\u201dThe director general of the Federal Intelligence Agency, Bashir Memon, confirmed that all of the Pakistanis whose bodies were recovered after the capsizing had gone to Libya legally. He said law enforcement agencies \u201ctry their best\u201d to counter \u201ca whole mafia of smuggling\u201d in the region.A short drive from where the cousins lived, Muhammad Khan held court recently in his ancestral house. Villagers came to offer condolences after learning that his nephew died in the capsizing with his wife and children, the younger less than 2 months old.The nephew, Ismail Khan, moved his family to Libya two years ago, hoping to find work as a laborer. His uncle said he had not known the younger Mr. Khan wanted to go to Europe until after the family had died.The uncle said he emigrated to Britain legally 30 years ago, and had been back in Gujrat on vacation when he learned about the deaths. \u201cMy family lives in Manchester now, and we have a good life,\u201d he said.Mr. Khan said he left Pakistan for the same reason his nephew Ismail did. \u201cWhen you live here, you lose hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see hope for years on end. So, when someone presents you with an opportunity, a small window of hope, you\u2019ll risk it all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She was in the bedroom with two of the children; one child opened the apartment door to allow the officers inside, the police said.The officers entered the apartment and spotted Ms. Baskerville outside of the window before she fell, the police said. Emergency responders transported her to Mount Sinai St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, where she died.

Ms. Baskerville faced assault and harassment charges after being accused of kicking in his apartment door and damaging the lock on Jan. 26.

{"Headline": "These Skates Are Made for Walking", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA fish that scurries along the seafloor uses the same neurons and genes that help land vertebrates walk, suggesting the blueprint for walking originated much earlier than previously thought.The circuits of neurons that govern walking, many have long thought, emerged sometime after that, as creatures transitioned from swimming to limb-based locomotion.You can trace the heritage of little skates and land vertebrates back to a common ancestor that lived about 420 million years ago. This primitive fish gave rise to the vast majority of vertebrate species, including all fish with paired fins. Typically, these pectoral and pelvic fins \u2014 which correspond to forelimbs and hindlimbs in land vertebrates \u2014 are small and largely used for balance and steering. To really propel themselves, most fish wriggle their powerful tails.In land vertebrates, or tetrapods, walking is partly characterized by this left-right alternation as well as rhythms of extending and flexing. These patterns are governed by networks of neurons that work together to inhibit and activate complementary types of muscles. When excitatory neurons are firing to your left leg muscles, for example, inhibitory ones are firing to your right. Similarly, as some neurons tell your extension muscles to contract, others tell your flexion ones to relax.Several gene switches found in tetrapods, which are important for the development and function of motor neurons that control tetrapods limbs, are active in those controlling the skates\u2019 fins too, the scientists found.Furthermore, neurons that help govern left-right alternation and extension-flexion in walking tetrapods were also present in little skates.The neurons and genetic programming shared between little skates and land vertebrates suggest that the two groups evolved their walking behaviors from an ancient system, said Tetsuya Nakamura, an assistant professor of genetics at Rutgers University who did not participate in the research. \u201cOur ancestral fish already had the cell types that later led to walking,\u201d he said.Dr. Dasen agreed.\u201cIt kind of goes against the idea that evolution is a way of taking something simple and making it more sophisticated,\u201d he said.Instead, it seems the common ancestor of most vertebrates already had a sophisticated blueprint in place. Over hundreds of millions of years, evolution tweaked this mold to generate vastly different life-forms \u2014 from fish that swim and scuttle to land vertebrates that walk, hop, slither and fly.____Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Reduce Shootings", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "\nIt has happened yet again: Inevitably, predictably, fatefully, a gunman shot dead 26 people in a Texas church on Sunday. These incidents are peculiarly American tragedies, and what\u2019s particularly heartbreaking is that they aren\u2019t shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the U.S. do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence.Two of the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history have occurred in the last six weeks. So let\u2019s not just mourn the dead, let\u2019s not just lower flags and make somber speeches. Let\u2019s also learn lessons from these tragedies, so that there can be fewer of them. In particular, I suggest that we try a new approach to reducing gun violence \u2013 a public health strategy.Guns per 100 peopleThe United States stands alone among developed countries: It has by far the highest rate of firearms ownership.88.8United States45.7switzerland31.6Sweden31.2france30.8canada30.3germany15.0Australia11.9italy10.4spain6.2England, wales0.6JapanGun murders per 100,000 peopleAmerica\u2019s private arsenal is six times as lethal as Canada\u2019s, and 30 times worse than Australia\u2019s.3.00United States0.7Italy0.5Canada0.3Sweden0.2Germany0.2Switzerland0.1Australia0.1England, Wales0.1france0.1Spain0JapanGuns per 100 peopleThe United States stands alone among developed countries: It has by far the highest rate of firearms ownership.88.8United States45.7switzerland31.6Sweden31.2france30.8canada30.3germany15.0Australia11.9italy10.4spain6.2England, wales0.6JapanGun murders per 100,000 peopleAmerica\u2019s private arsenal is six times as lethal as Canada\u2019s, and 30 times worse than Australia\u2019s.3.0United States0.7Italy0.5Canada0.3Sweden0.2Germany0.2Switzerland0.1Australia0.1England, Wales0.1france0.1Spain0JapanGun enthusiasts often protest: Cars kill about as many people as guns, and we don\u2019t ban them! No, but automobiles are actually a model for the public health approach I\u2019m suggesting.We don\u2019t ban cars, but we work hard to regulate them \u2013 and limit access to them \u2013 so as to reduce the death toll they cause. This has been spectacularly successful, reducing the death rate per 100 million miles driven by 95 percent since 1921.Take a look at the history of motor vehicle safety since World War II:Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.3581968  First federal safety standards for cars64201621.18\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910sDeaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled19469.35First seatbelt offered in an American carFirst federal safety standards for cars81974  55 m.p.h. national speed limit1993  Car safety ratings introduced61978  Tennessee is first to require child safety seats1999  Airbags, invented in 1951, become mandatory1984  4New York is first to require seat belt use2000  Mandatory reporting of defects by carmakers201621.18\u201946\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s2000s\u201910s\u201916Frankly, liberal opposition to guns has often been ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive. The 10-year ban on assault weapons accomplished little, partly because definitions were about cosmetic features like bayonet mounts (and partly because even before the ban, such guns were used in only 2 percent of crimes).The left sometimes focuses on \u201cgun control,\u201d which scares off gun owners and leads to more gun sales. A better framing is \u201cgun safety\u201d or \u201creducing gun violence,\u201d and using auto safety as a model\u2014constant efforts to make the products safer and to limit access by people who are most likely to misuse them.What would a public health approach look like for guns if it were modeled after cars? It would include:If someone steals my iPhone, it\u2019s useless, and the same should be true of guns. Gun manufacturers made child-proof guns back in the 19th century (before dropping them), and it\u2019s time to advance that technology today. Some combination of smart guns and safe storage would also reduce the number of firearms stolen in the U.S. each year, now about 200,000, and available to criminals.We also need to figure out whether gun buybacks, often conducted by police departments, are cost-effective and help reduce violence. And we can experiment more with anti-gang initiatives, such as Cure Violence, that have a good record in reducing shootings.In Texas on Sunday, it seems that a man living near the church grabbed his gun and confronted the shooter after he left the church. It may be that this defensive use of a weapon saved lives, and the N.R.A. often hails this view that guns are necessary to counter gun violence.But really?

The Las Vegas carnage, for example, might not have been prevented by any of the suggestions I make.That\u2019s true, and there\u2019s no magic wand available. Yet remember that although it is mass shootings that get our attention, they are not the main cause of loss of life. Much more typical is a friend who shoots another, a husband who kills his wife \u2013 or, most common of all, a man who kills himself. Skeptics will say that if people want to kill themselves, there\u2019s nothing we can do. In fact, it turns out that if you make suicide a bit more difficult, suicide rates drop.Here are the figures showing that mass shootings are a modest share of the total, and the same is true of self-defense \u2013 despite what the N.R.A. might have you believe.OTHER CAUSESDEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456VICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:OTHER CAUSESVICTIMS KILLINGPERPETRATORS INSELF-DEFENSE:589DEATHS INMASSSHOOTINGS:456SHARE OF ALLGUN DEATHS:Yet while we should be moving toward sensible regulation, in fact we\u2019ve been moving in the opposite direction.

In 1995, Connecticut tightened licensing laws, while in 2007 Missouri  eased gun laws.The upshot? After tightening gun laws, firearm homicide rates dropped 40 percent in Connecticut. And after Missouri eased gun laws, gun homicide rates rose 25 percent.Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsEstimated change in\u201340%Estimated change in\u201315%Missouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change in+25%Estimated change in+16%Connecticut after 1995 lawtightening licensing requirementsMissouri after 2007 repealof license requirementsEstimated change inrate of gun homicide\u201340%+25%Estimated change inrate of gun suicide\u201315%+16%One of the lessons of gun research is that we often focus just on firearms themselves, when it may be more productive to focus on who gets access to them. A car or gun is usually safe in the hands of a 45-year-old woman with no criminal record, but may be dangerous when used by a 19-year-old felon with a history of alcohol offenses or domestic violence protection orders.Yet our laws have often focused more on weapons themselves (such as the assault weapons ban) rather than on access. In many places, there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms.In these two states, the laws affected access, and although there\u2019s some indication that other factors were also involved in Connecticut (and correlations don\u2019t prove causation), the outcomes are worth pondering.There\u2019s simply a scandalous lack of research on gun violence, largely because the N.R.A. is extremely hostile to such research and Congress rolls over. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did try to research gun violence, Congress responded by cutting its funding.Here is the American toll from four diseases and firearms over the years 1973-2012 \u2013 and the number of National Institutes of Health research grants to explore each problem over that same time.N.I.H. research awardsDiseaseNumber of casesRabies6556Polio266212Cholera400129Diphtheria1,33789Firearmsinjuries3>4 millionNumberof casesDiseaseN.I.H. research awardsRabies6589Polio266129Cholera400212Diphtheria1,33756Firearm Injuries3>4 millionOne approach that could reduce the abuse of guns is better training. As a 13-year-old farm boy in Oregon, I attended a N.R.A. gun safety class (which came with a one-year membership to the N.R.A., making me an N.R.A. alum who despises what that organization has become). These classes can be very useful, and audits found that more than 80 percent cover such matters as checking the gun to see if it\u2019s loaded, keeping one\u2019s finger off the trigger until ready to fire and being certain of the target.Yet the audits also suggest that trainers are more likely to advocate for the N.R.A. or for carrying guns than for, say, safe storage. This is a missed opportunity, for all classes should cover the risks of guns and alcohol, the risks of abuse with suicide and domestic violence, the need for safe storage, and so on.

But I\u2019m more optimistic.Look, we all agree on some kinds of curbs on guns. Nobody believes that people should be able to drive a tank down Main Street, or have an anti-aircraft gun in the backyard. I\u2019ve been to parts of northern Yemen where one could actually buy a tank or an anti-aircraft gun, as well as fully automatic weapons \u2014 and that area\u2019s now embroiled in a civil war \u2013 but fortunately in America we have agreed to ban those kinds of weaponry.So the question isn\u2019t whether we will restrict firearms, but where to draw the line and precisely which ones to restrict.Check out these polling numbers as a basis for action on gun safety:Agree with the following:Householdswith no gunsGun households50%Background checksfor all gun buyers93%96%Preventing mentally ill from buying guns8989Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289Ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines(10+ bullets)*5277Householdswith no gunsGun householdsAgree with the following:50%93%Background checks for all gun buyers96%89Preventing the mentally ill from buying guns89Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes8885Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists8284Background checks for private sales and at gun shows7787Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases7289A ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun6779A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence6175New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns5771Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence5681Creating a federal database to track gun sales5480A ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines (10+ bullets)*5277Looking ahead, I\u2019m optimistic that there can be progress at the state level, and some of the necessary research funding will come from private foundations. Maybe some police departments will put in orders for smart guns to help create a market.But the real impetus for change will come because the public favors it. In particular, note that 93 percent of people even in gun households favor universal background checks for gun purchases.The terrible truth is that Wednesday\u2019s school shooting was 100 percent predictable. So is the next one. After each such incident, we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims, but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability.Some of you will protest (as President Trump did the last time) that it\u2019s too soon to talk about guns, or that it is disrespectful to the dead to use such a tragedy to score political points. Yet more Americans have died from gun violence, including suicides, since 1970 (about 1.4 million) than in all the wars in American history going back to the Revolutionary War (about 1.3 million). And it\u2019s not just gang members: In a typical year, more preschoolers are shot dead in America (about 75) than police officers are.Yes, making America safer will be hard: There are no perfect solutions. The Second Amendment is one constraint, and so is our polarized political system and the power of the gun lobby. There\u2019s a lot of talk about banning assault weapons, for example, but the 10-year assault weapons ban didn\u2019t accomplish much for reducing gun violence, partly because defining assault weapons proved to be much more complex than anybody had anticipated (in the end, the definition depended partly on cosmetic features). And new restrictions have limited effectiveness because we have delayed so long that there are already so many guns out there. So it\u2019s unclear how effective some of my suggestions will be, and in any case this will be a long, uncertain, uphill process.But automobiles are a reminder that we can chip away at a large problem through a public health approach: Just as auto safety improvements have left us far better off, it seems plausible to some gun policy experts that a sensible, politically feasible set of public health steps could over time reduce firearm deaths in America by one-third \u2014 or more than 10,000 lives saved each year.So let\u2019s not just shed tears for the dead, give somber speeches and lower flags. Let\u2019s get started and save lives. Let\u2019s not accept that school classrooms can turn any moment into war zones.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s 2020 Campaign Announcement Had a Very Trumpian Rollout", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With just 980 days to go until the next presidential election, President Trump said Tuesday that he would run again in 2020, an announcement that several White House advisers said simply meant the president would step up his preferred and much-missed activity of performing for an adoring crowd.In effect, it continues the permanent campaign of a president who, from the time he took office over a year ago, has signaled his interest to run again and has kept holding campaign-style rallies. The president officially filed for re-election with the Federal Election Commission on Jan. 20, 2017, the day of his inauguration.But another part of Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement \u2014 that Brad Parscale, his 2016 campaign digital director, would be elevated to campaign manager \u2014 signaled a more complicated political maneuver on behalf of the president\u2019s family, and specifically Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, according to the president\u2019s advisers.Mr. Parscale did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, but in an interview with The New York Times in June, he described himself as a \u201cblue-collar kid from Kansas who understood what Trump was saying,\u201d and spoke at length about his devotion to the Trump family.\u201cI was always the family guy on the campaign,\u201d Mr. Parscale said. \u201cIf I saw or heard anything that I didn\u2019t think was good for the family, my loyalty was to the family first.\u201dIn another interview, in August, Mr. Parscale described his role on the 2016 campaign.\u201cI build the plumbing,\u201d he said. \u201cI changed the plumbing of campaigns, from moving it from TV to digital.\u201dKellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2016 and now a counselor to the president, described Mr. Parscale as an \u201cunbroken thread\u201d from that campaign. \u201cIt should surprise no one that family members and a major player who has not come inside the administration would be called upon to redouble that effort for the re-elect,\u201d Ms. Conway said.Last year Mr. Parscale also took a sizable cut from the Trump campaign. The biggest single expenditure of the $17 million it spent in 2017 was the $5.5 million it paid for digital advertising, nearly all of which passed through firms owned by Mr. Parscale.The campaign\u2019s announcement made a point of emphasizing Mr. Parscale\u2019s loyalty to the Trump family. The statement featured quotations from Mr. Kushner and Eric Trump, the president\u2019s middle son, who, along with his wife, Lara, and older brother, Donald Jr., have been active in the campaign.Mr. Kushner said Mr. Parscale \u201cwas essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run,\u201d adding, \u201cHis leadership and expertise will help build a best-in-class campaign.\u201dEric Trump described Mr. Parscale as \u201can amazing talent\u201d and said he \u201chas our family\u2019s complete trust and is the perfect person to be at the helm of the campaign.\u201dThe specifics of Mr. Parscale\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, including his tactics to reach voters using social media platforms, has also been of interest to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Last year, he agreed to meet with the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.President Trump may be itching to hit the campaign trail, where he is happiest, but the White House still has a rail-thin political operation. Despite efforts to hire new staff members, it has struggled for months to catch up to speed. And on Tuesday, the West Wing was set to lose another key aide: Mr. Kushner\u2019s spokesman, Josh Raffel, said he would be departing.The 2020 campaign announcement, as is common in Trump world, didn\u2019t quite go off without a hitch: For starters, it initially alarmed ethics experts, who said its description of Mr. Kushner as \u201csenior adviser and assistant to the president, and President Trump\u2019s son-in-law,\u201d was in violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits political activities by government employees. The announcement was later edited to remove \u201csenior adviser.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got a campaign that\u2019s obsessed with campaigning and doesn\u2019t even know what the Hatch Act rules are around Jared Kushner,\u201d Richard W. Painter, who served as a White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any idea what the rules are, and they really don\u2019t care.\u201dKatie Rogers reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

If so, would you ever consider disconnecting from a particular platform you use now, or leaving all your social media feeds entirely? What do you think you would gain or lose?To be clear, it\u2019s not brave to quit Twitter, or righteous (I\u2019m still on Facebook, which is just a differently shaped moral stockyard), or noteworthy. Quitting Twitter is just a thing that you can do. I mention it only because there was a time when I didn\u2019t think it was a thing that I could do, and then I did it, and now my life is better.I\u2019m frequently approached by colleagues, usually women, who ask me about quitting Twitter with hushed titillation, as if I\u2019ve escaped a cult or broken a particularly seductive taboo. Well, here\u2019s what my new life is like: I don\u2019t wake up with a pit in my stomach every day, dreading what horrors accrued in my phone overnight. I don\u2019t get dragged into protracted, bad-faith arguments with teenage boys about whether poor people deserve medical care, or whether putting nice guys in the friend zone is a hate crime. I don\u2019t spend hours every week blocking and reporting trolls and screen-grabbing abuse in case it someday escalates into a credible threat. I no longer feel like my brain is trapped in a centrifuge filled with swastikas and Alex Jones\u2019s spittle. Time is finite, and now I have more of it.At the same time, I know this conversation is more complicated than that. I\u2019ve lost a large platform to self-promote and make professional connections, which isn\u2019t something many writers can afford to give up (less established writers and marginalized writers most of all \u2014 in a horrid irony, the same writers disproportionately abused on Twitter). I get my news on a slight delay. I seethe at the perception that I ceded any ground to trolls trying to push me out. I will probably never persuade RuPaul to be my friend. Also, I loved Twitter. Twitter is funny and smart and validating and cathartic. It feels, when you are embroiled in it, like the place where everything is happening.

Why?\u2014 Would you ever consider giving up all social media for a short time?\u2014 What about permanently giving it up?\u2014 Ms. West mentions that because she\u2019s a writer, there is an expectation that she engage with the \u201cdiscourse\u201d taking place on social media as well as use social media to network.

{"Headline": "Google Chrome Now Blocks Irksome Ads. That\u2019s a Good Thing, Right?", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingAs advertising has become more intrusive in recent years, hundreds of millions of web users have installed ad-blocking software to ward off full-page pop-ups, blaring video pitches that start automatically and large ads with unstoppable countdown clocks that obscure the content you actually want to see.On Thursday, Google did something about the problem: The company updated its browser, Google Chrome, so that it bans such ads by default on mobile devices and desktop computers.The change will probably improve the average person\u2019s internet day \u2014 and give the tech giant an even greater role in shaping the web.The update to Chrome, first announced last year, is not a universal ad-blocker, the company insisted, but a filter. It will affect only those websites that allow four types of desktop ads and eight types of mobile ads that violate the standards established by a group called the Coalition for Better Ads, of which Google is a member (as is Facebook).For the most part, the update has been embraced by the industry. After all, it seems like a win for publishers, quality advertisers and users alike.But Google did not become the creator of the world\u2019s most popular browser and a dominant advertising force by running its business in a manner that did not serve its own interests.With the Chrome update, the company hopes to come out ahead by lessening the temptation of web users to install more comprehensive ad-blocking software. In other words, Google is betting that ridding the web of especially intrusive ads will render it more hospitable to advertising in general \u2014 and more profitable for advertisers and Google itself.Utilizing Chrome\u2019s popularity in this way is yet another example of Google\u2019s singular position in the modern web.\u201cChrome literally exists to protect Google\u2019s advertising business,\u201d said Mark Mayo, a vice president at Mozilla, the company behind the web browser Firefox, a competitor to Chrome. \u201cGoogle has done a tremendous amount of stuff \u2014 their products are web-based \u2014 and probably most of it positive, but what we\u2019ve also seen, obviously, is a tremendous centralization.\u201d\u201cGoogle exploiting its browser dominance to shape the conditions of the advertising market raises some concerns,\u201d the foundation said.It took some time for Adblock Plus, which makes popular ad-blocking software that can be installed on Google Chrome, to figure out which types of ads, exactly, Google would be filtering, according to a company spokesman, Ben Williams. Once Adblock Plus had a firm idea, it determined that the update will not risk losing the interest of the tens of millions people who use its ad-blocking software.\u201cIt\u2019s laudable, what they\u2019re doing, getting rid of the worst of the worst formats,\u201d Mr. Williams said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it will cause people not to download ad blockers or to uninstall them.\u201dLikewise, Mozilla, which is paid by Google for traffic sent to its search engine through Firefox, depends on the company for much of its revenue.As of Friday, Google said that 65 percent of the sites with ads that were out of compliance with the new rules had already made changes to go along with them. Forbes, which has long greeted visitors with an inspirational quote built into an ad equipped with a countdown clock, was among them.\u201cA few months ago, we had one minor infraction, which we immediately fixed, and we are now compliant,\u201d said Laura Daunis Brusca, a Forbes spokeswoman.The Accelerated Mobile Pages framework provides standard formats for websites \u2014 including one for mobile websites to display Google Stories, a Google initiative that is very much like Snapchat Stories \u2014 as well as guidelines and limits for displaying advertising. The newly announced \u201cAMP for email\u201d project will allow users to complete tasks \u2014 such as submitting an RSVP or filling out a questionnaire \u2014 within Gmail.Publishers and advertisers have responded warmly to the speedy load times made possible by the Accelerated Mobile Pages program, but its adoption has also been rewarded more directly. According to Chartbeat, Google Mobile Search traffic to publishers that do not use Accelerated Mobile Pages has been flat over the past year, while publishers that have adopted the technology saw a jump of 100 percent in their mobile referrals from Google.With each improvement \u2014 whether it is the zapping of irksome ads or the restructuring of how mobile sites work \u2014 Google is continuing to consolidate its power over the web, which has lost its centrality in the modern internet ecosystem to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat.So far, what has been good for users has tended to be good for Google, and the other way around. But the collision of the old notion of the web as a free and open space and the reality of it as a digital territory increasingly colonized by commercial interests has provoked worry among some users.Scott Spencer, a director of product management at Google, said the company is sensitive to consumers\u2019 growing awareness of its power. \u201cGoogle is not neutral when it comes to the open web,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a search company, we want to ensure that there is a healthy and sustainable web for people to be searching and getting information from. We\u2019re also obviously an ad-serving company.\u201dHe framed Chrome\u2019s ad filter as the latest in a series of the browser\u2019s positive innovations, spanning back to the pop-up ad blocker in its original incarnation a decade ago and including more recent security protections against scams and malware.Mr. Spencer compared the web to a series of roads crowded by people trying to get to work. \u201cAt some point someone has the idea that we need to put in some traffic lights,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody likes waiting for the light, but everyone appreciates not getting stuck in traffic.\u201dGoogle is in a position to install and operate the traffic lights \u2014 with outside input, of course. It also raises questions about what sort of actor Google is on the web. Is it a government? A budding monopoly? A reluctant leader? All three?\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be doing this alone,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cWe understand the concerns that exist, and we want to make sure that other voices have a channel and are being heard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chewy Chocolate Cookies That Are Only Slightly Over the Top", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteBack when I was in high school, there was a cafe in SoHo I loved for its over-the-top sweets.Billowing cakes towered over the counter, the cream cheese frosting between the layers thicker than the cakes themselves. They had golden coconut macaroons as big as my palm, and soup bowls full of rice pudding, mounded with thick, cinnamon-flecked whipped cream.But to my teenage self, the best treats of all were saucer-size dark chocolate cookies loaded with white chocolate chunks and pecans. Fudgy in the center, with a brittle, crackling crust, they were sort of like the corner squares from pan of brownies \u2014 both chewy and crisp.Even better, any white chocolate bits that seeped through the cookie batter and hit the baking pan caramelized, turning butterscotch-rich. Who cares if the cookies were sweet enough to make my gums ache? I loved them fully and completely.This recipe is a more grown-up interpretation.All the components are there \u2014 the chewy chocolate cookie filled with nuts and caramelized white chocolate. But I\u2019ve tempered the sweetness by mixing white chocolate chips with bittersweet chocolate chips, and by melting bittersweet chocolate into the batter instead of the usual semisweet.This does mean you\u2019ll have to track down chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa solids, ideally 60 percent to 72 percent. The higher the percentage of cocoa solids a chocolate bar has, the less sugar it contains. This isn\u2019t going to make a huge difference with a small amount of chocolate, but when a recipe calls for a whopping half-pound, sweetness level matters.If you can\u2019t find bittersweet chocolate, you could reduce the amount of granulated sugar in the recipe. But keep in mind that sugar not only adds sweetness, it also contributes to the chewiness factor.

Let us help you. For the week of Feb. 25, seven events in New York and elsewhere not to be missed:Two of the many untimely deaths of 1918 were those of the Austrian artists Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele. Klimt, who died of a stroke, was middle-aged and successful, while Schiele, felled at 28 by the influenza pandemic, along with his pregnant wife, was on the threshold of a brilliant career.Klimt made drawings chiefly as studies for painting, marking out elegant shapes with a sinuously confident but simple line, while Schiele drew with the intensity of a diamond-cutter. Both men elongated the figure, but in Klimt\u2019s case, this resulted in a kind of elfin romanticism, while Schiele\u2019s knobbly portraits can look like prefigurations of heroin chic.In its first season, \u201cUnReal,\u201d the savagely soapy Lifetime drama about the making of a reality dating show \u2014 with the producer-wizards, Quinn (Constance Zimmer) and Rachel (Shiri Appleby), behind the screen \u2014 managed to be a fan favorite and a critical darling. Smart yet fanciful, it enticed a \u201cBachelor\u201d-enamored audience dying to know how the sausage was made, and earned the network its first Peabody Award.The Bobby & Phil tour, as it\u2019s called, begins with two nights at Radio City Music Hall (March 2 and 3), followed by stops in Boston and Chicago later in the month. Mr. Weir and Mr. Lesh will perform hits from the Dead\u2019s catalog (\u201cBox of Rain\u201d and \u201cSugar Magnolia\u201d are likely bets) in back-to-back acoustic and electric sets.March 2. A door opens, a mother (Sarah Adler) collapses and a father (Lior Ashkenazi) stands by in shocked inertia as soldiers tend to the woman.

Let\u2019s talk about tech.The HomePod reviews are in, and the verdict is: It\u2019s middling!Apple\u2019s smart speaker was originally due to ship last year. Now, after a delay and lots of speculation that it would face a rough go against Amazon\u2019s Echo, Apple\u2019s device is finally on sale.But most reviewers appraising the device this week suggested that it was best to wait. There are some interesting features in HomePod, but it has a long way to go to beat the competition.What doesn\u2019t it do well? Pretty much everything else, reviewers said. It\u2019s expensive \u2014 $349 versus $85 for an Echo. It\u2019s locked into Apple\u2019s music service, while competing systems let you play songs from a variety of sources.And most frustratingly, it\u2019s not very smart. Where Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s devices can answer a variety of questions and perform lots of different tasks (like order up an Uber or Lyft), HomePod\u2019s brain, Siri, needs evolution. Brian was particularly upset that the device kept playing music he didn\u2019t like. And for Nilay, the biggest complaint was that HomePod couldn\u2019t set two timers at once \u2014 basically table stakes in the smart speaker game.None of these are fatal. Siri is a cloud-based service, which means Apple can keep improving it from afar. Echo, too, wasn\u2019t so great to begin with. So I wouldn\u2019t count Apple out. The smart assistant war has barely started.Travis Kalanick took the stand, drank a whole lot of water, offered his thoughts on greed and Google, and introduced the world to the crazy lexicon of tech bros: \u201cunpumped,\u201d \u201cangsty\u201d and, most mysteriously of all, \u201claser is the sauce.\u201dAt the heart of the case is one question: Did Uber steal trade secrets from Waymo, Google\u2019s self-driving car spin-off, when it purchased Otto, a self-driving company founded by former employees of Waymo?The trial is expected to go on for weeks, but early on, Waymo seemed to score some wins. Kalanick conceded that during a \u201cjam sesh\u201d with Anthony Levandowski, the former Waymo engineer alleged to have stolen its secrets, he discussed the key technology at issue in the case, laser sensors. That\u2019s apparently when Kalanick jotted a note that included his conclusion that \u201claser is the sauce\u201d \u2014 it suggested Levandowski had convinced Kalanick of the importance of Waymo\u2019s tech.I\u2019m sure Uber\u2019s lawyers were unpumped about that.Here\u2019s something noteworthy from social media land. Snap and Twitter have long appeared at a disadvantage to the 800-pound social media gorilla, Facebook, and the smaller companies\u2019 financial results often proved it.There\u2019s some serious stuff here. This is the biggest rocket ever launched by a private company, and it paves the way for an even-larger rocket planned by Musk, called B.F.R., which could help realize Musk\u2019s dream of colonizing Mars. (As my colleague Kenneth Chang explained in this family-friendly newspaper about B.F.R.: \u201cThe B stands for big; the R for rocket.\u201d)But let\u2019s forget the serious stuff for a second.

She graduated from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va.She is the daughter of Elizabeth Russell Boe and Randall J. Boe, both of Washington. The bride\u2019s father is the executive vice president and general counsel of Monumental Sports and Entertainment, a Washington-based company that owns and operates the Washington Capitals of the N.H.L., the Washington Wizards of the N.B.A., the Washington Mystics of the W.N.B.A., and the Verizon Center in Washington. Her mother retired as a lawyer at Arent Fox, a law firm in Washington.The groom, who is 28 and also works in Shanghai, is the general manager of Amann Group China, a German textile manufacturer. He graduated from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.He is a son of Marylynn Uricchio Heuck and Douglas Heuck of Fox Chapel, Pa. The groom\u2019s father is the publisher and editor of Pittsburgh Quarterly and the director of Pittsburgh Today, a research institute that charts the progress of the Pittsburgh area to other regions in the country. His mother is the former film critic and society editor for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.Mr. Heuck was the first person that Ms. Boe met in August 2013, when she arrived in Shanghai to enroll in a Chinese-language program that would begin two weeks later in Beijing. They had already been introduced earlier that month, via Facebook, by Mr. Heuck\u2019s sister, Lidey Heuck, who is a friend of Ms. Boe.\u201cI remember our conversation just flowing so naturally and feeling so comfortable around him,\u201d Ms. Boe said of their first encounter, at a bar in Shanghai. \u201cWe were finishing each other\u2019s sentences.\u201dMr. Heuck, who had been working in Shanghai for nine months before Ms. Boe arrived, said she was \u201cbeautiful, intelligent and very funny.\u201d\u201cI had feelings for her, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure at first if she felt the same way about me,\u201d he said.They met a few more times before it was time for Ms. Boe to depart for Beijing, \u201cwhich had me feeling anxious,\u201d she said.\u201cI was disappointed about having to leave because it was too early to know what Sam was thinking about me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really nervous about the whole thing.\u201dShe was feeling better six weeks later when Mr. Heuck went to Beijing to see her again. They spent two days together talking and walking around the city while dropping in on bars and restaurants.\u201cI was truly inspired by Sam on so many levels,\u201d Ms. Boe said. \u201cHe was successful, intelligent, kindhearted and fun to be with, he was even fluent in Chinese.\u201dWhen Ms. Boe\u2019s Chinese language course came to an end, so did her stay in China, and now it was Mr. Heuck\u2019s turn to start feeling anxious.\u201cAt that point we didn\u2019t know what was going to happen between us,\u201d he said. \u201cI do know that when she wasn\u2019t there, I started looking around and wondering what I was doing there. \u201dFrom the moment Ms. Boe returned home to Washington, she had been wondering much of the same, but she stopped wondering in September 2014, when she landed a job in Shanghai.\u201cI was excited because I was going back to the place where I felt I had met the person I was destined to meet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have lived a very different kind of life in China filled with travel and adventure.\u201dDespite the great times abroad, Ms. Boe and Mr. Heuck, both of whom miss their family and friends, are planning on returning home soon.\u201cWhile we met 7,000 miles away from home and have loved our life in Asia,\u201d Mr. Heuck said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking forward to starting our married life back on the East Coast this spring.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sheet-Pan Supper That Defies the Seasons", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteFor most of the year, I hold to the notion that what grows together goes together, especially when it comes to mingling things on a sheet pan.Spring\u2019s tender greens and shoots; summer\u2019s juicy zucchini and tomatoes; fall\u2019s pumpkins and brussels sprouts; winter\u2019s dense roots \u2014 it\u2019s easy to come up with a harmonious dish within each season, in which all the vegetables roast at about the same rate.This recipe ignores all that.Although winter sweet potatoes are undeniably the focus here (along with ever-seasonal, stalwart chicken thighs), I\u2019ve paired them with summery bell peppers, imported from who-knows-where. They can be expensive, but the other ingredients here are thrifty.Peppers give a burst of juicy sweetness not available from a root, and by February, that\u2019s as welcome on the plate as a sunny, 50-degree afternoon on the weekend. Enjoy them when you have them.It\u2019s important to use red, yellow or orange bell peppers, the fleshier the better. Green ones don\u2019t have the sweetness needed to become profoundly caramelized.Back in winter\u2019s root cellar, I also add red onion to the dish, in two different ways. In the first, the onion is roasted along with the peppers and potatoes. Roasted at high heat, red onions get crisp at the edges, providing textural contrast to all the luxurious softness.I also add them raw as a garnish, quick-pickling them to add some tangy brightness to the mix. I use cider vinegar as the acid, tamed with a drizzle of honey. You don\u2019t need to plan ahead for this kind of pickle; it comes together in about half an hour while the vegetables and chicken roast.And as for that chicken, thighs are my preferred sheet-pan cut because they are forgiving in terms of timing. A few minutes more or less won\u2019t dry them out in the way chicken breasts do. However, if you\u2019d rather make this with chicken breasts, choose the bone-in, skin-on kind if possible, and watch them carefully. They cook more quickly than thighs, so remove them just as their juices no longer run pink when poked with a knife (150 degrees on an instant-read thermometer). Leave the vegetables in the oven for a few more minutes until they are thoroughly golden and very tender.Then set the table, uncork the wine and enjoy a not-perfectly-seasonal dinner while dreaming about spring.And to drink...You could choose a lot of different kinds of wine for this dish, and you would be happy. I\u2019m going to opt for a lively red with plenty of acidity that will go with both the earthy chicken thighs and sweet potatoes as well as the bright flavorings and caramelized bell peppers. Beaujolais is the natural choice, especially one of the crus like Morgon, Fleurie or C\u00f4te de Brouilly. Other options of the same ilk include frappato from the Vittoria region of Italy, barberas from the Piedmont region of Italy, and any number of fresh reds made by the perhaps arcane process known as carbonic maceration. You want white? Why not? Dry chenin blancs, dry rieslings and lively, easygoing chardonnays will go very well. ERIC ASIMOVcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Monitor Fake News", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The indictment of 13 Russians filed on Friday by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, details the secret workings of the Internet Research Agency, an organization in St. Petersburg, Russia, that disseminates false information online. According to American intelligence officials, the Kremlin oversaw this shadowy operation, which made extensive use of social media accounts to foster conflict in the United States and erode public faith in its democracy.But the Kremlin\u2019s operation relied on more than just its own secrecy. It also benefited from the secrecy of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Their algorithms for systematically targeting users to receive certain content are off limits to the public, and the output of these algorithms is almost impossible to monitor. The algorithms make millions of what amount to editorial decisions, pumping out content without anyone fully understanding what is happening.The editorial decisions of a newspaper or television news program are immediately apparent (articles published, segments aired) and so can be readily analyzed for bias and effect. By contrast, the editorial decisions of social media algorithms are opaque and slow to be discovered \u2014 even to those who run the platforms. It can take days or weeks before anyone finds out what has been disseminated by social media software.The Mueller investigation is shining a welcome light on the Kremlin\u2019s covert activity, but there is no similar effort to shine a light on the social media algorithms that helped the Russians spread their messages. There needs to be. This effort should begin by \u201copening up\u201d the results of the algorithms.In computer-speak, this \u201copening up\u201d would involve something called an open application programming interface. This is a common software technique that allows different programs to work with one another. For instance, Uber uses the open application programming interface of Google Maps to get information about a rider\u2019s pickup point and destination. It is not Uber\u2019s own mapping algorithm, but rather Google\u2019s open application programming interface, that makes it possible for Uber to build its own algorithms for its distinctive functions.The government should require social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to use a similar open application programming interface. This would make it possible for third parties to build software to monitor and report on the effects of social media algorithms. (This idea has been proposed by Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian Google employee who helped organize the Tahrir Square uprising in 2011.)Media watchdog groups have long been able to assess the results of the editorial decisions of newspapers and television. Whether those stories express the left, right or center of the political spectrum, they are openly available to independent organizations that want to understand what is being communicated.Extending this practice to social media would mean that a watchdog group could create software to analyze and make public whatever information from the platforms it might consider important: the demographics of the readership of a certain article, for instance, or whether a fake story continued to be widely disseminated even after being debunked.After the Mueller indictment, Twitter issued a statement noting that technology companies \u201ccannot defeat this novel, shared threat alone\u201d \u2014 referring to efforts like the Russian disinformation campaign. \u201cThe best approach,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cis to share information and ideas to increase our collective knowledge, with the full weight of government and law enforcement leading the charge against threats to our democracy.\u201dThis is true. And one effective form of information-sharing would be legally mandated open application programming interfaces for social media platforms. They would help the public identify what is being delivered by social media algorithms, and thus help protect our democracy.Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017, is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a fellow at Harvard Kennedy School.Advertisement"}

If you think middle-class children are being harmed by too much screen time, just consider how much greater the damage is to minority and disadvantaged kids, who spend much more time in front of screens.According to a 2011 study by researchers at Northwestern University, minority children watch 50 percent more TV than their white peers, and they use computers for up to one and a half hours longer each day. White children spend eight hours and 36 minutes looking at a screen every day, according to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, while black and Hispanic children spend 13 hours.In 2004, Dimitri Christakis of Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital wrote in the medical journal Pediatrics that \u201cearly exposure to television was associated with subsequent attentional problems.\u201d Even when controlling for socioeconomic status, gestational age and other factors, he discovered that an increase of one standard deviation in the number of hours of television watched at age 1 \u201cis associated with a 28 percent increase in the probability of having attentional problems at age 7.\u201dUnfortunately, too often the message we send low-income and less-educated parents is that screen time is going to help their children. Fifteen years ago, when I was a Big Sister to a girl who attended one of Brooklyn\u2019s worst middle schools, her mother was given strict instructions by teachers to purchase a faster computer as soon as possible to get her daughter\u2019s grades up. Today, thanks to lucrative contracts with school districts, tech companies are happy to bring screens into the classroom and send them home.But there is little evidence that such programs are helping students. Take Maine, which guarantees a tablet for every student. According to NPR, \u201cat a cost of about $12 million annually,\u201d the state \u201chas yet to see any measurable increases on statewide standardized test scores.\u201dWhen politicians and policymakers talk about kids and technology, it is usually about \u201cbridging the digital divide,\u201d making sure that poor kids have as much access as wealthier ones. But there is no evidence that they don\u2019t. According to a 2015 Pew report, 87 percent of Americans between the ages of 13 and 17 have access to a computer. For families earning less than $50,000 a year, that number is 80 percent. As for a racial divide, Pew finds that African-American teenagers are more likely to own a smartphone than any other group of teenagers in America.These facts have not been allowed to get in the way of the shiny-new-things approach to learning. In 2014, New York received a half-million-dollar grant to lend internet hot spots to low-income families. According to the Urban Libraries Council, such lending programs are \u201cthe latest buzz.\u201d Similar programs have begun in Chicago, Seattle and St. Paul, with funding coming from Google and other companies.But no one is telling poorer parents about the dangers of screen time. For instance, according to a 2012 Pew survey, just 39 percent of parents with incomes of less than $30,000 a year say they are \u201cvery concerned\u201d about this issue, compared with about six in 10 parents in higher-earning households.Make no mistake: The real digital divide in this country is not between children who have access to the internet and those who don\u2019t. It\u2019s between children whose parents know that they have to restrict screen time and those whose parents have been sold a bill of goods by schools and politicians that more screens are a key to success. It\u2019s time to let everyone in on the secret.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Cause of Market Turbulence: Computer-Driven Index Funds", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA decade ago, the center of gravity on Wall Street were raucous trading desks and stock exchange floors. These days, the locus has shifted to far quieter places, where computers are in charge.The transition has been years in the making, but its effect has been on full display over the past week. After propelling the market to historic highs, passive investment strategies \u2014 which follow a simple set of rules and are carried out by sophisticated computer programs, not humans \u2014 are among the factors fueling the market\u2019s recent plunge.This is the new reality of today\u2019s stock market: Funds that track financial indexes have become a dominant force, and they can act as accelerants, adding momentum to the market\u2019s rise and fall.This week, as markets shuddered, exchange-traded index funds were responsible for 38 percent of total stock trading on some days, an astonishing figure given that these funds were just a curiosity 10 years ago. Indexing giants like BlackRock and Vanguard now own vast swaths of the market and are the largest shareholders in just about all the major companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.In many ways, this stampede toward passive investing \u2014 in which people put their money into funds that track indexes and broader market themes as opposed to relying on human stock pickers \u2014 is uncharted territory. Now the key question is how this transformed market holds up during a financial storm that lasts more than a few days.\u201cThese flows have had a big effect on the market,\u201d said Peter Tchir, a strategist at Academy Securities. \u201cAnd when people want to get out, there is a similar effect.\u201dCheaply priced exchange-traded and index funds have pumped trillions of dollars into the stock market since early 2009. They now own close to 40 percent of stocks in the United States, according to research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Unlike mutual funds, E.T.F.s are listed on public exchanges, which makes many of them very easy to trade even if the securities they hold may not be. On Thursday, for example, the second most actively traded security in the equity market was a BlackRock fund that invests in large companies in emerging markets.There was a lot to keep an eye on.BlackRock, which manages $6 trillion overall, is the leading issuer of exchange-traded funds, with $1.3 trillion under management. But as the market fell and trading in BlackRock funds accelerated, there was little sign of panic or emotion among the E.T.F. specialists at the firm.They fielded phone calls from clients and let the computers do their work.Martin Small, who oversees United States-based E.T.F.s at the firm, said the high share of E.T.F. trading was positive for the markets. That is because on days when fearful investors want to sell, large, easy-to-trade E.T.F.s serve as a critical release valve.\u201cEverything worked,\u201d Mr. Small said. \u201cVolumes were higher and more people were watching, but our funds did what they were supposed to do.\u201dInvesting on the basis of what machines, as opposed to humans, do has been a trend in financial markets for years. What\u2019s different now is that so much money has poured into a specific type of computer-driven trading.From cost-conscious millennials to the world\u2019s largest pension and sovereign wealth funds, E.T.F.s have become a preferred investment choice. In addition to all the major stock and bond indexes, they enable investors to get a piece of the action in arcane areas like junk bonds, bank loans and stocks in Pakistan. There is even an E.T.F. that tracks companies that make whiskey.The popularity of E.T.F.s has concentrated unparalleled financial power in BlackRock and Vanguard, the two biggest providers of index funds and E.T.F.s. Together, they sit on $10.5 trillion in assets and control 65 percent of the 1,700 exchange-traded funds that exist.Relying on sophisticated computer programs, they funnel investor money into the stocks and bonds that make up indexes around the world. As the flows have grown in volume, much of these funds have gone toward index heavyweights like Amazon, Apple and Facebook, pushing their valuations ever higher.Active fund managers \u2014 human stock pickers \u2014 will be marginalized, the argument goes. And that could cause harm, because they are the ones who buy when others sell. So when stocks suddenly plummet, there will be fewer funds to step in, extending the fall.An analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein even compared passive investing to Marxism, in its sweeping conformity and its degradation of the independent-minded, active investor.\u201cFor years, this has been an E.T.F. market \u2014 its robots buying stocks just as they were programmed to do,\u201d said Steven Bregman of Horizon Kinetics, a firm that hunts for undervalued stocks. \u201cBut so much money has gone into just a few hundred stocks. Everyone owns the same stuff. So when they want to get out, who are they going to sell to?\u201dCompounding these worries is the rise of algorithm-driven trading strategies at large hedge funds. They get their buy and sell signals not from a human but from indexes that measure sharp swings in the market. Earlier this week, they were big sellers when the so-called VIX index \u2014 a measure of anticipated market volatility \u2014 skyrocketed.E.T.F. proponents argue that their industry\u2019s growth is just the latest stage of the stock-indexing revolution that began in the early 1970s. That was when John C. Bogle founded Vanguard and began to launch index funds.So when stocks sank this week, he barely glanced at his trading screens. Whether the market goes up or down does not matter to him because the computers control his suite of exchange-traded funds \u2014 not him.\u201cIf the market goes down 4 percent, I don\u2019t even care,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cThat is the beauty of systems. Once you build it, there is literally nothing left to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Things We Know About School Shooters", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFive years ago, shortly after the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., I visited a program in Los Angeles aimed at heading off school shootings before they occurred.What I learned was both terrifying and encouraging. High schools and colleges, it turned out, were rife with troubled students who expressed violent thoughts. One scribbled \u201cKill Everyone Leave None Alive\u201d in a notebook beside drawings of bombs hitting a building that looked disturbingly like a school. Another posted pictures of himself on Facebook holding guns alongside the words \u201cSchool \u2014 Tomorrow.\u201d A third student said that Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter, had done a good thing in killing those 20 children by enabling them to escape the travails of life.But I also realized that mental health experts, law enforcement agencies and criminal justice researchers had learned a great deal about how to identify potential perpetrators of school violence, how to assess whether the threats were real \u2014 a vast majority are not \u2014 and how to intervene. With at least 17 people dead at a high school in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday and 40 school shootings recorded in the United States since 2000, it is worth paying attention to what this knowledge is.Studies have shown, for example, that in school shootings, the killers virtually always \u201cleak\u201d their intentions, leaving a trail of clues behind them. Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old who the police said has confessed in the Parkland shooting, apparently was no exception: Students reportedly avoided him and joked that if anyone were going to shoot up the school, it would be him.Finally, there is nascent, but increasing, evidence that violence begets violence, with one school shooting \u2014 especially if it receives a lot of publicity \u2014 leading to others, a phenomenon that researchers refer to as \u201ccontagion.\u201d And some psychologists believe that news media reports of mass killings may propel people who are already at risk of violence into committing copycat crimes.Violence is, of course, notoriously difficult to predict, and no one thinks that all school shootings can be prevented. Yet experts in assessing threats say that there are approaches that in some cases can be effective in derailing a planned act of violence.Improved communication among agencies authorized to detect and prevent violence is one promising strategy. In many areas where there are coordinated threat assessment systems in place, barriers to such communication have been dismantled to reduce the chances that a student who is \u201con a path to violence\u201d will fall through the cracks.But few localities have as comprehensive a system as I saw in Los Angeles County, where law enforcement, the county mental health department and educational institutions share information and train staff members to recognize and report worrisome behavior. Students, teachers and parents are encouraged to report any troubling behavior. When a threat appears potentially serious, mental health workers and law enforcement officers might visit a student\u2019s home, talk to the parents and even ask if they can see the student\u2019s room.Tony Beliz, a consultant to schools and corporations on violence prevention who for many years ran the mental health side of the Los Angeles program, which was started by the Los Angeles Police Department, has noted that parents often have no idea what their children are up to. I n more than a few cases, a team visiting a home has found weapons or other indications of deadly intention.School shootings are rare events, and account for only a tiny fraction of gun-related deaths each year. Still, many experts believe that it should be far more difficult for severely troubled teenagers to get hold of weapons like the semiautomatic AR-15 used in the Parkland, Fla., attack. In California, disturbed teenagers who seem seriously bent on violence can sometimes be committed to a psychiatric hospital for 72 hours of observation, an action that then allows any firearms they possess to be legally seized. In other states, it is not so easy.Educating local clinics, school psychologists and teachers about laws governing the release of privileged communication can improve the chances of identifying potentially dangerous students. Many educators and mental health professionals believe that they cannot disclose troubling confidences, even if they believe that there might be a threat to public safety. But this is not the case.Dr. Meloy, the forensic psychologist, and other experts think the media can also do more to prevent mass shootings. He does not expect news outlets to forgo covering school shootings. But, Dr. Meloy says, reporters and editors could avoid describing a killer using words that might \u201cconvey a certain cool pose\u201d to some teenagers, including \u201clone wolf\u201d or even \u201cschool shooter.\u201d\u201cFrom the perspective of a young male, being a school shooter is something that can be idealized, and it brings a coolness to the behavior that otherwise does not exist in his life,\u201d Dr. Meloy told me.The horrific shooting in Parkland raises the question of whether we are serious about trying.Erica Goode, a former New York Times reporter, is a visiting professor at the S.I.

{"Headline": "A Museum Bridges the Divide Between Two Bordeaux", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourBORDEAUX, France \u2014 Bordeaux, the region, is unrivaled historically as the greatest, most prodigious producer of fine wine in the world.Bordeaux, the port city on the Garonne river, has played a crucial role as the center of the wine trade. Historically, though, it has lacked charm and lovability, and paradoxically, beyond its commercial ties, Bordeaux has had little connection with the wine producers in the growing regions that define the region and practically surround the city.The few wine museums I have visited around the world have never quite fired the imagination. The more ambitious the museum, the more transparently promotional it is for a particular region, a certain producer or the benefits of wine. The most successful have been the most local, which have simply presented artifacts without forced narratives.But La Cit\u00e9 consciously avoids the outright promotion and celebration of Bordeaux. Instead, it takes an ecumenical approach, looking at the scope of wine culture worldwide and letting history \u2014 and the people who make the wines \u2014 speak largely for themselves.\u201cVinexpo works because all the wines of the world take part,\u201d Ms. Cazes said. \u201cThat made it a success.\u201dLa Cit\u00e9 encompasses 10 levels, including a wine bar, a retail shop, exhibition spaces, areas for special tastings, a theater (named for Thomas Jefferson) and, on the top floor, a panoramic restaurant with gorgeous views of the city.But at its heart is a permanent exhibition of 19 themed spaces that provide an overview of the world\u2019s vineyards, the development of domesticated grapevines, the intricacies of how wine is made, the nuances of tasting and drinking it, and historical presentations on transporting wine and enjoying it dating from 6000 B.C.Ultimately, it poses the existential question of why humans have gone to such extreme efforts to create a beverage that is not essential to existence.Upon arrival, visitors are issued a \u201ccompanion du voyage,\u201d individual electronic guides about the size of cellphones that connect directly with each stop along the tour, explaining in eight languages exactly what you are looking at and how to interact with it. From there, you are on your own, free to wander among the exhibits at your own pace, in your own fashion.Displays explain how vines and grapes were domesticated, how they occupied exalted mythological positions within ancient societies and how vines adapt to wildly different terrains.Atmospheric enhancements penetrate almost unconsciously as you examine the exhibit: birds singing, thunder, the sound of a helicopter. Later, while learning about the use of barrels and how wine evolves in them over time, I suddenly became aware that I was smelling oak, used in the construction of the display.Not all the exhibits are so straightforwardly historic. A buffet table offers the opportunity for \u201cindulging in the sensory experience of wine tasting,\u201d offering surprisingly effective examples of different aromas and textures, and the opportunity to test your nose if so inclined.I especially enjoyed an animated presentation of how wine merchants through the ages challenged themselves over millenniums to transport wine overseas to customers who craved it. It\u2019s not strictly realistic, as one character chides a god: \u201cYou\u2019re all the same. You have eternity but no patience.\u201dThe entire visit can take about two hours to complete, by which time you are ready for the glass of wine included with admission.The permanent exhibition is geared toward anyone who wants to learn more about wine. La Cit\u00e9 also puts on two temporary exhibits a year, in conjunction with other wine regions, which go deeply into particular subjects like wine and art, or wine and music.In its first year, Ms. Cazes said, 445,000 visitors came to the museum, which far surpassed initial projections.As for whether La Cit\u00e9 can help to bridge the divide between the city and its surrounding wine industry, tourism will play a central role in whether it succeeds. The museum will serve as a point of departure for tours of the M\u00e9doc, the historic area encompassing the famous areas of Margaux, St.-Julien and Pauillac. Some will go by bus. Others will leave by boat from La Cit\u00e9, heading up the Garonne to the Gironde Estuary.Tourism has not historically been encouraged in Bordeaux estates, Ms. Cazes said. Cellars were not equipped for visits and, she said, merchants in Bordeaux were concerned that visitors would buy wine directly from the producers rather than through their networks.Indeed, the Bordeaux tourist board has a desk within La Cit\u00e9, she said, and is eager to sell tickets for tours.Advertisement"}

But as the leaders of the country\u2019s most influential gun advocacy group kept quiet after the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla., that claimed 17 lives, a furious debate played out on NRATV, the organization\u2019s online video channel. Its hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons, media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a \u201cdeep state\u201d campaign to undermine President Trump.Critics of the N.R.A. say that they have observed a shift in the organization\u2019s tone since Mr. Trump was elected that is much more pugilistic, and that NRATV is where the most outrageous commentary occurs. This change, they say, seems to reflect the fact that like many organizations on the right, the N.R.A. believes it has to guard against complacency among its members with a friendly president in the White House.\u201cThere\u2019s no boogeyman in the White House now to make people afraid of,\u201d said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. \u201cSo they have to make us afraid of one another, and that is how they will market guns in an age when they have a president beholden to them.\u201d The channel has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics today, with hosts and guests who are closely allied with Mr. Trump. Few news media operations seem as in sync with the political sensibilities of the Trump era. And they often side with Mr. Trump in divisive cultural disputes \u2014 some of which have potent racial undercurrents \u2014 like his feuding with Black Lives Matter activists and the professional football players who knelt during the national anthem.Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to discuss the media effort, the size of its online audience or its programming in the wake of the Parkland shooting. As a matter of policy, he said, the N.R.A. does not discuss proprietary matters. The N.R.A.\u2019s practice is to keep a low profile after mass shootings, as it did after the massacres in Newtown, Conn., and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. But it was always quietly talking to its members, first by email and later on NRATV, said Danny Barefoot, a partner at Anvil Strategies, an ad agency and communications company that has worked with gun control groups. \u201cIn those moments, the goal isn\u2019t to disseminate mass information and persuade a lot of people, \u201d Mr. Barefoot said. \u201cThe strategy is to be a messenger to the N.R.A.\u2019s own people.\u201d Eli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy, a site that delivered progressive political videos to targeted audiences on Facebook, said that while videos produced by NRATV after a shooting might not go viral, they helped viewers \u201cfeel they\u2019re part of a community, led by a news source that speaks to them.\u201dNRATV can galvanize members in the wake of a shooting in part because the N.R.A. has coached its followers to believe that the organization is the only credible source for news and information on any gun issue or controversy. \u201cIf it can topple us, it gets a direct path to the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Stinchfield told viewers this week from the organization\u2019s studio in Dallas. \u201cThey will stop at nothing to put us out of business.\u201d\u201cPeople could just as easily call for restrictions on the first amendment,\u201d Mr. Holton said. \u201cThey could say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make it illegal to report on those school shootings because we all know, I mean, there\u2019s no doubt that the media circus that takes place every time one of these things happens causes more school shootings.\u201d Advertisement"}

He mused that it might be China, or a guy from New Jersey, or \u201csomebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\u201d He said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had assured him it wasn\u2019t true. And, he added, \u201cI really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\u201dPresident Trump has never stopped belittling the charge that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. But on Friday, with the indictment of 13 Russians for orchestrating a vast, well-funded operation to interfere in the election, those denials collided with a mountain of evidence arrayed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.For Mr. Trump, who has tried to discredit Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation as a politically motivated witch hunt, it was a direct assault on the version of reality that he has sought tirelessly to create.By laying out a meticulous case for how Russia tried to tip the electoral scales toward Mr. Trump in 2016, Mr. Mueller has made it much harder for the president to dismiss the investigation as mere politics. He may also have made it harder for Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Mueller himself, since, as some Democratic lawmakers argued, that would look like an attempt to help Russia further undermine American democracy.Before the charges were announced, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, briefed Mr. Trump and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, and handed over a copy of the indictment, according to a person briefed on the matter. Mr. Mueller was not present at the briefing.On Friday afternoon, after Mr. Trump left Washington for his Palm Beach, Fla., estate, the White House issued a defiant statement claiming that the investigation had uncovered no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.\u201cIt\u2019s time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories, which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors, like Russia, and do nothing to protect the principles of our institutions,\u201d the president said in a statement.In a tweet, Mr. Trump played up Mr. Mueller\u2019s assertion that the Russian operation had begun in 2014, well before he declared his candidacy. \u201cThe Trump campaign did nothing wrong \u2014 no collusion!\u201d he wrote.Far from being rattled, Mr. Trump was elated, according to his advisers, because he viewed it as evidence that Mr. Mueller now knows who the malefactors are \u2014 and they do not include him or members of his team. (The indictment refers to campaign officials who met or communicated with Russians, but says they were \u201cunwitting.\u201d)Yet Mr. Trump sidestepped the fact that he has stubbornly denied Russia\u2019s interference, even after two assessments by the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had meddled. Last November, during a trip to Asia, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Putin had told him that Russia did not meddle, and that he was inclined to believe him.\u201cEvery time he sees me he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think he is very insulted by it,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich is not a good thing for our country.\u201dMr. Trump went so far as to suggest that the heads of the intelligence agencies at the time of the 2016 election \u2014 John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director \u2014 were less trustworthy than Mr. Putin.\u201cI mean, give me a break \u2014 they\u2019re political hacks,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cYou have Brennan, you have Clapper, and you have Comey. Comey\u2019s proven now to be a liar, and he\u2019s proven to be a leaker, so you look at that.\u201dStill, the response on Capitol Hill was resounding \u2014 at least concerning the gravity of Russia\u2019s actions \u2014 and it could narrow Mr. Trump\u2019s room for maneuver as he tries to limit the political fallout from the investigation.\u201cThe Russians engaged in a sinister and systematic attack on our political system,\u201d the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said. \u201cIt was a conspiracy to subvert the process, and take aim at democracy itself.\u201dThe Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said the indictment was \u201cfurther proof that Vladimir Putin directed a campaign to interfere with our elections, with the goal of tipping the outcome.\u201d He called on Mr. Trump to immediately reverse his decision not to impose sanctions against Russia that were recently passed by Congress.Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, argued that any attempts to remove Mr. Mueller or Mr. Rosentein \u201cwill have to be seen as a direct attempt to aid the Russian government in attacking American democracy.\u201dMr. Trump has not hesitated to put Mr. Mueller\u2019s future in jeopardy. Last July, he threatened to dismiss the special counsel if his investigation ranged too far afield from Russia\u2019s campaign meddling. In an interview with The New York Times, he complained that Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was rife with conflicts of interest and that the investigation had crossed a red line.A month earlier, several officials said, Mr. Trump actually gave an order to fire Mr. Mueller but backed down after Mr. McGahn threatened to resign rather than carry it out.Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy for dealing with charges of Russian meddling has not varied much since the campaign: deny, obfuscate, play down and, since Election Day, blame it on Democrats bitter after Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat.In May, Mr. Trump told Lester Holt, the NBC News anchor, \u201cThis Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\u2019ve won.\u201dIn September, he tweeted that \u201cthe Russia hoax continues, now it\u2019s ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\u201d PolitiFact called Mr. Trump\u2019s denial of Russian meddling its 2017 \u201cLie of the Year.\u201dSince taking office, Mr. Trump has often expressed concern that the charges undermine the legitimacy of his presidency. He has told associates that if he accepts the premise of Russian meddling, it will call into question the idea that he won the election on his own merits.That fear drove many of Mr. Trump\u2019s most incendiary tweets and statements throughout his first year in office, especially about the size and breadth of his electoral victory. The day after his inauguration, Mr. Trump ordered his press secretary, Sean Spicer, to insist that his inaugural crowd was the largest in history, which it demonstrably was not.In news conferences, on Twitter and at rallies, he has called the Russia investigation \u201cfake news\u201d and repeatedly predicted that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation will end without finding much.Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment does not settle the overarching question of whether Mr. Trump or any of his campaign associates colluded with Russia. For now, the president has seized on that as evidence of his innocence.But as Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, put it, \u201cThe indictment leaves open the vital question of whether Americans, including any associated with the Trump campaign, knowingly played a role in Russia\u2019s active-measures campaign.\u201dThat seemed a likely avenue of inquiry for an investigation that is casting a lengthening shadow on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.Maggie Haberman and Michael S.

To them, this place is \u201csachamama,\u201d a Quechua word roughly meaning \u201cmother jungle,\u201d the sacred heart of the area that produces the flora and fauna on which the groups depend.These indigenous people are part of a larger community dispersed across the landscape during the rubber boom at the turn of 20th century. They are the descendants of the few who survived slavery, torture and genocide, which took tens of thousands of lives.Over the past two decades, indigenous federations living around Yaguas have been working to protect the land. They educated scientists and conservationists about its geography and biology, and convinced the government that the land was worth saving.In the Amazonian lowlands of Yaguas National Park, different types of rivers that contain distinct forms of aquatic life mix during the rainy season as forests flood. This unusual cocktail of river waters produces biodiversity; more than 300 species of fish have adapted to forest life.One species, not yet named, grows no bigger than your thumb and has only been found dwelling in subterranean tunnels. Dr. Hidalgo hopes to return to the park soon to confirm whether it\u2019s new to science.But with some 3,000 plant, 600 bird and more than 150 mammal species, there are far more than fish in Yaguas.Often elusive in heavily hunted areas, tapirs in Yaguas seem to remain more visible. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this many tapirs in one place,\u201d said Dr. Vriesendorp. They are sometimes found in the forest, eating salty mud to extract its minerals.But their presence in Yaguas suggests that the aquatic ecosystem is still healthy, which is important given that the park contains the headwaters of a tributary to the Amazon.A team led by the Frankfurt Zoological Society is hoping to get an estimate of the otter population, determine if there are any otter-human conflicts, and eventually assess whether mercury from small, illegal gold mining operations has entered the food chain.If future proposals are successful, three-quarters of the Putumayo River will become a vast, unfragmented corridor for wildlife across northern Peru. And it could also be important as the world aims to reduce carbon emissions.Keeping the carbon in the ground is critical, although it will prove challenging in remote Yaguas and surrounding areas with fewer restrictions.\u201cFor now, Yaguas is safe, but in the 20 years I\u2019ve been working in the Amazon, I\u2019ve learned the hard way that today\u2019s remoteness is tomorrow\u2019s access,\u201d said Gregory Asner, an ecologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science.But for now, many are celebrating.\u201cPeople don\u2019t create national parks every day,\u201d said Dr. Vriesendorp. \u201cIt really is a big deal.\u201d_____An earlier version of this article misstated the corner of Peru in which Yaguas National Park is found.

Eric Greitens of Missouri was indicted on Thursday on a felony invasion of privacy charge, threatening his hold on the leadership of the state and creating chaos across Missouri\u2019s political landscape in an election year.The St. Louis grand jury\u2019s indictment accused Mr. Greitens, a first-term Republican who was seen as having ambitions for higher office, of photographing a nude or partially nude person without the person\u2019s knowledge or consent in 2015. The indictment said Mr. Greitens then transmitted the photo in a way that allowed it to be viewed on a computer, which prosecutors said made the crime a felony rather than a misdemeanor.Mr. Greitens, a former Navy SEAL and Rhodes scholar who has been governor for just over a year, has resisted calls to resign, insisting that he did nothing illegal. He has been touring the state touting his tax cut plans.Mr. Greitens, who was booked into a St. Louis jail on Thursday afternoon and then released on his own recognizance, defended himself in a statement posted to social media accounts, saying he \u201cmade a personal mistake\u201d but \u201cdid not commit a crime.\u201d\u201cWith today\u2019s disappointing and misguided political decision, my confidence in our prosecutorial system is shaken, but not broken,\u201d Mr. Greitens, 43, wrote on Facebook. He suggested that the charges were the work of a \u201creckless liberal prosecutor who uses her office to score political points,\u201d an apparent reference to Kimberly M. Gardner, the St. Louis prosecutor whose office presented the case to the grand jury and who is a Democrat.A lawyer for Mr. Greitens, Edward L. Dowd Jr., said in a statement that the charge was baseless and that he would be filing a motion to dismiss the case.Mr. Greitens showed no immediate signs of quitting, but he was certain to face pressure to leave, and some lawmakers said they were pushing for an investigation, which could be a first step to seek impeachment.Though his fellow Republicans hold large majorities in the State Legislature, the governor has frequently clashed with members of his own party. State Senator Robert Schaaf, a Republican, said lawmakers should \u201cmove swiftly to bring this to a resolution\u201d and possibly impeachment if the governor did not resign.Republican leaders in the State House raised their own doubts about Mr. Greitens\u2019s future.\u201cWe will carefully examine the facts contained in the indictment and answer the question as to whether or not the governor can lead our state while a felony case moves forward,\u201d a joint statement from the Republican leaders, including Todd Richardson, the speaker of the House; Elijah Haahr, speaker pro tem; and Rob Vescovo, the majority floor leader, said. \u201cThe people of Missouri deserve no less. We will begin the process of tasking a group of legislators to investigate these serious charges.\u201dMs. Gardner said the statute of limitations for charges to be filed would have expired next month.\u201cAs I have stated before, it is essential for residents of the City of St. Louis and our state to have confidence in their leaders,\u201d Ms. Gardner said in a statement. \u201cThey must know that the Office of the Circuit Attorney will hold public officials accountable in the same manner as any other resident of our city. Both parties and the people of St. Louis deserve a thorough investigation of these allegations.\u201dMr. Dowd said the governor had offered to meet with Ms. Gardner, but that she refused and \u201cproceeded to file an indictment that has no facts.\u201d Mr. Dowd said his client would cooperate if a legislative committee investigates.Last month, after the claims against Mr. Greitens became public, Mr. Greitens acknowledged an affair and asked for forgiveness.\u201cThis was a deeply personal mistake,\u201d Mr. Greitens and his wife, Sheena, said in a joint statement. \u201cEric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately.\u201dThe tawdry political drama is taking place in a state where Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, is locked in what is expected to be one of the most hard-fought Senate races in the country.Mr. Greitens was widely believed to have aspirations for higher office, perhaps even the presidency, and had appeared in Iowa, Michigan and Virginia in recent months in an apparent effort to burnish his national brand.By Thursday night, lawmakers were raising pointed questions about Mr. Greitens\u2019s future.Ryan Silvey, a former Republican state senator whom Mr. Greitens appointed to the state\u2019s Public Service Commission last month, said it would be difficult for the governor to survive.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really have a lot of deep relationships in the Legislature to begin with,\u201d Mr. Silvey said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how he can effectively govern in the current situation. I think that it would probably be best for the party and for the state if he were to resign.\u201dIt was hard to see the prosecution as political, he said, given the fact that the indictment came from a grand jury.\u201cWith it being a grand jury, that tells me evidence was presented to other people who saw that an indictment would be reasonable,\u201d he said.Under Missouri law, a member of the State House can file a resolution seeking an investigation of the governor, which would then be referred to a committee. That committee could then advance articles of impeachment to the full House for a vote. And if a majority of House members supported impeachment, the State Senate would select seven judges to conduct a trial.No Missouri governor has ever been removed from office through impeachment.T.J. Berry, a state representative from Kansas City, said he hoped the Assembly would open its own investigation \u201cto remove the question of political taint\u201d in Ms. Gardner\u2019s prosecution.While Mr. Berry, a Republican, said that the allegations still needed to be proven, the charges were not a good sign for the governor.\u201cIf you get a grand jury to indict you, there\u2019s probably some proof,\u201d Mr. Berry said.State Senator Jamilah Nasheed, a Democrat, said \u201cthere\u2019s a very dark cloud over the state of Missouri and I truly believe that the governor cannot lead\u201d while under felony indictment.If Mr. Greitens does not resign, \u201cthe people here in the state of Missouri need to rise up and call for his impeachment,\u201d Ms. Nasheed said. \u201cThis is a big embarrassment to the state.\u201dMr. Greitens, who was permitted to travel throughout the United States as a provision of his release, is scheduled to appear in court on March 16.Jonathan Martin and Dave Philipps contributed reporting for this story.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Online Growth Surges, Even as It Looks Offline", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Alibaba Group, the Chinese online shopping giant, has become so big that it is looking for growth by forging into new territory: the offline world.Alibaba has snapped up stakes in grocers and in an electronics chain over the last three years, a perhaps counterintuitive series of moves for a company that helps consumers in China buy products with their smartphones. In part, the push is driven by the eventual maturation of its online business.For now, however, online shopping still rules the roost.Alibaba on Thursday reported a one-third rise in profit for the three months that ended in December, on revenue that rose by more than half. The revenue growth rate was its slowest in a year but still came in better than expected.Still, a pullback in growth is inevitable for a company with Alibaba\u2019s reach.The company has lifted its recent results by offering more and better services to the vendors on its platforms. But it is also eyeing the 84 percent of physical goods sales that still take place offline in China.Alibaba has been pouring cash into experiments in what its founder, Jack Ma, calls \u201cnew retail\u201d: a kind of teched-up re-envisioning of how people shop in store. In particular, it hopes to gather more detailed user data, which could help it offer more personalized services and ads to its customers online and off.\u201cSome of Alibaba\u2019s \u2018new retail\u2019 initiatives have shown quite promising signs of initial success,\u201d said Jialong Shi, an analyst with Nomura, singling out Hema. Still, he said, \u201cthese initiatives may require a few more years of incubation before we can see profits.\u201dAnother challenge: Tencent, Alibaba\u2019s biggest rival, is getting into fresh food and traditional retail, too.Tencent is the world\u2019s largest video game company. It also runs WeChat, China\u2019s most popular messaging and social media app.For now at least, analysts do not expect Alibaba and Tencent to end up owning rival alliances of stores. Tencent primarily seems to want to create more opportunities for people to use its mobile payment service, WeChat Pay. It is also hunting for new clients for its cloud computing business.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to imagine that Tencent would fully own and operate a supermarket on its own,\u201d Mr. Shi of Nomura said.For both Alibaba and Tencent, though, creating more points of contact with their customers helps them amass more user data. This is one reason the companies are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, which helps them make sense of the boatloads of user information they are hauling in every minute.\u201cThey not only have the largest data sets, but they have data sets tied to customers that they can identify,\u201d Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research, said. \u201cThe potential for A.I.-led monetization growth, we think, is still at a very early stage.\u201dAlso on Thursday, Alibaba said it would acquire a one-third stake in the parent company of Alipay, one of China\u2019s two main online payment services. The two sides agreed in 2014 to give Alibaba the right to acquire the stake. The two companies used to be one until Mr. Ma took the Alipay operations out and formed a separate company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Criminals Hide Their Data Overseas", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsAmerican efforts to investigate crime and terrorism are increasingly impeded by a lack of access to data stored outside the country, even when it is held by companies subject to United States jurisdiction. Britain and other allied foreign governments face similar problems. All too often, officials in one country investigating a serious crime with victims in that very same country cannot get data they need simply because it is on a server halfway across the world. The internet is moving fast, and our legal constructs are not keeping up. This leaves tech companies in the difficult position of having to withhold information that could protect public safety.To make matters worse, a case at the United States Supreme Court could leave our governments and others with no effective way to obtain vital evidence of serious crimes. Oral arguments are scheduled for Feb. 27 in that case, which asks whether Microsoft may comply with a United States warrant to disclose information related to an American crime stored on a cloud server in Ireland. Microsoft argues that it cannot.Fortunately, there is a legislative solution to this problem that advances a model that empowers law enforcement. The Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Democratic senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Chris Coons of Delaware, and members of the House have proposed legislation that would clarify the legal authority of the United States to obtain data stored in another country, and would authorize special agreements to resolve potential conflicts of law. The bill would authorize the attorney general to enter into such agreements, but only with allies that respect privacy and protect civil liberties, and that have records of promoting and defending due process. The first one would be with Britain, which already has the authority to enter into such a pact.These agreements would not apply to foreign judicial orders directed at American citizens, or anyone in the United States, for that matter. Instead, the bill would promote swift justice among nations that share a common commitment to the rule of law, while protecting the privacy and safety of our citizens. The prime minister has stressed the great importance of the legislation to British authorities investigating criminal and terrorist activity. One of us, Paddy McGuinness, has testified before both houses of Congress to make the case for this change. President Trump adopted this priority upon taking office as part of his call for lawful access to information.In addition to improved law enforcement, this model advances American leadership in cybersecurity. American and British innovation created the internet, and United States-based companies dominate the online landscape. With that central role in the internet comes a responsibility to work with partners that share our values to support their safety and security. Any nation motivated to enter into an agreement with the United States will have to meet American standards of due process and ensure a commitment to the rule of law, not authoritarian whim.Some have argued that it is improper for the United States government to assert the authority to compel disclosure of data stored abroad. But Britain is one of many nations that already asserts this authority. The proposed law would not only put the United States on a par with these other nations but would also do so on its terms.Others argue the bill unwisely provides the American and British governments new powers to obtain private information. The reality is that courts in both governments already have the authority to compel a service provider to comply with a warrant, and we have a longstanding, but slow, treaty process for enforcing cross-border warrants. The Cloud Act considers these issues and provides thoughtful and swifter solutions. Neither government will issue a warrant without judicial approval.We can build an international system in which rights-respecting countries can have access to the data they need to investigate serious crimes regardless of where companies choose to store it. This legislation is the first step.The authority is critical. With it, law enforcement officials in the United States, Britain and other countries with similar due-process standards would be empowered to investigate people suspected of terrorism and serious crimes like murder, human trafficking and the sexual abuse of children, regardless of where the suspects\u2019 data happens to be stored. Obtaining access to overseas data held by companies subject to our jurisdiction is entirely consistent with our treaty obligations and international norms. With this legislation, our countries can meet these longstanding obligations, and meet them faster.The longer it takes to address this problem, the more our mutual public safety and national security will be undermined by the current legal obstacles to disclosure of data across borders.Advertisement"}

She checked the Drudge Report, \u201ca one-stop shop,\u201d she admitted, for all of her news updates. She caved with Facebook, using the network to coordinate birthday plans (\u201cWhen it\u2019s your birthday, it\u2019s like the best Facebook day ever,\u201d she said). And then she gave in to the allure of her social media feed to keep tabs on the Minnesota Vikings through the N.F.L. playoffs.\u201cI was basically set up for failure from the beginning,\u201d Ms. Kremers, an employee at the University of Minnesota, said with a laugh. \u201cGoing completely cold turkey in all of these different realms at once was too much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like cleaning out your whole house and deciding, \u2018O.K., what do I want to put back into the house?\u2019\u201d Mr. Newport said. His own online weakness, he said, is baseball trading rumors.He assured his followers that there was no reason to eliminate anything essential: email for work, checking finances, staying in touch with family. Don\u2019t get rid of anything that would jeopardize work or family.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity and uncertainty in the role that these technologies should play in personal and professional life,\u201d Mr. Newport said. \u201cWe\u2019re past the stage where they\u2019re novel, but not to the point where they\u2019re stable.\u201dHe estimated that nearly 2,000 people worldwide said they would participate in his challenge, tailoring their restrictions to match their work demands but hoping to at least limit their daily diet of news and social media.At her university in Boras, Sweden, Elin Hedin, 23, stopped using Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Messenger and Instagram. She also tried to limit the amount of time she browsed websites.In the first week, it felt like a vacation and she slept better. But then, she said, the loneliness kicked in.\u201cI\u2018ve often felt isolated, and kind of lonely,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cI miss reading about people\u2019s days, seeing what they\u2019re up to on Instagram, reading about their opinions on the latest news, and so on.\u201d\u201cI guess I\u2019m just used to getting that extra bit of socializing,\u201d she added.For Anya Mushakevich, a 20-year-old Belarusian studying at the University of Pennsylvania, the lack of online socializing made clear which of her friends abroad would make the effort to stay in touch outside the convenience of Facebook. Who among her circle in Belarus or in Singapore, where she attended high school, would take the time to find her email or phone number?\u201cI feel more invested in the time I spend with people. And because we interact less frequently, we have this idea that we want to make the most of the experience,\u201d said Ms. Mushakevich, who says she is unlikely to reinstall the Facebook app on her phone. \u201cThat makes it seem more meaningful than if we had all of the time in the world, like we do on Facebook.\u201dMr. Newport continues to send messages of daily encouragement to readers who participated in his challenge. It made most realize, he said, how dependent they had become on websites and mobile phone apps.\u201cTheir role in your life has grown without your permission,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one had that in mind when they signed up for Facebook to stay in touch with their college roommate.\u201dA majority of the people who reported back to Mr. Newport with their results in unplugging noted that they had picked up new hobbies: painting, exercise, the opportunity to write a book.

When you care about something, you\u2019re willing to see ads to experience it.\u201dThat has already proven to be true in some instances, Facebook revealed on Wednesday. The shift to more meaningful content has just started rolling out, but the company made other changes last year as a precursor to the latest moves, including cutting down on viral videos. In response, Facebook users over all reduced the time they spent on the platform by roughly 50 million hours a day, Mr. Zuckerberg said, which translates to about two minutes a day for each of the company\u2019s 1.4 billion daily users.Other measures of engagement also fell. The company said the number of people in the United States and Canada who use Facebook on a daily basis fell for the first time ever in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, dropping to 184 million from 185 million a year earlier.Mr. Zuckerberg said these declines were just fluctuations as Facebook made changes to its platform. Over all, the total number of people who use Facebook monthly jumped 14 percent in the fourth quarter to 2.13 billion users, which is a rate of growth that is far higher than that of many other social media companies.\u201cWe have a responsibility to fully understand how our services are used and amplify the good,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Facebook also continued to spend ferociously over the fourth quarter, with capital expenditures reaching $2.3 billion. The company said its number of employees increased 47 percent from a year ago to 25,105 people.\u201cFacebook has taken a conciliatory tone in terms of coming to terms with its power over advertising and how people interact and engage with each other,\u201d said Debra Williamson, an analyst with research firm eMarketer.

{"Headline": "Meat and Potatoes Made Magical", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenFor a special occasion, your best friend, sweetheart or spouse deserves the finest dinner you can produce. For many people, that means the simple luxury of steak and potatoes. Instead of going to a crowded restaurant, you can easily pull off this meal at home \u2014 and use the money you save by splurging on an expensive, top-quality cut like rib-eye or tenderloin or strip steak.Of the three choices, I prefer the rib-eye. It makes the most succulent steak, richly marbled and very tasty. (In France, this cut is called c\u00f4te de boeuf, and considered very special.)Not to dismiss the milder tenderloin, sliced into filets mignon, but to me those are best pan-fried in butter with a lot of pepper. They are delicious, but not as meaty. Strip loin, or New York strip steak, can be quite lean and thus a bit chewy, but some swear by it. I find it makes a good roast beef, cooked whole.But we digress. Assuming you\u2019re going for a high-end steak, you\u2019ll want to stop in a real butcher shop if you can. Or, order from a source you trust. It will cost you, but will still be cheaper than dinner out for two. Rather than buying two pieces for two people, get one large steak, about two inches thick. It will produce juicier, more flavorful meat. Cover it with generous dashes of salt and pepper, a little sliced garlic and some roughly chopped rosemary, then leave it for a while to absorb the seasonings. (You\u2019ll remove the garlic before cooking, as it would burn immediately in the hot skillet.)Start the steak in a scorching hot cast-iron pan on the stovetop, to brown one side well. Flip, then proceed by popping the pan in a hot oven to roast until done in the center and the interior reaches 120 degrees, usually 8 to 10 minutes. Let it rest 10 minutes or so before slicing into wide strips, across the grain. The residual heat will get the steak\u2019s interior to medium-rare.My favorite simple potato dish right now is made by boiling the tiny ones called pee-wee (even smaller than baby potatoes) in heavily salted water and tossing them with butter, garlic, parsley and lemon zest. They take but 10 minutes to cook and are fragrant and delicious, with extra potato flavor from the skins. You might substitute your own preferred potato, of course: mashed, baked or otherwise.I\u2019m suggesting this for a Valentine\u2019s Day dinner \u00e0 deux. (Throughout the year, however, at my house, we just call it \u201cSteak Night,\u201d and consider it an occasional, no-occasion indulgence.) The fact that it\u2019s dead easy to make doesn\u2019t diminish its appeal, and sometimes it is the perfect solution on a night when you\u2019re not inclined to embark on a kitchen project.Steak and potatoes is great for any last minute celebration and quick to prepare. Just open a great bottle of wine. It\u2019s a simple, no-fuss dinner, yet very special.And to Drink \u2026cookingAdvertisement"}

Some criticized the change as an erasure of the organization\u2019s history. Others took issue with the choice of a generic-sounding name over one reflecting the origins of PS122, which was founded in 1980 when a group of artists took over an abandoned public school.The initial outcry has subsided, but as Performance Space prepares to present the East Village Series \u2014 the first series organized by Ms. Schlenzka \u2014 this weekend, questions linger about the new identity. To what extent does a name matter? What happens to the history it holds? How to reconcile this renaming, a break from the past, with the East Village Series programming, which takes inspiration from the history of Performance Space and its neighborhood?Speaking by phone last week, Ms. Schlenzka said that although she had read some negative comments online, she felt the reception of the name over all had been \u201cso much more positive and understanding than I anticipated, especially from people I was very nervous to tell.\u201dAmong those people, she said, was Tim Miller, a founder of PS122 whose designs for brochures and posters helped to create its original visual identity.\u201cI think PS122 already was quite a good brand, and obviously I would,\u201d Mr. Miller said in a phone interview. \u201cBut what happens there is what will matter more.\u201dThe performance artist Lucy Sexton, who served on PS122\u2019s board of directors in the 1990s, said that the heated reactions stemmed from a strong sense of community and ownership of the space among artists, beginning with the founders. \u201cContinuing generations have also felt that ownership,\u201d she said.More important than the name, she added, was that \u201cwe maintain the ethos of the space.\u201dFor others who guided PS122 through its early years, the new name has been harder to accept. Mark Russell, the artistic and executive director from 1983 to 2004, noted the importance of places and names within the elusive medium of performance.\u201cWhat\u2019s left after a performance is so ephemeral that the theater dust of this, the history of this, which is sometimes mostly communicated verbally \u2014 it matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThose places matter.\u201dMs. Schlenzka reiterated that the change was part of an effort to make the space more accessible and identifiable. (In the past, she said, people had sometimes confused PS122 with a public school.)On the question of erasing what came before, she said: \u201cIf anything, the history of our organization is our biggest asset and our biggest inspiration. The East Village Series is an invitation to have that conversation.\u201dOn Sunday the focus shifts to Performance Space\u2019s storied past with Avant-Garde-Arama, a raucous live art sampler that dates back to PS122\u2019s earliest days. The free event will feature more than 30 artists performing throughout the renovated theaters and offices.The months ahead will bring a sub-series focused on the writer Kathy Acker, and commissioned works by Ms. Michelson and Yve Laris Cohen, both of whom will explore the architecture and history of the building, Ms. Schlenzka said.For some, visiting the two new top-floor theaters \u2014 which bear little resemblance to the scrappier old ones \u2014 has contributed to a change of heart. The once bereft Mr. Paraiso called the larger of the two theaters, with its high ceilings and views of Lower Manhattan, \u201can epiphany, a revelation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come sort of 180 degrees from my initial reaction,\u201d he said, \u201cto feeling more pragmatically that the new executive artistic director should be able to start afresh with a clean slate and her own artistic vision of the present and into the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was devastated that I tried to have a cordial relationship with his ex-wife (who wronged him). He felt betrayed that I didn\u2019t mirror his feelings toward her, and abandoned by my attempts to create a workable relationship for their children. Frankly, I can no more apologize and have a hand-holding cry with him than fly to the moon. I am emotionally detached, and he is wildly demonstrative. How to bridge this gap?S. C.Creating categories can be comforting, even when they are utter nonsense: the four humors of the ancient Greeks, for instance, or the blood-type diet. Your husband is not upset with you because of your incompatible temperaments. No, he\u2019s distraught because you are not (and I suspect, never were) sorry for your behavior. Any apology you made would be unsatisfying. You feel no actual remorse.Instead, you made a pragmatic call about the best way to deal with his ex-wife.

Should I say something?GINAWhen I was a kid, happily singing along with my mother to \u201cJudy Garland Live at Carnegie Hall,\u201d my brother blared scary rock music from his bedroom upstairs. I remember one song he played, over and over, by the J. Geils Band, about a guy who is deeply distraught that his former girlfriend posed for a naked centerfold in a magazine. Danger is relative, Gina.Posting 15 selfies to land the right sunglasses does seem over-the-top, but much less dangerous than posting sexually suggestive pictures \u2014 or those depicting substance abuse or other potentially harmful behaviors.

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Hysterectomies", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationFacebook is so persistent and skillful at unearthing past versions of yourself that you would rather forget. A few weeks ago, it reminded me about a photo from the fall of 2016: I\u2019m in a train station outside Milan, waiting for a ride to a beautiful, small Italian town, and there\u2019s a fake, slightly annoyed smile on my face, even though I should be happy.But I\u2019m not, because I\u2019m in a great deal of physical pain, as per usual. It was as if my lower organs were stacked on top of each other, heavy as stones, and there was an unrelenting sense of fullness: intense pressure on my uterus and bladder, a swollen, dense feeling. I didn\u2019t question it. I just thought: This is the pain I have to live with in my life.I\u2019d had fibroids for several years. By the time I was 43, my uterus had turned into something like a floating, abandoned spaceship upon which alien life forces had attached themselves, wreaking havoc on its mainframe. I suffered through all the greatest gynecological hits: cramps, extra-long PMS and periods and excessive bleeding. It is no exaggeration to say that half my days were spent worrying about my menstrual cycle.In the past, my doctor had, on occasion, suggested I get a hysterectomy that would remove my uterus and the accompanying fibroids, in order to solve the problems I was having. But each time, I hesitated, and a handful of hesitations that take only a second added up to years of failing to make a decision. I was aware of what was going on inside of me \u2014 I had pain, I recognized it \u2014 but I could not bring myself to contend with it.The reasons piled up: Secretly lodged somewhere in my psyche was the sense, however irrational and antiquated, that the ability to have babies felt relevant to my physical identity as a woman, though I have never actually wanted to have a child. My bare-bones freelancer health insurance meant that having the operation would have emptied out my bank account, and then some. (I had recently gotten out of debt, and I wasn\u2019t ready to be broke again just to feel a nebulous \u201cbetter.\u201d) I travel a lot for work, and there never seemed to be a right moment to take the six weeks off required for recovery. I, like most people, have a fear of extreme physical pain. But draped over all of those rationalizations was my most powerful and seductive weakness: denial. I was fine! I didn\u2019t even know what anyone was talking about! I was fine!So instead I struggled through my existence in partial pain. The symptoms had built up over time, and I had simply grown accustomed to feeling bad. A lot of people spend their lives in pain, often because our upbringing or gender or religion or self-esteem decrees that we deserve to suffer through it, that we aren\u2019t entitled to feel good \u2014 perhaps women more than most. Nearly our entire lives, from the first day we get our periods until menopause, we trade gestures of sympathy over menstrual cramps, a bond that is both heartening and depressing: We\u2019re destined to feel this way forever, so we might as well get used to it.But then, through some confluence of events, a mental shift occurred in me. First, I signed a book deal, so I had a little money in the bank. Next, I moved to a new city, got new health insurance and a new doctor. During my first appointment, she felt around inside of me and instantly sensed trouble. \u201cDo you feel ... O.K.?\u201d she asked, before informing me that, among all the other problems of which I was already aware, I had a tipped uterus, which was likely the source of additional pain. Something about a complete stranger\u2019s pointing out even more gynecological issues forced me to admit that in fact I was not O.K. I did not feel good, and I needed to fix it, desperately.That week, we scheduled the hysterectomy for just after the new year. Within a month, my uterus was gone. This thing that had tortured me for years had disappeared, in a snap. It took me six months to fully recover, but then, that was it: I hadn\u2019t understood I could just feel better.And then I couldn\u2019t stop feeling better. I felt so good that I nearly forgot what it was like to feel bad in the first place. For years, I\u2019d just accepted there would be times when my emotions and mood could be affected by the pain and hormones. There had often been a haziness that hung between my physical and emotional selves. Now a clearer and calmer version of me was in charge. The problem had been removed. I recognized I had the power to remove other things from my life that I\u2019d held onto for too long for all the wrong reasons, things that no longer worked and caused me pain or trouble. A leased apartment I hadn\u2019t lived in for a few years and had been renting out to a stranger? I closed up shop on it. The love letters I hadn\u2019t read in years but kept just because I liked the idea of being loved? I hadn\u2019t realized they were holding me back, so I tossed them unblinkingly. And these days I have coffee only with people I want to have coffee with and not people I feel as if I should, just because they asked nicely.Now I ask myself all the time: \u201cHow do I want to feel today?\u201d (The answer is never \u201cbad.\u201d) Having a hysterectomy required me to let go of my fears and misdirected beliefs, yes, but also I had to arrive at a new awareness that I deserved to feel great. You can just cut out the thing that doesn\u2019t work. Now I know.Jami Attenberg lives in New Orleans. Her most recent novel is \u201cAll Grown Up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Life and Death of Nigel, the World\u2019s Loneliest Seabird", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The story of a lonely seabird named Nigel who tried to woo a mate that had a heart of stone and died on an uninhabited island off New Zealand has captivated many on social media.His solitary life shined a light on a yearslong effort by an army of conservationists, devoted volunteers and others to repopulate his species on the island.News of the seabird\u2019s death in late January hit the island\u2019s caretakers and social media users hard.\u201cIt seems like such a wrong ending for Nigel to die now,\u201d said Chris Bell, 37, a ranger for the New Zealand Conservation Department, who found the seabird dead in his nest. \u201cJust when it looked like it could get better for him.\u201dIn the 1990s, conservationists set up concrete gannets on the western side of Mana to lure real birds. They painted the decoys\u2019 beaks yellow, the wingtips black, the plumage white. They played seabird calls over solar-powered speakers.On the very first day, two gannets swooped in, Mr. Bell said by phone early Saturday. Conservationists congratulated themselves on their instant success. But soon, the birds flew away, and the project stalled.Then came Nigel.He quickly took a liking to one of the concrete replicas, according to Mr. Bell, who says he\u2019s the only full-time employee on the island. Month after month, the bird cozied up to his chosen mate, but \u201cshe\u201d remained aloof.A botanist doing a survey for Friends of Mana Island named the bird Nigel \u201cno mates\u201d because he had no friends.\u201cI think the saddest part of this story is what a frustrating existence to be courting this stone bird and getting nothing back,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cNot getting rejected, not getting encouragement.\u201dThough Nigel lived a mostly solitary life on the island, he became the linchpin of the efforts to draw other gannets to Mana.The colony was one of several seabird projects undertaken by a partnership that included a local tribe, Friends of Mana Island and the Conservation Department to drive gannets to spread out and inhabit other islands.\u201cNew Zealand was an amazing place for seabirds before humans arrived,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cLots of seabirds nested on the land. Bringing seabirds back to the land is important.\u201dThe seabirds are key to the project because they provide nutrients in the soil for insects and plants to thrive, according to Friends of Mana Island.Mana, which was farmed from the 1820s to the 1980s, is pest free. It has been restored with 500,000 native trees, and lizards, seabirds and other native birds have been translocated, Friends of Mana Island said.\u201cMana Island is a great scientific reserve because Mana never had rats,\u201d Mr. Bell said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a great place to reintroduce species.\u201dIn December, after years of hoping the Mana seabird project would take off, conservationists redoubled efforts to build up the colony. They repositioned the decoys and moved the speakers so that recorded bird sounds would be carried clear out to sea. The fake birds got fresh paint. And suddenly, Nigel had company.\u201cWithin 10 days of that,\u201d Mr. Bell said, \u201cthere were three more gannets\u201d on the island.The conservationists were elated but cautious, hoping they would stay. But Nigel? He avoided the birds, refusing to leave his concrete mate.Then one day, Mr. Bell found him dead.\u201cIt\u2019s really sad he died,\u201d Mr. Bell said, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t for nothing.\u201dThe bird left a legacy to the island, he said. For all anyone knew, Mr. Bell said, \u201cother birds had came before, seen the concrete decoys and said, \u2018Ugh, we\u2019re not fooled by that.\u2019 But Nigel was fooled.\u201dHis presence most likely helped draw the three birds there and persuaded them to hang out. Now, the hope is that the new flock will stick around \u2014 and breed.\u201cThese birds interact with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if the birds are communicating with one another, there\u2019s a chance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A 3-D Look Inside the Tasmanian Tiger\u2019s Pouch, Long After Extinction", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe extinct Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, bears an uncanny resemblance to today\u2019s canines.Like dogs, wolves and dingoes, it was a carnivore with a svelte body, long, narrow snout and strong hind legs. But the Tasmanian tiger was a marsupial, meaning it had a pouch like a kangaroo. And despite the similarities, the Tasmanian tiger last shared a common ancestor with the placental pack some 160 million years ago during the Jurassic period.He said it was one of the most apparent cases of convergent evolution, where two unrelated organisms evolve to look or function alike because of the similar niches they fill in their environments.Now, by studying baby thylacines preserved in jars, Dr. Pask and his colleagues have pinpointed when those similarities began to develop. Using CT-scanning, the team revealed, for the first time digitally, the developmental stages of the extinct thylacine.Marsupials don\u2019t have a placenta, so when they give birth their young are born premature. All of these babies, from koalas to wombats, look like pink jelly beans.\u201cThey are alien-like with a little head and no eyes yet,\u201d said Dr. Pask. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got these forearms that have impressive muscles and little claws and paws they use to climb into the pouch.\u201dAs thylacines nurse, a change occurs that distinguishes them from other marsupial species, the team found. Somewhere from week five to week eight, their hind legs and faces elongate, giving them a puppy-like appearance.\u201cThe bones are growing much more like a big canid or other large body predators, than they do in other marsupials,\u201d said Christy Hipsley, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Melbourne and Museums Victoria, and an author on the paper. \u201cKnowing when that happens can lead us to understanding why that happens and under what circumstances.\u201dAfter about twelve weeks, the striped joeys are ready to leave their mother\u2019s pouch.The team constructed the Tasmanian tiger\u2019s developmental timeline after studying all of the 13 known thylacine pouch pups in the world from collections in Australia, Tasmania and the Czech Republic. But after conducting their CT scans, they discovered that two of the specimens were mislabeled and actually belonged to some other marsupial.Verity Bennett, an expert in marsupial evolution at Cardiff University, who was not involved in the paper, said the research added another important piece of data to the growing understanding of marsupial development.\u201cIt shows despite its relatively \u2018unique\u2019 ecology and skeletal morphology, the early development of the thylacine is generally consistent with that of other marsupials, \u201d Dr. Bennett said.READ MORE:Tasmanian Tigers\u2019 Brains Yield Clues Long After ExtinctionCall of the Thylacine: Protect the Wild_____Advertisement"}

Karina Armijo, the town\u2019s director of marketing and tourism, said in a telephone interview that complaints had subsided.\u201cI have never heard the Taos hum, but I\u2019ve heard stories of the Taos hum,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s not been a lot of buzz about it in the last few years.\u201d\u201cIn fact, one affected resident had become so disturbed that she moved more than 700 miles away to relieve her symptoms,\u201d it said.Mr. Carpenter said it was possible a major source of the Windsor hum could be eliminated and other mechanical sources would replace it, entering the \u201cheard spectrum.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible that no matter what is done to relieve or attenuate the noise, it might never be enough,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Stand With the \u2018She-Devils\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Missouri, an acolyte of President Trump is running for the U.S. Senate and denouncing \u201cmanophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils.\u201dThe candidate, Courtland Sykes, a conservative Republican, is seeking to oust a moderate Democrat, Claire McCaskill. That diatribe by Sykes is worth quoting as a window into the backlash against #MeToo and empowered women:\u201cI don\u2019t buy the non-stop feminization campaign against manhood,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to come home to a home cooked dinner at six every night, one that [my fianc\u00e9e] fixes and one that I expect one day to have daughters learn to fix.\u201dSpeaking of those daughters, Sykes clarifies: \u201cI don\u2019t want them [to] grow up into career obsessed banshees who \u2026 become nail-biting manophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils.\u201dSykes, who has not been endorsed by Donald Trump and who seems unlikely to be elected, says that young women are turning against feminism because of distaste for Hillary Clinton: \u201cThey look at her personal life\u2019s wreckage and didn\u2019t want to become like her.\u201dProgress on women\u2019s rights has been enormous since I was a kid and Margaret Chase Smith was the only female senator (she had to line up with tourists for bathroom breaks, as there was then no restroom designated for female senators). As recently as 1987, only half of Americans said that it was always wrong for a man to beat his wife with a belt or stick.Men like Sykes reflect the other dimension, the powerful backlash fueled by a combination of male resentment, anxiety at social change and a newfound freedom in the Age of Trump to say things that were previously beyond the pale.Backlashes go way back, of course. After Mary Wollstonecraft published her \u201cVindication of the Rights of Woman\u201d in 1792, laying the groundwork for discussions of gender equity, Horace Walpole mocked her as a \u201chyena in petticoats,\u201d and she was savaged for her \u201cwhoredoms.\u201dWhy is a man writing this column? Frankly, because women\u2019s rights aren\u2019t \u201cjust a woman\u2019s issue,\u201d any more than civil rights were \u201cjust a black issue.\u201d We all have an interest in a more fair society \u2014 and if only women speak up for gender equity, they may be dismissed as shrill \u201chyenas.\u201dWhat matters above all are policies. That means pushing for easier family leave, better child care, more women on boards, and cracking down on sex trafficking and domestic violence. It means helping teenage girls avoid pregnancy, providing locations at work for moms to express milk, and confronting the general tendency to defer to male self-confidence rather than female expertise. It means a determined effort to hold accountable sexual predators even when they\u2019re not Hollywood figures but simply factory supervisors or shift managers at a McDonald\u2019s.Of course there will be disagreements about policies or about where to draw lines \u2014 about what to make of Aziz Ansari and how to distinguish between the Harvey Weinsteins and the Al Frankens. But those controversies are secondary.The fundamental fault line today is between those working toward broader opportunity and those yearning for a mythic past before feminists developed \u201cnasty, snake-filled heads.\u201d To be on the right side of history, we should all, men and women alike, stand on the side of the she-devils.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Director\u2019s Apology Adds Momentum to South Korea\u2019s #MeToo Movement", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 One of South Korea\u2019s most prominent theater directors apologized on Monday for sexually abusing actresses, part of a slowly building #MeToo movement in a deeply male-dominated society.Mr. Lee\u2019s apology on Monday came five days after a Facebook post by a former actress set off a cascade of abuse accusations against him.\u201cI could not refuse. He was the king of the world where I belonged,\u201d said the former actress, Kim Soo-hee, describing how Mr. Lee had called her to his hotel room. \u201cWhen I opened the door, I saw him lying on the bed, and as expected, he ordered me to give him a massage. After a while, he suddenly took his pants off.\u201dIn South Korea, men still dominate the top echelons of government, business and the arts, presiding over a strictly hierarchical code that makes women particularly vulnerable to abuse and bias.Women\u2019s rights advocates have long warned that male supervisors exploit the country\u2019s command-and-compliance work culture, where an employee\u2019s personal relationship with her bosses often determines her chances for promotion.Mr. Lee\u2019s admission on Monday attested to the lasting nature of the problem. \u201cThis is a very bad thing that has been happening customarily for the past 18 years,\u201d he said.South Korea has made strides on women\u2019s rights in recent years, as more women have moved into the government, judiciary and corporate world. Long gone are the days when women in a Korean family were not allowed to eat at the same table as men or had to wait until men were finished. Government agencies and big corporations have instituted mandatory classes on harassment in recent years.Still, in this deeply patriarchal society, sons in many families still get the lion\u2019s shares of inheritances from parents, and in workplaces, women are often treated like temporary employees expected to quit once they marry.The World Economic Forum ranks the country 118th of 144 in terms of gender equality. Men earn 37 percent more than women on average, a gap in wages that puts South Korea at the bottom of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. (The gap is 18 percent in the United States and 26 percent in Japan.)As elsewhere, sexual abuse victims often remain quiet for fear of losing their jobs or being ostracized in the workplace. In 2009, a young actress named Jang Ja-yeon committed suicide, leaving behind a handwritten note saying she had been forced to provide sexual favors to entertainment executives.But as the #MeToo movement has erupted around the world, complaints in South Korea have trickled out. In November, a 25-year-old employee of the furniture maker Hanssem posted a detailed account of being sexually assaulted by male colleagues. In another episode, nurses at Hallym University Medical Center in Anyang, south of Seoul, said they were told to dance in skimpy outfits at work-related events.A broader outcry and lasting reforms, however, have been slow to materialize. A tipping point appears to have come last month when a prosecutor named Seo Ji-hyeon asserted that a senior male prosecutor groped her at a funeral in 2010.Writing in an internal web log for prosecutors, she said she had been so deeply traumatized that she had a miscarriage.\u201cI wanted to speak out but many discouraged me, saying: \u2018It will be a piece of cake for them to turn you into a fool. If you speak up now, they will make you look like an inefficient, problematic, weirdo prosecutor,\u2019 \u201d she wrote in her posting. \u201cThey said, \u2018Keep your mouth shut and go back to your work.\u2019 \u201dIn this newly open environment, news outlets have resurfaced a poem published last fall about an unidentified literary giant, accused of serially groping young women.In \u201cThe Beast,\u201d the poet Choi Young-mi did not name her subject, but the media quickly singled out Ko Un, a South Korean poet often cited as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.Kim Myoung-in, the editor of the magazine that published Ms. Choi\u2019s poem, lamented, \u201cI myself cannot avoid the accusation that I aided and abetted because I had never tried to stop it.\u201d In a Facebook post, he said that female writers were often sexually harassed by senior writers and publishing executives and that Mr. Ko\u2019s pattern had been well known for decades.Mr. Ko has not commented publicly on the accusations, but the new attention to male behavior seems to suggest that a wall of silence in South Korea is being eroded.Ms. Seo, the prosecutor whose case set off the #MeToo wave here, said that after she first sought an investigation, she was transferred to an obscure post in a provincial town. She spoke up publicly after the senior prosecutor she accused, Ahn Tae-geun, was fired last year in a corruption scandal.Mr. Ahn told reporters, \u201cIt happened so long ago, and I was heavily drunk, so I don\u2019t remember, but if such an act happened, then I sincerely apologize.\u201dIn November, Parliament improved protections for victims of sexual harassment, increasing penalties for employers who discriminate against them or fail to investigate abuse.Still, a fresh reminder of the obstacles victims have faced in South Korea came only minutes before Mr. Lee held his news conference on Monday.\u201cEven my boyfriend, who was a member of his theater group, kept silent,\u201d she wrote.An earlier version of this article misstated Lee Youn-taek\u2019s age. He is 65, not 66.Advertisement"}

My. Kid. My kid is dead. It goes through my head all day. And night.\u201dThe consequences from the shooting have reverberated far beyond school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., as schools around the nation closed Friday, or canceled activities after receiving threats. A teacher in Denver said she moved items from a closet in her classroom \u201cto make more space for 9-year-olds to hide.\u201dHere\u2019s the latest:\u2022 A federal law enforcement official on Friday said that Mr. Cruz fired more than 100 rounds during the shooting.\u2022 Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County said that his office had received about 20 calls about Mr. Cruz over the past two years, though cautioned that some of the calls may not have resulted in a response by officers.\u2022 More than 2,000 students have been interviewed as part of the investigation, the sheriff said. He added that Mr. Cruz did not have a gas mask or smoke grenades, as had previously been reported.The F.B.I.\u2019s admission that it failed to act on a tip in January from a person close to Mr. Cruz prompted Gov. Rick Scott of Florida to call for the bureau\u2019s director to resign.The bureau, which was already under considerable political pressure because of its investigation into Mr. Trump, faced calls for even more scrutiny following the massacre.Mr. Scott said that Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., should step down and that the bureau\u2019s failure to act on the tip about Mr. Cruz was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cSeventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn\u2019t going to cut it,\u201d Mr. Scott said in a statement.In an unusually sharp public rebuke of his own agents, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday that the missed warnings had \u201ctragic consequences\u201d and that \u201cthe F.B.I. in conjunction with our state and local partners must act flawlessly to prevent all attacks. This is imperative, and we must do better.\u201dRobert F. Lasky, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. field office in Miami, said the agency advised the victims\u2019 parents about the misstep in a conference call on Friday.At the first funeral, Alyssa Miriam Alhadeff, 14, was remembered for her joy and kindness, traits that had attracted a wide circle of friends. Hundreds of mourners filled the Star of David Funeral Chapel in North Lauderdale, Fla., spilling outside.Among the youngest victims, Alyssa, an honor student and a player for the Parkland soccer club, was buried in the Garden of Aaron at Star of David Memorial Gardens.Her mother, Lori Alhadeff, urged Alyssa\u2019s friends to stay in touch, but also let their future success be her daughter\u2019s legacy. \u201cLive, breathe for Alyssa,\u201d she said.Before her were hundreds of mourners, seated in row upon row and crowding every wall and corner: her cousins, her classmates, the governor and so many others. She is survived by many family members, including her brothers and her grandmother Evelyn.Her father stood in a black suit before the crowd.\u201cHow does this happen to my beautiful, smart, loving daughter?\u201d Mr. Pollack said. \u201cShe is everything. If we could learn one thing from this tragedy, it\u2019s that our everythings are not safe when we send them to school.\u201dThe room heaved with sobbing teenagers, and mourners wheeled out Ms. Pollack\u2019s coffin, to be buried in a nearby cemetery.The Trumps arrived Friday evening at a hospital in Pompano Beach that took in eight of the shooting victims, accompanied by John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.The president and Mrs. Trump visited the Broward Health North Hospital \u201cto pay their respects and thank the medical professionals for their life-saving assistance,\u201d according to a statement related by a White House spokeswoman on Friday evening.When asked if he met with victims, Mr. Trump said: \u201cYes, I did. I did indeed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s sad something like that could happen,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump did not respond when he was asked if gun laws needed to be changed.

Some schools opt to make the drills feel partially authentic \u2014 an approach several schools backed off from this week out of fear they would stir already heightened anxieties.At Dysart High School in El Mirage, Ariz., the principal took extra steps to make sure students knew its previously scheduled drill on Thursday was, in fact, just a drill.

He has a \u201csignificant\u201d history of mental illness, according to Mr. Weekes, and may be autistic or have a learning disability. But Mr. Weekes was not ready to say whether he would pursue a mental health defense.Howard Finkelstein, the chief public defender in Broward County, said the case would present a difficult question: Should society execute mentally ill people?\u201cThere\u2019s no question of whether he will be convicted of capital murder 17 times,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we let one of our children fall off grid, when they are screaming for help in every way, do we have the right to kill them when we could have stopped it?\u201dOthers, including some gun control and mental health advocates, point to the increasing number of states that allow law enforcement officers or, in some cases, family members or others to petition a court to temporarily take guns from people who pose a danger to themselves or others.The measures, known as \u201cred flag laws\u201d or extreme risk protection orders, have shown evidence of reducing suicides in Connecticut, where the first such law was passed in 1999, and in recent years have also been passed in California, Washington and Oregon.

{"Headline": "Trump Tries to Shift Blame to Obama for Not Countering Russian Meddling", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, who spent months belittling charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, has managed to revive questions about how his predecessor, President Barack Obama, handled suspicions about Russia in the months before the election.Some former Obama officials now confess to misgivings about Mr. Obama\u2019s reluctance to act, or speak out more forcefully, even as the evidence piled up during the spring and summer of 2016 that the Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee and were behind the leak of damaging emails about Hillary Clinton.\u201cIf there was a problem, it was that the government didn\u2019t have any levers to pull in this space,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser and one of Mr. Obama\u2019s closest aides. \u201cThe U.S. government isn\u2019t designed to guard against the manipulation of every individual American\u2019s Facebook feed and Twitter feed.\u201d\u201cSo it comes back to one question,\u201d Mr. Rhodes added. \u201cCould he have talked about it more?\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump seized on Mr. Obama\u2019s comments, which he made at a Rose Garden news conference a month before the election and which was recycled this week by one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite news shows, \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d as evidence that the former president did not confront allegations of Russian hacking.Mr. Obama, his former aides said, had hoped that the announcement, by the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and the Department of Homeland Security, would follow a bipartisan statement by congressional leaders about the need for state and local authorities to guard their voter-registration and balloting machines from Russian hacking.The White House provided an intelligence briefing to the lawmakers, including Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the Senate majority leader. But Mr. McConnell, two former officials said, refused to back a statement publicly challenging Russia and told Mr. Obama that he would view an effort by the White House to do that as partisan.Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said that the White House asked him to sign a letter warning about the threat of cyberattacks, and that he did so. But that letter did not name Russia and only spoke generally about the threat to the electoral process.Other Republican senators faulted the Obama administration on Tuesday for failing to warn officials in 21 states where intelligence agencies had detected efforts by the Russians to probe voting machines that they were at risk of being infiltrated. In some cases, officials in those states were not cleared to be briefed on the intelligence.\u201cI am very concerned that the Obama administration did so little,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. She added, referring to the F.B.I. director at the time, \u201cThey were aware \u2014 the intelligence community leaders were fully aware, whether it was Jim Clapper or James Comey, that the Russians were attempting to interfere in our elections \u2014 and they put out that brief statement before the election.\u201dSenator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said that even after Mr. Obama formally named Russia, the administration declined to declassify information related to meddling by the Kremlin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why they continued to sit on that information,\u201d he said.Some former administration officials said they pushed for the United States to take pre-emptive or deterrent measures against Russia in the summer of 2016. But the White House was reluctant, in part because the intelligence agencies still had not reached a consensus about who was responsible for the hacking. There were also concerns about Russia retaliating and whether the United States should use similar tactics.Looming over all this was Mr. Obama\u2019s worry that if he spoke out strongly, he would be viewed as trying to tilt the vote.\u201cHe really did feel, in September and October of an election year, as the head of the Democratic Party, that his role in adjudicating the information Americans received should be limited,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cIf he had ratcheted up that rhetoric, we would have seen exactly what we see today. It would have been called fake news.\u201dCarl Hulse and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Fromberg, the group\u2019s deputy commissioner for public affairs, told us. \u201cBut needless to say, there are many drivers who, of their own volition, will be more permissive regarding animals. I\u2019ve heard many stories about the kindness of drivers who have transported passengers with sick animals on their way to the veterinarian\u2019s office or animal hospital.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Get outside while you can \u2014 the rest of the week is looking gloomy and wet.Purim begins tonight.The Jewish holiday, likened to Halloween, revolves around the Book of Esther, also known as the Megillah.The (very) abridged version of the Book: An adored queen named Esther thwarts the evil plot of Haman to murder all the Jews in her kingdom in ancient Persia. She uses her smarts, influence and good will to save her people, and Haman is hanged.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mueller Is Gaining Steam. Should Trump Worry?", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 In a fiery speech to supporters on Friday, President Trump went after his vanquished opponent from 2016. \u201cWe had a crooked candidate,\u201d he declared. The crowd responded with a signature chant from the campaign trail: \u201cLock her up!\u201dMr. Trump is correct that nothing produced publicly by Mr. Mueller to date has claimed any wrongdoing by the president nor any illegal collaboration with the Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election. The indictment of the Russians \u2014 who are accused of flooding Facebook and other social media with disinformation and propaganda \u2014 cited only contact with \u201cunwitting individuals\u201d connected with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.John M. Dowd, the president\u2019s private lawyer, pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s cooperation with the investigation as evidence that he had nothing to hide. He noted that the White House had voluntarily turned over more than 20,000 pages to Mr. Mueller, including documents related to Mr. Flynn and Mr. Comey, and the campaign provided 1.4 million pages.More than 20 White House officials, including eight members of the counsel\u2019s office, voluntarily gave interviews to the special counsel or congressional investigators, as did 17 campaign employees and 11 others affiliated with the campaign, he added.\u201cI give great credit to the president for his extraordinary cooperation with the special counsel,\u201d Mr. Dowd said.Still, as the pileup at the courthouse indicates, allies of Mr. Trump acknowledged that the investigation had taken a toll.\u201cThe good news for the White House is that more than 18 months since the F.B.I. probe began, there is still no evidence of Russian collusion,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax and a friend of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe bad news is that the special counsel has a scorched-earth prosecution aimed at crushing the president\u2019s associates.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think the president is worried about the investigation himself,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it clearly bothers him that people are being prosecuted simply because they worked for his campaign.\u201dInside the White House, officials expressed calm resignation on Friday as Mr. Gates marched into the courthouse. But there was low-grade concern out of recognition that Mr. Gates was in a lot of meetings over a long period of time.While Mr. Gates joined the campaign with Mr. Manafort, his longtime business partner and mentor, he stayed after Mr. Manafort was fired. He rode on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign plane and served as liaison to the Republican National Committee. After the election victory, he joined the transition as a right hand to Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the president\u2019s close friend who ran the inaugural operation.The fact that Mr. Gates was allowed to plead guilty to just two relatively lower-level charges indicated to legal experts that he must have something of value for Mr. Mueller. The presumption in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle is that Mr. Gates may not have any incriminating information about the president but could be a dangerous witness against Mr. Manafort, who in turn could threaten Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump\u2019s argument that none of this has anything to do with him resonates with many of his supporters, who have echoed his repeated insistence that there was no collusion with Russia. But being surrounded by people who are prosecuted has damaged other presidents even when they were not directly implicated.In the current case, the targets so far have included not just a \u201ccoffee boy,\u201d as Mr. Papadopoulos was described by an adviser to Mr. Trump, but the president\u2019s top two campaign officials and national security adviser. While Mr. Trump has dismissed the relevance of allegations against Mr. Manafort because they involved business dealings before the campaign, the latest indictment claims that he was scheming to defraud banks while serving as Mr. Trump\u2019s chairman.Moreover, it remains unclear why he volunteered to work for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign without pay at a time when he was experiencing significant financial pressure.Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders have focused on questioning the original basis for the investigation, accusing the F.B.I. of misconduct in relying on an unverified dossier assembled by a former British spy hired by investigators working for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.To the extent that Mr. Mueller is exploring whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing Mr. Comey, the president\u2019s defenders contend that under the Constitution, he has the power to dismiss executive branch officials and dictate their work. They also point to testimony by Mr. Comey and other officials who said the investigation was not impeded.Therefore, they argue, the original order appointing Mr. Mueller was itself invalid and should be revoked.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to unfold piecemeal an indictment of Russian entities and Russians if you have any hope of building a collusion case. It makes no logical sense,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, at least, what he\u2019s done does underscore that there\u2019s no collusion there. That leaves him with the obstruction of justice narrative which I think is constitutionally flawed and isn\u2019t going to go anywhere.\u201dMr. Wittes said Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions could be seen as building a pyramid \u2014 establishing that there was a Russian influence campaign and assembling a group of cooperating witnesses. But the special counsel has not tipped his hand yet.\u201cThe basic contours of the puzzle is that he\u2019s constructed his actions in a way that we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s leading,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s on purpose.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernytAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeds Only a Plant Breeder Could Love, Until Now", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo Mr. Goldman, a professor of horticulture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, grew the beet himself. He used traditional breeding methods, cross-pollinating flowers, selecting for sweetness, mild earthiness and mellowness.It took him almost 15 years to develop the Badger Flame, a stunning oblong beet with swirls of deep orange. That\u2019s when he hit a wall.\u201cI might have a novelty I\u2019m really excited about, but unless a seed company wants to market it, it doesn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Mr. Goldman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge gap in the business.\u201dPlenty of companies, small and large, work with university plant breeders to distribute new seed varieties. But Row 7 aims to give breeders the chance to reach a big market with their most esoteric and groundbreaking work \u2014 by connecting them with chefs.As they develop new varieties, plant breeders will kick around ideas with chefs across the country, using feedback from the kitchen to guide their research. While Row 7 will consider the needs of regional growers, its founders say that flavor will always come first.Row 7\u2019s founders are betting that as plant breeders and chefs conspire to grow what\u2019s most delicious, they will grab the attention of home gardeners and small- to mid-scale farmers, who can order the seed in bulk. Their new varieties may then pop up at farmers\u2019 markets and high-end grocery stores, and, if demand is high enough, in national supermarket chains and manufactured foods.It sounds ambitious for a new company with such a small selection, not to mention one whose prices are high, from $3.50 for 100 seeds to $4.95 for just 12. But the founders have seen what happens when high-profile chefs flex their marketing muscles.Like all breeders, Mr. Mazourek had reached plenty of dead ends throughout his career. He didn\u2019t see why this miniature squash should be any different, even if it was notably cute and tasty.But Mr. Barber pitched the new variety, calling it out by name at food conferences and cooking with it at his restaurants, where the servers tell diners detailed stories about ingredients. The squash elbowed its way beyond an elite dining scene, through more and more restaurant kitchens, from social media and articles in Vogue and Cooking Light, right into the aisles of national grocery chains and onto dinner tables across the country.In about five years, the Honeynut had risen from academic obscurity. (That\u2019s fast for a squash.)\u201cThe Honeynut could not have happened without chefs,\u201d Mr. Barber said. \u201cThey Instagrammed it, they talked about it, it was on their menus, and it went from zero to 60.\u201dMr. Barber, Mr. Mazourek and Mr. Goldfarb all wondered what might happen if more chefs had a say in which new seeds went to market \u2014 if they played a part in shaping their own food supply.Was it a freakish anomaly, or could the Honeynut effect be repeated over and over again? Could chefs create a demand for new varieties that were more experimental and interesting and diverse, more nutrient-dense and more thoroughly delicious, from root to stem to leaf?Row 7\u2019s seeds are not patented; the company\u2019s founders say they don\u2019t believe in patenting life, and want researchers to have access to information. \u201cAs the climate changes and pests and disease evolve, we have to keep up,\u201d Mr. Mazourek said.For now, all profits from the seed sales will be used to support each plant breeder\u2019s research. (Later, the model could look more like that of other seed companies, which pass only a portion of profits to breeders, or license out particular seeds for royalty fees.)\u201cSo part of what we\u2019re dealing with is, how do we reinvent this pipeline from seed development all the way into the marketplace and to the point of consumption?\u201d he said.Mr. Sligh said that a seed business with chefs in the picture had potential. \u201cIt\u2019s a new and exciting linkage that would be cutting edge,\u201d he said. \u201cChefs have great public access, which plant breeders and farmers don\u2019t have so much.\u201d\u201cWhy would I want to change something in nature?\u201d she said. \u201cNature is perfect.\u201dBut tasting some of Mr. Mazourek\u2019s squash trials gave her a sense of the possibilities. \u201cIt had just never dawned on me that I could talk to a seed breeder and have a conversation like this,\u201d said Ms. Sortun, who has served the Honeynut at her restaurants for years.\u201cI like the focus on utilizing the entire plant,\u201d she said, \u201cand on reducing waste.\u201dHeirlooms, which are older varieties of open-pollinated plants, are prized for their origin stories and their flavors \u2014 though they can be risky for growers. The newer seeds that plant breeders produce, whether open-pollinated or hybrid, are manipulated to thrive, and aren\u2019t idealized in the same way, except by the breeders.In interviews, some described the work as beautiful, as both an art and a science, practiced in the lab and the field. Mr. Goldman said that like many of his peers, he considered every plant to be imperfect and unfinished \u2014 a work-in-progress on a continuum that stretched all the way back to each plant\u2019s domestication.Mr. Mazourek kept working on the Honeynut, even after its initial success, selecting for higher yields on the vine and longer storage. The palm-sized 898 squash is his latest version, and among Row 7\u2019s first group of trial seeds.Every year or so, the company plans to release more seed varieties, and newer versions of previously sold seeds. But that\u2019s not the only reason Mr. Goldman, who worked for more than a decade on his sunset-colored beet, continues to tinker on a new generation of the Badger Flame, even as the seed goes on sale.\u201cIt\u2019s like a raising a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really never done.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the day Row 7 would start selling seeds. It will start selling seeds on Tuesday, not Wednesday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Up? College in the Age of Tinder", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn campusSome found love; others learned valuable lessons about time stamps.It may not be on any syllabus, but college has always been a time for young people to learn about relationships and sex. But as the internet increasingly influences the ways we interact, it also transforms how students date and find partners. We asked students at nine colleges and universities how technology affects the campus dating scene.Madeline Apple, University of Michigan, Class of 2018Dating apps may have killed the college dating scene. Because it\u2019s so easy to swipe left or right on a seemingly endless pile of potential partners, it\u2019s become harder to actually meet anyone. As students, we are told over and over that college is a time for us to expand our social groups, to meet new people and grow into adults. But the indecisiveness that is built into dating app culture can stunt us \u2014 we\u2019re trapped in an endless cycle of swipes! Commitment, already a scary concept to many, becomes even more difficult with the false illusion that the dating possibilities are endless.Frankly, dating apps can also just make things incredibly awkward. My freshman year I swiped through hundreds of people. At one of the last tailgates of the year, a random man walked by me and yelled: \u201cHey! We matched on Tinder! You are Tinder girl!\u201dI was mortified. Suddenly everyone around me knew that I was on Tinder. And I had swiped through so many people, I had no idea who this guy was. He was just another nameless \u201cmatch\u201d that I would never get to know. Because, needless to say, I walked away and never spoke to that guy again.Tinder is supposed to bring people together, but it actually pushes them emotionally further apart. The fact that there could be hundreds, if not thousands, of potential dates in your pocket gives an illusion of possibility. In reality, students just become more isolated in a world of fake interactions and awkward run-ins with old matches. We\u2019re not getting out of our comfort zone to meet new people. Why approach someone in person when you can hide behind a Tinder profile?Catherine Gumarin, Mercer University, Class of 2019Mary Walz, University of Iowa, Class of 2020College students don\u2019t date. Instead, we \u201chang out.\u201d One of the most popular ways to hang out is to \u201cNetflix and Chill,\u201d a trope so common it became a meme. A typical hangout of the Netflix variety begins with one student going to another\u2019s residence, which is usually small and in a state of disarray. Next, the couple sit on the bed or futon (in the case of nicer dorms) and decide what movie or show to watch. This decision-making process can take up to half an hour and is often the most stressful time. With so many different genres, there is the problem of choice. But ultimately the most important consideration \u2014 the stressful element \u2014 is this question: What will be appropriate background noise for making out? The wrong choice could kill the mood. You don\u2019t want to be mid-makeout while the jewel-encrusted crab from \u201cMoana\u201d is singing about how shiny he is.If I could tell my younger self one thing upon entering college, it would be don\u2019t expect much from these campus boys. My first encounter with college dating was with someone who was the exact Urban Dictionary definitions of unreliable and unpredictable. Eventually his move became frequent late-night messages. He\u2019d text, \u201cYou got any water?\u201d What kind of question is that? It\u2019s definitely lame code for \u201cCan we hang out?\u201d and a poor excuse for romance. Later on I was infatuated with another guy, a charmer, to the point that I thought it was the start of an actual relationship. From this smooth talker, I learned the three stages of seriousness in college dating.The first stage is \u201changing out.\u201d In this phase you get to know each other as friends, and sometimes kiss. (Side note: I don\u2019t kiss my friends.) The second stage is \u201ctalking.\u201d In this phase you are not exclusive with the person, but you\u2019re also not on the market to \u201chang out\u201d with anyone else. The last stage is \u201csnatched.\u201d No, \u201csnatched\u201d is not slang for any dubious behavior. It means \u201cin a relationship\u201d \u2014 like Facebook-official status. The charmer never wanted to move past the \u201changing out\u201d stage, but I hung on for a while. Hopefully, I\u2019ll never make the mistake of investing my time in someone like that again. The most important lesson in college dating is to make your own experiences, and not let them make you. Emma Thom, Sweet Briar College, Class of 2018I fell in love with the small classroom environment of Sweet Briar College and the picturesque scenery of its surroundings in the middle of nowhere, Virginia. But as a heterosexual female at an all-women\u2019s college, my dating life was nonexistent until I was introduced to Tinder and Bumble. Initially I hated the concept of dating apps. The upside to them was blind dates (yikes) and the downside was the opportunity to get rejected in three seconds or less by a potential match. But as I began to create my dating profiles, choosing the most attractive pictures of me and my golden retriever, I started to have some fun. I hadn\u2019t yet warmed up to the idea of driving an hour or two to grab a drink with a stranger, but the conversations were light and the attention was wonderful. After hundreds of swipes left and right \u2014 and plenty of opening lines that received no response \u2014 I finally matched with a guy I was eager to meet. He was a Virginia Tech student who seemed intelligent, witty and happened to be 6-foot-4 \u2014 tall enough for my highest heels. Conveniently, my best friend is also a student at Tech, so when I told her about this new guy, she immediately responded with \u201cCome to Blacksburg! You can meet up with him, and if he sucks, stay with me.\u201d So I drove two hours to meet a guy I\u2019d only been messaging for a week and a half. I\u2019d never heard the sound of his voice, or seen the way he walked or chewed his food. What would he think about my smile or the awkward snorting sound I make when I laugh too hard? I pulled into the parking lot of the Thai restaurant hoping that I didn\u2019t have pit stains and flaking mascara. When I saw him waiting for me, I almost did a double take \u2014 not because he didn\u2019t look like the guy in the pictures, but because he looked better. He was tall, blond, with green eyes and a smile wider and more welcoming than I\u2019d imagined. We had dinner and drinks, and several months later, we\u2019re still doing the same. Dating apps aren\u2019t for everyone, but they gave me the opportunity to meet someone I wasn\u2019t sure existed.Caleb Keyes, Otterbein University, Class of 2018In high school I had always wanted to date but struggled to believe anyone would want to date me. When I got to college those fears were compounded by a feeling of trepidation that if I tried to date someone and we broke up, it would be hard to see them around campus. A friend encouraged me to download Coffee Meets Bagel, which was described as a dating app for people who are easily overwhelmed. I got a date and she suggested we get ice cream, even though it was snowing outside. It was old-school romantic in a way I hadn\u2019t expected. She looked beautiful with snowflakes falling on her hair and her cheeks red from the cold.Roxanne Powell, San Jose State University, Class of 2018 There is something to be said for technology and the way it has made our lives easier. But for all the time we spend on our devices, talking and looking at people across the country or globe, we can miss the people right in front of us. Sure, you can be attracted to someone online, but without meeting them in person, looking them in the eyes, holding their hand or giving them a hug, how can you know if that connection holds up IRL?Someone I was dating made a friend online which developed into something more, and I was blindsided by it. It was painful to see the person I cared about, the person I saw a future with, share more of his time with someone he had never met than with me.I kept wondering what I had done wrong, what I could have done differently, what this other person might have that I lacked. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the flexibility of an online relationship simply seemed easier to him. I couldn\u2019t compete with someone who could be accessed with the push of a button. Nor do I want to.Caroline Roddy, Bates College, Class of 2021Ping! You have a new match. Be the first one to say hello.During my first semester at Bates College I matched with a guy on Tinder who plays the same sport as me, ice hockey, and also has a Labrador retriever. Even though he lived an hour away, we agreed to meet at my college, and later go on a surprise adventure. He drove up in a car with a custom license plate and a CD collection stocked with Black Eyed Peas albums and obscure metal bands. We embarked on our adventure and were driving down a rural road in Maine when he suddenly pulled over. \u201cGreat,\u201d I thought. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to get into the hands of a serial killer. What will my mother say now?\u201d He led me on a hike along a trail to a quarry. It wasn\u2019t ideal for a first date: The exercise, coupled with the get-to-know-you conversation, left me out of breath and sounding like a dying cat. As we walked along, I tried to gauge his interest in politics, mumbling something about the upcoming local election and telling him that one of the candidates went to my college. He didn\u2019t seem interested in this tidbit, but otherwise, we had a good time together. We found out we both enjoyed the artist Lorde and shared a love of Thai food. Eventually, we turned around and he dropped me back off on campus. After exchanging occasional texts for a month, I received a message from him: \u201cHey so can I ask you something?\u201d I hesitated, thinking: \u201cIs he defining the relationship already? That was quick.\u201dI replied with a cool, \u201cyea what\u2019s up?\u201d Casual enough, I thought. Unassuming.He told me he\u2019s not liberal so we should avoid talking about politics. Ah, right. Not a serial killer, but perhaps a Trump voter. That relationship ended there.Kasey Roper, University of Virginia, Class of 2021I\u2019m a freshman at the University of Virginia, but my girlfriend attends college out West. In order to sustain our relationship we rely on technology and the Postal Service. Technology has definitely made maintaining a relationship easier, since we can talk frequently and immediately. But it is also prone to glitches: Messages sometimes don\u2019t send or they get cut off because of the Apple-Android divide, which, coupled with the fact that I refuse to update iOS, leads to accidental miscommunication. If we\u2019re in the middle of an important conversation, that \u201cunsent\u201d message can cause a lot of hurt feelings that don\u2019t just disappear when one of us explains that \u201cI wasn\u2019t ignoring you, the message just didn\u2019t send.\u201d It\u2019s a major inconvenience, but we have learned to be understanding about it. The saving grace of a long-distance relationship is the letters. About every two weeks, I get an email saying I have a package, and, unless it\u2019s the beginning of the semester and my textbooks haven\u2019t come in yet, I know it\u2019s from her. I eagerly wait until my classes are over for the day and rush to the mailroom to pick it up. Then I hide out in my room, my desk full of reminders of her \u2014 a pride flag made out of Legos, our initials spelled out in thumbtacks, pictures of us \u2014 and read the letter. In these notes to each other we say everything that needs to be expressed more intimately than can be said over a text or a video chat, as well as random thoughts we\u2019ve had that get lost in everyday conversation. We also send care packages to cheer each other up during difficult times. She recently sent me a mixtape of songs relevant to our relationship, and I made one for her, too. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Chambered Nautilus Is the Ocean\u2019s Most Efficient Jet Engine", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike a tiny submarine, the chambered nautilus speeds through the ocean on little jets that it creates by sucking in water and spitting it out.However, as ways of movement go, jet propulsion is not usually a very good use of energy. In the ocean\u2019s depths where oxygen gets thin, the nautilus seems to be putting itself at risk by expending so much effort on movement. Fish use far less energy by pushing at the water with their fins. So how does it manage to jet around unscathed in the ocean\u2019s depths?Graham Askew, a biomechanics professor at the University of Leeds, set out with a graduate student, Thomas Neil, to understand better how this shellfish moves. They found that the nautilus is actually a highly efficient jet-propelled creature, wasting much less energy than marine organisms like squid or jellyfish that get around in a similar way.They used high-speed cameras, a laser that lit up the particles and software that could record the particles\u2019 movements. In the constellation of specks, they saw the animals sucking in water, then forcing it out in the direction they were moving away from, with the pocket of expelled water and the nautilus shooting apart at velocities they could readily calculate.When they ran the numbers, the researchers saw that the nautilus was able to use 30 to 75 percent of the energy it transferred to the water to move.That was much higher than other similar swimmers. \u201cSquid, they tend to be about 40 to 50 percent efficient,\u201d said Dr. Askew.Bell-shaped jellyfish, which pulse their bells to squirt out water, also tend have lower than 50 percent efficiency.In general, moving very large volumes of water relatively slowly, as a fish\u2019s tail or a diver\u2019s flippers do, wastes less energy than having to swiftly accelerate very small amounts. But nautilus have clearly found a way to make it work.It seems, said Dr. Askew, that when they are sucking in water, they do so in a wide stream, rather than in a more energetically costly narrow one. And they spend more time jetting than they do refilling in certain swimming scenarios, gently eking out the fluid they\u2019ve already sipped in. These strategies may be contributing to their ability to swim efficiently, getting by in situations where more vigorous jetting might get them in trouble, like the low-oxygen deep ocean.Read more:Loving the Chambered Nautilus to DeathWhat Eats What: A Landlubber\u2019s Guide to Deep Sea DiningThe Cuttlefish, a Master of Camouflage, Reveals a New Trick_____Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I\u2019m the Wife of a Former N.F.L. Player. Football Destroyed His Mind.", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionRob had no idea, however, that all those years of playing would have such serious consequences. Safeties are the last line of defense and among the hardest hitters in the game. One tackle he attempted while playing for the Saints was so damaging, he doesn\u2019t remember the rest of the game. He got up, ran off the field and tried to go back in \u2014 as an offensive player. He knows this only because people told him the next day.Professional football is a brutal sport, he knew that. But he loved it anyway. And he accepted the risks of bruises and broken bones. What he didn\u2019t know was that along with a battered body can come a battered mind.When I first met him in 2007, Rob had this gentle, endearing way about him that caught me off guard. I had never watched a full game of football in my life, but still believed the stereotypes: Players were tough and abrasive. He was neither. I had never met a man who was so sensitive and tenderhearted. I loved that he wasn\u2019t afraid to be vulnerable and to show tears.When we married in 2009, I already knew he was an amazing father. He could play dollhouse with my stepdaughter for hours without a hint of boredom. This continued when we had two children of our own. When our son was born and I was focused on taking care of a baby, he would bathe the girls, brush and blow-dry their (tangled!) hair, then put them to bed. Afterward he would wash the dishes. He brought me coffee in bed each morning. I was spoiled rotten.But since I had known him, he had trouble sleeping, and he has been prone to mood swings and depression. In 2010, things got worrisome, so I arranged for him to be evaluated by neurologists so that he could apply for disability benefits. We traveled from Ohio, where we were living at the time, to North Carolina for full cognitive evaluations and testing. There were seemingly endless amounts of paperwork and record keeping.I was right to be concerned.Over time, I had started to notice changes. But this was different and, around 2013, things had become much more frightening.He lost weight. It seemed like one day, out of the blue, he stopped being hungry. And often he would forget to eat. I\u2019d find full bowls of cereal left around the house, on bookshelves or the fireplace mantel. The more friends and family commented on his gaunt frame, the more panicked I became. By 2016, he had shrunk to 157 pounds. That\u2019s right, my 6-foot-2 football-player husband weighed 157 pounds (down from around 200 when he was in the N.F.L.). People were visibly shocked when we told them he had played the game professionally.Besides damage resulting from football-related concussions, my husband has never had a diagnosed brain injury. He\u2019s never been in a car accident or fallen off a roof. He never took steroids. After struggling in retirement with alcohol abuse for about six years, off and on, he hasn\u2019t had a drink in eight years. And he\u2019s only 43.When you live with someone with brain damage, you become highly attuned to your environment and develop an intimate relationship with your senses and intuition. Your hearing becomes excellent, almost unbearably keen, like a movie character who develops supernatural abilities overnight. Rob\u2019s mood swings scare me sometimes, and I always have to be in tune with early signs of his agitation. I try to protect him from stress so he won\u2019t be overwhelmed. It\u2019s exhausting.Our fights went in bizarre circles and were never resolved. He would be irrationally upset about one thing but would quickly lose track and begin rambling about something that had no connection to the topic at hand. Every argument we had ended with me thinking: \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal. This is not what couples fight about. Something\u2019s wrong.\u201dAnd the arguments were always the same. It was as if our lives were on a loop, like some song that\u2019s been left on repeat for years. That sort of repetition has a tremendous ability to make you feel like you\u2019re going insane. And maybe, you wonder, you are.He was losing touch with reality and was getting more and more paranoid. The first time he accused me of stealing loose change from his nightstand I was speechless. And when I told him how illogical it would be for me to do such a thing, he looked at me with even more suspicion. But his paranoia didn\u2019t end there. It would leave me with a heaviness in my chest that made me sob without warning.He went from being a devoted and loving father and husband to someone who felt like a ghost in our home. For a couple of months one winter he was so depressed and detached, he couldn\u2019t muster up the energy to speak. My questions went unanswered until I simply stopped asking them. The silence was unnerving.So we were relieved when, in January 2013, we were told that the Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle N.F.L. player retirement plan and supplemental disability plan had awarded him total and permanent disability benefits. His benefits were listed as \u201cdegenerative,\u201d which establishes that his \u201cdisability arises out of league football activities\u201d and had manifested within 15 years of his last season. He is entitled to monthly payments for the rest of his life. (These payments are separate from the estimated $1 billion settlement of concussion-related lawsuits with thousands of retired players, for which we have registered.)The examining clinician found that \u201crepeated concussion is very likely to have caused Mr. Kelly\u2019s neuropsychological dysfunction,\u201d and also that his prior alcohol abuse may have been a factor. But he has not had a single drop of alcohol for eight years, and his condition continues to deteriorate.After years of little to no sleep, he alternated between sleeping either three hours a night or 20. I\u2019d wake up to find every blind and curtain in the house closed and Rob sitting on the sofa with a blank expression on his face. He no longer felt comfortable driving, refused to leave the house and cut off contact with everyone.Specific details about how he wanted his funeral to be, and his demand that he be cremated, were brought up with excruciating frequency. One particularly dark time, he went five days without eating anything; he drank only water and a few swigs of chocolate milk. He was suffering deeply and barely surviving. My love and affection seemed to offer no comfort or solace. I felt helpless.Our stories are eerily similar, our loved ones\u2019 symptoms almost identical: the bizarre behavior I had tried to ignore, the obsessive laundering of old clothes \u2014 our washing machine ran from morning till night.It was comforting and terrifying all at the same time. Why did so many of us see the same strange behaviors? \u201cOur neurologist said they do it to calm their brains,\u201d one friend told me.Symptoms consistent with C.T.E. are a recurring topic in the Facebook group. They include memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression and anxiety. These problems become apparent sometimes years or even decades after a player hangs up his helmet.One woman may write a post, desperate and afraid of the man her husband is becoming \u2014 the rage, mood swings, depression, memory loss. A man so drastically different from the one she once knew. Hundreds of comments will follow, woman after woman confirming that she is going through the exact same thing.While the symptoms and behaviors are telling, C.T.E. can be conclusively diagnosed only posthumously, because it requires the close examination of brain tissue. But many of us, including me, are convinced our husbands suffer from the disease. We try to comfort one another with the same words: \u201cJust know you\u2019re not alone.\u201dI don\u2019t think the public has any idea how widespread this problem truly is. Rob and I hope that, in telling our story, we might help other families. There are likely to be hundreds of wives and partners of football players, maybe more, who live a life like mine. Sadly, there is a feeling of shame among those affected, in both the men and their families.But who these men have become is not who they are, and I write that with conviction. The symptoms they display are beyond their control and occur through no fault of their own. These men chose football, but they didn\u2019t choose brain damage.I used to read all the articles about C.T.E., all the stories about football players committing suicide. I\u2019d skim the comments to see remarks like: \u201cThey know what they signed up for\u201d and \u201cOf course football is bad for the brain, everyone knows that.\u201dBut when all those big hits happened and the fans cheered, did they cheer despite knowing a man just greatly increased his risk for dementia? Was anyone worried about an A.L.S. diagnosis or a C.T.E.-related suicide at 40 after their favorite player suffered repeated blows to the head on the field? No, they cheered and they celebrated because they didn\u2019t know. And neither did we.Emily Kelly lives in Boulder, Colo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Profits Drove a Stock Boom. Did the Economy Pay a Price?", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneStocks are too expensive.This is not a market forecast. I wouldn\u2019t be particularly surprised if the Dow shrugged off its recent turbulence and continued its long upward thrust. What I contend is that if the American economy behaved in the way that most economists say market economies should, stocks would in all likelihood be cheaper.It is a grim proposition. Wall Street\u2019s titans might welcome the fact that equity prices have grossly exceeded what a well-functioning, competitive economy should deliver. But for almost everybody else, it amounts to a disaster. From wage stagnation to the depressed investment rates that are holding back long-term economic growth, many of the fault lines running through the American economy can be traced back to the same root cause powering the rise of America\u2019s overpriced stocks.What makes this particularly puzzling for scholars reared on the classical models of competitive economies is that all this happened despite a persistent decline in real interest rates. In a more orthodox economy, declining rates on corporate bonds would encourage a surge in corporate investment. As companies invested more and more capital, the returns on investments would gradually decline until companies\u2019 returns matched their cost of capital: the interest rate they pay to borrow.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.In a nutshell, the United States has built an economy where businesses don\u2019t invest even though it has rarely been cheaper to finance investment. Still, they reap spectacular profits that warrant runaway share prices.What happened? It turns out that there is one straightforward reason for the American economy\u2019s unorthodox behavior. As Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues argue, the standard economic theory based on competitive markets cannot apply when markets are not competitive. And competition, in the United States, is shriveling.The scholars argue that the American economy is afflicted by \u201crents\u201d \u2014 returns in excess of what investments would yield in a competitive economy, where fat margins are quickly whittled away by competition.These rents don\u2019t fall from the sky. Companies free of competitive pressures, with the power to set prices more or less at will, squeeze them from their customers and their workers. They pad corporate profits and send stock prices sky high.Global inequality, after widening for decades, has stabilized. The share of the world\u2019s income captured by the top 1 percent has shrunk since its peak on the eve of the financial crisis.Executives love it. The critical question is what these rents hold in store for the rest of us.Still, there are good reasons to worry about rising rents, no matter where they come from. Mr. Shapiro argues that while some measures of market concentration may not be meaningful, persistently high profits are of themselves a cause for concern.Profits as a share of output have risen by half over the last 30 years. Combined with evidence that large corporations are accounting for an increasing share of revenue and employment, Mr. Shapiro writes, \u201cit certainly appears that many large U.S. corporations are earning substantial incumbency rents, and have been doing so for at least 10 years, apart from during the depths of the Great Recession.\u201dThis is particularly true in the tech sector, where a handful of dominant companies \u2014 you know the ones I\u2019m talking about \u2014 have sustained spectacular profits for years. Their sky-high stock prices suggest that investors expect high profits to continue as well.\u201cThey probably are geniuses; what they are doing is wonderful,\u201d Mr. Shapiro told me. \u201cStill, you would expect competition to erode away the excess profits over time.\u201dHere is why we should worry.Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues built an alternative model of the American economy by doing away with the assumption of perfect competition. They contend that there are barriers to entry that stop competitors and allow rents to persist.In this economy, stock prices don\u2019t just reflect the future stream of normal economic returns that would accrue to a company\u2019s capital investment. They also include a claim to a stream of rents that generate \u201cpure profits.\u201d These profits can\u2019t be replicated by another company\u2019s capital investment. They are owned by a specific company.Rents interfere with incentives in a big way. Companies will spend more time and effort trying to preserve those rents \u2014 often by working to block rivals from their markets. Rivals will fight to grab a share of those rents for themselves, perhaps through lobbying. Amid all this jockeying, investment in productive capabilities will most likely be neglected as a secondary consideration.And inevitably, inequality will rise: The owners of the shares in the powerful corporations capturing the economy\u2019s growing monopoly rents will peel further and further away from the average Jane and Joe, who own little but their labor.This is not the kind of economy proposed by classical economic theory. It is not the kind of country portrayed by evangelists of the American dream. But it looks as if we are stuck with it, regardless of what the stock market does tomorrow.Advertisement"}

The theory: If a reassuringly large amount of new equity were created at the subsidiaries, the banks\u2019 creditors and trading partners would feel protected and not withdraw.

John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief executive, said: \u201cOnly a charge related to US tax reform at the end of the year meant that we had to post a full-year after-tax loss.\u201d\u2022 HSBC reported a pretax profit of $17.2 billion for 2017, but took a charge of $1.3 billion to reflect a reevaluation of its deferred tax balances.\u2022 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said its profit was dragged down in the quarter after it was hit by restructuring charges related to its French retail banking network and the impact of tax reforms in France and in the United States.\u2022 UBS fell to a loss in the fourth quarter as a result of a writedown of 2.87 billion francs on deferred tax assets.Keep an eye out for Standard Chartered when it reports its annual results next week.The bank, which is based in Britain, but makes most of its money in Asia, has been recently touting its ability to serve the North American market.\u2014 Chad BrayThe case stems from a lawsuit filed by a would-be whistle-blower, Paul Somers, who says he was fired from Digital Realty Trust in 2014 after complaining internally about accounting irregularities, among other matters.

{"Headline": "Can Christian Louboutin Trademark Red Soles? An E.U. Court Says No", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Can you trademark a color?On Tuesday, the European Union\u2019s highest court dealt a blow to that effort.Mr. Louboutin had filed a lawsuit in 2012 against Van Haren, a Dutch company whose retail outlets were selling affordably priced high-heeled women\u2019s shoes with red soles. Lawyers for Mr. Louboutin claimed that the shoes sold by Van Haren, part of its Fifth Avenue by Halle Berry line, infringed on his brand\u2019s trademark for footwear. That trademark, registered in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, referred to \u201cthe color red (Pantone 18 1663TP) applied to the sole of a shoe.\u201dVan Haren had to temporarily stop making and selling the line of shoes, but the company\u2019s lawyers fought back and the case eventually made its way to the European Court of Justice.In effect, he argued in a legal opinion, Mr. Louboutin\u2019s red soles could be refused trademark protection, sending the case back to Dutch courts to consider. Judges in national courts typically, though not always, follow advice from the European Court of Justice\u2019s advocates general.The case highlights one of the most difficult questions in fashion: In a world where designers often have distinct styles, and attract admirers based on those styles, what can, and cannot, be trademarked?Major luxury conglomerates like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering have historically been the most litigious, often using the courts to battle the counterfeiting that has long been a headache in the fashion industry. More recently, however, smaller brands and designers have also started to pursue legal action, particularly against larger luxury or fast-fashion companies that they claim use their designs without acknowledgment or permission.Last week, the Indian designer Orijit Sen and his New Delhi-based studio and store People Tree accused Christian Dior of plagiarizing a block print of a man doing yoga poses. Mr. Sen argued that he had formulated the design in 2000, and complained when it was used for a red dress worn by the Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor on the cover of Elle\u2019s Indian edition last month. He posted his complaints on Facebook under the title \u201cUnchristian Dior.\u201dIndeed, illustrating the complexity of the issue, Mr. Louboutin himself previously won a battle against the rival luxury fashion house Yves Saint Laurent in a United States federal appeals court, allowing him to protect his red soles as a source-identifying trademark.But Mr. Szpunar\u2019s opinion for the European Court of Justice \u201ccould mean that Louboutin would not be able to stop its competitors, including haute couture fashion houses, from offering shoes with red soles,\u201d said Sanjay Kapur, a partner at the British law firm Potter Clarkson and a specialist in trademark law.Trying to persuade courts to grant such protection to designs like Mr. Louboutin\u2019s \u201cmay well be an insurmountable hurdle,\u201d Mr. Kapur said. \u201cThe red sole could therefore become ubiquitous, which would seriously reduce the cachet associated with the Louboutin brand.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Quit Twitter and It Feels Great", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has been one year and 28 days since my last tweet.I deactivated my account shortly after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted, \u201cNorth Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won\u2019t happen!\u201d on Jan. 2, 2017.The tweet struck me as an unsettling portent of how Trump\u2019s presidency was likely to unfold: rash, petty, ostentatiously uninformed, with no regard for public safety or the mechanics of governance. The internet makes neighbors of us all, and my conscience demanded I put some virtual real estate between myself and the befuddled, racist mobster seemingly determined to dismantle and loot the republic. If seeding nuclear war wasn\u2019t a violation of Twitter\u2019s terms of service, then Twitter wasn\u2019t a service I wanted to endorse.Exactly one year later, on Jan. 2, 2018, President Trump tweeted, \u201cNorth Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the \u2018Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.\u2019 Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201dHow exquisite it would have been to be wrong.Trump essentially daring Kim Jong-un (just a hop, a skip, and a Pacific away from my house in Seattle) to prove his nuclear capabilities is what finally pushed me over the edge, but the cliff itself was built of years of accumulated grievances with Twitter\u2019s culture of harassment and its leadership\u2019s torpid failure to fix it.When you work in media, Twitter becomes part of your job. It\u2019s where you orient yourself in \u201cthe discourse\u201d \u2014 figure out what\u2019s going on, what people are saying about it and, more important, what no one has said yet. In a lucky coup for Twitter\u2019s marketing team, prevailing wisdom among media types has long held that quitting the platform could be a career killer. The illusion that Twitter visibility and professional relevance are indisputably inextricable always felt too risky to puncture. Who could afford to call that bluff and be wrong? So, we stayed, while Twitter\u2019s endemic racist, sexist and transphobic harassment problems grew increasingly more sophisticated and organized.Those of us who complained about online abuse were consistently told \u2014 by colleagues, armchair experts and random internet strangers \u2014 that we were the problem. We were too soft. We, who literally inured ourselves to rape threats and death threats so that we could participate in public life, were called weak by people who felt persecuted by the existence of female Ghostbusters. Meanwhile, Twitter\u2019s leadership offered us the ability to embed GIFs.Those of us who pointed out that online harassment was politically motivated \u2014 compounded by race, gender and sexual orientation \u2014 as I did in 2013, for example, were accused of being \u201cprofessional victims\u201d trying to leverage our paranoid delusions to censor the internet. This defamation has never been retracted or atoned for even after the revelations that an army of Russian Twitter bots functions as the Trump administration\u2019s propaganda wing, and the \u201calt-right,\u201d essentially a coalition of anti-feminist, white-supremacist online harassment campaigns, recruits disaffected young men to Trumpism by framing the abuse of social justice activists as a team sport. Meanwhile, Twitter\u2019s leadership offered us 280 characters.The social contract of the internet seems to insist that there\u2019s a nobility in weathering degradation. You can call me oversensitive, but the truth is I got far better than any human being should be at absorbing astonishing cruelty and feeling nothing. Undersensitivity was just another piece of workplace safety gear. The fact that we\u2019ve learned to cope doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t demand better.Being on Twitter felt like being in a nonconsensual BDSM relationship with the apocalypse. So, I left.To be clear, it\u2019s not brave to quit Twitter, or righteous (I\u2019m still on Facebook, which is just a differently shaped moral stockyard), or noteworthy. Quitting Twitter is just a thing that you can do. I mention it only because there was a time when I didn\u2019t think it was a thing that I could do, and then I did it, and now my life is better.I\u2019m frequently approached by colleagues, usually women, who ask me about quitting Twitter with hushed titillation, as if I\u2019ve escaped a cult or broken a particularly seductive taboo. Well, here\u2019s what my new life is like: I don\u2019t wake up with a pit in my stomach every day, dreading what horrors accrued in my phone overnight. I don\u2019t get dragged into protracted, bad-faith arguments with teenage boys about whether poor people deserve medical care, or whether putting nice guys in the friend zone is a hate crime. I don\u2019t spend hours every week blocking and reporting trolls and screen-grabbing abuse in case it someday escalates into a credible threat. I no longer feel like my brain is trapped in a centrifuge filled with swastikas and Alex Jones\u2019s spittle. Time is finite, and now I have more of it.At the same time, I know this conversation is more complicated than that. I\u2019ve lost a large platform to self-promote and make professional connections, which isn\u2019t something many writers can afford to give up (less established writers and marginalized writers most of all \u2014 in a horrid irony, the same writers disproportionately abused on Twitter). I get my news on a slight delay. I seethe at the perception that I ceded any ground to trolls trying to push me out. I will probably never persuade RuPaul to be my friend. Also, I loved Twitter. Twitter is funny and smart and validating and cathartic. It feels, when you are embroiled in it, like the place where everything is happening. (Scoff if you like, but the president of the United States makes major policy announcements there. This is the world now.)I shouldn\u2019t have had to walk away from all that because for Twitter to take a firm stance against neo-Nazism might have cost it some incalculable sliver of profit. No one should. Sure, as in everything, global culture change would have been better. But I didn\u2019t have global culture change, and I\u2019m better equipped to fight for global culture change now that I\u2019m not locked in eternal whack-a-mole with a sea of angry boy-men, an unknown percentage of which are probably robots.When you deactivate a verified Twitter account (nail-polish emoji), you have one year to log back in or your account \u2014 everything you ever tweeted, every reply in every thread \u2014 is permanently deleted. I always planned to log in and then immediately deactivate again, to re-up for another year. I figured I\u2019d eventually reactivate, even if just for posterity. I was part of some important cultural conversations; I said some smart things before other people said them; I made some good jokes. One time the actor Michael McKean called me \u201cdoodlebug\u201d in an affectionate manner because he liked one of my movie reviews. I wouldn\u2019t mind preserving that.Last week I realized: I was late. I\u2019d forgotten to log back in. A year had passed. It\u2019s all gone. It\u2019s like I was halfway through a difficult column and asked a thief to watch my laptop while I peed. It\u2019s like a great wind came and blew my problem novel into the river. It\u2019s like I ate a very good sandwich without taking a picture of it. Sometimes it is O.K. to just remember things.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Towers Came Down, and With Them the Promise of Public Housing", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "FeatureFormer residents of Chicago\u2019s Cabrini-Green were thrown into a system that increasingly leaves the poor to fend for themselves.Supported byRicks was shown a 15-story plain box of a high-rise, a giant filing cabinet with a facade the color of cigarette-stained teeth. The elevators were out of order, the stairwells dark. Built in stages beginning in the 1940s on Chicago\u2019s Near North Side, Cabrini-Green consisted of barracks-style rowhouses and 23 towers. When Ricks arrived, more than a third of the 3,600 units were vacant. The Chicago Housing Authority said it couldn\u2019t afford to do the repairs to ready them for occupancy, and not just at Cabrini. The C.H.A. had a stock of 42,000 apartments, but the number in use had fallen to fewer than 33,000.The vacant fifth-floor apartment Ricks entered looked like a crypt. Plywood covered the windows. The kitchen cabinets dangled or were missing altogether. Ricks surveyed the surroundings, counting four bedrooms. There was a full bathroom on one side of the unit and a half bath on the other. The front room was large enough for a dining table and a sofa, and it was connected to the kitchen, which (she checked) had a working stove and refrigerator. The ceilings were high, the walls made of seemingly indestructible cinder block. Ricks had freckles that wandered the bridge of her nose and reached her high cheekbones, which now sharpened to points as she smiled. What she saw looked like a home.Ricks lived at Cabrini-Green for the next 21 years. She worked as a teacher\u2019s aide in the local schools that most of her own (eventual) 13 children attended. She babysat, ran an after-school program and served free lunches out of the field house by her high-rise. She moved her aging mother in with them, and Ricks\u2019s grown children found jobs in construction, home health care, retail and at a new residential complex built atop the old Madison Street \u201cskid row,\u201d an area refashioned into the \u201cWest Loop.\u201d Ricks didn\u2019t leave Cabrini after one of her nephews was hit with several bullets through her apartment window \u2014 his heart stopped twice before he survived. She stuck it out as the city demolished every other public-housing high-rise in Chicago not reserved for the elderly, including all the towers at Cabrini-Green save hers. After the start of this civic remodeling, in 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley said that breaking up the severe concentrations of poverty of high-rise public housing would finally imbue long-neglected neighborhoods with vitality; the mostly black residents who lived there in social and economic isolation would be able to reap the rewards of the resurgent city. \u201cI want to rebuild their souls,\u201d Daley declared. But Ricks believed her soul was doing all right on its own. She refused to go, in 2010, even as every neighbor remaining in her building took whatever replacement housing was offered them. She outlasted them all. \u201cI\u2019m the last woman standing,\u201d Ricks liked to declare.Ricks held firm to a belief that if she followed the rules, if she kept up her part in an agreement, then she was entitled to all that was promised her. Her three youngest children \u2014 Reggie, Rose and Raqkown \u2014 were still on her lease, along with two of her nearly 40 grandchildren. She wasn\u2019t in her apartment illegally, she contended. She paid her rent on time. No one caught her with drugs or guns. So how could the C.H.A. just assign her a new unit? But the city took her to court, and a federal judge gave her 10 days to vacate the building. That was that. \u201cI had to go,\u201d she conceded. \u201cEither that or be homeless again.\u201dAs it had the day she arrived at Cabrini-Green, snow covered the ground on the December morning in 2010 that she left. A crowd of reporters jostled the last high-rise tenants of what had been the city\u2019s and the country\u2019s most well-known public-housing project. \u201cAn inglorious end to an infamous era,\u201d as one news outlet put it. Another described Cabrini-Green as \u201cthe housing development that came to symbolize the squandered hope of them all.\u201d Deonta Ricks lugged a cardboard box filled with his mother\u2019s most prized possessions: the trophies he and his siblings had won for basketball tournaments and perfect attendance and the one he was awarded for being valedictorian of the school that was still there, an empty field away. The Cabrini-Green neighborhood, only a few blocks west of the ritzy Gold Coast, had a new library and police station, new shopping and upscale housing. The school, too, had been renamed and given a makeover, and it now served only those students who tested in, ranking it among the best elementaries in Illinois. Rose, then 17, rolled a suitcase with a \u201cRoute 66\u201d sticker on it. \u201cI\u2019ve been here basically my whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cLike it\u2019s hard leaving when you\u2019ve got so much memories of it. You knew everyone. You felt safe.\u201dWhen the trophies were stowed and the furniture loaded onto a truck, Annie Ricks ducked into a sedan the same off-white color as her high-rise. The car spun its wheels on the snow and gained traction, and she was gone.Then, as now, the idea of government-run housing was maligned as anticapitalist and socialist; it clashed with a national ethos wrapped up in visions of the frontiersman and the self-made entrepreneur. When the Housing Act of 1937 was being debated, it was opposed by real estate trade groups and property owners\u2019 associations, by builders, suppliers, the U.S. Chambers of Commerce and the departments of the Interior and the Treasury. Although the subsidy was reserved for only stable families with modest incomes \u2014 the \u201cdeserving poor\u201d \u2014 the ceiling on what qualifying residents could earn was said to discourage hard work, acting as a sap on initiative and pluck. Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d dramatized the backlash against Roosevelt\u2019s call for a deeper social contract of shared responsibility: The hero of the 1943 novel is an architect of a public-housing complex who becomes enraged when he returns from a trip to discover that his bare-bones high-rise has been compromised to include \u201cthe expense of incomprehensible features\u201d like balconies, a gymnasium, extra doorways and decorative brickwork. In an act portrayed as a valiant defense of his convictions, he dynamites the entire building. Maybe most telling, the same Depression-era legislation that funded the first public-housing complexes also created the federally insured private home loan. With this revolution in home financing, buyers were able to put down as little as 10 percent of a house\u2019s cost and pay off their mortgages in small increments over an unprecedented 30 years. Even today, the federal government devotes three times as much each year to mortgage-interest deductions and other subsidies to the speculative real estate market \u2014 essentially public housing for homeowners \u2014 than to the entire annual budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.The first public-housing developments were often simple and unadorned brick rowhouses or duplexes. They were required to be built to minimum standards, so as not to compete with the private rental market, and the overall populations were diverse, in part because federal rules dictated that public housing couldn\u2019t change the existing racial makeup of a neighborhood. In the 1950s, cities began to build massive complexes of clustered towers encircled by plots of land closed off to through streets. It was a purity of modernist city planning, influenced by the avant-garde \u201ctowers in the park\u201d urban reimagining of the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. The density and nearly identical stripped-down designs of the high-rises were also believed to cut down on costs while meeting greater demand.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I died and went to heaven,\u201d one of the first tenants of a development in Chicago recalled years later. J.S. Fuerst, the former head of research and statistics at the C.H.A., collected this testimonial and dozens of others like it from early occupants of the agency\u2019s properties for a 2003 book titled \u201cWhen Public Housing Was Paradise.\u201d Even though these were low-income communities of thousands of people crammed together on isolated plazas, many families still found a modest home to be somehow divine after the damnation of the cold-water flats they left behind. There, they had been afraid of fires and sickness and eviction. Public housing, by contrast, was new and orderly. All the families went through a screening process. The buildings had teams of janitors on call around the clock. Groundskeepers maintained the gardens and lawns. There was a city agency responsible for answering calls. The C.H.A.\u2019s first executive director, Elizabeth Wood, worried not that the new developments might be too large and come to define an area as low-rent, but rather that they wouldn\u2019t be large enough to counteract the damaging effects of poverty and disrepair around them. \u201cIf it is not bold,\u201d she said in 1945, \u201cthe result will be a series of small projects, islands in a wilderness of slums beaten down by smoke, noise and fumes.\u201dAcross the entire country, a majority of public housing remained in low-rises; there were eventually more than 3,000 local authorities, most with fewer than 500 units. But large housing \u201cprojects\u201d came to dominate urban landscapes and symbolize for many the unruliness and otherness of the \u201cinner city\u201d in decline. The towers-in-the-park design was only ever partly to blame. In Chicago, as elsewhere, high-rise developments were built intentionally in neighborhoods that were already segregated racially; rather than apportioning the working poor across a number of areas and helping to diversify cities, public housing had the effect of solidifying racial and economic boundaries in superblocks detached from the street grid, in towers of concrete and steel. Yet they were also perennially underfunded and perilously mismanaged. The developments were allowed to deteriorate as maintenance and repairs lagged. And as the broader fortunes of cities declined \u2014 diminishing populations and disappearing jobs, spiking poverty and crime and drug use \u2014 public housing bore the worst of those effects.Soon, those same broad trends were used to justify abandoning the basic democratic idea of providing shelter for all. In 1972, when the 33 Pruitt-Igoe towers in St. Louis began to be imploded a mere 18 years after the complex fully opened, the televised image, with its mushrooming cloud of dust and debris, defined the popular notion of the public-housing experiment: It needed to be destroyed.For other cities, demolition still remained a political and practical impossibility. In previous decades when slums were cleared, those displaced were sent into public housing. Now where could tens of thousands of people from the projects be sent? But the aversion to social safety-net programs only came to root more deeply in the American mainstream. After retaking Congress in 1994, Republicans said they planned to scrap the federal housing agency entirely. President Clinton, promoting his cuts to the welfare system and proclaiming \u201cthe era of big government is over,\u201d pre-emptively reorganized HUD. The agency promised to \u201cinfuse market discipline\u201d into public housing. The anti-urban impulse that had sent middle-class families to the suburbs had reversed itself, and young professionals were flocking to city centers near their jobs and one another.In 1990, Chicago\u2019s population started to tick up for the first time in 40 years; the area surrounding Cabrini-Green added 4,000 white residents during the previous decade, and vacant lots that had sold for $30,000 a few years earlier were being snapped up for five times that amount. As the fortunes of cities changed once again, public housing experienced a new pressure. HUD began to award municipalities tens of millions of dollars in grants to tear down their public-housing high-rises and replace them with much smaller developments that mixed public-housing families with higher-income renters and market-rate owners. Proposals to preserve some of the towers, filling in the cleared land around them with a variety of housing types, were rejected. Many low-rise developments in rejuvenating areas were targeted as well. A majority of the relocated public-housing residents were given Section 8 vouchers to rent from landlords in the private market. Nationwide, 250,000 public-housing units have been demolished since the 1990s. Atlanta, Baltimore, Columbus, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Tucson \u2014 just about every American city got in on the action. But no city knocked down as many as Chicago.Ricks wanted to remain upbeat about the move. But when violence broke out at her new home, the longtime Wentworth residents said it was the fault of the newcomers, the outsiders from Cabrini-Green, a number of whom had been moved there. An elderly woman announced for Rose to hear that she didn\u2019t like the Cabrini people and wanted them gone. When Reggie and Raqkown tried to play basketball at the courts beside their apartment, the guys there threw elbows and fists, trying to turn the game into a brawl. A group of boys jumped Reggie in the courtyard. Other former Cabrini residents who ended up there had guns pulled on them. \u201cPeople at Wentworth think you\u2019re stepping on their turf,\u201d Ricks said. \u201cThis is not your turf. This is C.H.A.\u2019s turf. You can\u2019t run me from my home. Because I do pay rent.\u201dShe often made the trip to visit her friends at the remaining strip of rowhouses at Cabrini-Green. She went to the jazz concerts held in the nearby park. Like many relocated families, she felt safer in the vestiges of the old neighborhood. When Raqkown, Ricks\u2019s youngest, left his high school most days, he traveled to the field house at Cabrini. The principal at the neighborhood elementary school said two-thirds of his students were former Cabrini families who took the bus and train long distances to get there. Several Cabrini-Green Facebook pages formed, people reporting job opportunities and business ventures, sharing words of inspiration and announcements of deaths in the Cabrini family. Oftentimes a post showed a photo of one of the disappeared high-rises \u2014 \u201cWho can say what building this is?\u201d \u2014 leading to long threads of competing memories.On an airless Saturday night in the summer of 2012, Ricks stepped outside into the Wentworth courtyard. She\u2019d been confined to her apartment all day taking care of grandchildren and wanted to relax. She set up a small table, placing atop it a transistor radio and a can of bug spray. She popped open a bottle of iced tea she bought at the gas station and tuned the radio to a gospel station. Then she was startled by screaming in the distance. She recognized the voice before she saw him: Reggie. He came racing toward her out of the darkness with Raqkown sprinting beside him. A mob of men were at their heels. Her sons dashed past her and up the stairs to their apartment, their pursuers rushing past as well. Rose, who was inside, opened the door for her brothers, and the Wentworth guys charged in behind them, colliding into her. Ricks ran up the stairs after them. \u201cHome invasion!\u201d she cried.In the cramped apartment, one invader knocked a television off the wall and stomped his foot through it. They pushed over a chest of drawers and threw chairs. Reggie, who was bleeding from his head, lifted a cooking pot off the stove and swung it to fend off blows. Rose armed herself with a mop. Their mother usually carried a fist of keys with her, and she now punched with it. She held the aerosol can of bug repellent as well, and she sprayed it into any face close by. \u201cI\u2019m just going to say it like this,\u201d Ricks said later that night, \u201cwe did whatever we had to do to get their asses out of our house.\u201dFor the next two weeks, Ricks stayed with a son in the Cabrini rowhouses. One of her older daughters put up Reggie and Raqkown. Rose moved in temporarily with another sibling in the western suburbs. A social-service provider asked Ricks if she wanted to go to a shelter. She didn\u2019t. A shelter wasn\u2019t any place to live. \u201cThat\u2019s like giving up,\u201d Ricks said. With the home invasion, her old stubbornness returned. No way was she going to be cheated out of a four-bedroom again. Not this time. She was going to keep her family together.She put in for a transfer to a different C.H.A. development along the lakefront, and she documented every time she phoned the agency to get an update. She checked in with a pro bono lawyer who agreed to take her case, asking when she should expect to move.\u201cJust trying to get them to confirm that you\u2019re eligible to be on the wait list for a four-bedroom,\u201d he told her.\u201cSo how long will that be?\u201d\u201cI wish I knew. I think they\u2019ll respond to me. I\u2019ll bother them until they do. I think this is going to be taken care of. It\u2019s not going to be done quickly.\u201d\u201cIt should be quickly, because you\u2019re my lawyer,\u201d Ricks said.\u201cI may be a lawyer; however, I\u2019m not a magician.\u201dShe ended up cutting ties with him. He\u2019d been emailing the C.H.A. since July, but three months later, her situation remained the same. \u201cI\u2019m not prejudiced,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I\u2019d have been white, he\u2019d have moved me the very same day. He doesn\u2019t have to live in Wentworth Gardens, in the ghetto, as they say.\u201dMany more families were like the Rickses, people who went from run-down public housing to rehabbed public housing, albeit still in areas of concentrated poverty. The same proved true for those who moved with a voucher. The C.H.A. currently oversees 16,000 units of occupied public housing, more than a third of which are designated for the elderly, and 47,000 vouchers in the private market. The combination of the two exceeds what the agency\u2019s total supply of housing was in the \u201990s. Nationally, the number of families using a Section 8 rent subsidy has doubled over the last 25 years, to 2.3 million. In theory, a voucher gives a family the choice to live anywhere. But the rents the federal government pays to Section 8 landlords are generally not enough for a home in a diverse neighborhood with strong schools and low crime; most landlords taking vouchers aren\u2019t in \u201copportunity\u201d areas but in poor and racially isolated ones not so different from the razed government-run high-rises. In 2003, an independent monitor of the C.H.A.\u2019s first years of relocations offered a bleak assessment: \u201cThe result has been that the vertical ghettos from which the families are being moved are being replaced with horizontal ghettos, located in well defined, highly segregated neighborhoods.\u201dThe families that were dispersed from Chicago\u2019s demolished public housing have been blamed for the city\u2019s recent surge in gun violence, as well as for crime in the suburbs, the greater Midwest and even parts of the South. Several studies have shown that C.H.A. residents did not spread disorder wherever they settled, as if they carried an infectious disease. But these families were moved primarily to areas of Chicago that were already hollowed out of population, schools, occupied homes, jobs and resources. In South Shore, which took on more Section 8 renters than any other neighborhood in the city, 3,700 apartments were caught up in foreclosures, one out of every five rental units. The problems of concentrated poverty and isolation, which the demolitions were supposed to solve, persisted \u2014 and relocated families now found themselves in strange territory without their former support networks. People in public housing had, by necessity, bartered services, shopped together, shared food, stepped up when a neighbor lost a loved one. Annie Ricks\u2019s oldest daughter, Kenosha, left Cabrini-Green when she was in her 20s and moved with her family to a block on the West Side. \u201cI\u2019ve been out here almost a decade, and I know three or four of my neighbors,\u201d she told me recently. \u201c\u2009\u2018They from the projects,\u2019 people say. But they don\u2019t know me. They weren\u2019t raised how we were raised. We were raised to stick together. If you\u2019re a neighbor, you let the next neighbor know what\u2019s going on. They don\u2019t do that out here.\u201dDevelopments like Cabrini-Green did in fact need to be made safer and more livable, and maybe even torn down. But the public had an obligation as well to ensure that those who lived there didn\u2019t lose out when the high-rises were replaced. Virtually no new public housing has been built in the country in decades. There\u2019s still a stock of over a million units nationwide, down from a peak of 1.4 million. Much of it is at risk. A HUD-commissioned study in 2010 found a $26 billion backlog in repair and maintenance needs, a figure estimated to have ballooned since then to more than $50 billion. Each year, some 10,000 to 15,000 units are lost solely because of neglect. The New York City Housing Authority had long avoided the failings that troubled authorities in other big cities. Towers in New York are the norm; maintenance and management remained strong, and high demand for housing allowed for renters with a greater range of incomes. But the city\u2019s 2,500 buildings, home to 400,000 New Yorkers, now need $17 billion in unmet repairs. The problem is often worse in small cities and less-urban areas, because there is no other supply of low-income rentals once dilapidated public housing is shuttered. HUD, rather than trying to replenish its dangerously insufficient capital fund, submitted a 2018 budget that would slash it by another two-thirds.All of this comes amid an affordable-housing crisis that is as urgent as it is unheeded. Today, only one of every five families poor enough to qualify for a housing subsidy actually receives one. A quarter of all renters nationwide pay more than half their income in rent. Families are forced to make harmful choices between rent and food, doctor\u2019s visits and education costs. In their search for what public-housing agencies had promised as the minimal requirement of a \u201cdecent, safe and sanitary home,\u201d the poor have been pushed farther from the economic activity and opportunities of city centers. The current head of the Chicago Housing Authority, Eugene Jones Jr., has envisioned a remedy, albeit an unlikely one, coming in the form of an infrastructure bill that would fully fund housing assistance, coupling the subsidy with the wraparound services \u2014 health care, day care, job training and transportation \u2014 that residents need to thrive. \u201cI\u2019m not a Republican, but we\u2019re trying to transform our residents out of public and assisted housing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe end game is that you\u2019re moving off subsistence.\u201d It\u2019s a noble goal. But there simply is no adequate supply of housing at that next step up. In 2014, when the C.H.A. opened a lottery just to make it onto the waiting list for either a voucher or public-housing unit, 280,000 families entered their names, a quarter of all the households in Chicago.Around the old Cabrini-Green and other expensive urban real estate markets, close-cropped towers are again being built. These are high-end private developments, although they occasionally set aside a number of subsidized apartments for an allotted period of time in exchange for tax breaks and building rights. The common sentiment is that the people who can afford the luxury high-rises have created their own good fortune; the generous government benefits they receive are rightfully earned. For those in Wentworth Gardens or Chicago\u2019s distant South Side or any impoverished neighborhood in the country, no political will exists anymore for the government to step in and transform the blocks that have been left to decline. Affordable-housing advocates are by no means pushing for a return to large public-housing high-rise developments, but some have noted that a few towers mixed in here and there with the luxury condos wouldn\u2019t stand out.There are calls to again mobilize the country\u2019s resources. The Bipartisan Policy Center has endorsed a universal voucher program that would guarantee rental assistance to the country\u2019s 11.4 million extremely low income households. Several studies by the Urban Institute and other research organizations show that such an endeavor would recoup much of its cost in reduced homelessness and also ease health problems and other consequences of instability that are ultimately paid for by governments. Several organizations in recent years have proposed tax credits for cost-burdened low-income households. And a bill introduced numerous times by the Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison sets out to cut the mortgage-interest deduction for wealthier homeowners and use the $200 billion in savings over 10 years to close the affordable-housing deficit. Congress did, in fact, cut the mortgage-interest deduction as part of last December\u2019s tax bill, though by much less than low-income housing proponents had wanted. The savings went not to creating affordable housing but to offsetting the tax benefits that Republicans doled out to corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Seventy years into our test as a country to provide housing for those who have too little, we are hardly any closer to passing.Rose and her toddler daughter remained in the apartment at Wentworth Gardens. Her brothers slept there less and less frequently. With their mother gone, their lives became more itinerant. They stayed with girlfriends or with other siblings scattered around the city and the surrounding suburbs. Wentworth hadn\u2019t become any safer for them. Reggie, in his early 20s, was arrested there after another fight. A group of guys at the development pounced on Raqkown and broke a bone in his neck. But it wasn\u2019t clear where they would be better off. Raequonn Ricks Williams, a 19-year-old relative, was shot on the West Side, one of the 762 people murdered in Chicago in 2016. Reggie and his mother had squabbled before her death. He\u2019d been turned down at more than a dozen job interviews, and Annie Ricks berated him for giving up. He racked up arrests. \u201cWhen Reggie left Cabrini, he felt his whole family was gone,\u201d Kenosha said of her younger brother. \u201cHis immediate family plus everybody he was in, like, preschool with.\u201dRose left finally for an apartment building 25 blocks farther south. She had got her daughter into a school near there, and she had also come to feel haunted at Wentworth, always expecting to see her mother emerge from one of the bedrooms. Back in 2014, at her mother\u2019s funeral, Rose had been unable to speak through her tears. A hundred former Cabrini-Green residents showed up at the West Side church to pay their respects. Rose\u2019s siblings talked about their mother\u2019s stubbornness, her determination to provide for them: \u201cWhat she didn\u2019t have, she made sure we had it,\u201d one said. Reggie said he didn\u2019t care that he had a terrible singing voice, and he started in on an R. Kelly song: \u201cDear Mama, you wouldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019m goin\u2019 through/But still I got my head up just like I promised you.\u201d Kenton, Ricks\u2019s fourth of nine sons, said they all learned from her example. \u201cBe strong, take care of the kids, take care of family,\u201d he repeated. She made them all better people. \u201cShe\u2019d do anything for anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just love.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now I\u2019m Begging Him to Act on Guns.", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe video above is based on the following letter, which I wrote to my senator, Marco Rubio, in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. I urge you to hold your elected officials accountable by sending them a letter and tagging them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and whatever other social media platforms you use.Dear Senator Rubio,I am writing to you as a former employee of your Tallahassee, Florida office. My sophomore year at Florida State University, I accepted a non-partisan internship at your Tallahassee, Fla. location. As an eager, young Political Science student, I was excited to get my foot in the door of a Senator\u2019s office; however, I was dismayed when your staff told me that you probably wouldn\u2019t be present for the duration of my internship.As it turns out, they were right \u2013 I worked for your team for five whole months, twenty hours a week, and never once saw you in the office.As an intern, I was tasked with fielding constituents\u2019 calls and writing their comments into a call log, which was sent to you at the end of each week. Supposedly, you used this log to address the needs of constituents, but I am skeptical that you ever actually read through it.Now, three years later, I am one of those concerned constituents pleading for change from you, our elected Florida official. I am afraid, though, that my pleas for help will fall on the ears of another intern and go no further \u2013 but you can prove me wrong by taking action against gun violence.When I was 19-years-old, FSU \u2013 my home away from home \u2013 experienced a campus shooting. On November 20, 2015, Myron May approached the Strozier Library on FSU\u2019s campus and opened fire on students using a .380-caliber handgun. Three of my fellow colleagues were injured. May was mentally disturbed and consumed by paranoia to a point where he sought to murder people on my campus.Thankfully, during the shooting I was not at the scene of the crime, but rather, across the street sitting in my dorm. While I studied for my upcoming finals, students were being shot a few yards away from me.When I was 20-years-old, yet another community I hold close to my heart suffered a mass shooting. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 58 others using an AR-15 style-rifle at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Mateen specifically targeted LGBTQ+ Latinx/people-of-color that evening.I was about one mile up the same street from the massacre that night. Again, a blood bath occurred yards away from me and my friends.Less than 7 months later, tragedy struck while I was visiting home for winter break. January 6, 2017, Esteban Santiago-Ruiz used a Walther PPS 9mm semi-automatic pistol to gun down five individuals and injure six others at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The Broward County airport my family used to travel our entire lives became a warzone.Today, I am a 21-year-old college graduate and am writing this with great despair \u2013 and even more anger. On February 14, 2018, Nikolas Cruz used an AR-15 style-rifle to murder 17 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and staff, and injured at least 14 more.I sat in my parents\u2019 home, just around the corner from my alma mater, as children were being slaughtered. Once again, I sat in a silo of safety as a bloody massacre literally played out across the street.I\u2019ve lived in the serene town of Parkland since I was three-years-old, and attended MSD for four formative years of my life. The hallways where I once shared laughter, curiosity, and hope are now crime scenes. Members of my community have lost their lives. Students and staff of MSD are traumatized. My tight-knit community of loving people is broken.I am in shock that one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history happened in Parkland, Fla., my hometown \u2013 the safest place in Florida.In my short lifetime, these countless acts of terror have plagued communities throughout the United States with unimaginable grief, and it is time for this pattern to stop. I will no longer feel helpless nor sit idly by while these atrocities occur.I will not accept mass shootings as the norm.\u00b7 Stricter gun licensing\u00b7 Recognizing gun violence as a public health issue\u00b7 Funding research on gun violence and gun violence prevention\u00b7 Extensive background checks for gun purchases\u00b7 Close loopholes in gun purchasing (i.e. gun shows)\u00b7 Implementing a buffer period between purchasing a rifle and taking it homeIt is shameful that I have to write this and beg you to do SOMETHING.I hope you have read my letter free from the influence of wealthy lobbyists who may impede your senatorial judgment. I hope you read this letter at all.Respectfully, your former intern and concerned Parkland citizen,Shana Miranda RosenthalShana Rosenthal (@ShanaMRosenthal) is a recent graduate of Florida State University, where she studied political science and communications.Advertisement"}

Dr. Soon-Shiong is a major shareholder in Tronc, the parent company of The Times.A deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday but could still fall apart, the people said. Tronc is likely to use the sale proceeds to pay down its debt.\u2014 Sydney EmberAfter days of sometimes wild moves in stock markets, investors on Wall Street refocused on the ongoing strength in the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A sometimes-panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated through the day, and the S.&P. 500 ended Tuesday\u2019s session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs.Investors appeared to reassess whether the previous day\u2019s violent decline\u2014the S.&P. suffered its worst decline since August 2011\u2014reflected actual fundamentals or was merely a long-overdue outbreak of investor jitters.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk higher, as measures of volatility\u2014the ups and downs of stock prices\u2014hit historically low levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop in which growth and inflation remained lackluster, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But the peaceful climb ended over the past week amid worries that solid economic growth in the United States and abroad could be showing early signals of growing inflation pressure. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data\u2014such as the U.S. jobs report on Friday\u2014showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.The Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became the latest prominent company to report solid earnings amidst the market turmoil. The strong numbers support the belief that plunging stock markets do not reflect weakness in the real economy.Disney made $1.89 per share in the last three months of 2017, after excluding a tax benefit. That number is 22 percent higher than the $1.55 per share earnings in the same period of 2016. It is also well in excess of the $1.61 per share that Wall Street analysts had forecast for the latest quarter.Disney did best in its parks and resorts business, which reported $1.35 billion of operating income, which was 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period. The earlier period\u2019s results were somewhat depressed by the impact of Hurricane Matthew, Disney said. In its press release, the company noted that higher profits at its domestic parks and resorts were driven by an increase in guest spending and an increase in attendance, which underscores consumers\u2019 willingness to spend more. On the other hand, the company said parks and resorts are dealing with higher labor costs and other expenses. That may not be lost on investors who are starting to see inflation as a threat to stock prices.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Numbers\u2022 Snap reported revenue rose 72 percent to $285.7 million, easily exceeding the $252.9 million expected by analysts.\u2022 The company lost 13 cents per share, below estimates of 16 cents a share.\u2022 Snap added 8.9 million daily active users for a total of 187 million, compared to the 184.2 million estimated.The ContextSnap\u2019s shares have struggled since its initial public offering in March 2017. The stock fell below its I.P.O price of $17 a share last summer and has remained below that level since. If Snap\u2019s after-hours gains hold up on Wednesday, the stock will be on the cusp of crossing back over its I.P.O. level.The stock market\u2019s slide over the past week has given investors plenty of anxiety.Stocks have lost roughly $4 trillion in value. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 endured their worst point declines in their histories Monday and their largest percentage drops since 2011. C.B.O.E. Volatility Index surged more than 100 percent Monday, the biggest increase in its history.But there are reasons investors shouldn\u2019t get too concerned.Strategists over at Goldman Sachs wrote:\u201cThe stock market correction appears to be more technical and positioning-driven rather than fundamentally-based.We believe the fundamental drivers of the equity market remain intact and reiterate our S&P 500 year-end 2018 forecast of 2850.\u201dHere\u2019s a video of the launch:When stock markets are plunging, sober-minded investors try to gauge the underlying strength of bellwether companies, to see whether all the selling is justified.That is why many eyes will be on the earnings of the Walt Disney Company, which reports after the close of regular trading Tuesday. If the company releases stronger-than-expected results for the three months through the end of December, it will reinforce a general sense of optimism about corporate America .Stellar results from Disney would add to a strong earnings report on Tuesday from General Motors, which helped push the company\u2019s shares 3 percent higher. Micron Technology, a large maker of computer chips, on Monday upped its outlook for the current quarter. Its shares soared 7.7 percent on Tuesday.Though Disney is not a high growth company, its results offer insight into the strength of consumer spending. As a result, if the company reports earnings that are below the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, it may add to the unease among investors..Of course, a lot more companies are going to have to report strong earnings to convince investors to jump back into the stock market. One of the reasons that stocks rallied in recent months is that analysts are expecting a 20-percent plus jump in profits in 2018, an eye-popping rise. The more large companies that hit their numbers in this earnings season, the more likely the stock market will find a floor.\u2014 Peter EavisAt a hearing of the Senate banking committee on Tuesday, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama asked the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the market turmoil.\u201cIs this perhaps more than an ordinary correction?\u201d Mr. Shelby asked.Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C. said that he could not tell what had caused the big declines, but he said that the market infrastructure had held up well under the strain of heavy trading.\u201cAs I sit here today, there\u2019s nothing that came out of this that concerns me,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the C.F.T.C. said that his staff had a late night on Monday checking in with all the exchanges, and had not heard anything that concerned them.\u201cThe system worked as it was designed to do,\u201d he said.\u2014 Nathaniel PopperFollowing a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that he has been in touch with market participants this week and that they are reacting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems. He said it was possible that algorithmic trading was partially responsible for the recent volatility in the stock market.\u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said.Despite that volatility, it does not appear that the Trump administration is ready to give up on the stock market as a measure of its success.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been looking at the long-term impact of the stock market, it\u2019s still up over 30 percent since the election and we continue to think American is a great place to do business,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with companies\u2019 response with more and more investments in the U.S.\u201dAsked about the roiled stock market at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the Trump administration was not concerned and that it remains focused on the long-term trajectory of the economy.\u201cWe are very focused on long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we have enacted, including tax reform are very positive for long-term economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He said that he was closely monitoring for orderly market functioning and that there were \u201cno systemic issues\u201d that were reported to him.\u201cI\u2019m happy to report I got the green lights,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The Treasury secretary said that given how much the market has rallied in the last year, he does not think the recent drop in prices raises financial stability concerns.Asked if the Trump administration will take the blame for the recent drop in stocks after taking credit for the rally, Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\u201cI think we\u2019ll still claim credit for the fact that it\u2019s up over 30 percent since the election,\u201d he said of the stock market.\u2014 Alan RappeportWhen stock markets sell off as they have the past two trading sessions, there is often more than one cause. But one popular trade is taking a lot of blame for Monday\u2019s plunge: short volatility.Investors had piled money into exchange-traded products designed to rise when the C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, falls. The VIX, known as the market\u2019s fear gauge, measures how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead. Those wagers paid off handsomely, rising 180 percent last year as the VIX plumbed historic lows.That quickly reversed Monday. The VIX surged 117 percent in its biggest one-day jump on record and two short volatility exchange-traded product \u2014 VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange Traded Note, XIV, and Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Inverse ETN \u2014 endured heavy selling.From Barclays:\u201cIn our opinion, the significant spike in the VIX index and futures yesterday was technical in nature and does not necessarily indicate a true increase in risk perception.\u201dFrom Morgan Stanley:\u201cThe near bankruptcy of the inverse VIX ETPs will be a very negative headline, and the several billion dollar loss for holders, largely retail, will scare some out of the market or force liquidations of other products to raise cash.\u201dFrom Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research:\u201c Assuming volatility-related ETFs really are a market structure \u201cAchilles heel\u201d, this will take days if not weeks to play out, and there could be other problems waiting in the wings.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u2022 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 5 percent.\u2022 Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 4.7 percent.\u2022 The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was down 2 percent.\u2022 Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d the VIX, is at its highest level in two and a half years.More from Ben White of Politico:\u201cThis is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,\u201d said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. \u201cUntil now, Trump\u2019s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed. Now she\u2019s out the door and volatility is back.\u201dInvestors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down.\u201cCryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,\u201d said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThe combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large.\u201dExpect more give-and-take between the two sides of Congress:\u201cI think everyone understands that this will probably end up being a Ping-Pong situation, and we\u2019ll see where the ball lands,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida.Elsewhere in policyMore from Alex Sherman of CNBC:An unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney\u2019s bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox\u2019s Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox\u2019s assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast.Elsewhere in the deal world\u201cI talked to women engineers at Uber who were getting invited to strip clubs and bondage clubs in the middle of the day. The middle of the day!

{"Headline": "On Happiness, Social Media, Collecting Things and Olympic Sports: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationEnjoy!_________I think the school should offer resources for students to feel happy but not offer classes like Yale is. I think the school should stick to academics and not turn classes into a rehab centers. I would be O.K. with if the school were to offer a program in which students were taught to make others happy. I think this way because you come to school to learn not feel better that what hospitals are for. With saying that, I do think schools should offer resources and help for those feeling unhappy.I think that, since happiness is different for different people, it will be difficult to teach, and the material taught will not be perfect for every specific situation \u2026 [but] as long as it works and people are becoming happier, I think it\u2019s a fantastic idea that will help the stress of college life, especially at a school like Yale.I would not want my school to offer this class. I don\u2019t think the kids in my high school would take it seriously. They would probably just be on their phones the entire time. However, I do think schools should at least offer a class on happiness, maybe not on how to get it. But rather on how studies show others feel happiness. I think this class would be better as a psychology class on happiness.I think I would like to have a class like this because I get so wrapped up in the pressure to do well in school that I sometimes put my happiness to the side and only focus on school. I think if my school had this class it would actually improve academics because when I\u2019m stressed I will do worse than if I am calm about it. I think this class should be graded but only for effort. It would be kind of counterproductive if you were getting stressed about a class that teaches you how to not be stressed.After reading this article and gathering my thoughts I think that a course that teaches students how to be happy is unnecessary. I think it is nice to offer the class to colleges that are known to high stress levels and expectations, however I do not think the class will help in the long run and it may just be a temporary relief for student workload \u2026 I think it is important to find happiness and a positive life style on your own as a way to grow as a person instead of following advice given from psychologists.I do not think that happiness should be graded at all. Though the class is a good idea, I still do not believe happiness can simply be taught. Happiness comes to people in different ways, because we\u2019re all so different. Nonetheless, the course seems to be helping a lot of people and I do support that.Yale\u2019s class on happiness brilliantly addresses a crisis happening in educational institutions nationwide. Whether it is in high school or college, metal health experiences follow students into adulthood, and create habits that will play a role in defining one\u2019s success.Dr. Santos referenced \u201c[numbness]\u201d as a feeling by many students, and rightfully so, because often times it may not be depression that consumes students, but rather a lack of happiness or pathways to it. I would encourage educational institutions, including my own, to offer a class on happiness and gratified living, that can shape overall moods on campus, and put graduates on a path for healthy success. A class on happiness should be graded, so that students\u2019 progress can be kept and students can see a conscious growth within themselves through self-reflection.For me, a form of self-reflection is gratitude. I have taken up remembering what it is that makes me happy to take me out of stressful situations and find that it is little skills like that, that will take me far._________1.) I looked forward to the game2.) I hoped and got what I wished for, THE EAGLES WON!3.) #9: FolesThis year I was especially excited for the Super Bowl because the Eagles were playing and they were the team I was rooting for.I love this time of year because there are great commercials, good food, and a game you can yell your head off about.The Super Bowl is known for the memorable commercials and halftime show, but this year the main attraction was the thrilling showdown between the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots. Which was your favorite? Was it the hilarious rap battle between Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman, or the halftime show featuring JT?Super Bowl LII was one that will go down in history. On Feb. 4, 2018 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Nick Foles (Eagles Quarterback) became the second player to ever start the season as a backup, and win the Super Bowl as a starter. Who was the first player to do it? Tom Brady, of course.The Eagles outlasted the Patriots 41-33 in a nail-biter to land the Eagles their first ever Super Bowl. However, the M.V.P. of the game might\u2019ve been Justin Timberlake when he performed \u201cI Would Die 4 U\u201d by Prince to honor him since Prince is from Minneapolis._________After a break-up and many years of neglecting my space, I finally gave it a fresh rehaul. And I decided to go minimalist. All those little knick-knacks that was supposed to recall good memories? Gone. All the sticks of furniture that were laden with history (even good history) \u2026 gone. All the doodads that might, just might, be useful at some point \u2026 also gone.A friend suggested I just start creating a board of images I loved. And I learned that I really do have a certain feel I really love, certain colors and hues I\u2019m drawn to, but it was not being reflected in my space. So now, with a new pared down look with only colors and textures I love \u2014 I find this is my \u2018feel good\u2019 room. There isn\u2019t as much personal junk \u2014 instead, the space is a strong statement of style I have an affinity and an affection for. It leaves a lighter footprint. I feel free, unshackled from possessions. I can finally breathe.My room, no not room, my getaway, is one of my most prized possessions. Well my parent\u2019s possessions. My room is made up of everything that is a part of me. Whether it be my salt rock lamp, or my eucalyptus pillow spray and silk pillows. I balanced out bulky shelves with a small Polaroid string. The lights I strung around the perimeter of my ceiling remind me of summer nights on the lawn with my mom in Raleigh as we would watch for shooting stars and the different hues if fireworks on the Fourth of July. I believe that I styled my bedroom exactly to fit me. My bed spread is like that of a hotel\u2019s comforter. Reminding me of family vacations to florida or georgia or oregon. My color palette (Teal, wood, and white accent) maybe subliminally represent my longing to be anywhere on the water. The hammock could represent my swing-easy attitude, and the sondbar system: my love for movies.I recently, with the help of my parents, completely redid my room. Nothing is remotely similar than it was before and I absolutely love it. My room now completely reflects who I and creates a sanctuary all for myself. From my Beatles poster to my waterfall fish tank, it\u2019s all genuinely me. The colors I chose myself, I finally have a plant of my own and continue to add to my haven every day. My painting of Venice along with my outline of the world reflects my unmatched urge to travel as far as I can. Nothing in here isn\u2019t a part of who I am and I couldn\u2019t have it any other way.I have designed my room to support my well being by keeping it fun with small things. I have a small smiley face sticker on the wall from when I went to the orthodontist and first got my braces next to my bed, and an Eddie Van Halen poster on my wall. The Eddie Van Halen poster makes me happy like how I feel when I listen to his music. This is all I really need or want to have on my walls \u2026 I put nostalgic items like birthday cards from my grandparents, or my parents on my dresser to make it look nicer. All of the things in my room make it my room, and help me relax._________I\u2019ve been struggling with perfectionism for almost all my life. I\u2019ve naturally always gotten good grades and at first I never really thought about it, but over time I started to become obsessive with the amount of studying I put in and the outcome of my work. I definitely put pressure on myself and set extremely high standards.Since last year I\u2019ve known that I wanted to be a neurologist. I began to research the career even more and set the goal of getting amazing grades for the rest of high school so I can get into a credited college and later on medical school, to prepare myself for the rest of my career and life. So, me being my overachieving self, I\u2019ve put in a lot of work into my schoolwork and make sure it\u2019s perfect and worthy of a good grade. I often work myself too hard to the point where I have a mental breakdown.Recently my english teacher gave us an assignment of choosing one word we\u2019d like to represent the person we want to become this year. I want to become less of a perfectionist (but still reaching most of my goals) and become less stressed and confident in my abilities, so I chose the word faith. Since I started the assignment, I\u2019ve noticed a tremendous change and already see my extreme perfectionist tendencies vanishing. I learned the hard way that being a perfectionist can be beneficial and build you up, like getting good grades, but can also tear you down and consume you in a sea of stress.Growing up in a world in which the pressure to succeed and stand out is at its peak, it is difficult to not fall victim to being a \u201cperfectionist\u201d. Though being a perfectionist can be a positive attribute, I for one feel as though it is an exhausting attribute that most often leads to disappointment. No matter how well a \u201cperfectionist\u201d does, their performance never seems to be good enough. As a perfectionist, I hold very high standards and goals for myself, and when I fail to meet those standards, the disappointment that I feel is incredibly overwhelming.\u2026 What people fail to understand is that such achievements do not come without a substantial cost: the overwhelming burden that one feels through many stages of life is sometimes unfathomable.No, I am not a perfectionist at all. I don\u2019t believe that any one thing can be truly perfect. However I do believe in trying my best. I know that whatever I do at my age can\u2019t be perfect but as long as I have given it the best that I have got then I don\u2019t stress over it. I value the opinions of my family, teachers, and classmates, they all influence how good or bad my work is, but the only opinion that matters the most when counts is my own. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I try hard in school and sports and I want a good future for myself, but setting standards for everything as high as \u201cperfect\u201d can cause stress and anxiety that I don\u2019t need.Often on social media we find our selves scrolling through our feed wishing we had the life that our friend had, or that we had this amount of likes or \u201cWow, her life must be perfect!\u201d Social media has provided a mask to our actual lives that we are living \u2026 Sometimes we just need to remind ourselves that people aren\u2019t living the perfect life that we think they are and that we\u2019re doing the best we can.I would not label myself as a perfectionist, I always try to do my best and go with the flow. However, I do strive to work hard and get good grades, but I know if I get one B it won\u2019t be the end of the world. I try to find a balance between schoolwork and just being a teenager.My dad is a lot like me in this way, we\u2019re both very type B. However, my sister is the total opposite. She is the definition of a perfectionist. She doesn\u2019t just strive for A\u2019s, she strives for A+\u2019s, in classes 2-3 grades above her grade level, and if she doesn\u2019t meet her goal she constantly beats herself up about it. On top of this, she dances for 4-5 hours a day. She has a really hard time letting go of things if they aren\u2019t absolutely perfect. She is a constant stress-ball, like my mom.My mom is a perfectionist as well, as she projects this onto me with her high expectations. Often, I feel they\u2019re way too high, and I just can\u2019t do enough to please her. Whenever I do accomplish something I\u2019m proud of, like getting an A on a really hard test, I rarely rewarded because that\u2019s just what\u2019s expected of me. She often treats me how she would treat herself, and I\u2019m not a perfectionist so her standards seem impossible.Because of my perfectionism, I do not take many breaks. I always seem to be running somewhere or spending an obsessive amount of time improving something that does not necessarily need to be perfect. As a student, I study for long periods of time and do a lot of homework. In fact, I do not socialize as much because my standards push me to exceed. To manage the muddle my high standards create, I have tried to create a schedule to manage my time and make myself available for what I enjoy doing, and for my grades and community. I also make different study methods for my own benefit. When I get stressed or overwhelmed, I try to relax and take a break such as listening to music or watch a quick TV show. Overall, high standards can be both beneficial and detrimental._________Liberty leading the people, the murals painted on the Berlin wall, and the women\u2019s march logo. All these images are more than just murals and paintings.Art unites people under a common image. One painting or one image can be the face of a revolution or what the movement is remembered by. For example the \u201cEveryone is welcome here\u201d which can be seen around America in storefront windows in other places. It is what is spread and seen by people. Or look at Liberty leading the people the image we all associate with the French Revolution. Art gives one unforgettable image for a moment to be remembered by. Watching history throughout the years it is clear that art mirrors the way people feel. Take the dada art movement for example. People were disillusioned after WWII and it was the new types of art that showed that. Art is people\u2019s true feelings and anger used productively to make something creative and inspirational.Art can unite and build support. Art shows how people feel. Art is not just paint on wall and canvases. Art is what begins the revolution.I believe that art can be an act of resistance. Art can be created in an abundance of forms and is given to everyone to access, no matter who you are or what your background. By creating art, it gives the creator as well as others the ability to emote and show opinion through these images. I believe in this ideal because of how widespread art is and how many forms that it may take.I do think that art can be an effective method of resistance \u2014 and I believe so because art has been one of the most profound factors in shaping society as we know it.Any major change in history came with a change in the arts. For example, the Renaissance cam with rebirth of culture \u2014 and art is what led us out of the \u201cdarkness\u201d of the Middle Ages into the intellectual sophistication of the Renaissance. Art belongs to the people; it always has. We saw that with the birth of hip-hop as a form resistance to an unjust government.In the history of humans, there has always been art as a constant. It has shaped any major event that has happened \u2014 political cartoons, a form of art, has managed to overwhelmingly affect the course of wars and politics. Art has always been about the people, and it can be a very effective method to bring about change and resistance. Art is what makes \u201cpolitical\u201d things or heavy subjects that aren\u2019t really talked about, a major topic in popular culture.Art is what makes us human, and in cases like the Holocaust where the government tried to entirely erase a group\u2019s humanity, the simple existence of art can be a form of resistance.Art can be an act of resistance. Throughout history, ordinary people have turned to art for political expression and social defiance of standards in their government, nation, and/or society.One notable movement that required art was the Civil Rights Movement, which sparked in the 1960s. While direct involvement in protests and lawsuits moved forward the goal of racial equality for black citizens, art captured the deep and complex themes and emotions associated with the oppressed minority. Viewers could empathize with the subjects in paintings and murals, which demonstrate pain and distress. For example, Norman Rockwell\u2019s 1964 painting \u201cRockwell & Race\u201d depicts violence against civil rights workers, an unfair issue in America that requires social change.Although some may say that art is a luxury nowadays, with all the bad that is going on in the world, I think that art is a way that we can make a change. When we feel like we are losing our voices, art can speak for us, and make public the change that we want to see.I personally think the greatest art comes from those resisting. Those in a dire time of need have the most to express. They can completely fill their art with the purest emotion possible. I am a very strong believer that art is an amazing way to vent and allow your audience to almost empathize with whatever it is you\u2019re going through.An example of resistance in our nation\u2019s past can be shown through many of the famous poet Langston Hughes\u2019 poems. Hughes wrote from the perspective of a black man in a nation against him and the raw emotion displayed in his poetry puts you there. Hughes alone shows how beneficial resistance can be within art.As a student artist, naturally, I was drawn to this topic. As someone who believes that you should work to see a change, naturally, I was drawn away from this topic.I mean, no offense, but come on. Nothing\u2019s going to change if we just sit around making art that expresses our unease with our situations. I can draw as many political works as I want, nothing is going to change my situation unless I try to improve it for myself.While yes, maybe your art can help shift the mind of someone who is already slightly partial to your views and ideals, your art isn\u2019t going to save the world or have as big of an impact as you think unless you have influence \u2026 If making pretty pictures and clothing is all you\u2019re doing in the hopes of a societal reform, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re not living on the same planet. I say yes, do continue to create art maybe for the comfort of others who find solace in your work, but know that it\u2019s rather optimistic to think that the change you want lies within the creative works of yourself or others._________I deleted my twitter account in November because of all the constant negativity and anxiety I would get over scrolling through my feed. The whole idea about social media is a great concept, but there are a lot of things that make it very unappealing.I noticed that social media has really become a self obsorbed realm of eye candy and feeds all of our insecurities. Or, on the other end, a place where people can spew their hate for the world to see and comment on with their own idiotic opinions.I spent only a month away and realized how much time I allowed it to consume my life. I had to fill my time with more productive things and it honestly felt so good. I currently co-run my church\u2019s young adult Instagram page so I need to be on social media for that reason, but other than that, getting rid of it for good would be no problem to me.I have thought about giving my social media up once before and now with lent coming up my friend was talking about how she is going to give up her social media and I thought that was a very good idea and something that I would want to do.I feel like in life we often don\u2019t believe in ourselves so we don\u2019t even try, but I think it is important to give up social media or even just take a break from it because we often don\u2019t realize what we are missing until we have a different perspective. Also since my generation has basically grown up with social media we don\u2019t know how life would be without it, so why not give it a try.I would never consider to quit any of the social media because I want to stay in touch with my old friends and know about their lifestyle, so you feel like you are close to them even if they are living in a different country. I have never have conflict with social media. Instead I enjoy using social media because you get to know about your friends, what he have done whole week, also what is going on the Earth.I think the best thing one can do is find a balance, where you reap the good things that come with social media, while maintaining a distance, so one doesn\u2019t become addicted or find oneself fully entrenched in a \u201cTwitter war.\u201dIn the spirit of the article, my teacher challenged us to quit social media for a day, and found myself doing more chores, something I usually wouldn\u2019t have time for. However, I think this indicates my failure to find the balance between productivity and pleasure.I am a regular Twitter user, as well as using Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, Snapchat, and other sites. I think that I could give up social media for a short period of time, perhaps a month, and I would benefit from it. Without social media I would have much more time on my hands, and the amount of negative news I consume would decrease. I don\u2019t think that I would want to give up social media permanently though, because it is a free tool at my disposal, whether I use it for putting myself out there, finding funny stories, sharing laughs with my friends, or anything else.As an aspiring journalist, I know that having a social media presence will be important, if not essential to my career. Even though it may include fighting off trolls and managing threats, it will be worth it to have immediate access to news and a large platform to promote myself on.Though I was long opposed to using social media platforms, I don\u2019t think I will ever get rid of them now that I am involved. I have experienced first hand the whole other level of friendship and social involvement you miss out on without these platforms, especially snapchat at my age.Not only is social media important socially, but I believe that I will need it professionally. I want to work in the fashion industry, which is heavily promoted via imagery. Social media platforms are how I promote my personal brand, and how the fashion industry communicates with its followers. The benefits of giving up social media are not worth the community and professional-aid I would be losing.I use Facebook and Instagram regularly but 5 years ago, I considered to give up these social media platform and I actually did it for a short time. The reason was I spent so much time on it. Now I use it but only 30 minutes a day... I look up some fun stuff and share good information with my friends. How could I changed? The biggest difference from 5 years ago and now is I don\u2019t care so much friendship in there. I post things whenever I love to, I reply to my friend who lives overseas.Social media enhances quality of life if you can moderate but if you can\u2019t control yourself, it\u2019s better you to quit social media. Social media can be part of your life, not everything.I think I will need social media for some time for my career because I want to work in organizations relatedwithwomen\u2019s rights in the future. I guess social media would provide many data and many people\u2019s real experience.I may not be a postcard collector myself but one thing that is for sure is that I love vinyl records.When I buy vinyl I don\u2019t buy online. There is nothing like feeling the record and looking at the art within, it\u2019s beautiful.I guess you could say that I cheated; but here\u2019s how I acquired around 300 records. My great-aunt\u2019s son died and he left behind precious records like sly and the family stone, The Beatles, The Allman Brothers Band, and the Grateful Dead.This wasn\u2019t intentional, really, it wasn\u2019t. Naturally, however, if you really like something you\u2019re going to want more of it, right?What am I talking about? Video games. I\u2019ve been obsessed with the things since I was a little kid in pre-school. I remember my first Nintendo DS, it was a cute pastel pink and I loved it until it couldn\u2019t handle all the Hershey\u2019s Kisses wrappers I shoved into the cartridge slot so my family wouldn\u2019t know that I ate all that candy in one night.Back on track, just looking to my left I realize that I might have a problem. Stacks of games upon games, most of which I don\u2019t even have the time to beat or replay (I would kill for an hour alone with Ocarina of Time or Majora\u2019s Mask), and yet I want more. As soon as I hear about the next new release, I want it so bad. I heard about the new Xenoblade and I wanted it but I wasn\u2019t even a third of the way through the first Chronicles. And that\u2019s how they stack up.I never thought of it as a collection up until now and it\u2019s a weird way to think about it, but what is it if not a collection? Collectors themselves kinda freak me out. Like, don\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re not malicious, but as much as I love video games, I would definitely never shell out upward of $26,000 for an authentic 1990 Nintendo World Championship cartridge. If it makes you happy though and you don\u2019t neglect your health in favor of obsession, go for it!My grandparents started a coin collection back in 1999 saving every quarter from each state and placed it into a coin collection book. My grandparents were not able to finish the collection, so I decided to finish it. Now I have a coin collection of every state dating back to a Delaware coin made in 1787 to the final coin made in Hawaii in 1959.Now, I may not have an exotic collection, but it is a collection that has a valuable meaning behind it. Every time I look at the collection it reminds me of my grandparents.(part 1) I don\u2019t collect anything, yet, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not passionate or fascinated by any one particular materialistic thing. Or maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t like the look of clutter (an image I\u2019ve associated with collectors since watching American Pickers). I feel like collectors are attracted to certain collection items thanks to past memories.(part 2) I haven\u2019t picked my dad\u2019s brain about it, but maybe that\u2019s why his face lights up when he finds an especially old and unique quarter or a book written in the 19th century about historic forts. Most importantly, at the core of collection is culture. Clubs made of collectors exist because they are on the search for culture.Together, my family collects mugs from different places we\u2019ve been to. We tend to travel a lot, with or without each other and we like to collect the mugs as reminders as to where we\u2019ve been and what we\u2019ve experienced.It\u2019s always exciting when someone comes back from a place for a long time and gets to place the new mug in the cupboard and tell stories about it at the dinner table. For instance, this summer I went to a camp in a different state and I got to put my own mug in the cupboard for the first time. Getting to tell my family about the exciting things I experienced alone was exhilarating because it was something I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a while.The first time I came to the United States at the age of 9 years old. I felt amazed by the 25\u00a2 coins (Quarters) because they were completely different from what I knew of coins.Back in my country all coins where the same. They were uniform with no variety. When I first purchase in a store and got my change I noticed that my two quarters were different from each other .They have different image carve in the coin follow by a different state name of the fifty that forms the USA. I just had acknowledged not every coin was the same. It were different since that day I start collecting the quarters from every state and date. I get to collect more than 70 coins, I was very proud of my collection.The reason why I collect things is so I can remember. There are so many things that occur day to day and it can be hard to remember every little thing that has transpired in our lives. Collections allow people to reminisce past events or memories that are significant to them. They bring people back to the moments that shaped them.My most sentimental collection is definitely my postcard collection. Whenever I go to a new place I try to find a postcard from the area that I know will remind me of the moments and adventures that occurred. Every few months I\u2019ll come across my box of postcards and I\u2019ll dive into all of the memories. Feelings of joy and bliss rush through my mind every single time as I\u2019m reminded of all the little wonderful moments. I think everyone should have a collection of some sort._________Nothing can beat the bond of a real person that you can actually see in person and communicate in real time. Although, the internet and apps like Snapchat have made my relationships stronger with people I don\u2019t talk to often or get to see everyday, hanging out with them is much different. Being able to hear their voice, laugh with them, share the same meals and hug them is so much better than any type of phone call or text. It means so much more to you and the other person when you can be in each other\u2019s presence.People can get so caught up with virtual friends, they forget who is actually there for them. Facebook friends will leave comments on your posts when your sick. Real friends will visit you, and make sure you are O.K. \u2026 A text saying miss you will never compare to how you feel after seeing your best friend for the first time in months. A hug is better than an emoji. Laughing all night together wins against a phone call.When I meet someone in person, I feel nervous and vulnerable going up to them and starting a conversation. I get to know them through their facial expressions, gestures, and body language. Because they are also watching my expressions when I say something \u2014 in other words, they notice how I say things as much as what I say \u2014 my friends can detect deeper meaning behind what I say. We connect on an emotional level.I could be having an extremely terrible day, but on Facebook, I can hide behind my computer, pretending everything is fine, and my Facebook friends would have no idea. The internet creates a distorting filter where it is more difficult for people to understand one another on an emotional level because they cannot see each other. Online, we have to use a smiling emoji, but face to face, we can just smile._________Snowboarding (or snurfing) has been a staple of winter mountain sporting since its inception. Much like other board sports, snowboarding requires exceptional balance, control, awareness, and skill. Professionals of the snowboarding scene have put their lives into practice and perfection of their craft, and in some cases have become pop culture influences (Sean White). Taking into account the skill required to snowboard at a top level and the vast size of the culture, there\u2019s not a doubt in my mind that snowboarding should be included in the Winter Olympics. Most viewers of the Winter Games would agree, as Sports Illustrated listed the snowboard half pipe as the most popular event from the 2014 games.I\u2019m really excited for the Winter Olympics because of the snowboarding. I love the sport and I snowboard when I go up to New York sometimes. My favorite snowboarders are Gabe Ferguson, Shaun White, and Scotty James. Gabe and Shaun are on Team USA and Scotty James is on Team Australia.My all-time favorite snowboarder is Scotty James. I\u2019ve been following him since the X Games and he is truly amazing. He first started skiing at age one and then he started snowboarding three years of age. He started competing when he was six years old. He first went to the Winter Olympics when he was 15 years old, making him the youngest Australian male to compete in the Winter Olympics.\u2026 they could add other \u201cextreme\u201d games. In the x-games snowmobile speed and freestyle competitions are held. Both of these events could be added since the closest thing in the Winter Olympic Events today would be bobsledding. I am most excited to watch the bobsled racing, as well as the speed skating. I find the shorter events to be more entertaining. One Winter Olympic sport that is lengthy that I am intrigued by is the biathlon. The biathlon requires athletes to fire at targets varying from 1.8 to 4.5 inch in diameter based on firing position while being able to cross country ski, competing for the quickest time. I find this event interesting because of the diversity it brings to the Games.Advertisement"}

Talya Minsberg, a social strategy editor for The Times who is in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to cover the Winter Olympics, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.As a social strategy editor for The Times, what tech do you use on the job the most?Part of the job of a social editor is thinking about how readers find news where they already are \u2014 on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat. So I try to consume news like we know many of our readers do, from their phones.When I\u2019m in charge of what goes out on our social channels, I use a MacBook and one extra monitor, nothing too fancy. The key is having a handful of listening tools at the ready. That means I\u2019m one of those people who have an obnoxious amount of tabs up at once. Crowdtangle, a social media analytics tool, Chartbeat, Tweetdeck, Facebook \u2026 I could go on.I also listen to a good amount of music that can help me zone in on my work. So I\u2019m a frequent user of Spotify and live performances I have favorited on YouTube.How much social media do you consume for work, what forms of it do you consume the most, and how do you handle the deluge?As most social media editors can attest, the job demands consuming a lot of media in all forms. Day to day, Twitter takes up most of my time and energy. I also dedicate a good amount of my attention to Facebook, Reddit and Instagram at the office.I\u2019m very much still working on how I handle the deluge. Some days it feels like I\u2019m always taking in information, from the moment I wake up and start listening to NPR. Creating methods to narrow down the \u201cneed to know\u201d helps me cut out some of the noise. That could be a zooming in on sources pertinent to a story I\u2019m working on or top news. Either way, creating lists and advanced searches on Twitter is invaluable. I also follow specific subreddits, track trending terms, and use Google Alerts.That being said, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s helpful for my mental well-being to take one day a week off from social media. For me, that\u2019s Saturday. It feels like a weekly cleanse and sometimes it\u2019s truly a challenge, which makes me realize just how much I really need to push myself to do it. For one day a week, I try to use my phone as one thing and one thing only: a way to text and call family and friends. Radical, isn\u2019t it?My first priority was ensuring I have a secure backup for everything. If something happens to my phone or computer, I wanted to make sure that wouldn\u2019t completely derail my work. I use a password manager, have two-step verification on everything that allows it, and keep lots of stuff in the cloud.I\u2019ve also kicked my listening tools usage into high gear. That means a wealth of new lists, alerts and threads I\u2019m watching that are Olympics- and sport-specific.Do you have to keep any tech gear warm in the chilly temperatures in Pyeongchang, and how do you plan to do so? Yes! As many have experienced, phones can die quickly in the cold. Since temperatures have been hovering between zero and 30 degrees Fahrenheit, I thought about creative ways to keep my gear warm and charged. I ordered dozens and dozens of hand warmers that I plan on also using as phone warmers. The backup plan to that backup plan is having more than one phone on me, and more than one external charger on me.What is our social media strategy set to be at the Winter Olympics?I\u2019ll tell you about the tool I\u2019m most excited about \u2014 a new messaging system with one of our sports editors, Sam Manchester. Sam will be sending messages from the Olympics to readers within The New York Times app.There are a handful of exciting things you\u2019ll see on the messaging app. But perhaps most exciting is the fact that you will actually be able to talk to Sam, who is a real-life human and not a bot! He\u2019s going to be your man on the ground who will take you behind the scenes of the Games in all their excitement and quirkiness.Outside of work, what tech product are you in love with using in your daily life right now?What could be better about it?The most frustrating feature is that you have to be within 100 yards of a theater to reserve tickets. I wish you could reserve tickets in advance without being there. I don\u2019t see a reason against it, especially if there was a penalty for not showing up at the movie after reserving tickets to dissuade no shows, \u00e0 la ClassPass.What do you do to get away from social media?I get moving. I\u2019ve been an avid runner since I was a little kid, and there\u2019s nothing that makes me happier than a good long run. I\u2019m hoping to get in some runs in the very early mornings in Pyeongchang, SmartWool included.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Chicken Potpie Fit for a Party", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenEveryone falls for the homey appeal of chicken potpie. And why not? The aromatic filling of chicken in gravy, the nicely browned pastry lid, the ritual of piercing the crust: The whole experience is memorable.For most, it is a fond childhood memory \u2014 but not necessarily of a homemade treat made by a doting mother.I mostly recall having chicken potpies when my mother didn\u2019t feel like cooking. We children, fascinated by anything that came from the freezer section of the supermarket, were always thrilled. We each had our own little pie, baked in its own diminutive aluminum foil pan. Even if it was generic, bland chicken stew (and it was) encased in not very distinctive pie dough, it seemed wonderful. There was something attractive about the pies\u2019 soggy bottoms, a contrast to the crisp tops.For me, the frozen potpie has long since lost its attractiveness, but I confess to sometimes longing for a made-from-scratch version. Fortunately, in the era of frozen pastry dough, it\u2019s not really very difficult to put together.Rather than create miniature pies, I make them like turnovers or hand pies, folding the dough over the filling, so you can hold them with your fingers. Sometimes they are large, for dinner; sometimes bite-size, with drinks for a party. To make the job go faster, I use store bought puff pastry, with this caveat: Buy the real stuff, made with butter (read the label).To make the filling, I roast whole chicken legs, then remove and chop the meat: much simpler than breaking down a whole chicken. Softened onions, a bit of thyme and a splash of chicken broth are all that\u2019s required, but a little cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche never hurts. I find mushrooms to be the best vegetable to combine with the chicken, rather than the usual suspects, but frozen peas are an option.This is an easy project, but you may want to approach it in stages. First, cook the chicken, as long as a day ahead. Make the filling when there is a convenient moment. The actual assembly and baking of the pies takes practically no time or effort. You can even freeze them, unbaked or baked in advance, to finish or reheat them at serving time if you wish.The result tastes very homemade, and it mostly is. The buttery aroma and flaky crust added by the puff pastry give the humble potpie a certain elegance.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Pomerol, Wines of Grandeur From Modest Estates", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourPOMEROL, France \u2014 The word Bordeaux connotes magnificent chateaus, aristocratic (or at least wealthy or corporate) landowners and wines that occasionally live up to their pretensions.But in the vine-covered countryside surrounding this sleepy village, where the tiniest undulation of the land constitutes a hill, another side of Bordeaux is on display.Here, the sort of corporate ownership, grandiose architecture and Herm\u00e8s-wearing executives you might find in the M\u00e9doc \u2014 home to many of the most famous Bordeaux estates \u2014 is practically nonexistent.Contrary to the common perception of Bordeaux, Pomerol is a land of small family estates run by vignerons, people who grow the grapes and make the wines. Even as the wines of Pomerol are celebrated in much of the world, and the best are among the most expensive on the planet, the region operates on an approachable, direct human scale that is rare in Bordeaux\u2019s exalted precincts.Back in the 20th century, Bordeaux was the gateway to the world of fine wine, a kind of academy for those who wanted to understand wine in all its manifestations. But over the last 25 years, Burgundy has replaced Bordeaux as a paradigm for how to think about wine, with its dirt-encrusted emphasis on small farmers and terroir. In contrast to Bordeaux\u2019s current image as a luxury brand, Burgundy has become a symbol of authenticity, even as its prices have skyrocketed.Yet here is Pomerol, the smallest of Bordeaux\u2019s most prestigious appellations, which some may insensitively describe as Burgundian.\u201cThese are not just family-owned estates, they are family-worked estates,\u201d said Omri Ram, who for the last five years has been with the Guinaudeau family at Ch\u00e2teau Lafleur, one of four Pomerol estates I visited during a quick two-day tour in early February.\u201cI wanted to know if I could manage it from A to Z and do everything all by myself,\u201d said Mr. Desmarty, who attributed this desire to \u201ca lack of humility,\u201d though he said it in the most self-effacing way.Merlot is superbly adapted to the region\u2019s rich clay and gravel soils. It yields wines that are characteristically lush and round, but also nuanced and fine-grained, unlike merlots from anywhere else.At Bourgneuf, the blend is about 90 percent merlot and 10 percent cabernet franc, or bouchet, as it is often called here. I tasted from a barrel of 2017 merlot that was pure, minerally and structured. Sadly, severe spring frosts cost Bourgneuf 20 percent of its crop last year.\u201cWe were lucky,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vayron, whose family has made wine at Bourgneuf for eight generations. \u201cSome lost 80 or even 100 percent.\u201dSince Ms. Vayron took charge of the winemaking in 2009, the Bourgneuf wines have become more focused and consistent. Recent vintages have been superb, elegant and tense, with aromas of violets and fine tannins. The 2014 vintage, in general, is one I love, classically structured with medium weight and precision, and the Bourgneuf is excellent. The \u201915s and \u201916s are a bit riper and rounder. While lovely, they will need longer aging for the baby fat to integrate.The generational transition is continuing at Gombaude-Guillot, where Olivier Techer, who trained as a cook and as a mixed martial artist, is taking over from his parents, Claire Laval and Dominique Techer. In the cellar, he is experimenting with amphorae (for aging) and has added barrels from Austria to the more typical French ones. But he has resolutely continued his mother\u2019s biodynamic regimen in the vineyard.Ms. Laval, an agronomist, took over the estate from her father. In 1992, she began to work organically.\u201cWe were alone in Pomerol \u2014 180 farmers, and we were alone,\u201d she recalled. \u201cNow, people are more receptive.\u201dIt\u2019s something to uncork while waiting for the Gombaude-Guillot wines, which do take some time to mature. A 2012 was tannic and structured, with earthy, mineral flavors just beginning to emerge. The tannins in a 2008 were just starting to soften.At Lafleur, where Jacques and Sylvie Guinaudeau took charge in 1985, the 11-acre vineyard has 11 different types of soil. The Guinaudeaus, along with their son, Baptiste; his wife, Julie; and now Mr. Ram, are engaged in a long-term project to precisely match the soil, grapes and viticulture, not merely for each parcel but seemingly for each vine.\u201cThe vineyard looks flat, but even tiny differences in altitude can be meaningful,\u201d Mr. Ram said. \u201cIt\u2019s a garden, you can do amazing things.\u201dMr. Ram was a sommelier in Israel when he decided he wanted to plunge more deeply into winemaking. He studied oenology and viticulture at Montpellier in southern France, began an internship at Lafleur, and never left. Like everybody else at Lafleur, Mr. Ram does not do one specific job, but a little bit of everything.One of the most unusual characteristics of Lafleur is the high percentage of cabernet franc in the vineyard, more than 50 percent, a proportion that is often reflected in the wine. A 2009, the only Lafleur I tasted, was perfumed with flowers, citrus and a smoky, almost sandalwood scent. It was fresh, harmonious and refined, with great finesse. It will keep for a long time.\u201cThere is no distinction between the place I work and the place I live,\u201d he said.His great-grandmother, a World War I widow, planted the vineyard as part of a mixed subsistence farm, and over the years the vines were rented out to others, until Mr. Desmarty decided he wanted to farm it himself. His first vintage was 2004.\u201cHer goal was to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cMine was to make wine for me and my friends.\u201dThe vineyard is 70 percent merlot, 20 percent cabernet franc and, unusually, 10 percent cabernet sauvignon, which Mr. Desmarty said helps with freshness and acidity in dry vintages.I love the Clos St.-Andr\u00e9 wines, which are focused and linear, with flavors and nuances emerging one after the other. I am especially smitten with the beautifully balanced, exquisite 2014. The 2013, an extremely difficult vintage in Bordeaux, is lean but ready to drink now, as the surrounding vintages age.\u201cIt\u2019s not my best, it\u2019s not my worst,\u201d Mr. Desmarty said, though he is proud of the wines he makes in difficult years. \u201cI don\u2019t care about vintages like 2009 and 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the worst winemaker could make good wine in those vintages. My work is more important in years like 2013.\u201dMerlot is often thought not to age well, but good Pomerol can last for years, especially classic Right Bank vintages, in which the grapes have good acidity and are not too ripe. At Bourgneuf, I drank a 1975 that was magnificent, complex and still fresh, seemingly younger than a 1990 and a 2000, much warmer vintages.Inevitably, some changes will come to Pomerol. Larger estates, some outside Pomerol, are on the lookout to snap up smaller holdings, while I have heard of new plantings of cabernet sauvignon and petit verdot in response to climate change. But the family estates, like Bourgneuf, are still intact.\u201cWe hope it will stay like this for a long time,\u201d Ms. Vayron said.Five Pomerol Producers Worth Seeking OutAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here Are the World\u2019s Virtual Currency Billionaires (or at Least They Were)", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile the list in Forbes magazine, which was assembled in recent weeks, identifies about 10 virtual currency billionaires, most of them were not billionaires by the time the feature went online on Wednesday morning. On Monday alone, the prices of many virtual currencies plummeted over 20 percent, before stabilizing on Tuesday.Since then, the price of Ripple\u2019s digital token, XRP, has fallen more than 80 percent. Forbes put Mr. Larsen\u2019s wealth at around $8 billion, but the same holdings were worth less than $6 billion by Wednesday.The list is a reminder of how the biggest gains in virtual currencies have been reaped by a small number of early adopters \u2014 despite the early promises that virtual currencies could democratize the financial system and spread wealth more evenly.For early virtual currency adopters like the people on the Forbes list, the recent price declines are not catastrophic. The price of Bitcoin is still up 600 percent from a year ago, and up 70,000 percent from when the Winklevoss twins began buying in 2012.Identifying the richest people in the secretive and paranoid virtual currency realm is far from easy; some of it is guesswork. Mr. Lubin, whom Forbes pegged as the second-wealthiest person in the virtual currency universe, illustrates the difficulties. He told the magazine that he had begun selling his Ethereum tokens, known as Ether, last year to fund his business, ConsenSys. Because Forbes could not verify his holdings, the magazine put his wealth at between $1 billion and $5 billion before the most recent price declines.The normal Forbes billionaires list is easier to compile because the richest people in the world generally have most of their wealth tied up in stock holdings, which usually have to be disclosed for big public companies. With virtual currencies, it is not necessary to disclose your identity, and the system was created by people who were interested in protecting financial privacy.Many large holders of virtual currencies are loath to acknowledge their holdings for privacy and security reasons, and many people who are rumored to have giant Bitcoin stockpiles are not on the Forbes list.The list suggests that inventing virtual currencies can end up being less lucrative than investing in them. The magazine estimated that the inventor of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is less wealthy than two early investors, Mr. Lubin and Anthony Di Iorio, who had previously managed his family\u2019s patio-door business in Canada.And while three big holders of Ripple\u2019s token, XRP, are on the list, the inventor of the digital token, Jed McCaleb, is not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why We Need a New \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 44______Pedro Almod\u00f3var shapes how we think of Spain. England will forever be \u201cMonty Python\u201d and \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d for many of us, while the American extremes \u2014 optimism, violence, humor and despair \u2014 are all visible via Hollywood.So what does \u201cCrocodile Dundee\u201d say about Australia?I watched the movie again last night, for the first time since its release in 1986. I was just a kid then and thought nothing of laughing at Paul Hogan\u2019s knife or his cluelessness about escalators and elevators in New York.Now, though, it\u2019s all a bit jarring.Dundee is still the highest-grossing Australian film of all time. He\u2019s the character many Americans most associate with this country, and yet the depiction of Australia (not to mention New York and journalism, given the reporters in limos) needs some serious updating.I was one of many who saw the clips and got excited. Joining Danny McBride as the son of Dundee were Australia\u2019s biggest stars, including Margot Robbie, Chris Hemsworth, Russell Crowe, and Hugh Jackman.The trailer\u2019s premise \u2014 the foolish Americanized son of an Australian legend returns to the bush \u2014 also suggested a chance to poke fun at Americans and American assumptions about Australia. Bring it, I thought.But what looked like a summer film was actually a setup for a Super Bowl ad. Tourism Australia duped us all, aiming directly at America\u2019s love for the Dundee story, with the goal of exploiting it.And it seems to be working.\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying to North America is you\u2019re welcome in our country and we want you to visit,\" he said. \u201cThat character really does bring that to the fore in a way that no other character has really done before.\u201dPerhaps. It\u2019s true that Dundee is quite welcoming to the visiting American reporter played by Linda Kozlowski (Hogan ended up marrying her in real life) and there\u2019s clearly something deeper going on with Dundee and Aussie identity.More than anything else, he seems to represent the newly proud Australian, the man who doesn\u2019t apologize for not being born English, who relishes his own, very pronounced accent and vocabulary, and who celebrates skepticism and the old, frontier values, more or less simultaneously.Regardless, here\u2019s a related question: Is there a \u201cCrocodile Dundee\u201d for today? A character or story that embodies how Australia sees itself now?It\u2019s one thing to use Dundee to reintroduce Americans to Australia. Good on ya for that, especially if it means gaining a deeper understanding of the place through visiting.But ad-driven nostalgia is a sticky wicket. In the actual movie, I saw quite a bit more than what many Americans and Australians might recall.Hogan\u2019s performance, closely observed, is unlike what he did for Tourism Australia as a spokesman before the film \u2014 he\u2019s not just a breezy larrikin.His Dundee in America is more complicated, revealing in his facial expressions a fair amount of anxiety and awkwardness as he wanders through New York.The Australia that he embodied in the \u201980s was not yet a middle power, or middle-power plus as Australia is sometimes known today.

{"Headline": "Finding a Lost Strain of Rice, and Clues to Slave Cooking", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "The search for the missing grain led to Trinidad and Thomas Jefferson, and now excitement among African-American chefs.Supported byCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Among the biologists, geneticists and historians who use food as a lens to study the African diaspora, rice is a particularly deep rabbit hole. So much remains unknown about how millions of enslaved Africans used it in their kitchens and how it got to those kitchens to begin with.That\u2019s what made the hill rice in Trinidad such a find.The fat, nutty grain, with its West African lineage and tender red hull, was a favored staple for Southern home cooks during much of the 19th century. Unlike Carolina Gold, the versatile rice that until the Civil War was America\u2019s primary rice crop, the hill rice hadn\u2019t made Lowcountry plantation owners rich off the backs of slaves.It didn\u2019t need to be planted in watery fields surrounded by dikes, which meant that those who grew it weren\u2019t dogged by malaria. You could grow it in a garden patch, as did many of the slaves who had been taken from the rice-growing regions of West Africa. This was the rice of their ancestors, sustaining slaves and, later, generations of Southern cooks both black and white.That\u2019s why B.J. Dennis, a Gullah chef from Charleston, was stunned to find the rice growing in a field in Trinidad, tended by a farmer descended from slaves who once lived in Georgia.But then, on a rainy morning in the Trinidad hills in December 2016, he walked past coconut trees and towering okra plants to the edge of a field with ripe stalks of rice, each grain covered in a reddish husk and sprouting spiky tufts.\u201cHere I am looking at this rice and I said: \u2018Wow. Wait a minute. This is that rice that\u2019s missing,\u2019\u201d he said.It is hard to overstate how shocked the people who study rice were to learn that the long-lost American hill rice was alive and growing in the Caribbean. Horticulturists at the Smithsonian Institution want to grow it, rice geneticists at New York University are testing it and the United States Department of Agriculture is reviewing it. If all goes well, it may become a commercial crop in America, and a menu staple as diners develop a deeper appreciation for African-American food.\u201cWhat I am doing is searching for my culture through food,\u201d he said.It begins during the War of 1812, when British soldiers promised land and freedom to a small group of West African slaves along the Eastern Seaboard if they would take up arms against their masters. They did, and each was given 16 acres of undeveloped land in southern Trinidad. They came to be called the Merikins, a Creole rendering of the word American.One group was the Fourth British Marine Company, from the Georgia Sea Islands. The rice, which Dr. Shields believes can be traced to Jefferson\u2019s barrel of seed, was among the crops the group brought with them to Trinidad.The missing piece of the puzzle would have not been found if it hadn\u2019t been for Trinidadian ethnobotanist Francis Morean, a man with Merikin roots who has recorded interviews with most of the 60 or so Merikins still growing hill rice on the island.Mr. Morean had traveled to the American South in September 2015 as part of his exploration of African diaspora cooking. He had heard about Mr. Dennis, but wasn\u2019t able to find him. Then, a few months later, Mr. Dennis reached out to him on Facebook, and the two bonded over their interest in using agriculture to keep their shared heritage alive.Still, no one had made the connection between the rice in Trinidad and the rice that had been lost in the American South. Most students of Gullah-Geechee cuisine thought Carolina Gold was the only rice that enslaved Africans in the coastal South had cooked.On that wet morning in Moruga, Trinidad, he had his answer.\u201cWhen I got out of the car and walked toward the field and saw the rice just about to be harvested, I knew it had to be the real thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like you see the story made flesh. You see something that has existed as really an abstract possibility suddenly become real.\u201dThe rice performs differently in the kitchen than Carolina Gold, which works best in wet or creamy recipes like Hoppin\u2019 John or risotto. Hill rice is better dry, with an okra stew or a saut\u00e9 or chutney piled on top.Mr. Jordan is so enamored that he is trying to find farmers in the Northwest to grow it, once the seed is approved by the Agriculture Department.\u201cIf we can bring this back,\u201d he said, \u201cthe historical back story could deepen the development of African diaspora food in America and better tell the real story of Southern food.\u201dAt another rice symposium held by the Carolina Rice Foundation in April, Mr. Dennis prepared hill rice for everyone. He cooked it the way he had learned to during his time in Trinidad, simmering it in coconut water until the rice became starchy. Then he covered the rice with chutney made from grinding toasted benne seeds; an herb called shadow benne that is similar to cilantro; some bird\u2019s-eye peppers, and garlic with a little oil. It was delicious.Like many a detective story, this one has some loose ends.That discovery was concrete evidence of the high level of rice-growing knowledge among African slaves, and marked the first time genetics had been used to pinpoint the origin of a slave crop in the Americas.It turned out not to be indigenous African glaberrima, but more likely a Japonica rice that made its way from Southeast Asia to West Africa between the 16th and 18th centuries.Amy Lawton-Rauh, a Clemson University professor of genetics and biochemistry who is working on the genetics of hill rice, is using population genomics tools to test whether the hill rice has a more complex history. It could even be a hybrid, she said, and not necessarily linked to Jefferson\u2019s rice.\u201cIt might be too much to just give credit to Jefferson,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cWe know about him because we have records. But people miss just how big rice was, and how much money was involved and how much history we have no written record of.\u201dMr. Twitty, who first heard about the rice from Mr. Dennis, has embraced it. It fits in nicely with his work, which includes researching the links between Southern food and West African cooking.For the event, Mr. Twitty used it as the base for a chicken stew, made in the style of the Mende people of Sierra Leone, that he cooked with palm oil, onions and garlic. \u201cI don\u2019t really like brown rice at all, but it\u2019s not like that,\u201d he said.His appreciation goes beyond taste: The rice helps validate the African experience in America. \u201cIt\u2019s another living artifact that automatically wipes out any nonsense about the earliest years of African-American food,\u201d he said.For now, no one is growing the rice commercially, but Dr. Shields and Mr. Roberts hope it will be embraced by Gullah farmers, and spread from there. In the meantime, they hope to find an economical way to import it from growers in Trinidad.For Mr. Dennis, the chef, a steady supply would ensure that his purloos, like the rice-and-okra dish called Limpin\u2019 Susan (often referred to as the cousin or wife of Hoppin\u2019 John), would have a new dimension.He also hopes that the rice will eventually sell at a price that most cooks can afford, and that African-American home cooks will come to see the hill rice and other traditional dishes as healthier alternatives to a popular perception of soul food.\u201cWe\u2019ve been warped into thinking it\u2019s mac-and-cheese and collard greens,\u201d he said.African-American cooking, at least as defined in the Lowcountry, is about slow-cooked peas and vegetables and specific strains of rice, he said.\u201cCulturally, this rice is a hidden story of the African-American and enslaved narrative,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of our ancestors were not able to read or write, so a lot of stories aren\u2019t able to be told. But we can cook this rice, and we can tell the story.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the chef at Junebaby in Seattle. He is Edouardo Jordan, not Eduardo. The article also misstated the year in which Mr. Jordan opened the restaurant. It was 2017, not 2016.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Parkland Massacre Thrusts Guns Into the Midterm Spotlight", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In Minnesota, a Democratic candidate for governor with rural roots is running from his past affiliation with the National Rifle Association. In South Florida, endangered House Republicans are embracing an assault weapons ban.And in Ohio, the moderate Democratic candidate for governor, feeling heat from his left, is embracing a more stringent gun-violence platform than his past relations with the N.R.A. would suggest.A host of House Republicans and a handful of the party\u2019s governors are beginning to distance themselves from their party\u2019s gun-rights orthodoxy, signaling an openness to restrictions that reflects the rising anger among suburban voters. But Democrats are under even more pressure from within to recalibrate their position on the issue. Even as they attempt to reclaim governorships and congressional seats in red-tinged regions, moderates recognize that bearing the mark of the N.R.A. could be fatal in their primaries.\u201cI\u2019ve always respected law-abiding citizens\u2019 right to be responsible gun owners and many people in Ohio feel strongly about that,\u201d said Richard Cordray, the leading Democratic candidate for governor in Ohio and former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who first must beat the left-wing candidate, Dennis Kucinich, for the nomination. \u201cBut I also think people with their eyes and ears open are seeing some of these tragedies, of all different kinds in our society, and thinking we need to do more.\u201dIn recent years, both major parties have honored something of a nonaggression pact. As the Republican Party\u2019s moderates thinned out, few Republicans strayed from the gun-rights line, and Democrats in competitive regions deliberately avoided making guns central, fearing that it was far more of a voting issue for gun advocates than gun control supporters. In Congress and in most states, gun policy was largely kept off the legislative agenda.But with mass shootings becoming agonizingly routine, and Americans demanding action after 17 Florida teenagers and faculty members were murdered on Valentine\u2019s Day, this election may be more like 1994, when an assault weapons ban thrust guns to the fore.\u201cThis is a tipping point,\u201d said Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, the head of the Democratic Governors Association and one of those lawmakers who lost his House seat after voting for the 1994 ban. \u201cI think what people are looking for is more independent thought and less slavish devotion to the N.R.A.\u201dOn the Republican side, Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, who runs the Republican Governors Association but does not have to run again, gave his party a blunt warning about the political challenge staring it in the face: voters \u201cparticularly among suburban women,\u201d are mobilizing for gun control.\u201cWhen you have something put into stark dramatization like Florida, then I think that gets people\u2019s attention. And they say, \u2018There\u2019s got to be certain things we can do,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Haslam, who called for raising the age limit on gun purchases over the N.R.A.\u2019s opposition.Yet it was not at all clear whether Congress will take up a gun control measure anytime soon. Before a planned bipartisan gun summit meeting on Wednesday at the White House, Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters on Tuesday that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be banning guns for law-abiding citizens.\u201dHe indicated that lawmakers would focus on narrow measures and added, \u201cWe also want to make sure that we protect people\u2019s due process rights and legal constitutional rights while making sure that people who should not get guns don\u2019t get them.\u201dThe political peril for each party lies in divergent parts of the country: For Republicans, ignoring voters\u2019 fears about gun violence could take a pronounced toll in the House, where the party is defending several dozen districts around major cities \u2014 including Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Diego \u2014 where Mr. Trump is deeply disliked and the N.R.A. has little following to speak of.On the Democratic side, it is in the more rural states \u2014 key to Democrats\u2019 hopes in Senate and governors\u2019 races \u2014 where Democratic supporters of gun rights have scrambled to react. In some cases, the rapidly shifting conversation on guns has collided with primary elections that party leaders like Mr. Inslee are hoping do not grow too nasty.In 2018, Democrats\u2019 ability to compete in statewide elections in the Midwest and in the South may depend on candidates\u2019 ability to court gun owners, many of whom fiercely oppose new regulations. Until recently, liberal Democrats largely tolerated such overtures as a political necessity. Just last week, Conor Lamb, a Democrat running a tenacious special election campaign in a conservative House district in southwestern Pennsylvania, rebuffed calls for new gun laws after the Parkland shooting.When a gunman walked into a Florida school on Feb. 14, his rifle let him fire in much the same way that many American soldiers and Marines would fire M16 and M4 rifles in combat.But the grim spectacle of students, churchgoers and concert attendees being killed by individuals wielding military-style semiautomatic rifles has mobilized gun control advocates in a new way \u2014 and pushed even red- and purple-state Democrats to move abruptly in their direction.Some who have in the past sought to placate the N.R.A. are now attempting to make amends with the left: In Minnesota, Representative Tim Walz, a Democratic candidate for governor embroiled in a contested primary, posted an apologetic note on Facebook after the Parkland shooting, endorsing an assault weapons ban and acknowledging \u201ccriticisms from those who take issue with my past campaign contributions from the N.R.A.\u201dMr. Walz, a military veteran from rural southern Minnesota whom the N.R.A. has endorsed in the past, said he is now determined to \u201cget the N.R.A. out of the way, and get us to the common-sense solutions that we all agree on.\u201dBut his Democratic opponents see an opening.\u201cIt has become a huge issue,\u201d said Rebecca Otto, the Democratic state auditor. \u201cThe only thing that has changed about Congressman Walz is he\u2019s now running for governor.\u201dIn South Carolina, State Representative James Smith, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for governor, has faced attacks in the primary race from a businessman, Phil Noble, for having received an \u201cA\u201d rating from the N.R.A. for several years. In Ohio, Mr. Cordray unveiled a more stringent gun violence platform last week amid criticism from Mr. Kucinich of his past relationship with the N.R.A.Mr. Cordray said in an interview that the Parkland shooting had prompted a reassessment of existing policies even among people who back broader gun rights. He has called for greatly expanded background checks and said lawmakers should \u201crethink\u201d regulation of assault weapons, stopping short of demanding an outright ban. Mr. Cordray also cautioned that there are many voters in rural areas who \u201cfeel strongly about the Second Amendment and their right to have guns for hunting, for self-defense.\u201dIn Florida, Gwen Graham, whose primary political calling card has been her ability to win over Republican voters, wasted no time calling for new gun regulations after the Parkland shooting, including a suspension on sales of AR-15 rifles. But Ms. Graham, who previously represented a conservative stretch of the state\u2019s panhandle in Congress, will surely face scrutiny in her primary for making more pro-gun comments when she was a congressional candidate facing opposition from the N.R.A.Even before the Florida shooting, however, the ranks of staunchly N.R.A.-aligned Democrats had dwindled to the point of near-extinction. After the party\u2019s losses in the 2010 and 2014 elections, only a small group of Democrats from rural, solidly Republican areas remain in Congress. Of the five Senate Democrats who voted against a 2013 bill to expand background checks for gun purchasers, just one \u2014 Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2014 is still in office.But even in Texas, which has a gun culture that can be traced to its founding, the tide in the party is running clearly in the direction of gun restrictions. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, a Democrat challenging Senator Ted Cruz, acknowledged his support for banning assault weapons would probably not poll well.But, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right, and people need to know where you are on these issues.\u201dOn the Republican side, uniformity on the gun issue has been just as pronounced. Only three Senate Republicans still in office voted for the 2013 background-check bill, drafted by Senators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, after the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.Yet the Florida shooting has plainly caused some Republicans to rethink the issue, or at least to buy time until they can assess whether this latest outcry will fade.In New Jersey, Jay Webber, a Republican state legislator who is running to succeed Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a retiring Republican, said voters are demanding an \u201copen\u201d conversation on guns. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a desire to do something,\u201d said Mr. Webber, who has been backed by gun-rights activists in the past.A handful of congressional Republicans have made more determined gestures in the direction of gun regulation over the past two weeks. Representative Brian Mast of Florida, a Republican from near Parkland, and Carlos Curbelo, an endangered Republican in Miami, endorsed an assault weapons ban. Five Republicans from competitive districts are sponsoring a Democratic bill to authorize federal research into gun violence.Sometimes, said Gov. Ralph S. Northam of Virginia, who ran unapologetically on gun control and routed his Republican rival last year, \u201cYou have to be slapped in the face.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018Brotopia,\u2019 Silicon Valley Disrupts Everything but the Boys\u2019 Club", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesBeware the callow misfit who becomes part of the ruling class; rather than disrupt the social order that excluded him, he might just reap its spoils for himself.A number of the men depicted in Emily Chang\u2019s \u201cBrotopia: Breaking Up the Boys\u2019 Club of Silicon Valley\u201d seem to be making up for lost experience, using their newfound wealth and power to get whatever it is they had previously been denied \u2014 mainly stuff, status and sex. \u201cFrom its earliest days,\u201d Chang writes, \u201cthe industry has self-selected for men: first, antisocial nerds, then, decades later, self-confident and risk-taking bros.\u201dThis is more than a work force issue, and \u201cBrotopia\u201d is more than a business book. Silicon Valley holds extraordinary power over our present lives as well as whatever utopia (or nightmare) might come next. \u201cIf robots are going to run the world, or at the very least play a hugely critical role in our future, men shouldn\u2019t be programming them alone,\u201d Chang writes. \u201cThe scarcity of women in an industry that is so forcefully reshaping our culture simply cannot be allowed to stand.\u201dChang, the host and executive producer of the television show \u201cBloomberg Technology,\u201d is on to something important, even if her book doesn\u2019t quite do it justice. Some of the writing is blander than it needs to be, and she has a soft spot for worthy proclamations.But she is clearly engaged with and often incensed by her subject, and the best parts of \u201cBrotopia\u201d are those moments when she actively resists the \u201cit\u2019s all good\u201d ethos of the Bay Area and cuts down chauvinism with the disdain it deserves.The book includes a blistering chapter about the venture capitalist Peter Thiel and the self-styled PayPal Mafia \u2014 an all-male clique of company alumni who fund one another\u2019s business ventures. Thiel and a group of mostly conservative classmates from Stanford later founded PayPal and boasted about their entrepreneurial success, casting it as a vindication of their hiring strategy. None of the company\u2019s first engineers were women. As one founder admits, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know any.\u201dThe adulation of Sandberg gets surprisingly personal. Chang describes being pregnant with her first child in 2012, doubting her \u201cability to succeed as a working mom,\u201d and emailing Sandberg out of gratitude for her willingness to step into the fray. \u201cI gasped aloud when, 30 seconds later, Sandberg\u2019s reply hit my inbox.\u201dOne might have hoped that this intimacy would at least generate some pointed insights or candid quotes. But Sandberg gives Chang her well-worn lines about trickle-down feminism. \u201cWomen in leadership will help create the environment for more women in leadership,\u201d Sandberg tells her, in a sentence that sounds about as spontaneous as a TED Talk. \u201cWomen will create the institutional change we need.\u201d\u201cI believe this will happen,\u201d Chang writes. This credulity is as disappointing as it is puzzling. As her own reporting shows, Google found it hard to scale its good intentions as it grew, and last year it reported numbers comparable to the rest of the industry, with women accounting for less than a third of its work force and only 25 percent of its leadership roles. Google had regressed to the mean \u2014 and the mean, as it stands, isn\u2019t great for women.That last detail gave me pause, if only for how trite it is. As Chang herself wonders, \u201cIf these sexual adventurers are so progressive, why do these parties seem to lean so heavily toward male heterosexual fantasies?\u201d The party scenes she depicts are as poignant and depressing as \u201cRevenge of the Nerds.\u201d For all their talk of innovation, these entrepreneurs can\u2019t throw an orgy without resorting to clich\u00e9s.\u201cYou may think you\u2019re Steve Jobs, but really you\u2019re Roger Ailes or Bill O\u2019Reilly with a Bernie Sanders tattoo.\u201d That\u2019s one of the best quotes in \u201cBrotopia,\u201d and it\u2019s from Elisabeth Sheff, a polyamory expert. Bold new world; same old patriarchy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Respect First, Then Gun Control", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis has been an emotional week. We greet tragedies like the school shooting in Florida with shock, sadness, mourning and grief that turns into indignation and rage. The anger inevitably gets directed at the N.R.A., those who support gun rights, and the politicians who refuse to do anything while children die.Many of us walked this emotional path. But we may end up doing more harm than good. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned, it is that guns have become a cultural flash point in a nation that is unequal and divided. The people who defend gun rights believe that snobbish elites look down on their morals and want to destroy their culture. If we end up telling such people that they and their guns are despicable, they will just despise us back and dig in their heels.So if you want to stop school shootings it\u2019s not enough just to vent and march. It\u2019s necessary to let people from Red America lead the way, and to show respect to gun owners at all points. There has to be trust and respect first. Then we can strike a compromise on guns as guns, and not some sacred cross in the culture war.My Times colleague April Lawson has gotten involved with Better Angels and has been reporting back on its techniques.One of the most successful parts of the structured conversations is built around stereotypes. Doherty, the head moderator, asks the people at each gathering to name five major stereotypes that the other side throws at them. The Republicans invariably list \u201cracist\u201d first, followed by, say, \u201cuncaring,\u201d \u201cuneducated,\u201d \u201cmisogynistic\u201d and \u201cscience deniers.\u201dIn a session Lawson attended, a Trump supporter acknowledged that the G.O.P. has had a spotty record on racial matters, but it\u2019s important to him that Blues know that\u2019s not why he holds his opinions.Doherty says that the Reds feel shamed by the Blues to a much greater degree than the Blues realize. Reds are very reluctant to enter into a conversation with Blues, for fear of further shaming, but they often come to the table when they are told that this will be a chance to \u201cde-monsterize\u201d themselves.At that session one Blue said she was really grateful to hear a Red acknowledge the Republican history on race. When Blues are asked about the stereotypes thrown at them, they tend to list \u201cagainst religion and morality,\u201d \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and \u201cagainst personal responsibility\u201d among their responses. They, too, relish the chance to clear the air.After the stereotypes are discussed, the room feels different. As one Red in Ohio told Lawson, \u201cI think we are all pretty clear on one thing: Don\u2019t tell us who we are and what we think.\u201d Another Red was moved almost to tears by the damage categories do. \u201cWe\u2019re not just cookie-cutter people; we\u2019re individuals. Just because you don\u2019t like something, you don\u2019t have to ridicule it \u2014 you probably don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone\u2019s heart is full up with something, and then you demean it without even listening to them \u2014 I hate that.\u201dIn another exercise, Reds and Blues ask each other honest, nonleading questions. Blues may ask Reds, \u201cName a safety-net program you can support.\u201d Reds may ask Blues, \u201cHow do you balance having a heart with keeping health care costs under control?\u201dBy the end of the conversations, the atmosphere has changed. Nearly always somebody will say that the discussion was easy because only moderates were in the room, not the people who post crazy stuff on Facebook. The staff tries not to smile, knowing that some of the people were selected precisely because of the intense stuff they posted on Facebook.\u201cThis is not a civility organization,\u201d Blankenhorn told Lawson. Better Angels is aiming to build a group of people whose personal bonds with their fellow citizens redefine how they engage in the political system.We don\u2019t really have policy debates anymore. We have one big tribal conflict, and policy fights are just proxy battles as each side tries to establish moral superiority. But just as the tribal mentality has been turned on, it can be turned off. Then and only then can we go back to normal politics and take reasonable measures to keep our children safe.Michelle Goldberg is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macron Aims to Keep Migrants, and Far Right, at Bay in France", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 European countries from Poland to Italy and Britain are shutting borders, stepping up deportations and making unsavory deals with warlords in Libya to restrict migrants. Now comes France\u2019s turn.The government of President Emmanuel Macron this week put forward a draft law that even some of his own supporters said was too harsh. Human rights groups say it is intended to make it easier to expel would-be asylum seekers.But in presenting the proposal this week, Mr. Macron\u2019s interior minister, Gerard Collomb, made no bones about its other aim: to head off the political challenge of the far right.The migrant issue \u201cis a problem that can lead to difficulties\u201d \u2014 meaning political difficulties \u2014 he told reporters on Wednesday, before getting into the details of the law.The new law, while limited in scope, would make it somewhat tougher for those who enter France illegally. They would have less time to apply for asylum and half as much time to appeal if their applications are rejected.The measure is almost certain to win approval after debate in April, given Mr. Macron\u2019s large parliamentary majority. More than 60 percent of French people say there are too many immigrants in France.Indeed, the law is the offspring of two pressing realities in French politics. Last year, the country saw 100,000 asylum seekers, a record. And the runner-up in the presidential election was Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front, whose theme was immigrant-bashing.The National Front has not gone away, although it is much weakened, and it is still singing the same song. Its spokesman Sebastien Chenu called the law a \u201cfraud\u201d this week, said \u201cthe government is organizing migratory subversion.\u201d It promised something much tougher.Mr. Macron knows that his principal political challenge in the years ahead will come from the millions of discontented voters who opted for Ms. Le Pen last year. He is trying to use the momentum of his still-young presidency to deny the far-right its favorite issue.But the reaction on the left and among immigrant aid groups was equally strong, which suggests that Mr. Macron may have hit his target.\u201cIt\u2019s a law that will mean a very sharp setback for human rights,\u201d said Jean-Claude Mas of Cimade, a leading refugee-aid organization in France. \u201cAbove all it is aimed at greater control of, and expulsion of, humans.\u201dThe proposed law is likely to toughen the lives of would-be asylum seekers.\u201cIt multiplies the cases in which detention is possible,\u201d said Marie-Aim\u00e9e Peyron, head of the Paris bar, in an interview.Others agreed.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get over this \u2018Le Penization\u2019 factor,\u201d said Olivier Faure, the head of the Socialists in Parliament, in a Facebook post. \u201cFear has had the upper hand over reason for too long.\u201dThe rhetoric may not match the text, however.Those who enter France illegally would now only have 90 days to apply for asylum, instead of the current 120.If the demand is rejected, asylum seekers would have only 15 days to appeal, instead of a month. Those deemed ineligible and ordered to leave France could be held in \u201cadministrative detention\u201d for 90 days, with extensions possible, instead of the current 45 days, before being expelled.Applications for asylum would be treated in six months by the French authorities, instead of the current 14 months.Mr. Collomb, the interior minister, insisted the new law was \u201cbalanced and completely aligned with European law,\u201d pointing out the similarities between the French proposal and legislation elsewhere in Europe.\u201cWe will have the same types of procedures as other European countries,\u201d he said.But France doesn\u2019t see itself in the same way as its European neighbors. \u201cIf the fatherland of the rights of man doesn\u2019t vigorously oppose this law, I just don\u2019t understand anything anymore,\u201d said Mrs. Peyron.Advertisement"}

Because I came from the owner\u2019s family, I had access. I really loved to go up into the projection room. I would hang out in the ticket booth.\u201d Her search for movie houses in Varanasi, Delhi, Kolkata, and Chennai, led her to discover that some of these theaters, once packed with boisterous crowds, were shuttered or struggling to stay open. Built largely during the first half of the 20th century, their popularity began to wane as home video emerged in the 1990s and multiplexes became popular a decade later.Ms. Raman\u2019s photographs show spaces that are paradoxically majestic and intimate: Once luxurious interiors replete with towering screens, grand staircases and opulent lobbies were designed to make going to the movies both personal and fleeting. \u201cThere was a grandness to the cinema making and going experience in India,\u201d Ms. Raman said. \u201cThese theaters were huge. They had capacities of 600, even 1200 people. The screens were really big. But the nature of films and their subject matter invited you to escape into darkness, into a make believe world.\u201d Immensely popular both at home and eventually globally, the Indian cinema supported a range of genres and subject matter, from romantic musicals and social realist explorations of urban working class life to period dramas and coming-of-age films. \u201cCinema Play House\u201d chronicles a slowly-dying culture known for its eccentricity and originality. The photographs underscore the grandeur, individuality and decline of these movie palaces: the huge screen and cavernous interior of a now crumbling building; the lush carpeting in an abandoned theater lobby; a mammoth film projector surrounded by detritus; tall stacks of film cans in a makeshift storage area; the shattered glass of a ticket booth; or the elaborate murals of a once palatial movie hall.Ms. Raman\u2019s elegiac pictures may be largely devoid of people, but they resonate with the evocative ghostlike traces of that once-vibrant community of passionate moviegoers entranced by these idiosyncratic buildings. While she photographed workers and a few audience members, she edited out most of these images from the series, resulting in pictures that are stilled and silent but also pulsing with life and history. Ms. Raman sees these photographs as a window into the inner lives of theater owners, too, who often helped to design their own buildings, in contrast to today\u2019s cookie-cutter corporate multiplexes. \u201cThey didn\u2019t follow a template and each cinema was unique,\u201d she noted in an artist statement. \u201cThese theaters seemed to contain cues to the psyche of the people who built it and who occupy it.\u201d Her images show those quirks: a row of mismatched seats; a huge circular window that mirrors the shape of the film reels in front of it; a portrait of Vladimir Lenin adjacent to a fire extinguisher; or the marble parquetry of a palatial lobby.Ms. Raman\u2019s photographs also speak to the central role that movies have played in the life of a nation that is home to the world\u2019s most prolific film industry. The decline of single-screen theaters coincided with the passing of the era when film emerged as a dominant creative force in India, culminating in what is widely regarded as the golden age of popular cinema in the 1950s. During this time, filmmakers offered eager audiences a popular visual art that sometimes also addressed the social realities of a nation, from the caste system to the role of women. In the end, the film industry inspired Indian society as much as it reflected it \u2014 from sparking trends in popular culture and fashion to influencing public attitudes about spirituality, relationships, social mores and politics. Commenting on its broad impact, then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru observed in 1955 that \u201cthe influence of the films in India is greater than the influence of newspapers and books combined.\u201d Ms. Raman, who now lives in New York, laments the fading of this vital and distinctive culture, acknowledging the global forces and corporate interests that have transformed the Indian film industry. \u201cWhen I went into the more modern multiplexes in these cities, I could not find anything to hold on to,\u201d she said. \u201cThe single screen theaters were much more generous in telling their age and story to me.\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

{"Headline": "Gun Smoke and Mirrors", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs I watched President Trump blathering to a group of governors on Monday about throwing people who have not committed a crime into mental hospitals to prevent mass shootings at schools, I recalled a country where I once lived in which the government had that power \u2014 the Soviet Union.From the mid-1960s until the fall of Soviet Communism, the Kremlin employed the notion of \u201csluggish schizophrenia\u201d \u2014 dreamed up by the Mengele-like psychiatrist Andrei Snezhnevsky \u2014 to imprison people on the ground that they were on their way to becoming insane.Rejected by most civilized nations as a transparent fraud, sluggish schizophrenia was used against dissidents and other citizens who simply dared to seek exit visas. When I worked in Moscow as a reporter in the mid-1980s, I knew an Estonian man who was committed twice for refusing to enter the Red Army during the war in Afghanistan, an act of sanity. It was a literal Catch-22.Now comes Trump, urging the nation\u2019s governors to return to a time when he said the states could \u201cnab\u201d people and throw them in a padded room because \u201csomething was off.\u201dIn fact, the law has required court-ratified findings of actual mental illness for involuntary commitment since around 1881, said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s medical school. \u201cIt was never the case that people could be involuntary committed for being a little odd, or even for that matter thought to be dangerous to other people unless they had evidence of mental illness,\u201d he said.I\u2019m not bringing this up to suggest that Trump is a disciple of Snezhnevsky, despite his bizarre affinity for Kremlin autocracy, or merely to point out that the president was once again making things up. Rather, it is an example of the incoherent, insincere and inadequate ways in which the president and others on the right are suddenly claiming to be dedicated to addressing the nation\u2019s epidemic of gun violence.They are playing a cynical game of misdirection.It is tragic that in recent decades, states have closed mental hospitals and thrown people into prisons when they should be receiving psychiatric care. But that has little to do with gun violence \u2014 in or out of schools, on a small or mass scale.Similarly, the president\u2019s newfound support for banning bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic weapons to be fired nearly as rapidly as automatic ones, is fine, on the surface. But bump stocks could have been banned at any time before or since a killer used them to murder 58 people in Las Vegas last fall, and Trump has done nothing to make it happen.Some politicians \u2014 so far not including Trump or the Republican leadership in Congress \u2014 are calling for raising the age to buy a semiautomatic weapon to 21 from 18. (The person charged with the murders in Parkland, Fla., this month was 19.)There should be such a law, on a national basis and not state by state, but Everytown found that only 5 percent of the mass shooters it studied were under 20. And of course, mass shooting victims account for a tiny percentage of the Americans gunned down every year. A majority of children killed by guns are killed by accident, or by their own hand, or by adults, with weapons legally obtained by adults.Trump also chimed in on calls from the right to arm more teachers and train them to shoot would-be killers. It\u2019s an absurd and dangerous idea. Highly trained police officers frequently miss their targets, even at close range, in the heat of the moment. Having armed civilians at a shooting scene would just make their jobs harder.The real problem with gun violence is not about mental hospitals, armed teachers, bump stocks or age requirements. The real problem is that there are far too many firearms in America \u2014 more than 300 million, according to Congress. They are too easy to obtain and they are becoming ever more lethal.But the gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association, has stopped every effort to reduce the number and lethality of firearms, a crusade that seems as much or more about expanding the markets for firearms makers than about constitutional principles.Banning the possession of semiautomatic weapons by civilians would be a better approach. So would repealing lax concealed-carry laws, stand-your-ground laws and other rules that are proliferating around America to make it easier to shoot someone and get away with it.The risk is that the passage of a few partial measures will take our eyes off the bigger picture and drain the energy out of the demands for change led by young people after the Parkland slaughter. That is what the gun lobby is counting on.Advertisement"}

In elementary school, his teachers had him draw posters and write essays against the communists.Now, in an emotional homecoming he could never have imagined, Mr. Lee has returned to cover the Winter Games for The New York Times. Even harder to believe was the sight of a unified team of women hockey players from North and South Korea as they entered the stadium. \u201cWe are the same people,\u201d Mr. Lee said in a phone call from Korea this week. \u201cUnification will probably not happen anytime soon but we don\u2019t have to be literally unified to be able to communicate with our relatives on the other side and have activities together.\u201d \u201cI heard people screaming from their homes,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut I was just delivering the pizza.\u201dHe went on to study photography at New York University and landed a photo internship at The Times in 1994 before being promoted to staff photographer a few months later. And though he started with little knowledge of many American sports, he quickly became an expert sports photographer. He covered his first Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in 1998, where the spectacle and the drama motivated him to photograph as many Olympic Games as possible ever since.\u201cI love to cover the Olympics because it\u2019s really about human drama,\u201d he said. \u201cThese athletes go through extreme hardship and devote so much of their lives to compete in a short period of time that will define their career. To witness that and to be able to capture those moments is a great gift to me and a privilege to be able to do it.\u201d His obsession with capturing the perfect moment at the Olympics at times rivals the obsession of the athletes themselves. Two thirds of his job, he said, is making sure everything is working so he can actually take the pictures the rest of the time.At these Olympics, his focus will be on figure skating and ice hockey. Mr. Lee has set up two remote cameras at the skating arena and two more at the hockey rink. He had already scouted the figure skating venue in Pyeongchang a year ago in order to familiarize himself with the location. He also went to the American figure skating trials in order to study the athletes and their routines.Planning and patience may be the foundation, but once the event begins, instinct takes over. There is a purely meditative aspect to being a great sports photographer and a feeling of being solely in the moment.

Gen. H. R. McMaster, accused Moscow of engaging in a campaign of \u201cdisinformation, subversion and espionage\u201d that he said Washington would continue to expose.The evidence of a Russian effort to interfere in the election \u201cis now incontrovertible,\u201d General McMaster said at the Munich Security Conference, an annual meeting of European and American diplomats and security experts, including several senior Russian officials. On Friday, just hours before the indictment, the top White House official for cyberissues accused Russia of \u201cthe most destructive cyberattack in human history,\u201d against Ukraine last summer.Taken together, the statements appeared to mark a major turn in the administration\u2019s willingness to directly confront the government of President Vladimir V. Putin. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and C.I.A. Director Mike Pompeo also attended the Munich conference, and while they did not speak publicly, in private meetings with others here they reiterated similar statements.The comments highlighted a sharp division inside the administration about how to talk about the Russian covert efforts, with only Mr. Trump and a few of his close advisers holding back from acknowledging the Russian role or talking about a larger strategy to deter future attacks.The indictment characterized the cyberattacks and social media fraud as part of a larger effort by Russia to undermine the United States. A senior administration official called the effort to confront Russia \u201ca significant point of contention\u201d within the administration.After the indictment on Friday Mr. Trump declared in a Twitter post that \u201cthe results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong \u2014 no collusion!\u201d He made no mention of Russia as a \u201crevisionist power,\u201d the description used in his own National Security Strategy, or of the elaborate $1.2 million-a-month effort that the indictment indicated Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency spent in an effort to discredit the election system and ultimately to support his candidacy.Vice President Mike Pence, speaking this past week in Washington, misstated American intelligence conclusions about the election hacking, arguing \u201cit is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that none of those efforts had any effect on the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201d The intelligence chiefs have said they have not, and cannot, reach such a conclusion.Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, cited Mr. Pence\u2019s comments during the session here Saturday to make the case that Russia did nothing wrong. \u201cSo until we see the facts, everything else is just blabber,\u201d he said.The man who served as the Russian ambassador to the United States during the period covered by the indictments, Sergey I. Kislyak, picked up on a favorite theme of Mr. Trump\u2019s: questioning the credibility of the F.B.I. and intelligence agency assessments.\u201cI have seen so many indictments and accusations against Russians,\u201d Mr. Kislyak said on Saturday afternoon. \u201cI am not sure I can trust American law enforcement to be the most truthful source against Russians.\u201d He added, \u201cThe allegations being mounted against us are simply fantasies.\u201dMr. Kislyak, who has been caught up in the investigation because of meetings with Trump campaign officials during his time as ambassador, went on to cite a study, which he said he was keeping in his briefcase, that proved the \u201cmain source of computer attacks in the world is not Russia. It is the United States.\u201dThe accusations and counteraccusations about cyber- and social media attacks were the main point of division between the Americans and the Russians, but hardly the only ones expressed at the conference.Mr. Kislyak argued that the Trump administration\u2019s new nuclear strategy involved the manufacture of low-yield weapons and made nuclear war more probable. The Americans argued they were just matching Russian capabilities and charged that Moscow was in continued violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement, limiting tactical weapons.Yet the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and others, and the use of Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to spread propaganda, dominated the discussion and reflected how quickly the use of these techniques has become the new battleground in a very different kind of post-Cold War conflict.The White House cybercoordinator, Rob Joyce, was particularly direct in his accusations that Russia was behind the broad attack on Ukraine last June, called \u201cNotPetya.\u201d He described the attack as \u201cindiscriminate\u201d and noted that it paralyzed operations far beyond Ukraine, the intended target, and included the Maersk shipping system. He said the United States would retaliate, but did not say how, adding \u201cwe will not telegraph these punches.\u201dMr. Joyce is no newcomer to offensive cyberoperations; previously he ran the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency, overseeing American cyberaction against other counties. \u201cWe are going to conduct cyberoperations,\u201d he said. But \u201cwe need to do it in a responsible, balanced way.\u201dGeneral McMaster, in his comments, argued that Russia had bridged the partisan divides in the United States, citing a 98 to 2 vote in the Senate to impose Russian sanctions. He did not mention that the administration has yet to impose those sanctions, saying the threat of them alone has begun to change Russian behavior.\u201cThat sanctions bill has not yet been used as a tool against the Russians,\u201d Christopher Painter, a former coordinator for cyberissues at the State Department, who also attended the conference. \u201cThe question now is whether they will actually use it to create consequences. I don\u2019t know.\u201dGeneral McMaster was questioned by the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of Russian Federation Council, the country\u2019s equivalent of the Senate, about whether the United States was ready to enter into some kind of negotiation with Russia about the use of cyberweapons.It was not the time for that yet, General McMaster said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m surprised there are any Russian cyberexperts available based on how active they have been in undermining the democracies\u201d of the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Loneliness a Health Epidemic?", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterPublic-health leaders immediately praised the idea \u2014 and for good reason. In recent decades, researchers have discovered that loneliness left untreated is not just psychically painful; it also can have serious medical consequences. Rigorous epidemiological studies have linked loneliness and social isolation to heart disease, cancer, depression, diabetes and suicide. Vivek Murthy, the former United States surgeon general, has written that loneliness and social isolation are \u201cassociated with a reduction in life span similar to that caused by smoking 15 cigarettes a day and even greater than that associated with obesity.\u201dBut is loneliness, as many political officials and pundits are warning, a growing \u201chealth epidemic\u201d?I don\u2019t believe so, nor do I believe it helps anyone to describe it that way. Social disconnection is a serious matter, yet if we whip up a panic over its prevalence and impact, we\u2019re less likely to deal with it properly.Anxiety about loneliness is a common feature of modern societies. Today, two major causes of loneliness seem possible. One is that societies throughout the world have embraced a culture of individualism. More people are living alone, and aging alone, than ever. Neoliberal social policies have turned workers into precarious free agents, and when jobs disappear, things fall apart fast. Labor unions, civic associations, neighborhood organizations, religious groups and other traditional sources of social solidarity are in steady decline. Increasingly, we all feel that we\u2019re on our own.The other possible cause is the rise of communications technology, including smartphones, social media and the internet. A decade ago, companies like Facebook, Apple and Google pledged that their products would help create meaningful relationships and communities. Instead, we\u2019ve used the media system to deepen existing divisions, at both the individual and group levels. We may have thousands of \u201cfriends\u201d and \u201cfollowers\u201d on Facebook and Instagram, but when it comes to human relationships, it turns out there\u2019s no substitute for building them the old-fashioned way, in person.In light of these two trends, it\u2019s easy to believe we\u2019re experiencing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of loneliness and isolation. Surprisingly, though, the best data do not actually show drastic spikes in either loneliness or social isolation.The other data on loneliness are complicated and often contradictory, in part because there are so many different ways of measuring the phenomenon. But it\u2019s clear that the loneliness statistics cited by those who say we have an epidemic are outliers. For example, one set of statistics comes from a study that counted as lonely people who said they felt \u201cleft out\u201d or \u201cisolated,\u201d or \u201clacked companionship\u201d \u2014 even just \u201csome of the time.\u201d That\u2019s an exceedingly low bar, and surely not one we\u2019d want doctors or policymakers to use in their work.One reason we need to be careful about how we measure and respond to loneliness is that, as the University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo argues, an occasional and transitory feeling of loneliness can be healthy and productive. It\u2019s a biological signal to ourselves that we need to build stronger social bonds.Professor Cacioppo has spent much of his career documenting the dangers of loneliness. But it\u2019s notable that he relies on more measured statistics in his own scientific papers than the statistics described above. One of his articles, from last year, reports that around 19 percent of older Americans said they had felt lonely for much of the week before they were surveyed, and that in Britain about 6 percent of adults said they felt lonely all or most of the time. Those are worrisome numbers, but they are quite similar to the numbers reported in Britain in 1948, when about 8 percent of older adults said they often or always felt lonely, and to those in previous American studies as well.In particular, overstating the problem can make it harder to make sure we are focusing on the people who need help the most. When Britain announced its new ministry, officials insisted that everyone, young or old, was at risk of loneliness. Yet the research tells us something more specific. In places like the United States and Britain, it\u2019s the poor, unemployed, displaced and migrant populations that stand to suffer most from loneliness and isolation. Their lives are unstable, and so are their relationships. When they get lonely, they are the least able to get adequate social or medical support.I don\u2019t believe we have a loneliness epidemic. But millions of people are suffering from social disconnection. Whether or not they have a minister for loneliness, they deserve more attention and help than we\u2019re offering today.Eric Klinenberg is a professor of sociology at New York University and the author of \u201cGoing Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But over the past few months, it switched buildings and now works right beside the loungelike area where Mr. Pichai and other top executives work.\u201cAny C.E.O. thinks a lot about where people are sitting \u2014 who they can walk around and have casual conversations with,\u201d said Diane Greene, who oversees Google\u2019s cloud computing team and sits on the board of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. \u201cIt is a very significant statement that he has moved that group right next him.\u201dTo Mr. Byrne, shaking up the seating chart at Overstock was a bit like a common management tactic in the military, when an officer will work closely with a small \u201ccommand initiatives group\u201d that is considerably more nimble than the rest of the organization.\u201cWe were getting bureaucratic,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. \u201cAnd this was a way of creating added competition outside the bureaucracy.\u201dThese big companies are trying to duplicate the vibe of a Silicon Valley start-up, where the boss is next to everyone. As start-ups grow, they often put key technology teams next to the chief executive. Ms. Greene, who was the chief executive of the software company VMware, said she had always made a point of sitting beside the top engineers because they saw the company\u2019s future.There are limits to these arrangements. When Facebook built a team to explore the future of virtual reality on its vast social network, it made a similar desk move. The group is no longer seated next to Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook said this was because the group had grown too large. But across Silicon Valley, virtual reality is no longer the buzziest of topics. That honor belongs to artificial intelligence.At Overstock, Mr. Byrne walks past his small research team every time he leaves his office. Like Ms. Greene, he sees this as an opportunity for spontaneous interaction. The team members can discuss their work with him, and Mr. Byrne, a doctor of philosophy with a long history of unorthodox business choices, will share his far-reaching ideas with them. And he gets to hear, without the pressure of a formal presentation, what the engineers are excited about.\u201cIt was undeniable that proximity sparked conversation,\u201d said Judd Bagley, a kind of roving technologist and strategist who once worked in this group. \u201cPatrick prides himself on being able to walk up to anyone at the company, say \u2018hello,\u2019 and occasionally even eat french fries off the plate on their desk.\u201dIf a chief executive is close to these researchers, he or she is learning from them. But the boss is also showing them how important they are to the company. That is enormously valuable for engineers and mathematicians who are not necessarily generating immediate revenue, said Kevin Quennesson, a start-up executive who ran an A.I. team at Twitter.He also warned that companies risked putting too much pressure on researchers to produce results from work that was, by definition, a trip into the unknown. Amid so much spontaneous conversation with the chief executive, Mr. Bagley said, it is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between \u201cthe formal direction and informal brainstorming.\u201dStatus at Facebook was defined by how close your desk was to Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Mart\u00ednez said. And if you were close to the boss, other groups resented you.Priorities also tend to ebb and flow. At Overstock, a new Bitcoin project will squeeze in beside OLabs. And at Facebook, the A.I. lab is no longer side by side with Mr. Zuckerberg because it also grew too large.Still, this work is particularly important to the company as it works to ensure \u201cthe safety and integrity of our community\u201d \u2014 which has become Facebook code for guarding against false, misleading or dangerous activity on its social network, Mr. Schroepfer said. And the A.I. team is still only a short walk from Mr. Zuckerberg.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Our Hackable Political Future", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsImagine it is the spring of 2019. A bottom-feeding website, perhaps tied to Russia, \u201csurfaces\u201d video of a sex scene starring an 18-year-old Kirsten Gillibrand. It is soon debunked as a fake, the product of a user-friendly video application that employs generative adversarial network technology to convincingly swap out one face for another.It is the summer of 2019, and the story, predictably, has stuck around \u2014 part talk-show joke, part right-wing talking point. \u201cIt\u2019s news,\u201d political journalists say in their own defense. \u201cPeople are talking about it. How can we not?\u201dThen it is fall. The junior senator from New York State announces her campaign for the presidency. At a diner in New Hampshire, one \u201clow information\u201d voter asks another: \u201cKirsten What\u2019s-her-name? She\u2019s running for president? Didn\u2019t she have something to do with pornography?\u201dWelcome to the shape of things to come. In 2016 Gareth Edwards, the director of the Star Wars film \u201cRogue One,\u201d was able to create a scene featuring a young Princess Leia by manipulating images of Carrie Fisher as she looked in 1977. Mr. Edwards had the best hardware and software a $200 million Hollywood budget could buy. Less than two years later, images of similar quality can be created with software available for free download on Reddit. That was how a faked video supposedly of the actress Emma Watson in a shower with another woman ended up on the website Celeb Jihad.Programs like these have many legitimate applications. They can help computer-security experts probe for weaknesses in their defenses and help self-driving cars learn how to navigate unusual weather conditions. But as the novelist William Gibson once said, \u201cThe street finds its own uses for things.\u201d So do rogue political actors. The implications for democracy are eye-opening.The conservative political activist James O\u2019Keefe has created a cottage industry manipulating political perceptions by editing footage in misleading ways. In 2018, low-tech editing like Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s is already an anachronism: Imagine what even less scrupulous activists could do with the power to create \u201cvideo\u201d framing real people for things they\u2019ve never actually done. One harrowing potential eventuality: Fake video and audio may become so convincing that it can\u2019t be distinguished from real recordings, rendering audio and video evidence inadmissible in court.A program called Face2Face, developed at Stanford, films one person speaking, then manipulates that person\u2019s image to resemble someone else\u2019s. Throw in voice manipulation technology, and you can literally make anyone say anything \u2014 or at least seem to.The technology isn\u2019t quite there; Princess Leia was a little wooden, if you looked carefully. But it\u2019s closer than you might think. And even when fake video isn\u2019t perfect, it can convince people who want to be convinced, especially when it reinforces offensive gender or racial stereotypes.Another harrowing potential is the ability to trick the algorithms behind self-driving cars to not recognize traffic signs. Computer scientists have shown that nearly invisible changes to a stop sign can fool algorithms into thinking it says yield instead. Imagine if one of these cars contained a dissident challenging a dictator.In 2007, Barack Obama\u2019s political opponents insisted that footage existed of Michelle Obama ranting against \u201cwhitey.\u201d In the future, they may not have to worry about whether it actually existed. If someone called their bluff, they may simply be able to invent it, using data from stock photos and pre-existing footage.The next step would be one we are already familiar with: the exploitation of the algorithms used by social media sites like Twitter and Facebook to spread stories virally to those most inclined to show interest in them, even if those stories are fake.It might be impossible to stop the advance of this kind of technology. But the relevant algorithms here aren\u2019t only the ones that run on computer hardware. They are also the ones that undergird our too easily hacked media system, where garbage acquires the perfumed scent of legitimacy with all too much ease. Editors, journalists and news producers can play a role here \u2014 for good or for bad.Outlets like Fox News spread stories about the murder of Democratic staff members and F.B.I. conspiracies to frame the president. Traditional news organizations, fearing that they might be left behind in the new attention economy, struggle to maximize \u201cengagement with content.\u201dThis gives them a built-in incentive to spread informational viruses that enfeeble the very democratic institutions that allow a free media to thrive. Cable news shows consider it their professional duty to provide \u201cbalance\u201d by giving partisan talking heads free rein to spout nonsense \u2014 or amplify the nonsense of our current president.It already feels as though we are living in an alternative science-fiction universe where no one agrees on what it true. Just think how much worse it will be when fake news becomes fake video. Democracy assumes that its citizens share the same reality. We\u2019re about to find out whether democracy can be preserved when this assumption no longer holds.Henry J. Farrell is a professor of political science and international affairs at the George Washington University.

But the common thread is a need to diversify revenue, as well as the sad truth that cheap drinks and cheap food alone will often no longer support these hulking old buildings and the people who work in them.The last renovation happened a decade ago, leaving the interior with wood-paneled walls covered in various memorabilia: old photos, vintage advertisements, license plates, taxidermied animals (a kookaburra, a raven, a ringtail possum). In the winter, bartenders pull double duty slinging drinks and stoking the leaping flames in the huge brick fireplace.Alistair Derham, the owner, has been proactive in balancing tradition with the needs of a modern urban clientele. There are no televisions, but there are USB outlets under the bar to charge your phone. There are cheap beers, and there are craft beers. The back bar holds some truly exciting local whiskeys and gins. And in terms of food, the pub classics are all available, done very well with little to no gourmet pretensions.Here is a chicken Parma, the classic Australian pub meal that puts a breaded, fried chicken cutlet under a slice of ham, a layer of red sauce and melted cheese, and over a pile of fries. The sauce is house-made, with a hint of smokiness; the cheese is blistered perfectly. There\u2019s no tinkering with the form, no cleverness. It is just a very good Parma.But maybe you\u2019re not in the mood for a Parma or a pub steak (though the porterhouse here is wonderful). Perhaps, instead, you have a hankering for rare wallaby leg with mustard cream and capers. The New Sydney can help you there as well.The easiest way to gauge the breadth of Mr. Clemens\u2019s ambitions is to order the $55 six-course tasting menu, but his more modern efforts are available \u00e0 la carte as well. Southern Tasmanian calamari comes crisped over spiced carrots, some of which have been roasted to a caramelized sear, others turned into a sweet pur\u00e9e. Pickled seaweed salad and furikake take the dish in a somewhat kaleidoscopic direction, in terms of both texture and flavor.Mr. Clemens takes the classic Christmas ham and turns it on its head, serving pork croquettes with charred pineapple, then ramping up the tropical element by adding coconut and chile. The blowtorch comes into play with a starter of Wagyu, which is cut thin and dramatically scorched at the table by your waiter. It is not the only silly but fun cooking method. Sometimes a hot rock is provided, with elaborate instructions about how to cook bits of seafood or meat. Sometimes you\u2019re given a warm salt rock, which seasons and cooks simultaneously.There are times when Mr. Clemens\u2019s cooking runs slightly askew, when the copious cross-cultural influences muddy the experience. But given the location and price and sheer fun of it all, the main takeaway of this food is joy.If nothing else, you should consider patronizing the New Sydney for the people-watching. The customers are as varied and fascinating as the cacophony of memorabilia that adorns its wood-paneled walls.On a recent midweek evening, a family with two young children tucked into an overwhelming platter of roasted lamb, served with pita bread and salad and dips, like a giant deconstructed souvlaki. Nearby, a group of drinkers in their early 20s gossiped about their favorite new cookbooks, remarking on the chefs and recipes the way my friends and I used to discuss musicians and songs. A biker couple nestled into the comfy corner nook near the front windows. At the bar, a few weather-worn older dudes sat in the time-honored pub stance: elbows out, one hand on a cold beer, talking in low, friendly voices.Everyone fits right in at the New Sydney, and it gives me hope for the future of the great Australian pub. Which is saying something, because that future is far from certain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Serengeti Kitchen, Touches of Memoir Dot the Menu", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City12 PhotosDoughba Caranda-Martin III, the chef, braises the escargots slowly in a stew of tomatoes and smoked peppers, including musky black pepper from the Gulf of Guinea and wild handpicked Madagascar pepper, floral with a whiff of camphor. Just before serving, he adds half a teaspoon of crushed Ghanaian kpakpo shito peppers, ever so slightly less incendiary than Scotch bonnets. The snails emerge tender, with a lovely heat that curls up the back of your throat.Mr. Caranda-Martin was born in Liberia to a family steeped in politics (one grandfather was a senator) and spent much of his childhood on his grandmother\u2019s farm in Grand Bassa, south of the capital, Monrovia. He was 15 when the First Liberian Civil War began, in 1989. \u201cBullets were flying everywhere,\u201d he said. Alone, separated from his family, he made his way east to a refugee camp in Ivory Coast and eventually found sanctuary in the United States.Time bends here; a meal might take four hours, even when the dining room is empty. The kitchen is still finding its footing \u2014 or, perhaps, you are being asked to pause and learn a different pace of life.It\u2019s a beautiful place to do so, the narrow dining room glowing from burnished lamps and red Moroccan lanterns, with indigenous and contemporary African art sharing the walls. Geometric cutouts perforate the restaurant\u2019s facade, an allusion to Dogon architecture in Mali, repeated indoors and on the ceiling over a semi-enclosed back garden.Every few months, the menu will shift to explore different regions of the continent. For now, Liberia is its heart. One dish harks back to summers on the farm in Grand Bassa, where Mr. Caranda-Martin picked leaves off the sweet potato vines. Decanted palm oil is brought to high heat until it loses its blood-red hue and turns the color of high noon. Then sweet potato leaves, dark and iron-rich, relax in the pan, soaking up the oil, and come out a creamy pulp with a faint smack of garlic.Another touch of memoir: a jelly jar filled with duck liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, which Mr. Caranda-Martin\u2019s grandmother used to make and call \u201cliver butter.\u201d (Ducks wandered the farm.) It\u2019s simple and forthright, accented by rosemary, cloves and Ethiopian sea salt, with sesame oil for extra velvet.In his art, Mr. Caranda-Martin has used heirloom African textiles as canvases, painting over them, refusing to allow the past to remain static. With food, too, he nods to tradition but faces forward.A thick soup of zucchini and bunapi mushrooms is cooked down with muan-muan (fermented fish) in a broth of forest bark, melding sea and earth. Roasted guinea hen, customarily served whole, is here represented by its best part, thighs, deboned and tied with string to hold in the juices, and half-submerged in a deep, mellow stew of sweet African peppers.No meal is complete without tea, served in a glass kettle that\u2019s perched over a candle to keep it warm. Each has a story, like one that Mr. Caranda-Martin described as \u201cdrunk by fishermen,\u201d composed of wache (red sorghum leaves) and root grass from the West African coast.For dessert, hot chocolate is inflamed by dehydrated Scotch bonnets; truffles are laced with suya spice, a flare-up of ginger, chile and kuli-kuli (spiced groundnut paste), more often slapped on meat before grilling. Other treats are hidden on the tea list, including apple cake, baked by an aunt and so rich it\u2019s almost damp, and a lush pudding born of a childhood prank of throwing kelewele (ginger-fried plantains) in a blender.There are more stories. And to book the $65 tasting menu, which features rarer ingredients like loofah, a gourd from Botswana, you must call ahead and share your own. \u201cWe have to have a conversation, like Grandma and Grandpa when you\u2019re coming over,\u201d Mr. Caranda-Martin said. \u201cWe need to have a sense of who you are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tyranny of Convenience", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConvenience is the most underestimated and least understood force in the world today. As a driver of human decisions, it may not offer the illicit thrill of Freud\u2019s unconscious sexual desires or the mathematical elegance of the economist\u2019s incentives. Convenience is boring. But boring is not the same thing as trivial.In the developed nations of the 21st century, convenience \u2014 that is, more efficient and easier ways of doing personal tasks \u2014 has emerged as perhaps the most powerful force shaping our individual lives and our economies. This is particularly true in America, where, despite all the paeans to freedom and individuality, one sometimes wonders whether convenience is in fact the supreme value.As Evan Williams, a co-founder of Twitter, recently put it, \u201cConvenience decides everything.\u201d Convenience seems to make our decisions for us, trumping what we like to imagine are our true preferences. (I prefer to brew my coffee, but Starbucks instant is so convenient I hardly ever do what I \u201cprefer.\u201d) Easy is better, easiest is best.Convenience has the ability to make other options unthinkable. Once you have used a washing machine, laundering clothes by hand seems irrational, even if it might be cheaper. After you have experienced streaming television, waiting to see a show at a prescribed hour seems silly, even a little undignified. To resist convenience \u2014 not to own a cellphone, not to use Google \u2014 has come to require a special kind of dedication that is often taken for eccentricity, if not fanaticism.For all its influence as a shaper of individual decisions, the greater power of convenience may arise from decisions made in aggregate, where it is doing so much to structure the modern economy. Particularly in tech-related industries, the battle for convenience is the battle for industry dominance.Americans say they prize competition, a proliferation of choices, the little guy. Yet our taste for convenience begets more convenience, through a combination of the economics of scale and the power of habit. The easier it is to use Amazon, the more powerful Amazon becomes \u2014 and thus the easier it becomes to use Amazon. Convenience and monopoly seem to be natural bedfellows.Given the growth of convenience \u2014 as an ideal, as a value, as a way of life \u2014 it is worth asking what our fixation with it is doing to us and to our country. I don\u2019t want to suggest that convenience is a force for evil. Making things easier isn\u2019t wicked. On the contrary, it often opens up possibilities that once seemed too onerous to contemplate, and it typically makes life less arduous, especially for those most vulnerable to life\u2019s drudgeries.But we err in presuming convenience is always good, for it has a complex relationship with other ideals that we hold dear. Though understood and promoted as an instrument of liberation, convenience has a dark side. With its promise of smooth, effortless efficiency, it threatens to erase the sort of struggles and challenges that help give meaning to life. Created to free us, it can become a constraint on what we are willing to do, and thus in a subtle way it can enslave us.It would be perverse to embrace inconvenience as a general rule. But when we let convenience decide everything, we surrender too much.Convenience as we now know it is a product of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when labor-saving devices for the home were invented and marketed. Milestones include the invention of the first \u201cconvenience foods,\u201d such as canned pork and beans and Quaker Quick Oats; the first electric clothes-washing machines; cleaning products like Old Dutch scouring powder; and other marvels including the electric vacuum cleaner, instant cake mix and the microwave oven.Convenience was the household version of another late-19th-century idea, industrial efficiency, and its accompanying \u201cscientific management.\u201d It represented the adaptation of the ethos of the factory to domestic life.However mundane it seems now, convenience, the great liberator of humankind from labor, was a utopian ideal. By saving time and eliminating drudgery, it would create the possibility of leisure. And with leisure would come the possibility of devoting time to learning, hobbies or whatever else might really matter to us. Convenience would make available to the general population the kind of freedom for self-cultivation once available only to the aristocracy. In this way convenience would also be the great leveler.This idea \u2014 convenience as liberation \u2014 could be intoxicating. Its headiest depictions are in the science fiction and futurist imaginings of the mid-20th century. From serious magazines like Popular Mechanics and from goofy entertainments like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d we learned that life in the future would be perfectly convenient. Food would be prepared with the push of a button. Moving sidewalks would do away with the annoyance of walking. Clothes would clean themselves or perhaps self-destruct after a day\u2019s wearing. The end of the struggle for existence could at last be contemplated.The dream of convenience is premised on the nightmare of physical work. But is physical work always a nightmare? Do we really want to be emancipated from all of it? Perhaps our humanity is sometimes expressed in inconvenient actions and time-consuming pursuits. Perhaps this is why, with every advance of convenience, there have always been those who resist it. They resist out of stubbornness, yes (and because they have the luxury to do so), but also because they see a threat to their sense of who they are, to their feeling of control over things that matter to them.By the late 1960s, the first convenience revolution had begun to sputter. The prospect of total convenience no longer seemed like society\u2019s greatest aspiration. Convenience meant conformity. The counterculture was about people\u2019s need to express themselves, to fulfill their individual potential, to live in harmony with nature rather than constantly seeking to overcome its nuisances. Playing the guitar was not convenient. Neither was growing one\u2019s own vegetables or fixing one\u2019s own motorcycle. But such things were seen to have value nevertheless \u2014 or rather, as a result. People were looking for individuality again.Perhaps it was inevitable, then, that the second wave of convenience technologies \u2014 the period we are living in \u2014 would co-opt this ideal. It would conveniencize individuality.Consider the man of the early 1980s, strolling down the street with his Walkman and earphones. He is enclosed in an acoustic environment of his choosing. He is enjoying, out in public, the kind of self-expression he once could experience only in his private den. A new technology is making it easier for him to show who he is, if only to himself. He struts around the world, the star of his own movie.So alluring is this vision that it has come to dominate our existence. Most of the powerful and important technologies created over the past few decades deliver convenience in the service of personalization and individuality. Think of the VCR, the playlist, the Facebook page, the Instagram account. This kind of convenience is no longer about saving physical labor \u2014 many of us don\u2019t do much of that anyway. It is about minimizing the mental resources, the mental exertion, required to choose among the options that express ourselves. Convenience is one-click, one-stop shopping, the seamless experience of \u201cplug and play.\u201d The ideal is personal preference with no effort.We are willing to pay a premium for convenience, of course \u2014 more than we often realize we are willing to pay. During the late 1990s, for example, technologies of music distribution like Napster made it possible to get music online at no cost, and lots of people availed themselves of the option. But though it remains easy to get music free, no one really does it anymore. Why? Because the introduction of the iTunes store in 2003 made buying music even more convenient than illegally downloading it. Convenient beat out free.As task after task becomes easier, the growing expectation of convenience exerts a pressure on everything else to be easy or get left behind. We are spoiled by immediacy and become annoyed by tasks that remain at the old level of effort and time. When you can skip the line and buy concert tickets on your phone, waiting in line to vote in an election is irritating. This is especially true for those who have never had to wait in lines (which may help explain the low rate at which young people vote).The paradoxical truth I\u2019m driving at is that today\u2019s technologies of individualization are technologies of mass individualization. Customization can be surprisingly homogenizing. Everyone, or nearly everyone, is on Facebook: It is the most convenient way to keep track of your friends and family, who in theory should represent what is unique about you and your life. Yet Facebook seems to make us all the same. Its format and conventions strip us of all but the most superficial expressions of individuality, such as which particular photo of a beach or mountain range we select as our background image.I do not want to deny that making things easier can serve us in important ways, giving us many choices (of restaurants, taxi services, open-source encyclopedias) where we used to have only a few or none. But being a person is only partly about having and exercising choices. It is also about how we face up to situations that are thrust upon us, about overcoming worthy challenges and finishing difficult tasks \u2014 the struggles that help make us who we are. What happens to human experience when so many obstacles and impediments and requirements and preparations have been removed?Today\u2019s cult of convenience fails to acknowledge that difficulty is a constitutive feature of human experience. Convenience is all destination and no journey. But climbing a mountain is different from taking the tram to the top, even if you end up at the same place. We are becoming people who care mainly or only about outcomes. We are at risk of making most of our life experiences a series of trolley rides.An unwelcome consequence of living in a world where everything is \u201ceasy\u201d is that the only skill that matters is the ability to multitask. At the extreme, we don\u2019t actually do anything; we only arrange what will be done, which is a flimsy basis for a life.We need to consciously embrace the inconvenient \u2014 not always, but more of the time. Nowadays individuality has come to reside in making at least some inconvenient choices. You need not churn your own butter or hunt your own meat, but if you want to be someone, you cannot allow convenience to be the value that transcends all others. Struggle is not always a problem. Sometimes struggle is a solution. It can be the solution to the question of who you are.Embracing inconvenience may sound odd, but we already do it without thinking of it as such. As if to mask the issue, we give other names to our inconvenient choices: We call them hobbies, avocations, callings, passions. These are the noninstrumental activities that help to define us. They reward us with character because they involve an encounter with meaningful resistance \u2014 with nature\u2019s laws, with the limits of our own bodies \u2014 as in carving wood, melding raw ingredients, fixing a broken appliance, writing code, timing waves or facing the point when the runner\u2019s legs and lungs begin to rebel against him.Such activities take time, but they also give us time back. They expose us to the risk of frustration and failure, but they also can teach us something about the world and our place in it.So let\u2019s reflect on the tyranny of convenience, try more often to resist its stupefying power, and see what happens. We must never forget the joy of doing something slow and something difficult, the satisfaction of not doing what is easiest. The constellation of inconvenient choices may be all that stands between us and a life of total, efficient conformity.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Comes to the Olympics", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSince the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, announced on Jan. 1 that he was interested in sending a delegation to the Games, there has been a flurry of inter-Korean agreements.The international news media has been buzzing about the new prospects for a secure peace on the Korean Peninsula, but not everyone in the South is happy about the welcome the North is receiving. And this time it\u2019s not just the usual South Korean conservatives who are moaning.The idea that people in the South belong with their Northern brethren isn\u2019t universal, especially among the young. The exigencies of daily life \u2014 jobs, housing, income inequality \u2014 are far more pressing than uniting with what may as well be an alien country. Unification increasingly sounds like an abstract ideal, taught only in school and repeated ad nauseam by the political class.President Moon Jae-in appears to be paying a heavy political price for the rapprochement. Engagement to foster peace is worth exploring. But pulling out all the stops to accommodate Pyongyang on the basis that the two Koreas are one \u201cminjok\u201d (nation) \u2014 as Mr. Moon seems to be suggesting \u2014 comes across as outdated and out of touch.After all, we have seen this before.More hopeful years followed under the so-called Sunshine Policy of President Kim Dae-jung, the first progressive politician to take power since the adoption of a democratic Constitution in 1987, who held office from 1998 to 2003. The two Koreas marched together at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, flying the Korean Unification Flag. Cooperative economic ventures, limited to some border areas, were next.No matter who shoulders the blame for the North\u2019s nuclear status and the tensions that have arisen as a result, the fact remains that Pyongyang is a difficult regime to deal with, one that is quick to take offense and doesn\u2019t hesitate to rain artillery fire on the South. Young South Koreans, who have little sense of connection to the North, tend to see only these current realities.To be clear, the Moon administration is playing nice with Kim Jong-un for strategic reasons. Yet the president\u2019s government is doing a poor job persuading those who say it\u2019s unfair to give North Koreans spots on the women\u2019s ice hockey team at the expense of South Korean players who trained hard. Nor does the government appear to have a credible strategy for when Pyongyang acts out.Mr. Moon needs to do a better job explaining why it matters to court Pyongyang at this time. It\u2019s for the safety and well-being of all Koreans, not because of the shared blood between the two countries.Se-Woong Koo is the publisher of Korea Expos\u00e9.Advertisement"}

Between 2013 and 2016, the gross annual bookings of full-time yellow-taxi drivers in New York, working during the day when fares are typically highest, fell from $88,000 a year to just over $69,000. Medallions, which grant the right to operate a taxi in New York City, were now depreciating assets and drivers who had borrowed money to pay for them, once a sound investment strategy, were deeply in debt. Ms. Desai was routinely seeing grown men cry and she had become increasingly concerned about the possibility that they would begin taking their lives.Implicit in his testament was the anger he felt over the de-professionalization of his life\u2019s work. Mr. Schifter had driven more than five million miles throughout his tenure, through five hurricanes and 50 snowstorms. He had chauffeured celebrities and worn a suit. He was not driving a car to supplement the income he was getting from his crepe business and he was not trying to make a little extra money for a gym membership. He was not a participant in the gig economy; he was a casualty of it.For at least a century, the suicide as spectacle, prompted by a reversal of fortune, has typically been the practice of the wealthy. In the months after Wall Street\u2019s crash in 1929, four people threw themselves out windows in New York (leading to the folklore that there had been many, many more such deaths). Decades later, Bernie Madoff\u2019s son Mark hanged himself from a dog leash in his SoHo apartment. In 2016, Sanjay Valvani, a hedge fund manager accused of insider trading, slashed his throat in the bedroom of his Brooklyn townhouse, to much sensation in the tabloid and financial press. Poverty too often kills you without making you try.In response to Mr. Schifter\u2019s death, Mayor de Blasio showed little sensitivity to the psychic harms of economic deprivation. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, for someone to commit suicide there\u2019s an underlying mental health challenge,\u201d he said. Uber did not respond to a request for comment.For taxi drivers staring down an even bleaker future of driverless cars at a moment when Washington considers a weekly paycheck bump of $1.50 an occasion to break out the layer cake, it is hard to see where the metaphoric Prozac will come from.The problems facing the city\u2019s taxi drivers have become so bad, Ms. Desai said, that even on New Year\u2019s Eve many complained that they roamed around unable to pick up fares. At about that time she had received a call from a woman who runs a community radio station in the Bronx, with an audience made up mostly of Dominican livery drivers. Two drivers that the host knew of had killed themselves and other drivers were on the show talking about the isolation and fear they saw all around them.In the days preceding his death, Mr. Schifter wrote about his decreasing faith in our politics and about his commitments to his spiritual life. \u201cForget the clich\u00e9 you only live once it is not true,\u201d he said in a Facebook post. \u201cThe clues are all about you if you take the time to seek them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Marches Forward on A.I., the White House Is Silent", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "Last summer, China unveiled a plan to become the world\u2019s leader in artificial intelligence, challenging the longtime role of the United States.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In July, China unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence and create an industry worth $150 billion to its economy by 2030.To technologists working on A.I. in the United States, the statement, which was 28 pages long in its English translation, was a direct challenge to America\u2019s lead in arguably the most important tech research to come along in decades. It outlined the Chinese government\u2019s aggressive plan to treat A.I. like the country\u2019s own version of the Apollo 11 lunar mission \u2014 an all-in effort that could stoke national pride and spark agenda-setting technology breakthroughs.\u201cIt is remarkable to see how A.I. has emerged as a top priority for the Chinese leadership and how quickly things have been set into motion,\u201d said Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security who helped translate the manifesto and follows China\u2019s work on artificial intelligence. \u201cThe U.S. plans and policies released in 2016 were seemingly the impetus for the formulation of China\u2019s national A.I. strategy.\u201d\u201cWe are still waiting on the White House to provide some direction\u201d on how to respond to the competition, said Tim Hwang, who worked on A.I. policy at Google and is now the director of the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative, a new organization created by the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and others to fund ethical research in artificial intelligence.American companies like Amazon and Google have done more than anyone to turn A.I. concepts into real products. But for a number of reasons, including concerns that the Trump administration will limit the number of immigrant engineers allowed into the United States, much of the critical research being done on artificial intelligence is already migrating to other countries, including tech hot spots like Toronto, London and Beijing.To China\u2019s growing tech community, driving the industry\u2019s next big thing \u2014 a mantra of Silicon Valley \u2014 is becoming a tantalizing possibility.\u201cThanks to the size of the market and the rapid experimentation, China is going to become one of the most powerful \u2014 if not the most powerful \u2014 A.I. countries in the world,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft and Google executive who now runs a prominent Chinese venture capital firm dedicated to artificial intelligence.The 2016 A.I. reports were shepherded by President Barack Obama\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy.The O.S.T.P., which has overseen science and technology activities across the federal government for more than four decades, is now run by the deputy chief technology officer Michael Kratsios. He had worked as a Wall Street analyst before serving as chief of staff for an investment fund run by Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist who supported Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential run. The administration has yet to name an office director or fill four other assistant posts.In a recent interview, Mr. Kratsios was adamant that any concerns over the administration\u2019s approach to A.I. were unfounded.\u201cArtificial intelligence has been a priority for the Trump administration since Day 1,\u201d he said. Mr. Kratsios added that the administration was particularly concerned with the development of A.I. in national security and as a way of encouraging economic prosperity.Many staff members in Mr. Kratsios\u2019s office are exploring issues related to artificial intelligence, he said. Mr. Kratsios also meets with a committee, set up by the Obama administration, that coordinates A.I. policy across the government.\u201cThe key thing to remember is that the front line of A.I. policy is at the agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House is a convener and a coordinator.\u201dIn an echo of plans laid out by the Obama administration, China\u2019s government said it intended to significantly increase long-term funding for A.I. research and develop a much larger community of A.I. researchers.There are several ways to do that, according to the Obama administration and China. First, educate more students in these technologies. Second, recruit experts from other countries.At the same time, both policy statements urged companies to share more technology and data. Huge pools of data are need to \u201ctrain\u201d A.I. systems, and in the United States much of this is locked up inside companies like Facebook and Google. Mr. Lee said China already has an enormous advantage here because its large population will generate more data and its companies are more willing to share.Artificial intelligence has been a focus of Chinese technologists for some time. By 2013, China was already producing more research papers than the United States in the area of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the main technology driving the rise of A.I., according to the Obama reports. Deep learning, which allows machines to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, is one of the main technologies driving the rise of artificial intelligence.It is unclear how much China as a whole is spending. But one Chinese state has promised to invest $5 billion in A.I., and the government of Beijing has committed $2 billion to an A.I. development park in the city. South Korea has set aside close to $1 billion of its own. Canada, already home to many of the top researchers in the field, has also committed $125 million to, in part, attract new talent from other countries.It is also difficult to say just how much the government of the United States is spending. Government organizations like the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation continue to fund new research in universities and the private sector. According to an O.S.T.P report, the federal government spent about $1 billion a year in 2015. The Trump administration says that spending jumped to $3 billion in 2017. But the current administration said that was not an apples-to-apples comparison to the 2015 tally, because it was not certain how the Obama administration made it calculations.\u201cWe may have a bunch of small initiatives inside the government that are doing good, but we don\u2019t have a central national strategy,\u201d said Jack Clark, a former journalist who now oversees policy efforts at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab co-founded by Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is confusing that we have this technology of such obvious power and merit and we are not hearing full-throated support, including financial support.\u201d\u201cThey are headed in precisely the wrong direction,\u201d said Thomas Kalil, who led O.S.T.P\u2019s Technology and Innovation Division under President Obama. \u201cThat is particularly concerning given that China has identified this as a strategic priority.\u201dGoogle operates another important lab in Montreal. Its London lab, DeepMind, may be home to more top-notch A.I. researchers than any other lab on earth. And Google recently unveiled new labs in both Paris and Beijing. Facebook, after creating its own lab in Canada, recently pumped 10 million euros, or more than $12 million, into its existing operation in Paris. And Amazon is opening a lab in Germany.Inside these facilities, researchers still create technology for their American employers. As the labs grow and the products get better, some employees can be expected to leave to start their own companies and hire their own employees.Google\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s work in China has already led to Chinese start-ups like Malong, which is building image recognition systems, and a major A.I. investment fund run by Mr. Lee.\u201cWhen it is close to you, something like Microsoft Research has real economic value,\u201d said Mr. Clark, of OpenAI.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

Hundreds of thousands of mainland Chinese have immigrated to Australia in the past decade. Many of them have brought ideas for businesses, but also an ideology that stresses the unity of China, viewing Taiwan as a rebellious territory that broke away in 1949.Their efforts have added to a sense of Chinese ubiquity: For anyone who identifies as Taiwanese, supports Taiwan\u2019s independence \u2014 or even inadvertently refers to Taiwan as a country \u2014 Chinese nationalism has become a threatening and unrelenting presence, like a smog that never lifts.In Australia, service workers, professionals and students from Taiwan have all described gatherings with mainland colleagues and acquaintances where the default setting is that Taiwan and China are one country.Disagreement is not encouraged.\u201cEven people who are very pro-Taiwan often don\u2019t want it to be known publicly,\u201d said Roger Huang, 35, a Taiwanese academic who helped organize last year\u2019s Sydney Taiwan Festival. \u201cSelf-censorship is very real.\u201dOthers note that many people in Taiwan consider the island part of China and that, given the economic benefits, good relations are necessary.\u201cDiscussing politics is bad for business,\u201d said Antonio Guo, 65, the Taiwanese owner of a restaurant in a north Sydney suburb. \u201cPeople get agitated.\u201dBut for many, silence is the spawn of fear. There are widening concerns in the Australian government and in immigrant communities that the Chinese government is watching and listening, ready to apply pressure on those who do not toe the Communist Party line.Paul Lin, president of the Australian Taiwanese Friendship Association, said several people believed to be Chinese agents were snapping photos of people at the Sydney Taiwan Festival in 2016.\u201cThe problem is they think Sydney is Beijing,\u201d said Mr. Lin, a businessman who moved to Australia in 1990, referring to the Chinese government and its loyalists. \u201cThey\u2019re doing more and more watching and interfering. And they\u2019re getting better at it.\u201dMr. Lin said that for Chinese immigrants who still have family and business interests in China, discriminating could be \u201can entry point,\u201d a way to show loyalty to Beijing.Ms. Tuan\u2019s experience provides a glimpse of how that power dynamic works.Her story became public when Ms. Tuan, who goes by Winnie in Australia, published a Facebook post about her experience on Jan. 9, the day she was fired. That post, in which she named the restaurant, HuTong Hot Pot, and a supervisor she called Mr. Ha, quickly went viral on Chinese social media.China\u2019s Global Times \u2014 a state news media outlet \u2014 published an article the following day, asking readers: \u201cWhat do you think about this incident, mainland netizens?\u201dThe editors, leaving little to chance, added that The Global Times \u201cwould like to go to Sydney, and give \u2018Mr. Ha\u2019 a thumbs up!\u201dMore than a dozen Chinese news outlets republished the article.Later that week, a post from the restaurant appeared on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter: \u201cIt is fate and a privilege,\u201d the message said, \u201cto have people who respect us coming to dine at our restaurant.\u201dThe comments section was filled with praise and promises to visit.During the lunch rush one day last week, the restaurant was packed.Asked about Ms. Tuan\u2019s departure, a young manager said, \u201cThe company told us we\u2019re not commenting.\u201dMs. Tuan, 29, said in an interview that other comments on social media were supportive of her cause.\u201cPeople could relate,\u201d she said.They included Daniel Chang, 28. A hairdresser working in Melbourne, Mr. Chang said he never received a callback from a salon that had seemed eager to hire him until he mentioned he was Taiwanese.Jade Liao, 26, ran afoul of a customer. She said that in 2016, at a shoe store where she worked, a Chinese student berated her after she answered a question about whether Taiwan was part of China.\u201cShe started yelling, and pointed a finger at me,\u201d Ms. Liao said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hold back my tears after she left.\u201dMany other Taiwanese workers described similar experiences \u2014 mostly young women on working holiday visas.A spokesman for the agency, however, said it had not undertaken any enforcement actions for discrimination against Taiwanese workers, or any other group, based on their political opinions.Mr. Lin, of the Australian Taiwanese Friendship Association, and many others in the Taiwanese community said Australia must do more to address the issue.Without more effort, Mr. Lin said, China will continue to erode Australia\u2019s \u201cfair go\u201d culture of democracy and equality.\u201cThey are helping China erase the values that Taiwan and Australia share: democracy, human rights and the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Lin said in a Sydney shopping mall flush with signs in Mandarin. \u201cThis is invisible.

But to Alexander Garcia, the AR-15 represents something else altogether: his favorite gun.\u201cThat\u2019s my baby,\u201d said Mr. Garcia, 34, a musician in Southern California who likes to take his AR-15 out target-shooting. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the greatest rifles I\u2019ve ever fired. I\u2019m a very proud owner.\u201dThe waves of fury and grief over the mass shooting that killed 17 students and educators last week at a South Florida high school has refocused attention onto the AR-15 and its popularity.In the wake of the shooting, a handful of AR-15 owners are rethinking whether they still want to own a style of rifle originally designed for troops to kill enemy fighters. The gun fires a small-caliber, high-velocity bullet that can cause especially damaging soft-tissue wounds.But in interviews, other AR-15 owners said they swear by the guns. They called the rifle a lightweight, easy-to-fire symbol of their Second Amendment rights, and said they would never give up what they called a misunderstood weapon. In fact, one owners group, the AR-15 Gun Owners of America, said it had gained 10,000 new fans on its Facebook page since the shooting in Parkland.Here are the perspectives from some of those AR-15 owners.Mr. Garcia said he bought his AR-15 about a year ago, and keeps it locked in a case inside his home in Rancho Cucamonga, in San Bernardino County, Calif. He said that he had a concealed-weapons permit, and that he went out with a handgun at all times.\u201cAs we speak, I am armed,\u201d he said.He takes his AR-15 target-shooting, and like many other owners, said he liked to swap out the rifle\u2019s components and after-market additions. At the shooting range, he said other gun owners often approached him and asked about how he had personalized the rifle to his liking.Mr. Garcia, whose father served in the military, said he embraced the military roots of the AR-15. The Pentagon\u2019s version of the rifle, renamed the M16 and capable of automatic or burst fire, was first distributed to American troops in Vietnam, and versions of the gun that do not fire automatically became enormously popular for civilian use. AR-15s were targeted under the Assault Weapons Ban from 1994 to 2004, but today are legal. Mr. Garcia said that his was made by Smith & Wesson, and that he had bought it for about $800.Mr. Garcia said the weapon had been demonized and misrepresented.\u201cThis rifle is in no way an assault rifle,\u201d he said. \u201cAn inanimate object is not committing these crimes.\u201dShyanne Roberts was nine years old when she built her first AR-15-style rifle. Now 13 and a competitive shooter in South Carolina, she regularly uses AR-15s at shooting competitions, along with shotguns and pistols. Her rifle is black with purple marbling. Her name is engraved on the scope mount, so everyone knows it is hers.\u201cI like shooting them because it\u2019s just another gun to master,\u201d she said.\u201cEverybody always says it\u2019s the gun that did it,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the person. The person uses the firearm the incorrect way. No matter what, they\u2019re still going to get their guns.\u201dShyanne\u2019s father, Dan Roberts, said that being vocal AR-15 owners (they have eight between them) had made them targets for online anger. He said he had gotten messages hoping that a gun would blow up in Shyanne\u2019s face, or that she would become a victim in the next mass shooting.\u201cWe\u2019re not monsters,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cWe\u2019re just regular, normal people who want to be left alone.\u201dFor Jerrol Jensen, the growing body count has complicated his feelings about the AR-15 rifles that sit in a locked cabinet at his home in Lincoln, Neb.Mr. Jensen, 55, who calls his politics \u201cextremely liberal,\u201d said he had used AR-15-style rifles for three decades to hunt and target-shoot. He said he had done extensive work as a test-shooter for rifles, some of which were used by the military and law enforcement. He said he always felt he was doing a public service, and enjoyed being outside to hunt deer and the relaxation of target-shooting.But he said that he opposed the National Rifle Association\u2019s aggressive opposition to gun-control measures, and that he supported closing loopholes that allow guns to be purchased outside licensed dealers. His wife does not like the AR-15s that are in their home, and supports banning them outright, Mr. Jensen said.He wondered what place there should be in society for a weapon that had caused so much carnage.\u201cThat\u2019s the potential of the rifle,\u201d Mr. Jensen said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing out there that\u2019ll compare to it as to doing what it was designed to do, and that\u2019s kill people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It had 11 million paying users in 2017, up 25 percent from 2016. But that was a significantly slower pace than the 35 percent increase in 2016.In theory, Dropbox could squeeze more revenue out of each user, but it has not managed to do that in recent years.

But an alternative way to view the tensions is that so much trade goes on between Britain and the bloc, and others ties are so deep, that both sides will ultimately strike a new relationship that retains much of the existing one. As analysts at Nomura wrote earlier this week:In terms of the bespoke deal issue, we think it is not credible to say the U.K. can only take an off-the-shelf Norway / Switzerland / Turkey / Ukraine / Canada / Mexico deal. They were all bespoke deals when they were made. The idea that the world\u2019s seventh largest economy, an ex-member and a country that will still have strong institutional, economic and geographic ties to the E.U. should not get a bespoke deal is not reasonable, in our view.The paper, produced by the Belgian government for a meeting of diplomats last week, will prove a huge boost to British negotiators and gives new insight into E.U. thinking.\u2014 Peter EavisPresident Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda seems to have met its match in the obscure world of international financial regulation.A big reason the Treasury held back: The concerns of foreign regulators.Further, these judges, once designated, could engage in planning and coordination exercises, including cross-border efforts (e.g., the crisis management groups discussed above).Instead, fearing higher costs for United States banks, the Treasury apparently gave the concerns of foreign regulators considerable weight and took an internationalist approach.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Chinese manufacturer has built up a $9 billion stake, or just under 10 percent, in the German automaker and parent of Mercedes-Benz.From Bloomberg:The investment in the parent of Mercedes-Benz furthers Hangzhou-based Geely\u2019s foray into the European premium automotive market and ends months of speculation.

But the steady move of technology companies into downtown San Francisco is shifting the center of gravity of what is arguably America\u2019s most innovative industry from the rambling, suburban streets of the Valley to the tightly concentrated and increasingly vertical neighborhood behind San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero.Facebook\u2019s decision last year to lease more than 400,000 square feet in a skyscraper across from the newly opened Salesforce Tower will put offices of the biggest names in tech \u2014 Google and LinkedIn among them \u2014 within walking distance of each other.In the middle of all this is the Transbay Transit Center, which opens in June and is advertised as the Grand Central of the West.\u201cThe building is starting to come to life,\u201d said Dennis Turchon, senior construction manager for the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, the public organization charged with building the structure.To critics it is a glorified bus terminal, and an expensive one at that \u2014 the cost hovers around $6 billion, according to the authority.Yet the transit center has ambitions to be much more. A 5.4-acre park on the roof has a half-mile walking loop, an outdoor theater and gardens populated by dozens of mature trees. It\u2019s an elevated park that has been compared to the High Line in New York. The tech offices that surround the center connect directly with the park, as does a gondola that will whisk visitors to the park for the sidewalk below.During a week in which the Trump administration has sought to put infrastructure on the agenda, the transit center, which was built with close to $600 million in federal money from the stimulus package during the Great Recession, is a rubber-meets-the-road test for America\u2019s infrastructure plans. The center was built on top of a giant underground concrete box designed to be the San Francisco terminus for both CalTrain, the railway that runs through Silicon Valley to San Jose, and high-speed rail, which is meant to connect San Francisco with Los Angeles.Building the 1.3-mile tunnel that will bring the tracks into the station will take years and hundreds of millions of dollars. San Franciscans are waiting to see whether there is both the political will and the financing to get the job done.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)For more than a century, people across California have claimed to have seen Bigfoot.Claudia Ackley is among them.

{"Headline": "What Is Big Air? It\u2019s the Olympics\u2019 Newest Snowboard Event", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the list of snowboarding events for this year\u2019s Winter Olympics, alongside the now familiar halfpipe and slopestyle, is a new competition with a short but evocative name: big air.The name is accurate. Everything about the event is big. And the dizzying heights achieved by the snowboarders more than justify the \u201cair.\u201dIn big air, snowboarders slide down a 49-meter tall ramp (Pyeongchang\u2019s is the biggest in the world) that curls up at the end and shoots them into the sky, seemingly forever, allowing particularly spectacular tricks.Unlike, say, slopestyle, in which athletes go down a course and have several chances to show off tricks, big air is all about the one jump, the one big, spectacular stunt.For the men\u2019s favorite Mark McMorris of Canada, there\u2019s a trick that even someone new to the sport can probably guess is a doozy: the backside triple cork 1440. He does four full rotations (1440) and basically turns upside down three times (triple). And, oh yes, he has to land without falling.Snowboarders get three jumps; their best two count.The event has been contested at the world championships and the X Games since 2003, but is making its Olympic debut in Pyeongchang.Snowboarding has been growing at the Games. It made its debut in 1998, with two events each for men and women, and now is up to five.Like most so-called extreme sports, injuries are a big part of big air.\u201cThe crazy part about what I\u2019m doing is I get injured so much and still \u2014 every time I\u2019m laying down there, all I want is to get back on my feet, which I think a lot of people think is crazy,\u201d said the women\u2019s favorite Anna Gasser of Austria.Gasser competed in slopestyle at the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, four years ago, and fell twice, finishing 10th. \u201cI was pretty young and inexperienced,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the expectations went so high overnight. I think, as such a young athlete, I wasn\u2019t used to that. I wasn\u2019t used to having crazy media attention like everyone \u2014 I remember I should have never opened my Facebook. I had a million messages. A million friend requests. I didn\u2019t realize until that moment how big the Olympics were, and I think that made me nervous and also made me fall in the finals.\u201dA former gymnast, Gasser has completed a backside double cork 1080.McMorris and Gasser will be challenged by a strong American team, including Chris Corning, 18, and Ryan Stassel, 25. The United States has won five of 12 medals in the men\u2019s World Cup this year.The American women\u2019s team includes Jamie Anderson, who won a gold medal in slopestyle four years ago; Julia Marino; and 17-year-old Hailey Langland, the X Games champion, who will also be showing off a double cork 1080.Advertisement"}

Should she have told someone what happened at the time? Could he have done this to anyone else? Was the interaction really a #MeToo moment?\u201cI don\u2019t know what #MeToo means, really,\u201d Ms. Phillips said of the hashtag that started this cultural reckoning. \u201cDoes it mean you were raped, or does it mean you went out on a bad date with someone? Does it mean someone like me?\u201dMs. Phillips\u2019 25-year-old daughter, Pearl Stanley, has no such qualms. Watching her Facebook feed fill with stories of women abused by men, she said she sees it as \u201cintense, dark,\u201d yet exhilarating and clarifying.\u201cEverybody pretty much has dealt with something that you could put on #MeToo,\u201d she said. \u201cThe #MeToo movement just appeared, so it\u2019s not perfect. But it\u2019s here now, and it\u2019s better than not.\u201dI too am a mother. How to talk about predators is tough. We have told our daughters not to talk to strangers, that their bodies were their own, to trust their instincts. We want to give them a sense of power and confidence, not vulnerability and weakness.As I was thinking about these questions, I asked my younger daughter, now a college student, whether she thought there was a generation gap in the way women see the #MeToo movement. \u201cThere was at Thanksgiving,\u201d she answered.In my recollection of our family meal, it was not that the mothers at the table denied the existence of sexual harassment, far from it. But they voiced whether the reports were accurate \u2014 was the behavior really that prevalent, or that corrosive. \u201cIt\u2019s only sex,\u201d a 50-something female guest at the Thanksgiving table said.But the daughters at the table, including my own, did not see anything \u201conly\u201d about it. They saw #MeToo in more starkly black-and-white terms, as a wakeup call to change society, and as an invitation to men, even men of good will, to rethink their behavior.Ms. Diamint, who works in sales, has noticed that her daughter has begun to attract men\u2019s attention on the street. S he tells her just to keep walking.She said she wants to teach her the resilience that she says has served her well.\u201cI don\u2019t want to teach my daughter to be a victim,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to teach her to be strong about what she wants. I want to teach her to get up and leave. I want her to call me and tell me, \u2018You gotta hear about this terrible date we had last night,\u2019 and then we both laugh about it.\u201dThose conversations may reflect how far the women\u2019s movement has come \u2014 that daughters are willing to speak out about abuse their mothers and grandmothers once learned to put up with. Their mothers have been too polite for too long, the daughters say.\u201cThey\u2019re just too used to it,\u201d said Ms. Stanley, the 25-year-old. She said that when she worked as a waitress in New Orleans, male customers seemed to think that they could get away with pinching her behind if they left a good tip.Advertisement"}

She prefers to travel alone so she can burrow her way into the local culture in her own reserved and unassuming way.In the fall of 2014, not long after a trip to Japan, she headed to Granada, Nicaragua, to volunteer as an English teacher with La Esperanza Granada, a nonprofit dedicated to improving the lives of local children. Initially, the two most striking things about this particular experience were the bats in her open-air bedroom and the children she taught, \u201ctiny bodies desperate for my love and affection.\u201dA few weeks after Ms. Marshall, now 29, started working, Thomas Forsyth Kelland, a new volunteer, arrived on a motorcycle he had been riding around Central America for weeks. He grew up in Sumner, New Zealand; studied chemical engineering at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch; got a job and then quit that job to travel. \u201cThere are very few Kiwis I\u2019m aware of who have gone from college into a good job and stayed in it,\u201d said Peter Down, a longtime friend and fellow Kiwi. \u201cWe tend to have itchy feet.\u201dMr. Kelland, now 28, made a strong impression. Within days, he had built a ramp from the street to the front door of the house where he lived with several volunteers from different parts of the world. He would ride his motorcycle directly in and out of the house and roar around town, often with more than one passenger hanging on.Ms. Marshall lived in a house nearby and couldn\u2019t help but notice him. \u201cI was drawn by how people were drawn to him,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone wanted to be around Tom. He had this amazing attitude, happy-go-lucky.\u201d He was gregarious to the extreme, yet \u201che carried himself with a special sort of humble confidence,\u201d she said.Mr. Kelland mainly helped La Esperanza with building projects, but he occasionally worked as an assistant in the classroom and always managed to make the children laugh. \u201cOne time, I was telling the kids to sit down,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI thought the word for sit down was \u2018suerte.\u2019\u201d Suerte, he soon discovered, actually means \u201cluck.\u201d\u201cI was just yelling \u2018Luck!\u2019 at them and pointing at their chairs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese were 5- and 6-year-old kids. The teacher must have thought, \u2018They\u2019re really scraping the bottom of the barrel with the volunteers.\u2019\u201dAlthough he was usually busy doing something hilarious or dangerous, he definitely noticed Ms. Marshall. She was a dark-haired beauty, he said, \u201cwith a relentless mind that\u2019s always working.\u201d The other volunteers turned to her for advice about everything, including the best cure for food poisoning and the safest place to camp while surfing on Nicaragua\u2019s Pacific Coast.\u201cMariana is very friendly, very confident,\u201d said Matt Conrady, a fellow volunteer who has remained a friend. \u201cShe always looks like she knows what\u2019s going on. She\u2019s somebody you can\u2019t mess with.\u201dMr. Kelland, Ms. Marshall and a few others became particularly close, calling themselves the Familia. The Familia traveled on weekends, usually by \u201cchicken bus\u201d \u2014 old, converted school buses that serve as public transportation, for people as well as animals.The buses traveled slowly, which gave Ms. Marshall and Mr. Kelland time to get to know each other. \u201cWe could talk about anything, and it was never dull,\u201d he said.The one subject they were afraid to discuss was the fact that they were falling in love. Eventually, she texted him late one night \u2014 the date was Oct. 23 \u2014 saying that she had something important to tell him. Although she is shy, she said, she is even more impatient. It was way past midnight but he texted back, saying he would be right over.She waited on the steps outside her house. \u201cI had this image that he would ride up on his motorcycle and kiss me,\u201d she said.Instead he rode up on a rickety little bike he had borrowed. (He didn\u2019t want to wake anyone by riding his motorcycle.) \u201cThe trip over there was something special,\u201d he said. \u201cI was riding a small push bike on the streets of Granada at about 2 a.m. to talk to the girl I can\u2019t stop thinking about. I wasn\u2019t nervous. It was actually quite calming.\u201dThey sat on the steps for awhile, shoulder to shoulder, before she simply asked him if he\u2019d like to be her boyfriend. \u201cI was ecstatic,\u201d he said.As a couple, they continued exploring Nicaragua together and discovered they are very different travelers. She consults maps, guidebooks and the internet whenever possible, while he ignores all that and actually enjoys getting lost. \u201cHe helps me live more in the moment and put down the book for a second,\u201d she said.Friends at home began realizing they were no longer solo travelers. \u201cI kept in touch with her while she was in Nicaragua through Facebook,\u201d said Emily Mohney, who worked with Ms. Marshall at Canyonlands National Park in Utah. \u201cShe told me, \u2018Oh, by the way, I met this awesome, incredible guy. I have an adventure partner now.\u2019 I think that\u2019s when I thought it could be serious, when she started calling him an \u2018adventure partner.\u2019\u201dIn January 2015, Ms. Marshall moved to New York City to begin graduate school at Teachers College at Columbia University. Mr. Kelland followed her and secretly moved into her dorm room. He prepared dinner every night, often a pot of curry and a box of wine. \u201cIt was a small space, but we were happy,\u201d she said.He eventually returned home, working as a chemical engineer, this time at CSL Limited, a biotechnology company in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cThe lack of his presence was a physical sensation,\u201d Ms. Marshall said. \u201cI literally felt like someone was sitting on my chest.\u201dTo stay more closely connected, they instituted rituals such as drinking a bottle of champagne together \u2014 via Skype \u2014 on the 23rd of every month, to celebrate the fact that they officially started dating on Oct. 23, 2014. Because of the time difference, Mr. Kelland often imbibed before dawn. \u201cThere were plenty of 23rds where Tom Skyped me from bed with a bottle of champagne and got dutifully drunk with me first thing in the morning in the name of love,\u201d she wrote in an email.In July 2016, a month after earning a master\u2019s degree in elementary education, she moved to Melbourne and is now an elementary schoolteacher there. On Christmas Eve that year, he proposed while they were walking on some seaside cliffs in his hometown, as waves crashed below and he played their favorite road trip tune on his iPhone, \u201cSongbird\u201d by Fleetwood Mac.Ms. Marshall\u2019s bachelorette party was the opposite of a wild weekend in Vegas. \u201cI went to Bali by myself and got my diving certification,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a terrifying adventure that left me with a feeling of accomplishment. That seemed like a good way to celebrate my wedding.\u201dOn Jan. 5, \u201cSongbird\u201d played through speakers as the bride entered the Broad Axe Barn at Devil\u2019s Thumb Ranch, a rustic lodge surrounded by mountains in Tabernash, Colo. Ms. Marshall, who has done a lot of skiing, hiking and river rafting in the vicinity, calls Colorado \u201cthe area of the world where I really came to know myself.\u201dThe wedding began just as sunset was beginning, and a yellowy-pink glow eventually transformed the scene outside, as if an Instagram filter had been applied.The ceremony was led by Hamish Kelland, the bridegroom\u2019s father, and Myriam Marshall, the bride\u2019s mother. (In Colorado, couples can choose anyone to legally officiate at their wedding since no type of authorization is required.) The groom\u2019s mother, Ronene Kelland, and the bride\u2019s father, Tim Marshall, watched nearby.\u201cHey, kids,\u201d the bride\u2019s mother began. \u201cThe vows you are about to take will reward you as much as they will test you.\u201dShe then added: \u201cMarriage is like catching the chicken bus. You jump on it and you hope for the best. You don\u2019t know exactly where it\u2019s going, but you sure hope it takes you more or less where you want to go. Sometimes, the trip will have you crying with terror. Sometimes, the ride will have you squealing with thrills. But in both cases, you hang on tight.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 85.Mr. Shimano helped fuel interest in Zen Buddhism in New York and beyond in the 1960s and \u201970s, a time of alternative lifestyles and spiritual searching. But years later it was found that he had also been having sex with a number of women who had come to him to be taught, revelations that raised ethical questions that roiled Western Buddhism.Although Mr. Shimano continued to have devoted followers after the scandal broke in 2010, he became a pariah to many.Mr. Shimano\u2019s own story of his relocation was more charming. He told of arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport on New Year\u2019s Eve with virtually nothing and proceeding over the ensuing weeks and months to attract followers in the most basic of ways.\u201cAll I did was simply walk Manhattan from top to the bottom,\u201d he told Mr. Oppenheimer, a former religion columnist for The New York Times, adding, \u201cin my Buddhist robe.\u201dCountless people made the trek there to meditate, study and be taught.

Two months later, he resigned as abbot as well.\u201cEido Shimano Roshi was clearly one of the great Zen teachers of his generation of immigrants who fed the hunger in the American counterculture for an \u2018authentic\u2019 teaching from the East,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer said by email. \u201cUnfortunately, he was also one of the generation\u2019s worst predators.\u201dThere was no immediate information on Mr. Shimano\u2019s survivors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Grief and Hope, Florida Students Take Gun Control Fight On the Road", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Instead of 10th-grade English and 12th-grade calculus, the teenagers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., had another funeral to attend. When the grim ceremony was over on Tuesday morning, they hugged their parents goodbye, stashed their backpacks in the bellies of three buses and set off in grief and hope to demand gun control measures from state lawmakers more than 400 miles away.As they were getting on the road, the lawmakers in Tallahassee swiftly rejected an effort to debate an assault weapons ban in a party-line vote that said much about how far apart most Democrats and Republicans are when it comes to guns. In the balcony, some Parkland students who had already made it to the Capitol could be seen crying, hands smothering mouths.It was an early reminder that failure might very well become familiar for these latest, youngest gun control activists, as it has for so many others. Republican lawmakers plan to consider more modest proposals, including raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles, before the session ends in March. Yet a kind of optimism \u2014 or maybe just an inability not to believe in their own power \u2014 was in the humid air.\u201cThis shooting is different from the other ones,\u201d said Daniel Bishop, 16, who sat side-by-side with his sister on the second bus. \u201cSandy Hook, they were elementary school kids who couldn\u2019t stand up for themselves. Virginia Tech was 2007, a different time. But this one, I just have a gut feeling \u2014 something is going to change.\u201dThere was little to suggest yet that anything would. But in Battle Creek, Mich., in Bakersfield, Calif., in Toms River, N.J., in Iowa City, and all over South Florida, the flickers of underage protest this week seemed to augur something new: a coast-to-coast challenge to the idea that the Snapchat generation was too young, too frivolous, for politics.\u201cWe definitely have a moral obligation to do something, considering that so many innocent people that we know passed,\u201d said Mr. Bishop\u2019s sister, Julia Bishop, 18. \u201cThese adults, these politicians, these lawmakers, these legislators, they were supposed to protect us. And they didn\u2019t.\u201dMany of the protests around the country have arrived semi-spontaneously, apparently ignited by the impassioned pleas of young Parkland survivors in the hours and days after the shooting last Wednesday. Facebook and Twitter have amplified attendance; Snapchat and Instagram have documented the marches, signs and chants.Some on the left were hopeful that the unsullied voices of teenagers, cutting through the usual tussle over whether gun control advocates were politicizing a tragedy, would move previously unbudgeable lawmakers. Still, the students have faced questions from some conservatives over whether they are being exploited by the left. Bill O\u2019Reilly on Tuesday asked on Twitter, \u201cShould the media be promoting opinions by teenagers who are in an emotional state and facing extreme peer pressure in some cases?\u201dFor now, however, there is momentum. From South Florida to Bellingham, Wash., local walkouts were proliferating. A national event has been planned for March 14, the one-month anniversary of the Parkland shooting, when students and teachers plan to leave class for 17 minutes, one minute for each victim. On March 24, students will protest in Washington at an event organized by March for Our Lives, the group formed by Parkland survivors, which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from celebrities. Another mass walkout is scheduled for April 20, when students will commemorate the 19th year since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999.The organizers of last year\u2019s Women\u2019s March are directing the March 14 walkout. Mostly, though, the adults have gotten out of the way.On Tuesday morning, hundreds of students from West Boca Raton High School in South Florida walked out of class and onto the roads, bound for Stoneman Douglas High, in a march that took Broward County officials by surprise. The authorities abruptly assembled a law enforcement escort for the students, said Todd DeAngelis, a city of Parkland spokesman. They also organized water stations along the way to help students, who walked nearly 11 miles, beat the heat.\u201cThese kids may look like they\u2019re summer campers,\u201d said Paul Corin, whose daughter, Jaclyn, helped organize the Parkland caravan to Tallahassee. \u201cBut they are fierce warriors.\u201dIn Bakersfield, Calif., about a dozen students and 80 adults marched on Presidents\u2019 Day in support of stricter gun laws. The same day, more than 200 students in Iowa City marched out of school, walked to the Old Capitol downtown and gathered to read the names of the Parkland victims.\u201cThe N.R.A. has got to go,\u201d they chanted. \u201cNot one more,\u201d they chanted.\u201cAt this point, you\u2019re either with us or against us,\u201d said Lujayn Hamad, a senior at West High School, according to The Iowa City Press-Citizen. \u201cWe are dying, and I\u2019m not going to stand for it anymore.\u201dSome of the students of Toms River, N.J., also spent part of Presidents\u2019 Day, a school holiday, massed on the steps of the squat, red brick public library. A young man who described himself as a 16-year-old junior led the crowd in chants of, \u201cEnough is enough! Enough is enough!\u201d\u201cThis is what it\u2019s come to,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this country, kids are typically expected to take a back seat to what goes on in politics and policy, and what\u2019s going on right now \u2014 it can\u2019t happen like that any longer.\u201dAccusing Congress and state legislators of inaction, he advocated stronger gun restrictions. The other option, he said, was turning schools into armed camps where \u201cI have to be aware if there\u2019s a loud bang in the school, do I know where to go?\u201dThe adults who \u201chave the responsibility to take care of these things\u201d have failed, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our generation\u2019s responsibility.\u201dOn Tuesday, at least 20 students walked out of Harper Creek High School in Battle Creek, Mich. The principal stood with them, and the district\u2019s superintendent was on hand.Students left class or held gatherings all over South Florida on Monday and Tuesday. There was American Heritage School in Plantation. Olympic Heights High School in suburban Boca Raton. Park Vista Community High School in Lake Worth. Fort Lauderdale High School in Fort Lauderdale. McArthur High School in Hollywood.At South Broward High School, students aimed to participate in a protest almost every day to make their point.They started with a protest at their school in Hollywood last Friday, and then rallied in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday and at Hollywood City Hall on Monday, said Rachel Donly, a 16-year-old sophomore.\u201cWe don\u2019t think anyone is truly listening to us yet,\u201d said Ms. Donly, whose father is a teacher. \u201cSo we don\u2019t want to give up. We\u2019re just going to keep fighting.\u201dOn the Parkland buses, pillows and sleeping bags had been mushed into the seats. Candy and doughnuts were passed from row to row. Laughter occasionally poked through. But the people the students were traveling for \u2014 their fallen classmates, coaches, teachers \u2014 were never far from their minds.Anthony Lopez, 16, a junior, was sitting alone in the back. He had scratched out a wish list he planned to deliver to lawmakers.\u201cBan on military grade weapons (assault weapons, etc.)\u201d he had written.\u201cUniversal background check, stricter,\u201d he had added.\u201cRaise age for gun ownership (20+), unless for sport or hunting (16+).\u201dThen the news arrived that the Florida House had refused even to consider a ban on assault weapons. How could lawmakers ignore the activism that had lit up social media, the students wondered.\u201cThey know that multiple kids, hundreds of kids, are coming up to the state Capitol, which by the way is extremely far, just to talk to them,\u201d Mr. Bishop said.In the back, Mr. Lopez slammed his head back on the bus seat. He placed a hand on his forehead.\u201cThat\u2019s infuriating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re acting inhuman.\u201dJulie Turkewitz reported from Tallahassee, Fla., and Vivian Yee from New York.

{"Headline": "Fox News Plans a Streaming Service for \u2018Superfans\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, Fox News is set to announce Fox Nation, a stand-alone subscription service available without a cable package. The streaming service, expected to start by the end of the year, would focus primarily on right-leaning commentary, with original shows and cameos by popular personalities like Sean Hannity.It would not overlap with Fox News\u2019s 24-hour cable broadcast \u2014 not even reruns \u2014 because of the channel\u2019s contractual agreements with cable operators. Instead, the network is planning to develop hours of new daily programming with a mostly fresh slate of anchors and commentators.\u201cFox Nation is designed to appeal to the Fox superfan,\u201d John Finley, who oversees program development and production for Fox News, said in an interview. \u201cThese are the folks who watch Fox News every night for hours at a time, the dedicated audience that really wants more of what we have to offer.\u201dMr. Finley said the network was still discussing the cost of a subscription.The Fox News venture joins an increasingly crowded \u2014 and increasingly niche \u2014 marketplace for web-only streaming television.ESPN is starting its subscription service, ESPN Plus, in the spring. About five million viewers signed up last year for HBO and Cinemax digital subscriptions. Last week, CBS said it counted five million subscriptions to its CBS and Showtime streaming services, and it plans to add two more stand-alone products, CBS Sports HQ and an offering branded for \u201cEntertainment Tonight.\u201dFox Nation, depending on its popularity, may prove more consequential to the country\u2019s political life than the average streaming service.Fox News already commands the attention of President Trump and many voters in his base. The digital product would bring viewers an additional dose of opinion programming beyond staples like \u201cHannity\u201d and \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d Live events, like question-and-answer forums, would encourage more direct interaction with anchors and commentators.Fox News viewers \u201cvalue our product so much, they go to hotels and if they can\u2019t have Fox, they send us emails. They go on cruises, and if they can\u2019t have Fox, they send us emails,\u201d Mr. Finley said. \u201cThis is a way for us to meet that demand.\u201dWhether the venture would be a moneymaker is up in the air.Fox News reaps more than $1 billion in annual profit, providing ample funds to hire a new team for Fox Nation, which is not expected to initially carry advertising. Mr. Finley declined to estimate his start-up costs, and streaming services in conservative media have had a mixed record of success.Mr. Finley said Fox Nation was not comparable to a personality-driven product. \u201cThis is not starting from scratch here,\u201d he said. \u201cGlenn Beck had a ton of viewers when he was here on Fox. When he left, it didn\u2019t seem to me that they followed him. People are loyal to the Fox brand.\u201dAsked if Fox Nation was a response to pressures from cord-cutting and other industry trends, Mr. Finley said Fox News loyalists \u201care not cutting the cord anytime soon.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think this is about competing with our rivals. It\u2019s about serving our audience,\u201d he added. \u201cWe know who our audience is. We know what they want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Do When Laptops and Silence Take Over Your Cafe?", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe was not. \u201cEverybody was at a laptop wearing headphones,\u201d Mr. Glanville said. He strode inside, unplugged the device that provided free Wi-Fi and tossed it into a bin in his office.He wanted a courtyard where people talked to one another, not a silent office for remote workers. And while anyone with a cellphone hot spot could connect without his help, he had made himself clear. On a recent weekday morning, almost a year and a half later, the courtyard was still full of people, but this time they were talking to one another. Only one was at his laptop.Starbucks may not feel the pinch, with its multibillion-dollar revenues and legions of grab-and-go customers, but for owners of smaller businesses, the math is grim.Owners face a choice: Get tough and encourage workers to relocate, or embrace them and hope that a combination of guilt and loyalty will inspire them to spend more or leave sooner.It\u2019s hard to know which is the right answer. \u201cThere\u2019s no social order here to tell us how to behave,\u201d said Mr. Glanville, as though he were contemplating a newly formed nation, which in a way he is. He took a no-tolerance stance on Wi-Fi because a single ground rule seemed more hospitable than a litany of restrictions.\u201cYou can\u2019t win that battle,\u201d said Mr. Nieto, who had already learned his lesson the hard way. \u201cThe first time I saw someone with a laptop I said, \u2018Sorry, no laptops,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cRight after that, I got a one-star review on Yelp.\u201dWhen she and Ms. Sodi open Pisellino, a new cafe, in April, the no-work attitude will be embedded in the design: a standing bar only 12 inches deep, no Wi-Fi, no outlets, five small cafe tables inside and 20 outside when the weather allows. Little opportunity to set up shop.Even companies committed to accommodating remote workers look for ways to improve the relationship. At Triniti, Mr. Wynn offers free Wi-Fi, but after two hours a customer must have \u201ca face-to-face interaction\u201d with an employee, he says, to get a new password. He relies on that interaction and the aromas from the kitchen to transform coffee drinkers into lunch customers, and has been gratified as the first wave of workers have started to order midday meals.If someone stakes out too much turf \u2014 if their belongings sprawl into nearby seating \u2014 it\u2019s time for a polite intervention. \u201cWe won\u2019t move anybody\u2019s stuff,\u201d Ms. Arnold said, \u201cbut an employee might start to clean the adjacent table and hope they get the hint.\u201dAnd if that doesn\u2019t work, eventually the furniture will send a message. \u201cThe seating isn\u2019t all that comfortable\u201d for long sessions, she said.He sees them as the nascent regulars of tomorrow \u2014 and with 300 seats, he can afford to invest 85 to 90 cafe and patio seats in the future, and still maintain a no-laptop policy in the main dining room.He employs subtle means to influence the behavior of working customers. Logging in for two hours of free Wi-Fi requires the user\u2019s email address, which goes onto the Rose\u2019s mailing list \u2014 and while people can log right back in, the expiration reminds them that it might be time to order another round. Servers circulate to ask if they can get something else for a customer tied to his electronic devices. And Wi-Fi service ends at 5:30 p.m., to signal that the workday has ended and dinner service is about to begin.Mr. Neroni tried extending the Wi-Fi until 7 one night, \u201cas an experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople looked up and figured we forgot to turn it off. And it was \u2018Oh, boy,\u2019 and a line of people carrying their open laptops into the dining room so they could keep working.\u201d He reminded the disappointed throng of the dining-room no-laptop policy and resumed the 5:30 cutoff.Like most cafes, the Rose doesn\u2019t provide electrical outlets; a dwindling battery should be a sign that it\u2019s time to go.Her self-imposed rules include working in one cafe or restaurant no more than three mornings a week, for no more than three hours at a stretch. She always orders a coffee and pastry, and frequently a lunch to go. Then she packs up and heads to another spot on her preferred list.The only casualty of the plan is her social life, which she had hoped might include the Rose as well: She tried a weekend brunch there, only to realize that it felt too much like the office.\u201cI couldn\u2019t enjoy myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept feeling that I ought to be working.\u201dHe budgets $350 a month to cover coffee, frequent breakfasts and lunch to go if he\u2019s headed straight to a meeting. Business lunches or drinks are always at the Rose \u2014 and yet he figures his home away from home still costs about $100 less than a shared work space.But there\u2019s a big gap between a customer who invests in his remote work space and one who rips the wallpaper to get at an outlet. Cafe owners find it difficult to define a consistent strategy without a proven, profitable relationship model.Mr. Glanville yanked the Wi-Fi at Go Get Em Tiger, but he provides it at two other locations that are not as much of a hub for remote workers. He\u2019ll do so again at a smaller fourth cafe opening this spring in Highland Park, in northeastern Los Angeles.He can\u2019t imagine that remote workers will find the new place a comfortable home, so he has decided to take a chance and accommodate people who want recreational access.Still, there\u2019s no way to know for sure if the working masses will turn up. \u201cIf they can figure out how to work squished into 15 seats with Prince blaring on the sound system,\u201d he said, with a shrug, \u201cmore power to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Is there a way to deliver the impact I like my food to have \u2014 surprising, complex, bold and, of course, delicious \u2014 without having to put together 18 ingredients and set aside the two hours my sister can\u2019t spare when cooking for her family? The short answer to this question is yes, but there is more to it than that.In the next few months, I\u2019ll be using these pages to offer two variations on a theme in each column: one recipe that you can whip up quickly without breaking your back or your bank balance; another one that will be a more involved, special occasion kind of dish in which you\u2019ll happily invest time and resources. My hope is that two versions on a common theme will allow you, the reader, and me to better understand the particular conditions under which we cook and the kind of dishes that work best. It will also offer extra-busy people (like my dear sister) an opportunity to try out the particular ingredients and flavor combinations I get so excited about.My focus today is salmon. I am taking inspiration for these two recipes from the two tips of Europe: Sweden at the very north for my \u201cepic\u201d recipe and Sicily in the south for the everyday version.I give a traditional Nordic laxpudding, a cozy bake of potatoes, salmon and dill, bright Mediterranean touches from capers and lemon. And a quick pan-seared fillet, that most modern of preparations, benefits from the classic Sicilian contrast of currants, olives and pine nuts. How the fish is cooked is entirely different in these two versions but, put together, they show the versatility of salmon and how well it adapts to different culinary circumstances.My sister promises to try it both ways.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Which is O.K. sometimes! On a recent Friday night (the museum is open until 11 p.m.), I watched young couples having a great time in front of Mr. Araki\u2019s images, tittering at the naughtier pictures, looking closely at the sheen of a silk kimono over scratchy, taut cordage. These pictures are much more than erotica, but the curators have done their job, and hey, some museumgoers ogle David and the Venus de Milo too.Still, rope is for Mr. Araki what blue paint was for Yves Klein, and at the Museum of Sex especially, bondage is given particular prominence. His tied-up models are rarely fully nude, and usually have their eyes locked on the lens. They do not smile, but do not struggle either. A small fraction of his photographs objectify his models, but in the vast majority the bound women are in utter command. His most impressive bondage pictures are shot in saturated color, with rich reds and greens, but the black-and-white ones can at times feel ponderous, too much like porn with a pedigree.Given the subject, and given, too, the locale, the curators\u2019 wall texts in this section are models of gravity and social responsibility. They note that Mr. Araki and his models sometimes have sex, and that the models themselves regularly speak of their \u201cabsolute consent.\u201d (Last year, as the texts acknowledge, one model went to Facebook to allege lewd behavior by Mr. Araki on a commercial shoot in 1990.) The show also smartly includes video interviews with several models, who speak of their work as consensual, fulfilling, and, most revealingly, collaborative. His intrepid model Shino, instantly recognizable with her freckled, elongated face, explains that posing in bondage \u201cwas really like the extension of a relationship.\u201d The model Komari uses the same analogy: \u201cEven as a model our relationship is one of two human beings.\u201dThese women\u2019s words are worth recalling as you look at Shino in her open kimono, or when you behold Komari with her legs splayed open in front of a carmine wall. Among the many things to like about \u201cThe Incomplete Araki,\u201d perhaps the most important is its insistence on the agency of women in the construction of these images, even amid power imbalances that can never be fully erased. Consider, too, Mr. Araki\u2019s series \u201cEros of a Married Woman,\u201d for which hundreds of everyday citizens have applied to pose. He has produced 20 of these books, displayed here amid hundreds of other publications that testify to the diversity of his titanic output.slide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Bell Pottinger, P.R. Firm for Despots and Rogues, Met Its End in South Africa", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "The British firm Bell Pottinger, hired by three brothers now caught up in a nationwide corruption scandal, helped drive racial tensions to levels not felt since apartheid.Supported byThis is ironic because Bell Pottinger always seemed defiantly beyond shame. During its 30 years in the upper echelons of Britain\u2019s spin doctoring game, it sought to polish the image of dictators (Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus), repressive regimes (Bahrain and Egypt, to name two) and celebrities accused of despicable crimes (the Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius after he was charged with murder).As the power of the Guptas and their holding company, Oakbay Investments, gained attention, the family wanted the public relations equivalent of a stun grenade \u2014 a distraction that would draw attention away from them and onto their many enemies.So Bell Pottinger was retained, and given an assignment that initially sounded benign enough: grass-roots political activism intended to help poor blacks.By the following year, Bell Pottinger was embroiled in a national maelstrom. In TV reports, editorials and public rallies, it stood accused of setting off racial tensions through a furtive campaign built on Twitter bots, hate-filled websites and speeches. All were pushing a highly toxic narrative, namely that whites in South Africa had seized resources and wealth while they deprived blacks of education and jobs. The message was popularized with an incendiary phrase, \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201dHow Bell Pottinger went bankrupt is a tale of corporate skulduggery that seems lifted from \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the P.R. edition. During the Gupta disaster, a vicious boardroom struggle unfolded, one that pitted a co-founder, Tim Bell, against James Henderson, 53, who ran the firm in the years before it went under. Their conflict centered on the perennials of business potboilers, namely power and money.The scandal has engulfed the nation. Mr. Zuma is a member of the African National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela and post-apartheid comity. His alliance with the Guptas, and their exploitation of racial animosity, has underscored just how far the party has wandered from its roots after winning its first election in 1994.Though the only corporate fatality, Bell Pottinger is just one of the companies tainted by the Guptas. A small coterie of multinationals is now under investigation by South African authorities, including local units of three companies, McKinsey, KPMG and the software giant SAP.The Guptas\u2019 most devastating legacy is the harm they did to the cause of economic reform. With so many blacks in South Africa mired in poverty, the topic is urgent, but discussion about it has been debased by its association with a notorious and self-serving P.R. campaign.In the midst of that campaign, racial tensions rose to levels that had not been felt since apartheid. \u201cWhite monopoly capital,\u201d a phrase that for years had been confined to left-wing academic circles, was suddenly unavoidable. A political group with reported links to the Guptas warned of a coming civil war.When Bell Pottinger\u2019s role became public, protesters rallied against the company, both in South Africa and outside the firm\u2019s London office. A subsequent investigation by the Public Relations and Communications Association, a trade group in Britain, ended with the ejection of Bell Pottinger.\u201cIn my years of running the P.R.C.A., I have never seen anything worse, never seen anything equal to it,\u201d Francis Ingham, director general of the trade association, said in an interview. \u201cThe work was on a completely new scale of awfulness. Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201dWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.London is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.It was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\u201cMorality is a job for priests,\u201d he deadpanned in a recent interview, between puffs of an ever-present cigarette. \u201cNot P.R. men.\u201dWith the company co-founder, Piers Pottinger, Mr. Bell conceived a \u201cgo anywhere, do anything\u201d ethos, as they called it. When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.Bell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.This included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.After two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.When the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.In fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.The Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.Fret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201dMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201dBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201dThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201dThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201dSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.The corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.The billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201dBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.Mr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.For his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201dThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.More than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.There were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.As the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.An atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201dNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201dFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\u201cMe and others felt that there was something strange going on under the surface of this onslaught,\u201d said Pieter-Louis Myburgh, author of \u201cThe Republic of Gupta.\u201d \u201cLong before Bell Pottinger\u2019s role became known, we smelled a rat.\u201dThe campaign coincided with a period in which the Guptas badly needed a makeover. The brothers had moved to South Africa from Uttar Pradesh in India in 1993 at the behest of their father, who thought the end of apartheid was a terrific business opportunity. The Guptas befriended a variety of A.N.C. luminaries, including Mr. Zuma.Relationships with politicians were soon producing results, said Mr. Myburgh. In 2016, South Africa\u2019s Sunday Times listed Atul Gupta as the seventh richest man in the country, with a net worth equivalent to more than $700 million.The brothers had operated in relative obscurity until 2013, when a jet filled with some 200 guests attending the four-day wedding of a Gupta niece was given permission by a highly placed official to land at an air force base that ordinarily barred commercial traffic. The public was incensed.From there, the publicity would only get worse. Politicians described being summoned to the Gupta compound and offered ministerial jobs and, on occasion, multimillion-dollar bribes.In March 2016, a onetime A.N.C. member of Parliament named Vytjie Mentor wrote on Facebook, and later in a sworn affidavit, that the Guptas said she could become minister of public enterprises, though only if she helped cancel the India route flown by South African Airways. (The Guptas had links to a rival.) When she declined, Jacob Zuma ambled into the room and told her, in Zulu, \u201cIt\u2019s OK, girl. Take care of yourself,\u201d according to the affidavit.Bell Pottinger\u2019s work for the Guptas was not widely known until November 2016, when a video interview of Ajay Gupta, arranged by the company, leaked to the media. The content of the interview was largely banal. It was proof, though, that one of Britain\u2019s most famous P.R. firms was helping the brothers.The leak alarmed Mr. Henderson because the video resided exclusively on the company\u2019s servers. Mr. Henderson hired Pelican Worldwide, a corporate intelligence firm, to determine whether someone had hacked Bell Pottinger\u2019s system. When no signs of hacking were found, suspicion inside the company fell on Jonathan Lehrle and Darren Murphy, two executives who would depart in December 2016 and start a new P.R. firm with Mr. Bell.Both men deny involvement.Bell Pottinger\u2019s links to the Guptas went full-on radioactive in March of last year, when a mysterious 21-page report was posted on the website of the South African Communist Party. Written anonymously and without any cited sources, the report laid out the history of Bell Pottinger\u2019s work for the Guptas, tagging the firm as the brains behind Twitter hashtags, like #HandsofftheGuptas and an array of bogus social media accounts.Mr. Henderson issued a news release asserting the report contained statements that were \u201cwholly untrue.\u201dHe had a point.Instead, the role of Bell Pottinger was to keep a close eye on social media related to the Guptas and their enemies. A cache of some 200,000 internal documents, christened the GuptaLeaks, that wound up in the media last summer, includes a Bell Pottinger presentation titled \u201cGupta Family online landscape briefing document.\u201d It tracks mentions of the Guptas and a list of hashtags and keywords, some pro-Gupta, some anti-Gupta.\u201cSentiment is more positive in conversations online compared to yesterday,\u201d the report states.Likewise, there is scant evidence that Bell Pottinger promoted \u201cwhite monopoly capital,\u201d the phrase that helped doom it. A law firm report commissioned by the company later concluded that employees of the firm had used the phrase \u201con occasion.\u201d That is more often than is defensible, though it hardly explains the term\u2019s sudden vogue.The 21-page document had credibility, however, because it contained details that only insiders could have known, some of which were utterly gratuitous. Like the cost to rent the Italian villa for the wedding of Victoria Geoghegan, the Bell Pottinger executive who led the South African team.A few days after the report went public, an anti-Zuma demonstration in South Africa included anti-Bell Pottinger placards. One showed a photograph of Ms. Geoghegan with blood dripping from her lips and the words \u201cGupta\u2019s Girl\u201d over her head. A demonstration in front of Bell Pottinger\u2019s London office soon followed.In April, Bell Pottinger canceled its deal with the Guptas, citing \u201cincreasingly strong social media attacks on our staff and our business.\u201d It didn\u2019t help.Nor did Mr. Henderson\u2019s \u201cunequivocal and absolute apology\u201d in July, or his resignation in September the day before Britain\u2019s P.R. trade group tossed out Bell Pottinger. The company suffered \u00a38 million worth of client losses in 48 hours and layoffs began soon after.Other companies linked, both directly and indirectly, with the Guptas are just beginning to deal with fallout of their own. The South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission is pursuing criminal complaints that emerged from an investigation into state contracts and the Gupta-Zuma nexus, which have ensnared KPMG, SAP and McKinsey.A spokeswoman for KPMG said in a statement that apologies have been made \u201cto those affected,\u201d adding that nine senior partners at the company had departed. SAP issued a statement in October apologizing \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d and noting that three staff members had been placed on leave. McKinsey has denied involvement in acts of bribery or corruption and issued a statement saying, \u201cWe are sorry for the distress this matter has caused the people of South Africa.\u201dFor its part, Bell Pottinger never shook allegations that it ran that vitriolic social media campaign, nor that it was responsible for injecting \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d into the national dialogue.Clearly, Bell Pottinger was not an innocent bystander, and for a crisis management firm, it did a terrible job of managing this crisis. At least a dozen chances were missed to avert calamity.\u201cAs chief executive at the time, I take culpability for not closing down the account in the early stages,\u201d Mr. Henderson said in an interview. \u201cWhilst I was not involved at any time in any way in the account, I should have taken action earlier.\u201dIts errors notwithstanding, the company ended up being blamed for an even greater number of misdeeds than it actually committed, and it is worth asking how that happened.Former employees contend that they were the target of \u2014 what else? \u2014 a furtive P.R. campaign.Inside Bell Pottinger, it was widely believed that Mr. Bell wanted to damage the company just enough to weaken Mr. Henderson and compel a change of leadership.\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, who stated that he had nothing to do with the 21-page report. At the same time, he readily acknowledges that he started plans to take control of Bell Pottinger as soon as he left it. He hoped to line up investors and buy up enough shares to force out Mr. Henderson. He said he abandoned the plan after deciding that the firm was beyond saving.The Gupta-Bell Pottinger campaign backfired on just about everyone, especially the Guptas. In an August statement, the brothers said they intended to sell all of their South African holdings by the end of 2017.Mr. Zuma could soon be removed by his party over issues of corruption and the stagnant economy. His term was supposed to end in 2019, but Cyril Ramaphosa, the man who became head of the A.N.C. in December, has called for Mr. Zuma to step down. A judicial inquiry was recently announced to investigate \u201cstate capture\u201d and the president\u2019s relationship to the Guptas.A spokesman for the Guptas did not return emails. President Zuma has repeatedly denied all accusations of corruption.Mr. Henderson lost everything when the firm failed, starting with his reputation. He became known as the guy in charge of a public relations company that perished in a public relations fiasco.The British media reported that he lost his entire life\u2019s savings when Bell Pottinger evaporated and for a time, he also seemed to have lost his fianc\u00e9e. The American socialite Heather Kerzner had invested a sizable chunk of her personal wealth in Bell Pottinger four months before it went under. The wedding was originally scheduled for November. Mr. Henderson said the couple hoped to marry.\u201cThat\u2019s our intention,\u201d he said.But arguably the greatest casualty of the Gupta-Bell Pottinger campaign is the very cause it nominally championed, helping impoverished blacks. Like most propaganda, the ideas promoted by the Guptas contained kernels of truth. The economic advancement of blacks postapartheid has indeed been painfully slow.The topic is now exponentially more fraught, given its association with the Guptas, who tried to use it as a way to enrich themselves and expand their power. For a young democracy that is grappling with a history of institutionalized racism and trying to spread wealth more evenly throughout the country, the results have been tragic.\u201cThe damage done by this campaign is not over,\u201d said Sipho Pityana, a businessman who headed the Department of Labour under the Mandela administration. \u201cIt shapes the discourse about inequality in South Africa to this day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

How easy is it to change people\u2019s votes in an election?The answer, a growing number of studies conclude, is that most forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all. Here\u2019s what you should look for in evaluating claims about vast persuasion effects from dubious online content:Similarly, my study with Mr. Guess and Mr. Reifler found that the mean number of articles on fake news websites visited by Trump supporters was 13.1, but only 40 percent of his supporters visited such websites, and they represented only about 6 percent of the pages they visited on sites focusing on news topics. None of these findings indicate that fake news and bots aren\u2019t worrisome signs for American democracy.

But the company\u2019s whole business model is based on giving ads and posts prominence in the feeds of well-targeted users.Questions for Facebook:Has Facebook performed any analyses that looks at smaller groups of people?If so, can Facebook share them?And how did the ads perform before and after the election?Mr. Mueller\u2019s latest indictment says that, after the middle of 2016, Russians often talked about targeting \u201cpurple states,\u201d or those in which the number of Republican and Democratic voters are close. The indictment also describes the Russians as focused on Florida, which Mr. Trump ended up winning.\u201cOn or about August 4, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators created and purchased Facebook advertisements for the \u2018Florida Goes Trump\u2019 rally. The advertisements reached over 59,000 Facebook users in Florida, and over 8,300 Facebook users responded to the advertisements by clicking on it.\u201d\u201cWhat you haven\u2019t heard is that almost five times more ads were targeted at Maryland than Wisconsin. Maryland, which was targeted by 262 ads in comparison to Wisconsin\u2019s 55, wasn\u2019t up for grabs; it was a state the Democratic candidate carried by 26 percent.\u201dQuestions for Facebook: Do the company\u2019s records show that Russia-backed ads and posts reached a higher number of people in certain states or regions of the United States?If so, how responsive were Facebook users in those targeted regions to the Russian posts and ads?Blacktivist, a Russia-linked group whose often inflammatory content set it apart from legitimate groups championing African-American rights, had 14,000 followers at the end of 2015. By the time its Facebook page was shut down last year, it had 390,000, according to Mr. Albright\u2019s data \u2014 a hugely successful ramp up that took Blacktivist\u2019s total followers above that for Black Lives Matter. Other Russian-created groups, like Heart of Texas, also showed huge increases in followers.Questions for Facebook:How exactly were these groups able to scoop up so many members so quickly?Did the speed of the increases wave any red flags internally at Facebook?To what extent did Facebook\u2019s ad targeting tools, which allow advertisers to reach specific groups of people, enable Russia to put incendiary posts in the feeds of certain groups?It may well be the case that Russian disinformation did not swing the election for Mr. Trump. But it may have had far more of an impact than the public knows. And Facebook is almost certainly sitting on data that could deepen the nation\u2019s understanding of what went on.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it would it look like if we had all the data,\u201d Mr. Albright said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Bitcoin Bubble Loses Air, Frauds and Flaws Rise to Surface", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 You did not have to be a technophobe to worry that the virtual-currency boom of the past year papered over plenty of problems.The scale of those problems is starting to become clear as digital tokens have slid more than 50 percent in value from their peaks in early January, with steep drops on Monday pushing the value of Bitcoin specifically below $7,000.Hackers draining funds from online exchanges. Ponzi schemes. Government regulators unable to keep up with the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies. Signs of trouble have appeared at nearly every level of the industry, from the biggest exchanges to the news sites and chat rooms where the investment frenzy has been discussed.Some virtual currency enthusiasts argue that the problems are no different from what has happened in other booms, like the internet bubble of the 1990s. But even true believers say the design of virtual currencies \u2014 meant to cut out middlemen and government authorities \u2014 has made bad behavior more prevalent amid this particular bubble.\u201cCryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,\u201d said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThe combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large. The fact that the money got huge almost overnight, before there were good regulatory or even self-regulatory models in place, made the problem acute.\u201dThe fall from the peaks of early January has been dizzying. The value of all outstanding virtual currencies has been cut by more than half, down over $400 billion as of Monday, according to the website Coinmarketcap.com.Government agencies in the United States have shut down a few notable frauds. Early last month, securities regulators in Texas and North Carolina issued cease-and-desist orders to BitConnect, an operation that had grown to be worth $3 billion.But those moves only came after BitConnect had operated openly for months, collecting hundreds of millions of dollars from people around the world despite being labeled a Ponzi scheme by many prominent people in the virtual currency industry. BitConnect offered tokens on a decentralized network, similar to Bitcoin, but promised regular payouts to coin holders.But regulators have not gotten near most of the brazen schemes that have popped up in the past year, many of which had been attacked by hackers first, or simply shut down by their operators after money had been raised.One challenge facing regulators is that it is unclear how much of the deceptive activity they can legally control.Many schemes have been able to expand quickly because they do not use bank accounts and therefore do not have to win approval from established institutions. Instead, they are able to use virtual currency \u201cwallets\u201d without any approvals. And virtual currency transactions cannot be reversed like normal bank or even PayPal transfers.For investors, some of what has caused the most concern are well-intentioned businesses set up in a hurry with little outside oversight or time to work out kinks.Coincheck, which until last month was one of the largest exchanges in Japan, announced on Jan. 26 that it had lost nearly half a billion dollars of a virtual currency known as NEM, in what appeared to be the largest hack to hit the industry.In the United States, even the most widely used virtual currency company, Coinbase, has struggled to keep up with demand, shutting down trading for hours at particularly important moments, and attracting widespread complaints about its customer service.Most of the newer virtual currency projects borrow their basic design from Bitcoin, which uses a network of computers to maintain its records so that no central government or authority is needed.That design has allowed Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to grow as fast as they have with no regard for international borders, attracting followers from Zimbabwe to South Korea. It has also allowed some of the most talked-about uses of the technology, helping people escape hyperinflation in Venezuela or transfer money across borders with lower fees. But it has also allowed in a lot of bad actors.\u201cIt is a perfect storm for the kind of scammy activity we are seeing, and it\u2019s not obvious to me how that is easily removed,\u201d said Fred Wilson, a partner at the venture capital firm Union Square Venture and one of the earliest advocates of Bitcoin in Silicon Valley. \u201cRegulation, ideally prudent and informed regulation, can help. But we may also need to have a big correction to really clean things up.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Art and Anxiety of Booking a Hit Comedy Showcase", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyOnly 26 tickets sold. The space fits 250. \u201cThat sucks,\u201d she said by phone, and not only for business reasons: a sparse crowd gets self-conscious and is hesitant to laugh. Ms. Ways, 37, has been putting together comedy shows long enough to know she would have to come up with a quick fix.Part of what makes New York the greatest city in the world to see live comedy is the large number of cheap, easily accessible and impressively curated live shows outside the clubs. These were once considered alt comedy; now some (Whiplash on Monday, Sweet on Tuesday) are institutions. Their hosts may get the applause, but the far less well-known bookers are the crucial players who establish the vision and quality control. To understand the art of her job, I followed Ms. Ways for one week, keeping in touch by email and phone to see what went into putting together a lineup.Ms. Ways \u2014 who grew up in west Pennsylvania more of a music fan, but became seduced by the comedy of the sketch series \u201cThe State\u201d \u2014 now books three shows, including ones starring David Cross and another with Sasheer Zamata, but describes them as labors of love. She earned $10,000 from Night Train last year, and said Butterboy will probably bring in less. She makes her living from a company that puts on live events.She had been trying to move away from headliners, drawing audiences based on her show\u2019s reputation as a home for stellar comedy. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an hour special on HBO to be great,\u201d she told me the week before, and that is undeniably true. But sometimes, you do need someone with major credits to fill seats and avert disaster. Factoring in time needed for promotion, she had mere hours to track one down on this particular Monday.There is not only an art to putting together a lineup, but also a politics, especially now, when issues of representation (Ms. Ways always books at least two female comics) and sexual misconduct have roiled the comedy world. Should Louis C.K. and Aziz Ansari return to live stand-up, the first people confronted with a difficult choice will be bookers. Ms. Ways said she would check with her hosts, but probably wouldn\u2019t book Louis C.K., but likely would Mr. Ansari. Then she paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI have very mixed feelings on his situation.\u201dMuch of her time is spent figuring out the right order of comics, a process she describes with a strategic eye. Newcomers or comics who do particularly provocative work that might go wrong are slotted in the middle, and she tried to follow with someone who would kill. She knew Mr. Smith would deliver a crowd-pleasing set so she scheduled him last. She focused more on mulling over the right opener.It\u2019s essential to start the show with the strongest or second strongest comic, she said, preferably someone with high energy. \u201cLeah is more a storyteller, which might mean a slow build, so I wouldn\u2019t start with her,\u201d Ms. Ways said, preferring to begin with someone who gets laughs fast. \u201cThat leaves Eman. She has great energy.\u201dBut come Monday, what was still missing was a headliner. Her hunt began by scouring late-night television guest lists. Wanda Sykes, whom she has never booked, was in town for \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d Showcasing her would be a coup, but Ms. Ways reconsidered in light of the low presales: playing in front of a small crowd would be a terrible way to introduce Butterboy to Ms. Sykes. Then she turned to go-to stars. Jim Gaffigan had just performed last week at Butterboy. Mr. Cross, who has a baby girl with his wife, Amber Tamblyn, would probably be busy with child care (she tried anyway; no luck). She contacted Mr. Cenac, Michael Che, Todd Barry, Janeane Garofalo, Mike Birbiglia, Roy Wood Jr. and Phoebe Robinson.By 2 p.m. Monday, the day of the show, when she hoped to be promoting it online, Ms. Ways had heard only polite rejections, and started striking a different tone. She said her anxiety was fading as she accepted that her lineup was good enough. Minutes later, Mr. Cenac and Mr. Che said they couldn\u2019t do it, and Ms. Ways said, \u201cI haven\u2019t struck out this much since I was on the softball team in third grade!\u201dMs. Ways arrived at Littlefield an hour early and ordered pizza for the comics, who earn $30 apiece for performing. She shares her cut of the door with the hosts. When the comics arrived, Ms. Ways greeted them warmly, a hurricane of energy, complimenting outfits, doling out hugs and cracking jokes to keep the mood light. Backstage she was relaxed. Out front, she was more tense, checking her phone and eying the crowd warily. \u201cI don\u2019t like to see these,\u201d she says, pointing out empty chairs, of which there were a few. With walk-ins, the final count was 103.Onstage, after Ms. Firestone bantered charmingly about her bat mitzvah with her co-host, Ms. Higgins (Ms. Nancherla was out of town), Ms. El-Husseini opened strong with honed religious material about being a Muslim married to a Jewish woman. It\u2019s much harder to convert to Judaism, which, she joked, had higher standards. \u201cJesus Christ wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d she added. \u201cThose are standards.\u201dMs. Ways raised her cellphone to indicate the comic had two minutes left. She told her last joke and exited precisely on time. \u201cShe\u2019s a pro,\u201d Ms. Ways said.Mr. Smith dipped his toe into sexual harassment material \u2014 \u201cAll men are creepy until proven not creepy\u201d \u2014 to muffled response, then moved on.Mr. Wood did some #MeToo material with more success, analyzing apologies from disgraced men. \u201cThe only person who did it right was Bill Cosby,\u201d he said to dead silence. \u201cThey hit him with allegations, and he went blind.\u201d The huge laugh built into a roar as the rest of the set went long, nearly 20 minutes. This night ended with a kill, and the sound in the room made it feel packed.At the show, Ms. Ways seemed relieved: \u201cI spend the day worrying to solve problems before they happen,\u201d she said.Her post-mortem the next day, after the final numbers came in, was more balanced, conceding that a fifth of the tickets were comps. Still, they laughed loudly. \u201cThey were small,\u201d she said, \u201cbut mighty.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Both were fired on Wednesday, and the company said it was retraining its N.Y.U. employees.\u201cWe have zero tolerance for any employee who does not adhere to our values or contradicts our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion,\u201d Aramark said in a statement Wednesday evening. \u201cEmployees at N.Y.U. who acted independently and did not follow our approved plan for the celebration of Black History Month have been terminated and are no longer with the company. We are extremely disappointed by this regrettable situation and apologize to the entire N.Y.U. community and communities everywhere for their insensitive and offensive actions.\u201dMs. Harris was initially told by the dining hall\u2019s head cook that the employees who made up the menu were black. But later, she said on Sunday, she and other students learned from university officials that the Kool-Aid and watermelon water were the work of white employees; black employees were consulted only on the food offerings, not the drinks.The fired workers \u2014 the dining hall\u2019s general manager and head cook \u2014 are both white men, she said.A statement from the university\u2019s Governance Council of Minority and Marginalized Students said the same, and attributed the information to three N.Y.U. officials who work on diversity and multicultural initiatives: Lisa Coleman, Monroe France and Leah Lattimore. The officials could not be reached for comment Sunday afternoon. But an Aramark spokeswoman said that \u201cone of the two managers who was terminated was a person of color, and the other was not.\u201dIn a phone interview Wednesday evening, Ms. Harris said she chose to believe that the Aramark employees had acted out of ignorance of their menu\u2019s implications, not out of malice. But she added that it should not have been her responsibility to point out the problem \u2014 one that she said went far beyond a single incident.\u201cI would consider today a victory,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also very important that we had to publicize it in order to put the pressure on them to do the right thing, because I feel like had I not publicized it, this could have gone a little bit differently.\u201dKayla Eubanks, a sophomore studying neuroscience, said in an interview last week that most of the students and faculty members she had spoken to were unaware of the incident.\u201cThey can\u2019t address a problem they don\u2019t know exists,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know the issues that we\u2019re facing, so they can\u2019t even be held accountable.\u201dOn a daily basis, Ms. Harris said, she and other black students are \u201cdoing the same work and we\u2019re getting the same grades as you, and we\u2019re doing this extra work, teaching people how to be sensitive to us.\u201d\u201cThe burden of teaching people how to be respectful to us is falling on us,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Names and Faces of the Florida School Shooting Victims", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs gunshots echoed through the high school, a geography teacher, Scott Beigel, 35, paused to usher stragglers into his classroom before locking the door, only to be shot and killed himself as the shooter strode by.A parent, Jennifer Zeif, credited Mr. Beigel for saving her son\u2019s life. Her son, Matthew, 14, had been the last one to slip inside the class, just ahead of Mr. Beigel. Seconds later, the room filled with a smoky haze, Matthew said, and he turned to see his teacher lying near the door, pale and bleeding.\u201cMr. Beigel could have passed Matthew up and gone in the classroom first,\u201d Ms. Zeif said. \u201cIn that case, Matthew would have been the one in the doorway.\u201dOn Thursday, as officials identified 17 people killed in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., some of the victims, like Mr. Beigel, were remembered for having tried to spare others in the moments of chaos that unfolded inside the school.Aaron Feis, a popular football coach who was killed, also had tried to protect students, officials said. \u201cHe was that kind of guy,\u201d said Jack Fris, a former football player at the school.Friends said they were not surprised that Mr. Beigel, a much-beloved figure at a Pennsylvania summer camp that he attended and later helped to run, had put his students\u2019 safety above his own.\u201cThousands of people at Camp Starlight looked up to Scott,\u201d said Grant Williams, 33, an emergency room nurse who worked with Mr. Beigel at the camp for several summers and was mourning long-distance with former camp counselors and campers on Thursday. \u201cHe was someone you strive to be like,\u201d said another former Starlight counselor.At the Florida high school, teachers and students were among the dead. There was a soccer player, a student nicknamed Guac and a trombonist in the marching band. Eight of the victims were girls and young women; nine were boys and men. They ranged from 14 years old to 49.These are some of their stories.Alyssa Alhadeff, 14, had played competitive soccer since she was 3 years old. Like any athlete, she had her ups and downs. But when her club, Parkland, faced off against the rival team from Coral Springs on Feb. 13, she was at the top of her game.\u201cHer passing was on, her shooting was on, her decision-making was on,\u201d her mother, Lori Alhadeff, recalled. With her outgoing personality, Alyssa had a wide circle of friends at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. She placed first in a debate tournament, was taking Algebra 2 and Spanish 3, and was honing her skills as an attacking midfielder. The score at what was to be her last time on the soccer field was 1-0, Parkland.\u201cI was so proud of her,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI told her it was the best game of her life.\u201d\u201cHe was sweet and caring and loved by all his family,\u201d Miguel wrote. \u201cMost of all he was my baby brother.\u201dNicholas Dworet, a promising high school swimmer, took a recruiting visit to the University of Indianapolis a few weeks ago. After a group dinner, he pulled the coach aside and said he wanted to compete there after he graduated this spring.\u201cHe was an instant part of our family,\u201d said Jason Hite, the university\u2019s swim coach. Mr. Hite said Nicholas, 17, had received an academic scholarship and planned to study physical therapy.Nicholas had improved academically and athletically since starting high school, Mr. Hite said, and his mentors in Florida \u201cfelt like the best was still to come for him.\u201d\u201cWe were going to continue to groom him to be a future leader for our team,\u201d Mr. Hite said.Mr. Hite said he sent Nicholas a text message on Wednesday afternoon after hearing about the shooting at his school. He got no response.\u201cThe saddest thing to me is how much life this kid had and how hard he had worked to change directions and change paths,\u201d Mr. Hite said. \u201cHe was really going in the right direction and he had really created some opportunities for himself.\u201dAt Stoneman Douglas, Mr. Feis was known to all \u2014 an assistant football coach and a security monitor. But he too had graduated from the school, played on the football team, and knew exactly what it was like to be a student in these halls.So he was seen as someone who looked out for students who got in trouble, those who were struggling, those without fathers at home. \u201cThey said he was like another father,\u201d Mr. Feis\u2019s grandfather, Raymond, recalled. \u201cHe\u2019d go out of his way to help anybody.\u201dSchool officials said that Mr. Feis, 37, did the same on Wednesday. When there were signs of trouble, they said, he responded immediately to help. \u201cWhen Aaron Feis died, when he was killed \u2014 tragically, inhumanely \u2014 he did it protecting others; you can guarantee that,\u201d said Scott Israel, the sheriff of Broward County.\u201cI don\u2019t know when Aaron\u2019s funeral is,\u201d Sheriff Israel said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many adults are going to go, but you\u2019ll get 2,000 kids there.\u201dIn Parkland, Austin Lazar, a student, recalled his former coach as cheery and selfless. \u201cHe always put everybody before himself.\u201dMr. Feis was married, his family said, and had a daughter, Arielle.Her father, Fred Guttenberg, posted this on Facebook: \u201cI am broken as I write this trying to figure out how my family gets through this.\u201dChristopher Hixon, 49, the school\u2019s athletic director, was a well-known figure in Florida high school sports. One man, Jose Roman, posted on social media that Mr. Hixon was \u201ca great coach and an awesome motivator\u201d when he was a freshman athlete years ago.Mr. Hixon was named athletic director of the year in 2017 by the Broward County Athletics Association.Luke Hoyer, 15, spent last Christmas with his extended family in South Carolina, where he bowled, joined in a big holiday meal and swapped stories with relatives.A cousin, Grant Cox, who was at the Christmas gathering said the family had been told by the police that Luke, a freshman at Stoneman Douglas, was among those killed on Wednesday.Mr. Cox said Luke was a basketball player who was ambitious about the sport and admired N.B.A. stars like LeBron James and Stephen Curry.\u201cI know Luke loved his family,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cI know he did. He had a huge heart.\u201d\u201cHe was quiet, but a very happy individual,\u201d he said.Cara Loughran, 14, loved the beach. She adored her cousins. And she was an excellent student, her family said.Gina Montalto, 14, was identified in local news accounts as a member of her school\u2019s winter color guard team.Andy Mroczek, who has worked as a choreographer at Stoneman Douglas, posted a tribute to Gina on Facebook. \u201cWe lost a beautiful soul tonight,\u201d he wrote.People often spelled Joaquin Oliver\u2019s first name wrong, so he went with a snappy nickname: Guac.He played basketball in the city recreational league \u2014 his jersey number was 2 \u2014 and he loved to write, filling a notebook with poetry, said Julien Decoste, a close friend of Joaquin\u2019s and a fellow senior at Stoneman Douglas.\u201cGuac and I always wanted to graduate together and prove everyone wrong, that we would be successful together,\u201d Julien said.On Tuesday, Joaquin, 17, asked Julien to help out at his next basketball game, which was scheduled for Thursday.\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Julien texted his friend. \u201cGood looks brotha,\u201d Joaquin responded.On Wednesday, as he hid inside a closet during the shooting, Julien texted Joaquin to check in.\u201cYou good?\u201d Julien texted. \u201cBro I need you to answer me please.\u201dAlaina Petty, 14, had helped do cleanup work in Florida after Hurricane Irma, her family said in a statement, and she was an active member of a volunteer group with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\u201cHer selfless service brought peace and joy to those that had lost everything during the storm,\u201d the family\u2019s statement said. \u201cWhile we will not have the opportunity to watch her grow up and become the amazing woman we know she would become, we are keeping an eternal perspective.\u201dAlaina was also a member of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, her family said.Meadow Pollack, 18, was a senior at the high school who was planning to go to Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., next year, according to her father, Andrew Pollack, who said his daughter was among the dead.\u201cShe was just unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Pollack said. \u201cShe was a very strong-willed young girl who had everything going for her.\u201dMr. Pollack described his daughter as smart, beautiful and caring. She worked at her boyfriend\u2019s family\u2019s motorcycle repair business.\u201cShe just knew how to get what she wanted all the time,\u201d Mr. Pollack said. \u201cNothing could ever stop her from what she wanted to achieve.\u201dHelena Ramsay, 17, was smart, kindhearted and thoughtful, her relative, Curtis Page, wrote on Facebook.\u201cThough she was somewhat reserved, she had a relentless motivation towards her academic studies, and her soft warm demeanor brought the best out in all who knew her,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cShe would have started college next year.\u201dAlex Schachter, 14, played the trombone in the Stoneman Douglas marching band, and was proud to have participated in winning a state championship last year. A freshman at the high school, he often played basketball with friends and was \u201ca sweetheart of a kid,\u201d his father, Max Schachter, said. Earlier this week, the two had discussed which classes Alex would take next semester.Mr. Schachter said Alex had loved his mother, who died when he was five years old. His older brother also attends Stoneman Douglas and survived the shooting. Alex \u201cjust wanted to do well and make his parents happy,\u201d his father said.\u201cI\u2019m in a daze right now,\u201d he wrote.Peter Wang, 15, a freshman, helped his cousin, Aaron Chen, adjust when he settled in Florida.\u201cHe was always so nice and so generous,\u201d Aaron, 16, said, adding that even though Peter was younger he had worked to be sure Aaron didn\u2019t get bullied when he first arrived.Peter was last seen in his gray uniform for the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, or J.R.O.T.C., on Wednesday. On Thursday, Aaron and another cousin said the authorities had informed the family that Peter was among those killed in the shooting.\u201cHe was the kid in school who would be friends with anyone,\u201d said the other cousin, Lin Chen, 24. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care about popularity.\u201dAudra D.S.

{"Headline": "YouTube Revamped Its Ad System. AT&T Still Hasn\u2019t Returned.", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAT&T, one of the nation\u2019s biggest marketers, has yet to return to YouTube nearly a year after pulling its advertising from the platform because of concerns that it could appear alongside offensive material.But that has not been enough for AT&T, which wants YouTube to get \u201cas close to zero tolerance for this issue as possible,\u201d Fiona Carter, the company\u2019s chief brand officer, said in a recent interview.\u201cIt became apparent to us as we worked through this that too much of the content our advertising could appear against was not brand safe \u2014 it was objectionable by any measure,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cYou really have an epiphany when you see some of that content.\u201dShe added, \u201cOur findings are that no matter the algorithm or the filters or the formula that you currently apply, nothing beats human review.\u201dOver the past year, major marketers have been demanding more accountability from Google, Facebook and the rest of the digital advertising ecosystem, as they have come to the conclusion that the same algorithmic tools that allow unprecedented access to consumers can be used to spread misinformation, hate speech and harmful videos that target children. On Monday, Keith Weed, the chief marketing officer of Unilever, called on tech companies to take greater responsibility for what appears on their sites and said that his company would not invest in platforms \u201cthat do not protect our children or which create division in society and promote anger or hate.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about the digital supply chain for several years but what happened last year is it became a societal issue, a people issue,\u201d Mr. Weed said in an interview after delivering remarks on eroding trust in tech companies at an industry conference in Palm Desert, Calif.Mr. Weed said that while he would pull dollars from the platforms \u201cif something happened which was completely inappropriate for our brands or our business,\u201d he wanted to work with the companies to improve their sites.\u201cWhat I\u2019m not doing is giving some sort of public ultimatum,\u201d he said.Brian Wieser, a media analyst at Pivotal Research, said that marketers were clearly having an influence.\u201cIf they said nothing then the only thing that would cause the platforms to act is the risk of government regulation,\u201d he said.But Unilever, he said, was not taking an especially hard line with the tech companies as far as its advertising budget. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they set a threshold and said companies who don\u2019t do this lose their money specifically,\u201d he said.Mr. Weed reiterated that position on Monday.\u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about here is moving the conversation along,\u201d he said.Unilever, for example, has been talking with YouTube about implementing more human screening of videos that include children to make sure that they are not being exploited.\u201cThere is nothing we take more seriously than the trust and safety of our users, customers and partners, and we will continue to work to earn that trust every day,\u201d a Google spokesperson said of Mr. Weed\u2019s remarks.Even though AT&T hasn\u2019t been spending money on YouTube ads in the past year, it has worked closely with the platform to improve its systems and is eager to have its ads again seen by YouTube\u2019s huge audience of teen and twentysomething viewers. YouTube has said that its manual reviews of Google Preferred channels would be complete by the end of March.\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful we can get back onto YouTube,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cIt delivers the scale we want but we had to roll up our sleeves and find that performance elsewhere.\u201dAT&T spent more than $1 billion on advertising in the United States last year through September, while Unilever spent $644 million, according to data from Kantar Media. AT&T was the sixth-biggest advertiser in the country during that period, Unilever was No. 16.AT&T also said that it would audit its programmatic ad spending in coming months, as it tries to better understand the process through which technology and automation place its online ads in front of consumers. That realm of advertising has drawn scrutiny from marketers in recent years amid reports that much of their spending, which is difficult to trace, is going to tech companies and agency fees rather than publishers.Ms. Carter said that it would be working with its agency, Omnicom\u2019s Hearts & Science, and the firms AdFin and Amino Payments to figure out how its money moves through those systems.\u201cI believe that marketers, and to a certain extent agency partners, have not been in control of the way the advertising process is moving,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon us to drive the key issues and shine a light on them and ensure that budgets are being spent in service of the right goals.\u201dAT&T\u2019s efforts underscore the strange world that advertisers are navigating online.\u201cFive, six, seven years ago, the majority of spend was in TV, print, even outdoor, and you had absolute clarity in where your advertising was appearing but far less data around who you were advertising against,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cWe\u2019ve flipped that now.\u201cWe have incredible data and insights into the people we\u2019re advertising against, but we no longer are really seeing across the digital ecosystem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Place With Room to Grow", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntA decade ago, Brad Archer was sent to England for work. There, he met his husband-to-be, a colleague named Ross Haynes.The two rented a two-bedroom flat in Crouch End, North London, until Mr. Haynes was offered a job in New York. Then, nearly four years ago, they moved into a large one-bedroom rental on Riverside Drive, paying in the low $3,000s a month.When they married three years ago and took the surname Archer-Haynes, their plans included adopting a child or two, so they knew more space would be required. Friends urged them to simply section off the dining room and use that as a bedroom.\u201cWe saw friends making huge sacrifices to stay in Manhattan,\u201d said Brad, 38, who works in marketing for Viacom International. (Ross, 32, works in retail marketing for Nickelodeon.)But they wanted not just a second bedroom, but a third, to accommodate Ross\u2019s parents on extended visits from their home in Dorset, England. Even if they spent $1 million, though, the couple knew their options would be limited in the city. So nearly two years ago, they began to consider the suburbs, where they discovered they could get at least three bedrooms for around $700,000.But they wanted to be within walking distance of the New Jersey Transit station, and \u201cthat was a big ask,\u201d Brad said.When they realized that property taxes for the homes they were looking at were generally around $15,000 a year, they lowered their target price, dropping into the $600,000s. And at that price point, sellers had the upper hand, Ms. Owens said, with most properties snapped up in a matter of days.Early on, the couple saw a modestly sized house they liked with three bedrooms, listed at $549,000, but they decided to hold out for something bigger. They were confounded when it sold quickly, for $623,000.Then they saw a lovely center-hall colonial with an asking price of $629,000. They offered $660,000, but it sold for $720,000.\u201cWe clearly had no idea what was going on,\u201d Brad said.Listing prices seemed to have little meaning, with houses being bid up by tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cA house would go on the market on a Thursday, and by Monday they were going with 10 offers,\u201d Brad said. \u201cIt created a lot of stress.\u201dLater, the couple saw another center-hall colonial they liked, with an attic that had been turned into a master suite. But it was listed for $719,000 \u2014 more than they wanted to spend \u2014 so they bid less than the asking price. When it sold for $730,000, they were both frustrated and relieved.There were several offers, Ms. Owens said, but theirs was the highest, at $687,000.Their first thought was \u201cHave we actually just done this after two years?\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt was a scary moment, but we loved the house.\u201dThey arrived in the fall with their Boston terrier, Olive, still wondering whether they had paid too much or gotten a great deal.In the beginning, the house seemed too large. \u201cIt was weird, having to go downstairs for your coffee before you went back upstairs,\u201d Brad said.Then, one cold day they arrived home to hear water gurgling in the basement. A dishwasher pipe had burst.\u201cNobody tells you about the bad stuff,\u201d Brad said. \u201cHow could I make it to 38 years old and be so ill-equipped to live in a house? Our life used to be so simple and straightforward.\u201d They shut off the water, contacted their insurance company and hired a plumber.And while they are still furnishing their home, they can envision children there. \u201cWe can actually have a family here and not feel constrained,\u201d Brad said. \u201cI can see our future happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside a 3-Year Russian Campaign to Influence U.S. Voters", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the F.B.I. busted our activity (not a joke),\u201d she wrote of the project in Russia. \u201cSo, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues.\u201d She added, \u201cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\u201dA 37-page indictment, handed up on Friday by a Washington grand jury and charging Ms. Kaverzina and 12 other people with an elaborate conspiracy, showed that she and her colleagues did not, in fact, hide their tracks so well from United States investigators. The charges, brought by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, introduced hard facts to a polarized political debate over Russia\u2019s intervention in American democracy, while not yet implicating President Trump or his associates.The indictment presented in astonishing detail a carefully planned, three-year Russian scheme to incite political discord in the United States, damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and later bolster the candidacy of Donald J. Trump, along with those of Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein. The precise description of the operation suggested that F.B.I. investigators had intercepted communications, found a cooperating insider or both.The field research to guide the attack appears to have begun in earnest in June 2014. Two Russian women, Aleksandra Y. Krylova and Anna V. Bogacheva, obtained visas for what turned out to be a three-week reconnaissance tour of the United States, including to key electoral states like Colorado, Michigan, Nevada and New Mexico. The visa application of a third Russian, Robert S. Bovda, was rejected.The two women bought cameras, SIM cards and disposable cellphones for the trip and devised \u201cevacuation scenarios\u201d in case their real purpose was detected. In all, they visited nine states \u2014 California, Illinois, Louisiana, New York and Texas, in addition to the others \u2014 \u201cto gather intelligence\u201d on American politics, the indictment says. Ms. Krylova sent a report about their findings to one of her bosses in St. Petersburg.Another Russian operative visited Atlanta in November 2014 on a similar mission, the indictment says. It does not name that operative, a possible indication that he or she is cooperating with the investigation, legal experts said.The operation also included the creation of hundreds of email, PayPal and bank accounts and even fraudulent drivers\u2019 licenses issued to fictitious Americans. The Russians also used the identities of real Americans from stolen Social Security numbers.At the height of the 2016 campaign, the effort employed more than 80 people, who used secure virtual private network connections to computer servers leased in the United States to hide the fact that they were in Russia. From there, they posed as American activists, emailing, advising and making payments to real Americans who were duped into believing that they were part of the same cause.The playing field was mainly social media, where the Russians splashed catchy memes and hash tags. Facebook has estimated that the fraudulent Russian posts reached 126 million Americans on its platforms alone.The Russian operatives contacted, among others, a real Texas activist who, evidently assuming they were Americans, advised them to focus on \u201cpurple states like Colorado, Virginia & Florida.\u201d After that, F.B.I. agents found that the phrase \u201cpurple states\u201d became a mantra for the Russian operation.\u201cFrom the beginning, they built this so it could be plausibly denied,\u201d Mr. Watts said. Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied any government role in hacking and disinformation aimed at the United States, while coyly allowing that patriotic Russians may have carried out such attacks on their own.Andrew S. Weiss, a Russia specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called the reported origin of the effort in April 2014 \u201ccrucially important.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a little more than a month after the annexation of Crimea and the launch of Russia\u2019s covert war in eastern Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. The resulting crisis \u201cvaporized U.S.-Russian relations overnight,\u201d he said, setting off multiple Russian efforts \u201cto undermine the United States, both in terms of our leading role in the world, but also via our own domestic political vulnerabilities.\u201dMr. Weiss said the fact that private companies conducted the social media campaign simply made it cheaper and more difficult to trace.Mr. Putin has been angry with Mrs. Clinton since at least 2011, when she was secretary of state and he accused her of inciting unrest in Russia as he faced large-scale political protests. Mrs. Clinton, he said, had sent \u201ca signal\u201d to \u201csome actors in our country\u201d after elections that were condemned as fraudulent by both international and Russian observers.Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment does not present evidence that the campaign overseen by Mr. Prigozhin was ordered by Mr. Putin. American officials have traced other elements of the Russian meddling, notably the hacking and leaking of leading Democrats\u2019 emails, to Russian intelligence agencies carrying out Mr. Putin\u2019s orders.While the indictment certainly undermines Mr. Trump\u2019s blanket assertions that the Russian interference is a political \u201choax,\u201d it does not accuse anyone from his campaign or any other American of knowingly aiding in the effort.By the beginning of 2016, the Russian strategy was in place, and the conspirators began their campaign to sow conflict. An internal message circulated through the Internet Research Agency telling operatives to post content online that focused on \u201cpolitics in the USA.\u201d\u201cUse any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump\u2014we support them),\u201d the message read.The scope of the operation was sweeping. The Russians assumed their fake identities to communicate with campaign volunteers for Mr. Trump and grass-roots groups supporting his candidacy. They bought pro-Trump and anti-Clinton political advertisements on Facebook and other social media. They used an Instagram account to try to suppress turnout of minority voters and campaign for Ms. Stein, the Green Party candidate.Applying nearly two years\u2019 worth of political research, the Russians used all of these tactics to target voters in swing states, notably Florida, according to the indictment.By summer 2016, the Russian operatives were mobilizing efforts for coming \u201cFlorida Goes Trump\u201d rallies across the state, all planned for Aug. 20. Using false identities, they contacted Trump campaign staff in Florida to offer their services. One operative sent a message to a campaign official saying that the group Being Patriotic was organizing a statewide rally \u201cto support Mr. Trump.\u201d\u201cYou know, simple yelling on the internet is not enough,\u201d the message read, according to the indictment. \u201cThere should be real action. We organized rallies in New York before. Now we\u2019re focusing on purple states such as Florida.\u201dTaking to Facebook, the Russians used the pseudonym Matt Skiber to advertise the rally. \u201cIf we lose Florida, we lose America. We can\u2019t let it happen, right? What about organizing a YUGE pro-Trump flash mob in every Florida town?\u201d the message read, using one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite verbal flourishes.They reached out to local organizations to build momentum for the coming rallies and assign specific tasks.They paid one unwitting Trump supporter to build a cage on a flatbed truck that housed another person wearing a costume that portrayed Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.After the rallies in Florida, the group applied similar tactics to organize rallies in Pennsylvania, New York and elsewhere.Weeks before the election, the Russians ratcheted up social media activity aimed at dampening support for Mrs. Clinton.In mid-October, Woke Blacks, an Instagram account run by the Internet Research Agency, carried the message \u201chatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201dThen, just days before Americans went to the polls, another Instagram account controlled by the Russians \u2014 called Blacktivist \u2014 urged its followers to \u201cchoose peace\u201d and vote for Ms. Stein, who was expected to siphon support from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201cTrust me,\u201d the message read, \u201cit\u2019s not a wasted vote.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nevertheless, the conditions of this uplift are murky, and at times depend on generalizations \u2014 like \u201cmules of the world\u201d and \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d \u2014 that have eerie historical parallels and leave little room for growth.\u201cWhen They Call You a Terrorist,\u201d by Patrisse Khan-Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, written with asha bandele, a former features editor at Essence, abandons such abstractions for details \u2014 at times one wishes there were even more \u2014 to help readers understand what it means to be a black woman in the United States today.Khan-Cullors\u2019s memoir begins in Van Nuys, Calif., in \u201ca two-story, tan-colored building where the paint is peeling and where there is a gate that does not close properly and an intercom system that never works.\u201d Her language is poetic even if her childhood wasn\u2019t. Joy comes in the form of family. Her mother is a survivor focused on the well-being of her children; her birth father, Gabriel, whose stints in prison leave him often unable to participate in her life, encourages everyone to \u201cchoose love\u201d; and her older brother Monte, who will later be imprisoned and told he has schizoaffective disorder, has a \u201cginormous heart.\u201d But love cannot save her family from external forces, and Khan-Cullors does her best to contextualize their circumstances. \u201cIn 1986 when I am 3 years old, Ronald Reagan re-energizes the drug war that was started in 1971 by Richard Nixon by further militarizing the police in our communities,\u201d she writes. At 9, she watches officers harass her 11- and 13-year-old brothers. At 12, she is arrested for smoking weed even though students at her suburban school \u201clight up in the bathroom\u201d and \u201cno one gets in trouble.\u201d Part 2 introduces Khan-Cullors the organizer and activist. Titled \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d these chapters outline her partnership with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, the other founders of the network. After the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon Martin in 2012, Khan-Cullors logged onto Facebook and responded to a post Garza had written. Her message, \u201c#BlackLivesMatter,\u201d catalyzed the now international movement against police violence and racism. But while the title of this section (and the subtitle of the book) promises an insider account, the details of their partnership are sparse, mostly concentrated at the end of one chapter. While Khan-Cullors outlines the reasons for some of Black Lives Matter\u2019s tactics, particularly its emphasis on inclusivity and a decentralized organization, readers won\u2019t find Situation Room-style play-by-plays here.In \u201cWhen and Where I Enter,\u201d an influential history of black female activists in the United States, Paula Giddings, a professor of Africana studies at Smith College, wonders about those women \u2014 from Anna Julia Cooper to Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell \u2014 who gave up much of their lives to fighting for justice and liberation. \u201cWho are we when no one yearns for us, or when we are in full possession of our sexuality? Who are we when we are not someone\u2019s mother, or daughter, or sister, or aunt, or church elder, or first black woman to be this or that?\u201d she writes. \u201cWhen They Call You a Terrorist\u201d is the beginning of an answer to these questions. While its importance will not be in doubt, for the significance of Black Lives Matter cannot be overstated, the book\u2019s necessity comes from its other subject. \u201cI am Patrisse Marie Khan-Cullors Brignac,\u201d its author writes in her introduction. And indeed, between the moments spent serving everyone else, the rest of the book \u2014 chronicling her evolving sexual identity, her radical redefinition of love, her relationships and eventually the birth of her child \u2014 uncovers just who she is.Lovia Gyarkye is on staff at the Book Review.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "NBC Executive Takes Over Amazon Studios", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon had been on the hunt for a new executive, placing a strong emphasis on finding a woman, since October. In that time, streaming rivals like Netflix, Hulu and Apple have continued to gobble up television projects.Amazon has made the occasional splash at the Golden Globes and the Emmys with shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d but it has failed to gain the same kind of standing that Netflix and even Hulu have within Hollywood\u2019s creative community.It will be up to Ms. Salke, 53, to essentially hit the reset button.\u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeff Blackburn, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for business development and entertainment, said in a statement.A Fox executive, Dana Walden, and an A&E executive, Nancy Dubuc, had discussed the position with Amazon before each dropped out of talks.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited about the future at Amazon Studios,\u201d Ms. Salke said in a statement. \u201cIn the studio\u2019s relatively short existence they have innovated, disrupted and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop culture. I am both honored and emboldened by the opportunity to lead this extraordinary business.\u201dFor the last seven years, Ms. Salke has been second in command at NBC, where she and Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, engineered an impressive turnaround.Mr. Greenblatt, who joined NBC in 2010, and Ms. Salke, who came on board as president from Fox in 2011, found a network in deep trouble and well past its \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u201cER\u201d and \u201cFriends\u201d heyday.But now, propelled by \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and shows like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d NBC is poised to win the 18-to-49-year-old demographic among the four broadcast networks for a second consecutive season.Ms. Salke was one of the biggest champions of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d an emotional family drama whose popularity has surprised many industry veterans \u2014 as has its ability to sustain that success in its second season. On Sunday, NBC gave \u201cThis Is Us\u201d the post-Super Bowl slot, where it garnered an impressive audience of 27 million viewers.Ms. Salke has also helped deploy a strategy that brought NBC\u2019s comedy lineup back to life. After the lineup collapsed when \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d went off the air, she said the network would develop comedies that weren\u2019t meant to appeal to everybody. NBC has since found traction with offbeat comedies like \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and \u201cSuperstore.\u201d\u201cJennifer Salke is a world-class entertainment executive and deserves enormous credit for helping put NBC back on top,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said in a statement.But whether her success at helping turn around a broadcast network \u2014 which also relies on a healthy diet of Dick Wolf dramas \u2014 will translate to a streaming service is an open question.Amazon has been viewed in Hollywood as something of a sleeping giant, one of the few companies that could match Netflix financially if it deployed its cash properly. Netflix is poised to spend $8 billion on content this year.But Amazon has had several expensive missteps. \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s unfinished novel, debuted to little fanfare and was canceled. Likewise, several comedies, including \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson\u201d and \u201cI Love Dick,\u201d have been canceled in the last month.At the same time, Hulu has found real momentum. It is introducing several shows this year, including \u201cThe Looming Tower,\u201d a mini-series based on Lawrence Wright\u2019s book about the lead-up to the Sept. 11 attacks, this month and the second season of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d in April.Advertisement"}

Last year, the Islamabad High Court banned Valentine\u2019s celebrations across Pakistan, deeming them \u201cagainst the teachings of Islam\u201d and a sign of growing Western influence.Some restaurant managers reported receiving calls from unknown numbers asking whether boys and girls had exchanged gifts on their premises, and whether they knew of other establishments that might be observing the holiday. A number of florists and gift shops in Islamabad complained that they had lost significant business as customers stayed away.But there were also many in Islamabad who did not mind taking a risk for love \u2014 or to make some money \u2014 in defiance of the ban.In the affluent neighborhood F-7, where Obaid Malik, a young businessman, was parked outside a strip of flower shops, sellers elbowed one another to show him the long-stemmed roses he had asked for. Before the ban, the street had typically been jammed the night before Valentine\u2019s Day, but now the shops stood quiet and sellers seemed more desperate than usual to make a sale.\u201cWhat does Valentine\u2019s Day have to do with the government? Why are they bothering people?\u201d Mr. Malik said as the florists showed him different types of roses. Three defiantly red helium balloons hovered in the back of his car.\u201cThree balloons because, you know, \u2018I love you\u2019 is three words,\u201d he said.Mr. Malik said that he would not take his wife out for Valentine\u2019s Day lunch or dinner this year, but that he planned to surprise her by cooking her breakfast.\u201cPeople are still going to go out and do their thing and have fun \u2014 maybe just in different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t ban love.\u201dAnother customer, Shakeel Khan, a banker who was buying white lilies for his mother, said he had taken his fianc\u00e9e out for a Valentine\u2019s Day dinner over the weekend.\u201cI had heard of the ban and didn\u2019t know what to expect, so we thought, let\u2019s just get it out of the way,\u201d Mr. Khan said. He stood in front of a flower shop filled with white roses, multicolor gladioli and purple chrysanthemums \u2014 but not a red rose in sight.The shop\u2019s owner, Muhammad Imran, said the police had warned him not to sell red flowers on Valentine\u2019s Day. So the red roses, he said, were hidden in the back of the shop, where he would lead loyal customers who asked for them.\u201cMy workers have also been calling customers to let them know that home delivery is available this year for the first time,\u201d Mr. Imran said, asking that the location of his shop not be disclosed. \u201cDelivery is just safer,\u201d he said with a shrug..\u201cYou can ban a day, but you can\u2019t stop people from being together or from falling in love,\u201d he said, breaking into a laugh.Some restaurants decided online promotions would be safest. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 15 percent discount today, but we only advertised it on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d said a waiter at Nocciola Chocolaterie.Similarly, a few customers said they had opted for \u201cvirtual dates\u201d to avoid possible harassment by the authorities at restaurants.\u201cMy girlfriend can\u2019t get out tonight, so I\u2019ll be Skyping with her,\u201d a university student said over coffee at the upscale Kohsar Market. His friend, a curly-haired young woman, suggested changing Valentine\u2019s Day to Friend\u2019s Day.\u201cThat might work better in Pakistan,\u201d she said. A third friend, wearing a bright red hoodie, disagreed: \u201cNo. We need a Valentine\u2019s Day revolution here. That\u2019s what we need.\u201dIn another part of town, police officers shooed away a man who had set up a stall to sell single roses. \u201cWe are just doing our job,\u201d one said when asked why they had intervened.Balloon sellers were also on the lookout for the police. Most had chosen not to sell heart-shape or red balloons, instead opting for stars, circles and bird- and animal-shape ones.But one vendor, Muhammad Akhar, was boldly selling red balloons that read \u201cYou Are Mine.\u201d\u201cIf the people who are coming to buy them are not scared,\u201d he said, \u201cthen why should I be?\u201dHe was not the only balloon seller taking a stand. Next to a boy offering giant, animal-shape balloons, another young vendor held some small heart-shape ones, red and white.\u201cI didn\u2019t blow them up to their full size,\u201d said the boy, Sarfaraz Ali, looking over his shoulder with an impish smile. \u201cI\u2019ll do it for you if you want one.\u201dBut when he spotted a couple of police officers approaching, he started to back away.\u201cMadam, please wait for me here,\u201d he said as he bolted, the tiny hearts trailing behind him. \u201cDon\u2019t go away, I\u2019ll be right back!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands of ISIS Fighters Flee in Syria, Many to Fight Another Day", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Thousands of Islamic State foreign fighters and family members have escaped the American-led military campaign in eastern Syria, according to new classified American and other Western military and intelligence assessments, a flow that threatens to tarnish American declarations that the militant group has been largely defeated.As many of the fighters flee unfettered to the south and west through Syrian Army lines, some have gone into hiding near Damascus, the Syrian capital, and in the country\u2019s northwest, awaiting orders sent by insurgent leaders on encrypted communications channels.Other battle-hardened militants, some with training in chemical weapons, are defecting to Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria. Others are paying smugglers tens of thousands of dollars to spirit them across the border to Turkey, with an eventual goal of returning home to European countries.\u201cISIS fighters are fleeing Syria and Iraq,\u201d the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, said in remarks in Washington last week. \u201cJihadists are going underground, dispersing to other safe havens, including on the internet, and returning to their home countries.\u201dGen. Paul J. Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters last week that the remaining Islamic State leadership, even while on the run, still had \u201cfairly robust\u201d communications with its shadowy network of fighters now on the lam.Analysts say they are also seeing signs that Islamic State fighters are adopting guerrilla tactics to terrorize civilians.\u201cThe group is transitioning into an underground organization that places more weight on asymmetric tactics, like suicide bombings against soft targets in government-secured areas like Baghdad,\u201d said Otso Iho, a senior analyst at Jane\u2019s Terrorism and Insurgency Center at IHS Markit in London.Estimates of how many fighters may have escaped into the deserts of Syria or Iraq and beyond are difficult to pin down, but American and other Western intelligence and counterterrorism analysts with access to classified assessments put the number in the low thousands. Many are traveling with spouses and children who are likely to have been radicalized during more than three years of Islamic State control of the region and could pose security risks as well, analysts say.In December, Col. Ryan Dillon, the chief spokesman for the American-led military campaign in Iraq and Syria, said in a briefing with Pentagon reporters: \u201cSyrian regime commanders in eastern Syria suggest that ISIS fighters\u201d from the Middle Euphrates River Valley \u201cmay have slipped through porous Syrian and Russian defenses to arrive in areas near Damascus.\u201dAsked late last month by The New York Times about indications that as many as 1,000 fighters and family members had fled the Euphrates River area just in recent days, Colonel Dillon\u2019s command replied in a statement: \u201cWe know that the Syrian regime has given ISIS the leeway to travel through their area of operations, but we cannot confirm any alleged incidents or operations that are taking place outside our area of operations.\u201dThe United States military is concerned that a Turkish offensive against the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces in Afrin, in northern Syria, has worsened the problem. The S.D.F. has been working with the Americans in former Islamic State-held areas to interdict fleeing jihadists, but those efforts have been greatly reduced as the Kurds have shifted resources to reinforce Afrin.Mustafa Balli, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces headquarters, blamed the Turkish assault on Afrin for what he said was the Islamic State\u2019s resurgence.\u201cSince this invasion of Afrin by Turkey, ISIS is getting stronger in the south,\u201d he said. \u201cThe battle against ISIS in the south, and the Turks in Afrin, is the same battle. The Turks want to give another chance to ISIS to grow again. Before the Turkish invasion, we were very close to finishing ISIS.\u201dSome 40,000 fighters from more than 120 countries poured into the battles in Syria and Iraq over the past four years, American and other Western officials say. While thousands died on the battlefield, officials say many thousands more probably survived to slip away to conflicts in Libya, Yemen or the Philippines, or have gone into hiding in countries like Turkey. About 295 Americans are believed to have traveled to Iraq or Syria, or tried to, American officials said.Of more than 5,000 Europeans who joined those ranks, as many as 1,500 have returned home, including many women and children, and most of the rest are dead or still fighting, according to Gilles de Kerchove, the European Union\u2019s top counterterrorism official.\u201cThe thought that these foreign fighters who have participated in this fight now for over two years will quietly leave Syria and return to their jobs as shopkeepers in Paris, in Brussels, in Copenhagen, is ludicrous,\u201d said General Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. \u201cThat\u2019s a very compelling problem.\u201dBut the new assessments, bolstered by reports from analysts and smugglers in the region, suggest that Islamic State fighters are fleeing to more hospitable parts of Syria and Iraq, or to third countries where they can lie low.Beyond the recent suicide bombings in Baghdad, a major American airstrike last month demonstrates the Islamic State\u2019s continued resiliency and threat, military officials said.Armed Reaper drones and Navy F/A-18 fighters from the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt carried out a strike on Jan. 20 in Al Shafah, Syria, in the Euphrates River Valley, that killed about 150 fighters, the American military said. The strike, one of the largest single aerial assaults against the Islamic State in three years, was based on intelligence collected over about a week. The strike hit two large buildings that were used as a command headquarters and a media distribution center, military officials said.The size and concentration of fighters took American officials by surprise. \u201cThe ISIS headquarters contained a heavy concentration of ISIS fighters who appear to have been massing for movement,\u201d Maj. Gen. James B. Jarrard, commanding general for Special Operations forces in Iraq and Syria, said in a statement.\u201cISIS continues to demonstrate the ability to mass large numbers in its attempt to retain a stronghold in Syria,\u201d the American-led command in Iraq said in the same statement.Ahmad Ramadan, the head of the Euphrates Center Against Violence and Terrorism in Istanbul, said that the Islamic State was still present in many villages east of the Euphrates River \u2014 the informal demarcation line between Russian-backed Syrian troops to the west and American-backed Syrian militias to the east. \u201cISIS nowadays are spreading all over Syria,\u201d he said via Facebook chat.Government and independent analysts in Syria and in Washington, including the Institute for the Study of War, said there was a thriving trade in smuggling Islamic State fighters across the border into Turkey, where intelligence officials believe they are linking with clandestine cells.According to the independent British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, senior Islamic State operatives from Raqqa and Deir al-Zour, in the Euphrates River Valley, have paid bribes of $20,000 to $30,000 for safe passage into Turkey.\u201cI smuggled about 50 ISIS fighters into Turkey,\u201d said Abu Omar, a smuggler between Syria and Turkey, adding that they were a mix of Syrian and foreign fighters, often disguised in women\u2019s clothes to help elude Turkish border patrols.Abu Omar added that the number of fleeing Islamic State fighters and senior leaders, including many foreigners, increased over the summer when the American-backed offensive against Raqqa began.\u201cI was really shocked when I saw them,\u201d he said in a WhatsApp message. \u201cThey were wearing cool clothes, classic jeans with many necklaces, trying to disguise as much as they can. They hid their passports in their boots. They were completely shaved; you never guess they are ISIS. They didn\u2019t speak any Arabic, few words.\u201dHwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, Rod Nordland from Kobani, Syria, and Karam Shoumali from Berlin.Advertisement"}

Run to the safest place in the classroom \u2014 in this case, a closet packed with 19 students and their teacher.This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it.Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 people this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices \u2014 in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman \u2014 are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting.While many politicians after the shooting were focused on mental health and safety, some vocal students at Stoneman Douglas High showed no reluctance in drawing attention to gun control.On a day when the funerals of the shooting victims began here, more than a dozen schools from Massachusetts to Iowa to Michigan were shut down in response to copycat threats and social media interpreted in the worst light. A college near Seattle was on lockdown for several hours on Friday after an unfounded report of gunfire and in at least one case an entire district closed down. Several students have been arrested, accused of phoning in threats to their schools.At other high schools across the country, students rallied in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High and staged walkouts to protest what they called Washington\u2019s inaction in protecting students and teachers. A gun control advocacy group, Moms Demand Action, said it had been so overwhelmed with requests from students that it was setting up a parallel, student focused advocacy group.\u201cPeople say it\u2019s too early to talk about it,\u201d Mr. Kasky said. \u201cIf you ask me, it\u2019s way too late.\u201dHis argument reflects the words of other students who want action: The issue is not an abstraction to them. These are their murdered friends, their bloodstained schools, their upended lives.Students said they did not want to cede the discussion over their lives to politicians and adult activists.\u201cWe need to take it into our hands,\u201d Mr. Kasky said.David Hogg, a 17-year-old student journalist who interviewed his classmates during the rampage in Parkland, said he had thought about the possibility of a school shooting long before shots from an AR-15 started to blast through the hallways. As he huddled with fellow students, he stayed calm and decided to try to create a record of their thoughts and views that would live on, even if the worst happened to them.\u201cI recorded those videos because I didn\u2019t know if I was going to survive,\u201d he said in an interview here. \u201cBut I knew that if those videos survived, they would echo on and tell the story. And that story would be one that would change things, I hoped. And that would be my legacy.\u201dIt is a stark change from the moments that followed the Columbine shooting in April 1999, said Austin Eubanks, who survived the shooting. Mr. Eubanks and a friend hid under a table when the two teenage gunmen walked into the library and started shooting. Mr. Eubanks was wounded. His friend, Corey DePooter, was killed.\u201cThere was nobody who took an activism stance,\u201d Mr. Eubanks said of Columbine\u2019s immediate aftermath. He said he began abusing opiates shortly after as a coping mechanism. \u201cI just wanted to be left alone. I was so destabilized and traumatized.\u201dMr. Eubanks now helps run an addiction treatment center in Colorado and has sons of his own, aged 8 and 12. The oldest has asked why Columbine happened and whether he needs to be afraid, and Mr. Eubanks said he has tried to make the boys feel safe while also discussing how children can drift toward violence.No matter how rare school shootings are for the vast majority of students, they have grown up in a world so attuned to these threats that high schoolers are now more conversant in the language of lockdowns and code red drills than their parents.Spencer Collier, the police chief in Selma, Ala., was chatting recently with a group of high school students when they brought up mass shootings and pressed him about current trends and what law enforcement agencies were doing to address them. In Connecticut, Nathaniel Laske, a high school junior, said he had asked school administrators about the apparent absence of lockdown drills or a mass shooting plan in the event something happened during school theater productions.\u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t willing to talk about it,\u201d Mr. Laske said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re part of a school community it makes you much more inclined to want to prevent things.\u201dSoon after Amy Campbell-Oates, 16, heard about the Parkland shooting, she knew she wanted to try, in some small way, to influence the national discussion on gun violence. She and two friends organized a protest, made posters, and on Friday, they rallied with dozens of fellow students from South Broward High School.They carried signs that read \u201cIt Could\u2019ve Been Us,\u201d and \u201cYour Silence is Killing Us,\u201d and \u201cWe Stand with Stoneman Douglas.\u201d They chanted, their collective voices rising as cars honked in support.\u201cWe agreed that our politicians have to do more than say thoughts and prayers,\u201d Ms. Campbell-Oates said. \u201cWe want voters to know that midterms are coming up. Some of us can\u2019t vote yet but we want to get to the people that can to vote in common sense laws, ban assault rifles and require mental health checks before gun purchases.\u201dTyra Hemans, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High, made a poster, too, emblazoned with the word \u201cENOUGH.\u201d On Friday, Ms. Hemans attended the funeral for Meadow Pollack, one of the 17 people killed, and then she spoke about her desire to see President Trump when he visits the area.\u201cI want our politicians to stop thinking about money and start thinking about all these lives we have lost,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to talk with him about changing these laws. Seventeen people are dead, killed in minutes.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of students killed in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The gunman killed 17 people: 14 students and three faculty members. He did not kill 17 students.Audra D. S.

{"Headline": "California Today: The Beverly Hills Affordable Housing Loophole", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Today\u2019s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, who reports on economics from the Bay Area.What was surprising, even shocking, was the city that topped the very short list of places that are meeting their goal of affordable new residences: Beverly Hills. How could that be? Are Beverly Hills\u2019s residents feeling guilty about income inequality and mass building low-income housing as a result?Perhaps not surprisingly, Beverly Hills\u2019s apparently stellar record at building housing for poor people has more to do with politics and funny math than a sudden building boom.The progress report released last week is based on a series of housing goals that are decided by a regional body of governments. Over the eight-year period covered by the goals, Beverly Hills was required to build a total of three housing units: One very-low income housing unit, one low-income housing unit, and one moderately priced housing unit. In fairness, the wealthy Los Angeles County city far exceeded its numbers, at least on a percentage basis, by issuing permits for a total of nine low- and moderate-income housing units.The city was not required to build any high-income housing units, since it already has a lot of them. Nevertheless, it blew its goal of zero out of the water, and issued 75 new permits for high-income housing.Scott Wiener, the San Francisco senator who wrote the streamlining bill on which the recent report was based, said in an interview that numbers like those reported by Beverly Hills are why he is working on a new bill that would try to neutralize the role of politics in housing production by tying future state housing goals to economic measures like job growth. It would also carry forward past housing deficits so that cities that don\u2019t build will lose further control over local housing decisions as time goes on.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd and we see this around the state where communities that are whiter and more affluent are able to push down their numbers and essentially opt out of new housing,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Coming up this week:In 1875, a visitor to Yosemite recorded his predicament in a guest registry. \u201cCan\u2019t get out of Yosemite on account of a sick horse,\u201d he wrote, adding ruefully: \u201cYosemite Valley is a lovely place in which to be incarcerated.\u201dThat\u2019s a quaint picture of a park that has exploded in popularity in recent years. The park received more than 5 million visitors in 2016.And although February is usually one of the slowest months, the spectacular sunsets that occur during the last two weeks of the month at Horsetail Fall have become a major draw. The fading sunlight colors the ribbon of water that descend from El Capitan a fiery red and orange.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "After Florida School Shooting, Russian \u2018Bot\u2019 Army Pounced", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe accounts addressed the news with the speed of a cable news network. Some adopted the hashtag #guncontrolnow. Others used #gunreformnow and #Parklandshooting. Earlier on Wednesday, before the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., many of those accounts had been focused on the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThis is pretty typical for them, to hop on breaking news like this,\u201d said Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, a company that tracks online disinformation campaigns. \u201cThe bots focus on anything that is divisive for Americans. Almost systematically.\u201dOne of the most divisive issues in the nation is how to handle guns, pitting Second Amendment advocates against proponents of gun control. And the messages from these automated accounts, or bots, were designed to widen the divide and make compromise even more difficult.Any news event \u2014 no matter how tragic \u2014 has become fodder to spread inflammatory messages in what is believed to be a far-reaching Russian disinformation campaign. The disinformation comes in various forms: conspiracy videos on YouTube, fake interest groups on Facebook, and armies of bot accounts that can hijack a topic or discussion on Twitter.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.The researchers said they had watched as the bots began posting about the Parkland shooting shortly after it happened.Facebook, Google and Twitter have, to varying degrees, announced new measures to eliminate bot accounts, and have hired more moderators to help them weed out disinformation on their platforms.The bots are \u201cgoing to find any contentious issue, and instead of making it an opportunity for compromise and negotiation, they turn it into an unsolvable issue bubbling with frustration,\u201d said Karen North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cIt just heightens that frustration and anger.\u201dIntelligence officials in the United States have warned that malicious actors will try to spread disinformation ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. In testimony to Congress last year and in private meetings with lawmakers, social media companies promised that they will do better in 2018 than they did in 2016.But the Twitter campaign around the Parkland shooting is an example of how Russian operatives are still at it.\u201cWe\u2019ve had more than a year to get our act together and address the threat posed by Russia and implement a strategy to deter future attacks, but I believe, unfortunately, we still don\u2019t have a comprehensive plan,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, during a hearing this month on global threats to the United States. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a continuous assault by Russia to target and undermine our democratic institutions, and they\u2019re going to keep coming at us.\u201dWhen the Russian bots jumped on the hashtag #Parklandshooting \u2014 initially created to spread news of the shooting \u2014 they quickly stoked tensions. Exploiting the issue of mental illness in the gun control debate, they propagated the notion that Nikolas Cruz, the suspected gunman, was a mentally ill \u201clone killer.\u201d They also claimed that he had searched for Arabic phrases on Google before the shooting. Simultaneously, the bots started other hashtags, like #ar15, for the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting, and #NRA.The goal is to push fringe ideas into the \u201cslightly more mainstream,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. If well-known people retweet the bot messages or simply link to a website the bots are promoting, the messages gain an edge of legitimacy.The indictment also described how fraudulent Russian accounts on Twitter tried to push real Americans into action. The indictment said the fake Twitter account @March_for_Trump had organized political rallies for Mr. Trump in New York before the election, including a \u201cMarch for Trump\u201d rally on June 25, 2016, and a \u201cDown With Hillary\u201d gathering on July 23, 2016.By Friday morning, the bots that pushed the original tweets around the Parkland shooting had moved on to the hashtag #falseflag \u2014 a term used by conspiracy theorists to refer to a secret government operation that is carried out to look like something else \u2014 with a conspiracy theory that the shooting had never happened.By Monday, the bots had new targets: the Daytona 500 auto race in Daytona Beach, Fla., and news about William Holleeder, a man facing trial in the Netherlands for his suspected role in six gangland killings. It is unclear why.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Next Lesson: Value Bordeaux", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor our next topic, let\u2019s return to what may now be familiar ground, Bordeaux.The dominant image of Bordeaux is one of imposing chateaus, patrician proprietors and stratospheric prices. As far as the most famous properties go, in the best-known regions, that image holds a lot of truth, though most of the patricians are now corporate executives.That\u2019s where the notion of value comes in. With these wines, you are not paying a premium for famous names or for the high status of their appellations. Nonetheless, they are not cheap. You could easily find dozens of bottles from Bordeaux that are less expensive than these three.So why these wines? Because value is not strictly a synonym for inexpensive. It means you are getting inordinate quality for the price, which I hope will be the case with these bottles. They are:These wines are produced in relatively small quantities, as is so often the case with good-value Bordeaux. If you cannot find them, you could select any recent Bordeaux in this price range. Other names to look for include Peybonhomme les Tours, Auney, Moulin Pey-Labrie, Lanessan, Jean Faux, La Peyre, Milon and Peyredon, just to name a few.I should say that the 2013 vintage is not considered among the best, though I generally think that we pay too much attention to vintages. Yes, vintage conditions affect the character of the wine, and occasionally the price, though not much for wines as relatively inexpensive as these. But it\u2019s always more interesting to see what a good producer does with a mediocre vintage than it is to prioritize the vintage.That said, if you see wines from these producers in other recent vintages, by all means snap them up.These wines are best with simple meals. Lamb and beef are classic matches; chicken and duck are fine as well. Serve the wines cool.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Has Good News for Once: Its First Quarterly Profit", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter often feels like the digital equivalent of a swamp.As a business, however, Twitter might finally be starting to work.\u201cWe did what we said we were going to do,\u201d an exultant Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, said on Twitter. \u201cOur focus and self-discipline continues to improve.\u201dIt\u2019s a measure of the undisciplined \u2014 O.K., brutal \u2014 nature of Twitter that most of the replies to Mr. Dorsey\u2019s tweet were not congratulations but insults and criticism. Others were incomprehensible.What counts, however, is that those cranks and critics are there in the first place. The number of people who use the service monthly rose 4 percent to 330 million, which \u2014 while not a big increase \u2014 is something. Those who use the social media service every day grew 12 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit gains.\u201cThe user growth is kind of astounding,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media and tech analyst at the research firm BTIG, who has been recommending the stock for a year. \u201cThey were barely growing two years ago.\u201dTwitter originally showed tweets in reverse chronological order \u2014 the latest posts, however mundane, were on top. Now it is using algorithms to try to show the most important tweets first, making the site more engaging.\u201cIf you show the right tweets to the right person at the right time, it creates user happiness,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said. \u201cThat means more time spent on the site, which means more opportunities for advertising.\u201dOver all, Twitter reported a profit of $91 million in the final three months of 2017, compared with a loss of $167 million a year earlier. Margins were much better, expenses were lower and stock-based compensation decreased sharply.Other numbers were not as impressive. Revenue rose 2 percent to $732 million in the quarter. Revenue from advertising, which makes up the bulk of its revenue, increased 1 percent. In general, Twitter exceeded low expectations.\u201cA solid result across the board and builds upon the momentum\u201d from the third quarter, analysts at UBS wrote in a research note.One quarter is not much of a streak, and Twitter has often been unable to keep it up. Jim Cridlin, the global head of innovation at Mindshare, a unit of the advertising giant WPP, said that while Twitter\u2019s momentum continued into the fourth quarter, the company still faced \u201csignificant headwinds.\u201dFor the current quarter, UBS calculated that Twitter would generate $583 million of revenue, $11 million more than analysts were predicting. That might keep the party going.What really is helping Twitter is that there are only three American social media companies that count. Facebook is by far the largest, but is under pressure from all quarters precisely because of its size and influence. It is trying to moderate the latter without hurting the former, which is going to be tricky. Snap is a singular effort forging its own direction as a communications platform.That leaves Twitter, troubled as it might be.\u201cAdvertisers have a huge desire to be on mobile devices more, but there are not a lot of ways to reach people on applications worthy of your home screen,\u201d said Mr. Greenfield. \u201cTwitter is on your home screen.\u201dDavid Streitfeld reported from San Francisco and Chad Bray from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Is Getting Paid to Save the Music Industry: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify files to go public.\u2022 Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles.\u2022 The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one?\u2022 What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?\u2022 The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope.\u2022 And is Jared Kushner\u2019s weakness his family business?Perhaps more than any other streaming service, Spotify has revived the fortunes of recording artists. It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday.The numbers are included in Spotify\u2019s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing\u2019s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, \u201cconsists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.\u201dThe filing says Spotify had \u20ac3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was \u20ac2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. \u201cThis decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,\u201d the filing said.But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that.\u2014 Peter EavisAccounting nerds delving into Spotify\u2019s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy.Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of \u20ac324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled \u20ac179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda?It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung \u20ac439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year.\u2014 Peter EavisDirect listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market.Spotify won\u2019t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days.Here\u2019s a look at the details:Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang.Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify\u2019s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public.In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby.Dick\u2019s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT:\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201dOver five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero.Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest.\u2022 Mr. Ackman\u2019s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet.How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high.Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIs it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no.BackgroundSnap\u2019s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock.The criticism has also overshadowed Snap\u2019s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent.BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock\u2019s annual report:As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as \u201ccommon ownership\u201d. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.The filing goes on to say:If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock\u2019s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years.What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy.To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes.Is it working? Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year.Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony.\u2014 Peter EavisSky is both a telecom operator \u2014 selling TV, internet and phone services \u2014 and a media company with its own original news, sports and entertainment programming.

{"Headline": "When Jokes Become a Crime: Free Speech Under Fire in Lebanon", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 On New Year\u2019s Eve, a Lebanese celebrity soothsayer predicted that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, would be advised to eat less fast food.For the host of a popular comedy show in Lebanon, it was a great hook for a joke.The powers that be were not amused, and the public prosecutor filed charges of libel and defamation of a foreign leader against Mr. Haddad.When Mr. Haddad struck back on his next show, appearing in prison scrubs and singing about the prosecutor while a belly dancer gyrated nearby, a council of judges called for further charges of insulting the judiciary.These cases were among a series of recent legal moves against entertainers, journalists and activists in Lebanon that rights groups worry could stifle free expression in one of the Arab world\u2019s freest environments. While the reason for the rise in cases remains unclear, many suspect that powerful parties are using the courts to prevent criticism of the authorities before parliamentary elections this year.\u201cThe bottom line is that you have criminalization of nonviolent speech in Lebanon, speech that criticizes politicians and national symbols,\u201d said Lama Fakih, the Beirut director for Human Rights Watch.Free speech has long been under fire across the Arab world, where authoritarian governments have an array of laws they can use to lock up those who criticize leaders, government institutions or religion, even on their own Facebook pages.Lebanon is better off when it comes to free expression. As a fragile democracy where power is shared by a range of political and religious groups, it has no dictator who can impose his will. On the contrary, it hosts an array of newspapers and television channels that cater to different tastes and are funded by political groups and powerful individuals to promote their agendas and undermine their rivals. The Constitution also guarantees freedom of speech.Still, some of the country\u2019s laws lay down red lines. It is a crime to libel or defame foreign leaders and public officials or to insult the president, the flag, the army or other national symbols. Other laws ban blasphemy and speech deemed insulting to religion.In the past, they have been inconsistently enforced, and it is the recent rise in speech-related cases that is worrying journalists and human rights campaigners.Marcel Ghanem, a popular talk show host, was summoned for questioning in cases against two Saudis who accused the Lebanese president and speaker of Parliament of links to terrorism while appearing as guests on his program. When he refused to show up, in protest of the charges, he was charged with obstruction of justice.In an interview, Salim Jreissati, Lebanon\u2019s justice minister, denied an attack on free speech in Lebanon, comparing those who promoted such an idea to Don Quixote\u2019s attacking windmills.\u201cWe are proud that in this murky, desert region that surrounds us when it comes to freedoms, we are a country of freedoms par excellence,\u201d he said.He said that laws placing limits on free speech were necessary to prevent flare-ups in a diverse country with a weak central state and a history of sectarian violence, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990.\u201cWe are fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cOur body is still soft, our democracy is soft.\u201dSpeech-related cases in Lebanon rarely lead to significant prison time. But the concern, rights groups say, is that the threat of prosecution will chill public discourse, deterring citizens from expressing their thoughts or criticizing powerful people or institutions.\u201cIf you want to have a stable country, you need to not be going after journalists and civil society organizations that are giving the facts about what is going on,\u201d said Ms. Fakih, of Human Rights Watch.He describes the show as a cross between Jay Leno and Jon Stewart, with a touch of Conan O\u2019Brien, and the format is familiar.

{"Headline": "Review: Cav\u2019s Steakhouse on the Gold Coast, Queensland", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Although steakhouses had been popular in Australia in the 1960s, they mostly died out when nouvelle cuisine hit in the \u201970s. There wasn\u2019t much of a steakhouse scene at all until Australian restaurateurs began imitating the American chain steakhouse boom of the \u201980s and \u201990s, which, curiously, was spurred in part by the success of Outback.Cav\u2019s is owned by Richard Cavill, whose family history is deeply entwined with this part of Queensland. He is the great-grandson of James Freeman Cavill, a champion swimmer who is partially responsible for giving the Gold Coast\u2019s most famous beach enclave its name. Surfers Paradise was called Elston when James opened the Surfers Paradise Hotel in 1925, and it was James who successfully lobbied the local council to change Elston\u2019s name to Surfers Paradise in 1933.In 1984 the Cavill family purchased the Beef Barron Restaurant in Labrador, a few miles from the site of the hotel (which by that point had been razed to make way for a shopping mall). The restaurant was gutted and given a distinctive design, which remains to this day and might be most accurately described as bovine hacienda chic.A life-size trio of slightly weather-beaten fiberglass cows once stood outside the restaurant on a three-level podium, Olympic style, but these days they rest with their heads over the white wooden fence, leaning a little to one side, as if slightly intoxicated. Inside, a long butcher case greets diners, showcasing the available steaks. To the back of the huge room, another cow stands over a large chair, wearing a cowboy hat and pursing its alarmingly red lips. You sit in the chair and take a photo with the cow, because of course you do.Drinks are ordered at the table from a wait staff that, at least during the summer, seems to be made up mainly of shy but eager teenagers. I can imagine that working at Cav\u2019s is a first-job rite of passage for certain local high schoolers. The bulk of your meal is ordered at the butcher counter: You tell them your table number, the steak you want (pointing is encouraged), the sauce you want (mushroom, chili, pepper or Dianne), the sides you want and anything extra. The most expensive steak is a 350-gram, grass-fed dry-aged eye filet (or filet mignon in American parlance) for $47.90. The larger, more flavorful T-bone is $38.90. It\u2019s a lot of meat. And it\u2019s a bargain.Cav\u2019s is serious about its meat, so much so that a retail butcher shop operates in a small building separate from the restaurant. The provenance and aging details of each steak are given; eating and comparing them is a basic lesson in the variances of affordable, quality Australian beef.Steakhouses may have gone out of style, but steaks never did, especially not as the counter meal of choice at the thousands of pubs that form the heart of Australian social life. The steaks at Cav\u2019s are better than your average pub steak, but the sauces and sides are familiar. The bread and butter pudding served for dessert with whiskey sauce and vanilla ice cream tastes like pure childhood. This is not a bespoke dessert. There is nothing artisan about it. It would do very well at Outback.It is not a good idea to order anything at Cav\u2019s much beyond those tried-and-true Australian classics. The mac and cheese is kind of wonderful in a gooey, tawdry way, but other forays into Americana are worrisome. Do not, under any circumstances, order the ribs platter. Even the Caesar salad is pushing your luck. A steak, a bread pudding and a picture with the cow are what you\u2019re here for.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uighur Specialties, With Lamb Front and Center, at Kebab Empire", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City11 PhotosThe menu is to the point: meat, and above all lamb. (In Kashgar, restaurants often hang whole sheep carcasses by the entrance.) Lamb chops, the juices shining, are thrust on blades a foot long, crossed like swords; leg of lamb is hewn in hunks, pressed with crushed cumin seeds, black pepper and salt, then skewered. Both pick up a good marbling of char from the grill \u2014 gas, not charcoal, but still the smoke goes deep.Here, too, is lamb shank, stacked high in a pot and steamed over boiling spices. It may be ordered large, on the bone and angled like a club, or small, shucked and bulging with fat that springs back from the teeth.Best is leg of lamb first roasted in a pan with garlic, onions and red streaks of chile, then shaved thin \u2014 it looks torn to scraps \u2014 so that after the briefest tug the meat surrenders. The taste is all cumin, strong and musky, matching game with game. It\u2019s hard to tell where the fragrance ends and flavor begins.Beef and chicken kebabs are respectable enough, made of whole meat, not ground. But they\u2019re a sideshow to the lamb. (Some vegetarian options have been added since my visit.)Mr. Yakup, 35, is driven: He left home for Beijing at age 18, taught himself English by watching American movies and ran an English-as-a-second-language school in his apartment. He was accepted by a dozen American colleges, but had no money for tuition; a kindly dean at George Mason University arranged for financial aid (\u201che basically saved my life\u201d), and a year later Mr. Yakup landed a scholarship to Harvard.After a stint with an investment firm in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in China, Mr. Yakup returned to the United States with a plan to share Uighur culture with the world. He started in guerrilla style, selling kebabs on Manhattan street corners at midnight \u201cto test the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police told us very nicely to leave, and we did.\u201d Now he has investors, including former Harvard classmates, and a team: his parents and older sister, who recently settled in New York. He calls his father \u201cchief kebab engineer.\u201dAll meats are presented in broad, shallow wooden bowls that might elsewhere be destined for salad. Each plate, generously priced under $10, is identical in its accessories \u2014 a handful of cucumbers and tomatoes, yogurt and Uighur polo, a dish general to Central Asia. To make polo (akin to pilaf), rice is cooked with carrots, olive oil and bone-in lamb that\u2019s left in the pot until the very end. (In Kashgar, Mr. Yakup said, they would keep the meat to eat, but for people here \u201cit\u2019s not soft enough.\u201d)The menu also lists naan (flatbread) as part of each plate, but all I received was a panel of dough blanketing the bottom of each bowl, skinny and stiff as a store-bought tortilla. In Beijing, I once watched a Uighur baker pull rounds of naan from the cavernous mouth of a tonur (akin to a tandoor), the bread thick and half-blackened \u2014 nothing like this.It wasn\u2019t naan, as it turned out, but in fact a tortilla, meant to be decorative, like a placemat. Two wedges of naan were supposed to go on top, chewy flatbread from an Uzbek bakery in Queens; someone in the kitchen had simply forgotten to put them on my plates, Mr. Yakup explained apologetically. He hopes to bake his own some day. \u201cThere are hundreds of kinds,\u201d he said. \u201cOnes big as the wheels of a car, ones small as fists.\u201dThe dining room is a minimalist black box, with orders placed and picked up at the counter and tables up for grabs. Sometimes the crowd grows quarrelsome. One night, when I was about to abandon my table, two hovering customers came close to blows over it.Mr. Yakup oversees a Kebab Empire stand in the New World Mall in Flushing, Queens, as well. There, for a brief spell last summer, he offered maruxna (Uighur ice cream), a meld of milk, eggs and brown sugar, hand-churned with a great wooden spoon.It proved too labor-intensive. In its stead now is doogh, a simple drink of honeyed yogurt, not too sweet, with a crumble of rose petals on top. Mr. Yakup is focused on kebabs \u2014 and empire.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jury Awards $38 Million to Family of Maryland Woman Shot by Police", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Baltimore County, Md., jury on Friday awarded more than $38 million to the family of a woman who was fatally shot by the police in 2016 after a standoff that had been partly broadcast on Instagram.The woman, Korryn Gaines, was shot several times by a Baltimore County police officer as her 5-year-old son lingered nearby, in the line of fire. During the standoff, the son, Kodi Gaines, was struck twice by the officer\u2019s gunfire \u2014 once in the face and once in the elbow.After an approximately three-week trial and less than three hours of deliberation, the all-female jury found that the first shot the officer had fired was not reasonable; they then doled out damages on the grounds that Baltimore County had violated the Gaineses\u2019 civil rights and had committed battery on the mother and son.The jury awarded Kodi Gaines, now 6, more than $32.8 million; Karsyn Courtney, Kodi\u2019s younger sister, who was not in the apartment at the time of the shooting, was awarded more than $4.5 million; and Korryn\u2019s mother and father were awarded $300,000 each, as was the estate of Korryn Gaines.Kenneth Ravenell, a lawyer representing Kodi Gaines and his father, Corey Cunningham, called the verdict a \u201chuge win\u201d for his clients. While he acknowledged that the award was \u201csignificant,\u201d he emphasized that he believed the payout was justified given that Kodi had been shot and continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress.\u201cEveryone should consider whether, if it was their child, would this number be too high?\u201d Mr. Ravenell said in a telephone interview on Friday.\u201cWe are moved by the jury\u2019s swift verdict in this case,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe believe it sends a message not only to the police officer who shot my client and killed his mother in front of him, we hope it sends a message to police officers around the country that the citizens here, and the citizens all around the country, are tired of police abuses.\u201dIn a statement, Mike Field, the Baltimore County attorney, said the county was \u201cdisappointed with the verdict and is reviewing all of its options, including an appeal.\u201d\u201cA mother died, a child was unintentionally injured, and police officers were placed in mortal danger,\u201d he said. \u201cBy any account, this was a tragic situation.\u201dThe Baltimore County Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 4, the police union, did not respond to a phone message or return an email requesting comment.As the case was unfolding, the police had said Ms. Gaines, 23, had a shotgun and had pointed it at an officer at least once during the confrontation.J. Wyndal Gordon, a lawyer for the estate as well as Karsyn Courtney and Korryn\u2019s mother, Rhanda Dormeus, said he had sought more money for Ms. Dormeus, but had been awarded more money for Karsyn Courtney than he had asked for.\u201cWe\u2019re happy,\u201d Mr. Gordon said in a telephone interview on Saturday night.\u201cA lot of this case was about men, men, men \u2014 men feeling safe, men having their body armor,\u201d he added. \u201cThis victory is a healing balm for women and children \u2014 for all those who have been ignored and dismissed when they\u2019ve made their allegations of police misconduct and abuse, this victory says, \u2018Me too.\u2019\u201dDefendants have a right to ask a judge to reduce the damages they must pay. But Mr. Ravenell said he did not believe the judge would make any changes.The police standoff involving Ms. Gaines occurred in Randallstown on Aug. 1, 2016, and lasted several hours. That Monday morning, the police were trying to serve her with an arrest warrant after she failed to appear in court on charges related a traffic stop. The police were also serving an arrest warrant on her boyfriend, Kareem Courtney, 39, who the police said was wanted on an assault charge.The first officer to enter the apartment testified that he saw Ms. Gaines holding a shotgun and that she had pointed it at him, according to The Sun. Officer Ruby also testified that he had observed Ms. Gaines seated in the hallway of her apartment, a shotgun on her lap and a cellphone to her ear, according to the newspaper.Eventually, Mr. Ravenell said, Officer Ruby fired the first shot from outside the apartment \u2014 a vantage point from which the officer could not see Kodi Gaines, the 5-year-old child. Mr. Ravenell said the officer knew the child was in the kitchen and \u201callegedly could only see braids of Ms. Gaines\u2019s hair and the barrel of a shotgun\u201d when he \u201ctook a blind shot through the drywall.\u201dThe shot struck Korryn Gaines in the back and also struck Kodi Gaines in the face, Mr. Ravenell said. The officer then went into the apartment and fired three more rounds, striking Ms. Gaines three more times and also striking Kodi Gaines a second time, Mr. Ravenell said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Videos of Syrian Militia Abusing Kurdish Fighter\u2019s Corpse Stir Outrage", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKOBANI, Syria \u2014 One fighter posed for selfies with the woman\u2019s corpse. Another called her a \u201cfemale pig.\u201d Another man stood on her naked breast as someone said, \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, man.\u201dThose are some of the low points of two new videos of what appear to be Turkish-backed fighters abusing the mutilated body of a Kurdish fighter.Although horrifying videos are nothing new in Syria\u2019s seven-year war, in this case the videos were apparently made by a group at least nominally under the command of a NATO country. That the object of abuse was a partly naked woman added to the outrage, with some commentators saying that even the Islamic State would not have behaved as badly.The Free Syrian Army ordered an investigation, saying in a statement that it \u201cwill not hesitate to hold accountable those who prove to be involved in this incident, if it is verified, in accordance with Shariah law and our principles.\u201d The statement went on to say that the group adhered to international human rights principles and Shariah law in dealing with the bodies of victims.The Turkish government, military and official media did not initially comment on the episode.The body was identified by Kurdish forces as that of Barin Kobani, a military pseudonym, though a spokesman declined to confirm her real name. She and three other members of the Kurdish women\u2019s militia, the Women\u2019s Protection Units, were killed last week defending Afrin, the militia said.\u201cIn such a bestial scene, it is proven to the world the identity of the real invaders and the terrorists in Afrin,\u201d the militia said in a statement. \u201cThe Turkish state is the world\u2019s sponsor of terrorism.\u201dThe comment on the videos that most incensed Kurds in Syria, judging from posts on Kurdish Facebook and Twitter accounts, was \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, man.\u201d Her body at that point was partly naked, and her exposed breasts appeared to have been mutilated. One of the men then stood with his booted foot on her left breast.\u201cThis is the spoils of war from the female pigs of the P.K.K.,\u201d one of the men in the videos says, referring to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a Kurdish group from Turkey designated by the United States and Europe as terrorists.The Syrian Kurdish militia, known as the People\u2019s Protection Units or Y.P.G., is not considered terrorist by Western countries and says it has no affiliation with the P.K.K.The Turkish newspaper Vatan described Barin Kobani as a would-be suicide bomber who detonated her explosives when spotted by Free Syrian Army members. The newspaper dismissed claims that the members of the Free Syrian Army tortured Ms. Kobani as \u201cpropaganda.\u201dThe spokesman for the main Kurdish militia in the region, Birosk Hasakah, disputed that Ms. Kobani was a suicide attacker. He said that she and three other Kurdish fighters had been surrounded by Free Syrian Army forces in Qarnah village on Jan. 30 but refused to surrender.\u201cBarin and the others, they fought to the end,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t make any suicide.\u201dIn the first video, 60 seconds long, Ms. Kobani\u2019s body is laid out on her back in the dirt and appears intact, in blue jeans and wearing what appear to be ammunition vests, also apparently intact.Nine armed men in assorted uniforms and civilian clothing pick at her corpse, searching her body and finding a grenade and an accessory pouch for her BKC light machine gun. Several times the men pose with their boots on her body. One man posed twice for a selfie with her body behind him.In the second video clip, 13 seconds long, the victim is partly unclothed and mutilated, again laid out on her back but apparently in a different location; the color and type of dirt has changed. After the fighter put a booted foot onto her breast, a commander apparently tried to intervene. \u201cNo, no, no, guys,\u201d he said.The National Council of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces, a pro-Turkish group, also called for an investigation into the episode. \u201cBarin\u2019s body was mutilated by monsters,\u201d Burhan Ghalioun, a critic of the Y.P.G. and the former president of the Syrian National Council, wrote on Facebook. \u201cWhoever did this to Barin does not belong to the human race.\u201dMr. Abdul Rahman of the Syrian Observatory called the behavior of the men in the video horrific even by Islamic State standards. \u201cThis is more brutal, more ugly even than ISIS; they didn\u2019t mutilate bodies like this, put their feet on someone\u2019s chest,\u201d he said. \u201cThey beheaded people, but they didn\u2019t do this sort of thing.\u201dMutilating dead bodies is a war crime under the international laws of armed conflict.Some Turkish commentators praised the events depicted in the video, and this post was typical of many on social media: \u201cIf you were men, you would not give weapons to women and put them on the front lines.\u201dMany Kurdish women saw the conduct shown in the video as expressing hatred for the role women play in the Kurdish militias, where women and men have separate units but fight together.\u201cThey want to break the women, they don\u2019t want them to be free,\u201d said Berivan Hesen, the co-president of the Kurdish civil government in Kobani, Syria. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been following public opinion, and every woman in the world was hurt by what happened to Barin Kobani.\u201dCarlotta Gall contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Hwaida Saad from Beirut.Advertisement"}

He leans against his bike and devours the messy sandwich, savoring the deeply comforting blend of textures and spices.\u201cWe were only doing 150 covers on Friday and Saturday nights,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted a line out the door.\u201dMr. Cardoz opened Paowalla with the intention of recapturing the conviviality of Tabla\u2019s popular downstairs bread bar, with fluffy Cheddar-bacon kulchas baked fresh in a wood-burning oven, sticky-sweet pork ribs vindaloo and a fiercely spicy Indo-Chinese three-chile chicken. But that goal proved elusive, he said.Mr. Meyer agreed. \u201cThere was something sexy about the bread bar and the way it touched all the senses that was missing from Paowalla,\u201d he said.Paowalla desperately needed that lively, unfiltered spirit, he realized. His investors agreed to put in additional capital to transform it into the Bombay Bread Bar. The name is an amalgamation of the two restaurants that have best represented his culinary identity: the Bombay Canteen and Tabla\u2019s Bread Bar.The new menu is dominated by dishes that are personal to Mr. Cardoz, who grew up in Bombay and Goa. The breads, and favorites like the vindaloo, three-chile chicken and Eggs Kejriwal are staying put. But there are new snacks like onion ring bhajias, or fritters, served with his mother\u2019s cinnamon and clove-spiked ketchup; and bhel puri, a tangy, crunchy, chutney-coated puffed rice snack typical of Bombay street vendors.A short list of larger dishes includes his grandmother\u2019s Goan fish curry, dressed in coconut and chilies; and short-rib nihari, a slow-cooked Hyderabadi stew spiced with garam masala.To match the restaurant\u2019s breezier fare, the walls will be bathed in bright pops of blue and yellow, and the dark wood tables will be covered with loud floral tablecloths.The most promising news of all? Mr. Cardoz has decided to re-create that braised lamb sandwich from his school days.

{"Headline": "To Stir Discord in 2016, Russians Turned Most Often to Facebook", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2014, Russians working for a shadowy firm called the Internet Research Agency started gathering American followers in online groups focused on issues like religion and immigration. Around mid-2015, the Russians began buying digital ads to spread their messages. A year later, they tapped their followers to help organize political rallies across the United States.While the indictment does not accuse Facebook of any wrongdoing, it provided the first comprehensive account from the authorities of how critical the company\u2019s platforms had been to the Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 election. Facebook and Instagram were mentioned 41 times, while other technology that the Russians used was featured far less. Twitter was referred to nine times, YouTube once and the electronic payments company PayPal 11 times.It is unprecedented for an American technology company to be so central to what the authorities say was a foreign scheme to commit election fraud in the United States. The indictment further batters Facebook\u2019s image after it has spent months grappling with questions about how it was misused and why it did not act earlier to prevent that activity.Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, said the indictment laid bare how effectively Facebook could be turned against the country.\u201cFacebook built incredibly effective tools which let Russia profile citizens here in the U.S. and figure out how to manipulate us,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cFacebook, essentially, gave them everything they needed.\u201d He added that many of the tools that the Russians used, including those that allow ads to be targeted and that show how widespread an ad becomes, still pervade Facebook.Yet Facebook\u2019s multiple mentions in Friday\u2019s indictment renew questions of why the world\u2019s biggest social media company didn\u2019t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company\u2019s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia\u2019s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election. On Saturday, President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory.In Silicon Valley, where Facebook has its headquarters, some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public.\u201cMueller\u2019s indictment underscores the central role of Facebook and other platforms in the Russian interference in 2016,\u201d said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who had invested early in Facebook. \u201cIn its heyday, television brought the country together, giving viewers a shared set of facts and experiences. Facebook does just the opposite, enabling every user to have a unique set of facts, driving the country apart for profit.\u201dJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action \u201cagainst those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.\u201dHe added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place. \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\u201d he said.Facebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors. Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel\u2019s investigation.YouTube did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and \u201cis intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.\u201dAccording to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency, created in 2014 in St. Petersburg and employing about 80 people, was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes.The group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014, when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion. Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.By 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.The Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: \u201cHatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201dAround 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.By mid-2016, according to the indictment, the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States. That June, for example, posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook, they promoted a rally called \u201cSupport Hillary. Save American Muslims.\u201d For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook, the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.At every step, the Russians used Facebook\u2019s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. Those tools allowed them to get real-time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers.Researchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation, it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively.Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "13 Russians Indicted as Mueller Reveals Effort to Aid Trump Campaign", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department charged 13 Russians and three companies on Friday in a sprawling indictment that unveiled a sophisticated network designed to subvert the 2016 election and to support the Trump campaign. It stretched from an office in St. Petersburg, Russia, into the social feeds of Americans and ultimately reached the streets of election battleground states.The Russians stole the identities of American citizens, posed as political activists and used the flash points of immigration, religion and race to manipulate a campaign in which those issues were already particularly divisive, prosecutors said.Some of the Russians were also in contact with \u201cunwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign,\u201d according to court papers. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation, made no accusation that President Trump or his associates were knowingly part of the conspiracy.\u201cThe indictment alleges that the Russian conspirators want to promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy,\u201d Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the inquiry, said in a brief news conference. \u201cWe must not allow them to succeed.\u201dThe 37-page indictment \u2014 handed up by a federal grand jury in Washington \u2014 amounted to a detailed rebuttal of Mr. Trump, who has sowed doubts that Russia interfered in the election and dismissed questions about its meddling as \u201cfake news.\u201dThe Justice Department said Mr. Mueller\u2019s work was not complete. The indictment does not address the hacking of Democratic email systems or whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the F.B.I. investigation into Russian interference. Mr. Mueller is negotiating with the president\u2019s lawyers over the terms of a possible interview.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.But Mr. Trump\u2019s statement ignored the government\u2019s conclusion that, by 2016, the Russians were \u201csupporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump\u201d and disparaging Hillary Clinton, his opponent. Working out of the office in St. Petersburg, the Russians described waging \u201cinformation warfare against the United States of America,\u201d according to court documents.Whether any of that violated federal law is the weightiest question facing Mr. Mueller, and Friday\u2019s indictment did not answer it. But it painted a picture of a Russian operation that was multipronged, well financed and relentless.Russian operatives traveled across the United States to gather intelligence and foment political discord. They worked with an unidentified American who advised them to focus their efforts on what they viewed as \u201cpurple\u201d election battleground states, including Colorado, Virginia and Florida, the indictment said.In August 2016, prosecutors said, Russians posed as Americans and coordinated with Trump campaign staff to organize rallies in Florida.Such anecdotes are rare examples of how intelligence agencies work covertly to influence political outcomes abroad. The C.I.A. has conducted such operations for decades, but both Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment and an intelligence assessment last year present a startling example \u2014 unprecedented in its scope and audacity \u2014 of a foreign government working to help elect an American president.The indictment does not explicitly say the Russian government sponsored the effort, but American intelligence officials have publicly said that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed and oversaw it. The indictment notes that two of the Russian firms involved hold Russian government contracts.\u201cThis is clearly a message document,\u201d Robert S. Litt, the former general counsel to the director of national intelligence, said of the indictment. \u201cMueller wants to end the debate over whether there was Russian interference in the election.\u201dThe Russian nationals were accused of working with the Internet Research Agency, which had a budget of millions of dollars and was designed to reach millions of Americans. The defendants were charged with carrying out a massive fraud against the American government and conspiring to obstruct enforcement of federal laws.None of the defendants were arrested \u2014 Russia does not generally extradite its citizens to the United States. But prosecutors use such indictments to name and shame operatives, making it harder for them to work undetected in the future. If they travel abroad, they risk capture and extradition.Russian computer specialists, divided into day teams and night teams, created hundreds of social media accounts that eventually attracted hundreds of thousands of online followers. They posed as Christian activists, anti-immigration groups and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement. One account posed as the Tennessee Republican Party and generated hundreds of thousands of followers, prosecutors said.Separate divisions of the Internet Research Agency were in charge of graphics, data analysis and information technology, according to the indictment.\u201cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people,\u201d one of the Russians, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina, wrote as the operation was being unmasked.Their tasks included undermining Mrs. Clinton by supporting her Democratic primary campaign rival, Bernie Sanders, prosecutors said. Those instructions were detailed in internal documents: \u201cUse any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump \u2014 we support them).\u201d Mr. Mueller identified 13 digital advertisements paid for by the Russian operation. All of them attacked Mrs. Clinton or promoted Mr. Trump.\u201cHillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is,\u201d one advertisement stated.In summer 2016, as Mrs. Clinton appeared headed for a decisive general election victory, Russian operatives promoted allegations of Democratic voter fraud. That echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s own message that he was the victim of a rigged political system.After the election, the Russians kept up their efforts to foment dissent. In November, they staged two rallies in New York on the same day. One had the theme, \u201cShow your support for President-Elect Trump.\u201d The other was called, \u201cTrump is NOT my President.\u201dThe indictment does not say that Russia changed the outcome of the election, a fact that Mr. Rosenstein noted repeatedly. American intelligence officials have said they have no way of calculating the effect of the Russian influence.The Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told the RBC news website that Russian officials have not familiarized themselves with the document yet.Scott Shane and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting from Washington, Michael Schwirtz from New York, and Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "They Just Want to Meet the Nice People", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Tony Award-winning production, which opened in March of last year at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater on West 45th Street, tells the true story of what happened on 9/11 when 38 planes from all over the world were rerouted and ordered to land in Gander, a remote, tiny town in the northeastern part of Newfoundland.For five days, about 10,000 residents from the province fed, housed and consoled some 6,700 unexpected visitors. Some opened their homes to people in need of showers, a change of clothes or a warm bed. Others bought rounds of drinks for stir-crazy passengers at the local bar. One local, Beulah Cooper, sat by a landline for days with a New Yorker who was waiting for any news about her firefighter son.Right away, audiences connected to the quirky story of mass generosity. But for Ms. Pearson, seeing it was particularly powerful. For the past year she had experienced heightened anxiety, she said, ever since the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound overwhelmingly melodramatic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there was a certain amount of survival of hope at stake.\u201dWhen the musical was over, long after the clapping and dancing had stopped, Ms. Pearson was scheming. \u201cI had this feeling that there was goodness, that if these people are really like this, I have to go there and meet them.\u201d By November she was on a plane to Gander to explore the area with Jenni Swan, 34, another New Yorker she\u2019d met at a group discussion about the play.Surprisingly, Ms. Pearson is not unusual. She and Ms. Swan are two of many Broadway theatergoers who have seen the show and made pilgrimages to Newfoundland.\u201cOur tourism was up 30 percent this past summer from the previous year,\u201d said Claude Elliott, the former mayor of Gander and a prominent character in the production. \u201cThe way the world is reacting, the people who want to visit us \u2014 never in our wildest dreams did we think this would happen.\u201d Tourism is now a billion dollar industry on the island, according to the Newfoundland\u2019s tourism department.Ms. Pearson said she simply wanted to visit the region to meet \u201cnice people.\u201d She spent her vacation going to the mall, to the village green, to the local Tim Hortons (the Canadian coffee and doughnut chain), just to talk to whomever was next to her.Other travelers are focused on meeting the real-life characters and visiting the locations featured in the show. \u201cThe play is 100 percent accurate,\u201d Mr. Elliott said. \u201cEverything that is in that musical happened.\u201dWhen Ryan Kraft, a 34-year-old sign-language interpreter in Toronto, visited New York for the Broadway premiere of the show last year, he got to meet Diane Davis, a retired teacher who had inspired a role in the musical. He had reached out to her several weeks before his trip to see if she\u2019d be at the premiere.\u201cI was obsessed, so I sent her a message on Facebook and said, \u2018I would like to meet you because I\u2019ve seen all your videos and interviews,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kraft said. \u201cHer response was something like, \u2018Oh! My first stalker.\u2019\u201d After they met in New York, she helped him plan his trip to Gander.He visited every site in the show, from the international terminal of the airport to the Dover Fault, where two stranded passengers fell in love. \u201cI laid on a picnic table and listened to the soundtrack,\u201d Mr. Kraft said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re on a \u2018Come From Away\u2019 trip.\u201dMary and Burt Emerson, of Naperville, Ill., saw the musical in both New York and Washington, D.C. They traveled to Newfoundland for their wedding anniversary, wearing their souvenir shirts wherever they went. \u201cPeople noticed them and then started telling us stories of what happened during 9/11,\u201d Ms. Emerson said.They visited the mayor\u2019s office, where they flipped through binders of thank-you notes sent by stranded passengers after they\u2019d made it home. They also got \u201cscreeched in,\u201d a ceremony performed on non-Newfoundlanders in the musical that involves a speech, a shot of rum (or \u201cscreech\u201d) and kissing a dead fish. \u201cIt was a three-month-old cod they kept in the freezer,\u201d said Mr. Emerson. \u201cIt was nasty-looking, but it was fun.\u201d\u201cAll you have to do: the first Newfoundlander you meet, tell them what you want to do, and we will take it from there,\u201d Mr. Elliott said. \u201cI would say within an hour you can meet whoever you want to meet.\u201dMs. Swan, the executive assistant from New York who traveled with Ms. Pearson, said that the trip to Gander was therapeutic. \u201cI\u2019ve been in New York City for 13\u00bd years, so it\u2019s easy to get bogged down in the pressures,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing there and seeing what a positive mind-set these people have, I catch myself more when I\u2019m stressing.\u201dThe people of Gander may be welcoming tourists with open arms, but they are also taking full advantage of their moment in the sun. The town now has official van tours, welcome centers and signs for \u201cCome From Away\u201d fans. Gander\u2019s website warns those planning to visit during peak season (summer) to book accommodations and car rentals well in advance. Mr. Elliott, however, doesn\u2019t think this is an issue. \u201cIf there is no more room just give someone a call, and you can stay in their home,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way we are.\u201dMr. and Ms. Emerson are heading back sometime in 2018 to see sites like Gros Morne National Park. Ms. Pearson and Ms. Swan are also taking another trip in June to take in the icebergs, the whales and some little towns they missed on their first trip.The exchange goes both ways. The \u201cIslanders,\u201d as they call themselves in the musical, are visiting New York, too.\u201cIt was an eerie feeling being at ground zero,\u201d Mr. Elliott said. \u201cIt was like I was walking on sacred ground. You look around and close your eyes and you can envision what these people were going through that day and what terror must have been going through everybody over here.\u201dFor Ms. Davis, the retired teacher, the Broadway premiere provided an opportunity for her to visit New York for the first time. She found that when she opened up to New Yorkers about her story, they were as hospitable to her as she had been to them. While in line at the 9/11 Tribute Museum, one man insisted on paying her admission fee. Outside the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, she asked a local couple to take her picture. They ended up inviting her to their home for dinner. \u201cSaying no was one of my biggest regrets of my time in New York City,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was being on the receiving end of people giving. Going to places and having someone pay your meal or offer to take you somewhere,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an overwhelming experience.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mercedes-Benz Quotes the Dalai Lama. China Notices. Apology Follows.", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe German carmaker Daimler publicly apologized on Tuesday after its Mercedes-Benz brand caused an outcry in China by quoting the Dalai Lama in a social media post.The move by the automaker is the latest example of a foreign company being cowed by the growing power of a critical, but increasingly nationalistic, consumer market. Many in China view the Dalai Lama as a dangerous voice for separatism in a region, Tibet, that they consider an integral part of their country.China typically responds furiously when a foreign leader, celebrity or company meets with the Dalai Lama or mentions him. Beijing accuses him of seeking independence for Tibet, but the spiritual leader insists that he is only seeking the autonomy promised by the Chinese government.The post carried an \u201cerroneous message\u201d and was removed, Mercedes said in a statement posted on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter.

Needless to say, it\u2019s hateful.\u201dDaimler\u2019s response highlights the vulnerabilities of foreign companies operating in a market like China, which is highly sensitive to any slight. Many companies, including Apple and Yum Brands, which owns the restaurant franchises Pizza Hut and KFC, have had to apologize because of an internet-savvy population that is quick to stoke a backlash against foreign businesses.After that episode, Chinese consumers scoured the internet for other offenders. Delta Air Lines and the Spanish clothing retailer Zara were similarly rebuked by Chinese authorities for listing Taiwan and Tibet as countries on their websites.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indictment Leaves No Doubt: Russia Backed Trump. But Was It the Difference?", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpponents of Mr. Trump do not yet have any conclusive proof that he colluded with the Russians. And Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters must continue to contend with questions about whether his upset for the ages was the result of foul play.That has left both sides grappling with a new twist in a debate that has consumed the political universe since the revealing final hours of election night: How did he do it?The dispute is especially raw because of the razor-thin margin in the election and the uncertainty over what exactly tipped the balance. Mrs. Clinton, who handily won the national popular vote, lost the Electoral College vote and therefore the presidency because Mr. Trump defeated her by less than a combined 80,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Few Democrats believe that Mr. Trump won solely as a result of Russia\u2019s intervention. But many think the meddling exacerbated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s challenges, making her more vulnerable to what some believe was the decisive blow: the announcement by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, just over a week before the election that he was reopening the investigation into her use of a private email server.\u201cRussia succeeded in weakening her enough so that the Comey letter could knock her off,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign communications director.But veterans of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign shake their head at what they believe is an abiding sense of denial among Clinton loyalists over her deficiencies.\u201cThe election was still won because Donald Trump was a better candidate with a superior message taking on a horrible candidate who people thought was corrupt,\u201d said David Bossie, a senior Trump strategist who is now president of the conservative lobbying group Citizens United. He allowed that Moscow had mounted a \u201cmalicious, disruptive campaign.\u201dNo single factor was determinative in an election that brought nearly 140 million Americans to the polls. And the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies say they do not have any way to calculate whether the Russian effort swung the election.\u201cTo credit the victory to anyone else including those 13 Russians is to demean everyday Americans\u2019 power to control their own destiny,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign chief executive, who reportedly spent 20 hours with the team led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, last week. \u201cThe \u2018deplorables\u2019 deserve better.\u201dYet it is difficult for Republicans to contend that the multimillion-dollar Russian intervention had no impact, with 126 million Americans being exposed to Russian-sponsored posts on Facebook alone.The interference was not limited to the actions laid out by Mr. Mueller in the indictment of the 13 Russians linked to a \u201ctroll farm\u201d known as the Internet Research Agency.According to the intelligence community, the Russian government supported the email hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, as well as the disclosure of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s paid speeches. The committee emails, leaked just before the Democratic National Convention, helped increase the rancor between supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.And the Podesta emails, leaked slowly over the month of October, were doled out selectively, with a number of exchanges held back, according to two Clinton campaign officials. While there were plenty of anodyne messages in the trove, the hackers made sure to reveal the messages that maximized the appearance of D.N.C. behavior unfairly favoring Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.Further, a major factor in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss of the three crucial Rust Belt states, which every Democratic nominee had carried since 1992, was a drop-off in turnout and the performance of third-party candidates.She could not match former President Barack Obama\u2019s turnout among blacks in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, captured enough votes to make up the difference between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.The indictment says the Russians worked to exacerbate those challenges. It says that they funded social media posts that were explicitly aimed at encouraging \u201cU.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate.\u201dFor example, the Russians created an Instagram account, \u201cWoke Blacks,\u201d and posted messages urging African-Americans not to vote at all rather than support \u201cthe lesser of two devils.\u201d They also purchased an ad on Instagram to promote a post that read: \u201cChoose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it\u2019s not a wasted vote.\u201d\u201cThe Stein vote alone clearly diminished Clinton\u2019s vote and some of the vote that might have gone to us in Milwaukee and stayed home was probably discouraged, and this Russia stuff played a role in that discouragement,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster based in Wisconsin. \u201cOut of the 10 factors that most caused Trump to win, maybe this was only the seventh, but the fact that this is even on a relatively short list ought to be alarming.\u201dStill, Republicans and even some Democrats note that the Russian meddling may not have mattered at all if Mrs. Clinton had run a better campaign. She ventured twice to Ohio in the final days of the campaign \u2014 a state she would lose by eight points \u2014 but never set foot in Wisconsin during the general election, and she made a few strategic errors in Michigan.Despite pleas from Michigan officials, her national campaign did not ask Mr. Obama to visit the state until the last day of the campaign \u2014 and it was forced to dispatch him to Ann Arbor to rally college students rather than sending him to Detroit, because a police funeral was scheduled in the city.Read the text of the indictment of 13 foreigners associated with Russia and three Russian organizations with illegally using social media platforms to sow political discordAnd when Mrs. Clinton visited Michigan in the last days of the election, she spent some of her time in the deeply conservative and religious western part of the state trying to win over Republicans who were thought to be uneasy with Mr. Trump on moral grounds.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who pleaded with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign to devote more attention to the state. \u201cThe Russians clearly did things that made their way into Michigan. At the same time, as Democrats, if we\u2019re not talking about issues that matter to people, then we\u2019re not connecting with our base either.\u201dStu Sandler, a Michigan Republican strategist, was blunter: \u201cClinton didn\u2019t do enough in inner-city Detroit, and that was noticed by a lot of Democrats here.\u201dMrs. Clinton did spend considerable time in Pennsylvania, but she suffered there from what plagued her in the other parts of the industrial Midwest: Too many black voters stayed home, a slice of white liberals voted third-party, and many of the working-class whites who had backed Mr. Obama swung to Mr. Trump.Her environmental and gun-control policies turned off some of the state\u2019s ancestral Democrats, and the views she and her husband held in the 1990s on criminal justice depressed black turnout.\u201cShe was very unpopular here, so she didn\u2019t motivate the Democrats,\u201d said Rob Gleason, who was the state Republican chairman in 2016.To Democrats, though, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shortcomings were precisely what Russia preyed on to undercut her campaign.\u201cWe will never be able to know for certain if the massive Russian operation was the difference between victory and defeat,\u201d said Representative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut there is one thing we absolutely can say with certainty: It was a factor. The Russians wouldn\u2019t have devoted hundreds of people and tens of millions of dollars on this operation if it wasn\u2019t having an effect.\u201dEven as Mr. Trump polarizes the country, both his admirers and detractors found themselves in agreement with one of his many Twitter observations on Sunday: that the Russians intended to sow chaos, and \u201chave succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}

The farther from Anchorage shoppers are, the more often they encounter them. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way around it,\u201d Mr. Lacy said.Leah Glasscock-Sanders, a recess attendant at a charter school in Wasilla, an Anchorage suburb, always plans her shopping in the early mornings to get the best selection. Even so, she sometimes can\u2019t find what she needs.\u201cIt\u2019s cleaned out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere might be five bell peppers to choose from when I get there, and they would all be of a quality I wouldn\u2019t purchase.\u201dAll of this deprivation can lead to unusual relationships. Maybe there\u2019s a \u201cpeach guy\u201d you meet in a parking lot, and you trade $70 in cash for a case of what\u2019s in his trunk. Or, if you live way up north, you may plead on Facebook for someone, anyone, to tuck an avocado into a pocket when he gets on a bush plane to your village. And you may think about it for days until it arrives, as you watch Giada and the Barefoot Contessa on cable.And then, after you thank whoever brought you the avocado with some caribou meat from your freezer, you may cut it in half and share it with your best friend, keeping it a secret from the children.\u201cYou have to cultivate these relationships when you are living in a place like this,\u201d she said.\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve smuggled back some things,\u201d she said.Isolation stokes her imagination, she said; cravings motivate her. They make Alaska a perfect laboratory for writing recipes. No pine nuts? Use pistachios. No lemons? Try oranges.\u201cI cannot tell you how many times I envisioned a recipe and I went to the store and I couldn\u2019t find the ingredients,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cI was so spoiled in California. Alaska has made me such a much more self-sufficient human being.\u201dIt used to be worse. Maybe 50 years ago, most winter vegetables and fruit came frozen or in a can. Many Anchorage children first encountered cherries, for example, in canned fruit cocktail, waxy and pink.Allison Warden, an artist and rapper who lives in Anchorage, is Inupiaq, with roots in the far-north village of Kaktovik. She lives with her mother, and they share a freezer full of wild foods: caribou, walrus, seal, whitefish, duck, seal liver and whale, mostly supplied by family.When money is tight in winter, Ms. Warden finds herself eating traditional proteins and rice, but her fantasies are full of tropical fruit. She still remembers eating her first mango, when she was 28, on a trip to New York.\u201cIt was the most amazing thing ever that I never thought I could ever taste,\u201d she said.Kate Consenstein, who owns a communications business in Anchorage, believes in eating seasonally, but then something comes over her when she glimpses an exotic fruit among the waxy apples and leathery oranges in Safeway, like a four-leaf clover in the grass.\u201cWhen you live in Alaska and, like, a dragon fruit waves at you from a stack at the grocery store, I run at it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m moved by its gravitational pull. I want that sweet brightness. I want it in my mouth. Then I get to the register and it\u2019s 20 freaking dollars. And I am like, so be it.\u201dMr. Watt, the chef at Fire Island bakery, is originally from South Carolina. He decided years ago to lean into Alaska\u2019s extremes, rather than resist them. His approach to winter cooking is to embrace the austerity and master what\u2019s left in the root cellar and freezer.\u201cYou learn what potato to get in order to get that perfect crispy exterior and the buttery interior,\u201d he said. \u201cYou figure out that roasting a whole carrot until it turns black is delicious.\u201dAlaska summers, short and lush, are electric, the long days packed with activity. In winter, he said, you get to catch your breath and revel in the slowness. You study the incremental return of the light, enjoy anticipation, get drunk on spring when it comes. Once you understand how all that works, you can call yourself Alaskan.\u201cThis is your penance,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get through it. Then you\u2019re rewarded, slowly at first with a few radishes and maybe a little bit of greens, and later with, like, everything. You are paying your dues in order to be a local in the summertime.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Atlantic Plans a Hiring Spree", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA media company is expanding its newsroom. You read that right.The Atlantic plans to add as many as 100 employees to its staff over the next 12 months, its president, Bob Cohn, told employees during a staff meeting on Wednesday. The hirings will represent a 30 percent increase in personnel at the publication, with half the jobs going to newsroom employees.\u201cWe have great ambitions to grow The Atlantic and make it better and these are the ways we think we can do it,\u201d Mr. Cohn said in an interview on Tuesday.The ramping up comes six months after Emerson Collective, an organization run by the philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic.With Emerson Collective as its new patron, The Atlantic has avoided the grim fates of its fellow news organizations. In a memo to the staff, Mr. Cohn said that circulation is at an all-time high \u2014 it rose 13 percent last year \u2014 and that visits to TheAtlantic.com rose by 25 percent in 2017.The planned additions to the newsroom are meant to bolster the magazine\u2019s coverage of Washington, Hollywood, Europe and the tech industry.\u201cIt will be a mix of writers and editors and video producers and podcast producers and live events producers,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cThose are areas of coverage that we want to focus on, and we\u2019ll do it across all our platforms: digital, print, live events, video, audio, newsletters.\u201dOther jobs will go to engineers, designers and members of a new team the magazine has called Talent Lab, which is intended to \u201chelp us achieve one of our paramount goals: ensuring that our team is truly representative of America in all of its diversity,\u201d Mr. Cohn wrote.When it acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic, Emerson Collective \u2014 which focuses on education, the environment and immigration \u2014 expanded its portfolio of media and entertainment holdings. It is also an investor in Axios, a media company started by the Politico co-founder Jim VandeHei and its former star reporter, Mike Allen, and in Pop-Up Magazine. In 2016, it took a minority stake in Anonymous Content, the production and talent management company behind the movie \u201cSpotlight.\u201dThe organization also supports several nonprofit journalism organizations, including The Marshall Project, Mother Jones and ProPublica. It was founded in 2004 by Ms. Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple co-founder Steven P. Jobs, who died in 2011.\u201cEmerson is eager to see us grow and succeed, and they were excited at helping to make this happen,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.Mr. Goldberg said he looks forward to bringing The Atlantic back to its 19th-century roots, when its founders, including heavyweights like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes, viewed the magazine as a forum for some good old intellectual brawls and tussles.\u201cWe are in a moment of national fracturing, and our expansion allows us to do a lot more of the kind of work that really is in our DNA,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said. \u201cWe can double down on our coverage of Washington and this administration.

The festival also features videos and multimedia pieces, which might help new collectors of Indian origin who are accustomed to paintings and sculptures accept the idea of limited editions instead of a single object, something that Mr. Gupta said was a problem when photography first hit the Indian market. \u201cI hope it\u2019s going to encourage people to look at this region more carefully and become better acquainted with it for a variety of reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe standard history of photography seems to be an American idea and there is very little else except a European or Japanese contribution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should You Invite Your Ex to the Wedding?", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike so many brides, Itamar Conner put a lot of thought into the guest list for her wedding last year.She wanted to be surrounded only by her closest family and friends when she said her vows on Sept. 23 in the chapel on the Marine Corps Base at Quantico in Virginia and when she danced the night away in a small romantic taco restaurant in downtown Manassas. \u201cI was in a Mexican food phase,\u201d said Ms. Conner, 22.Some guests clearly made the cut: her and her husband\u2019s immediate family; friends they each had known since grade school; an inner circle of new friends they socialized with as a couple. But other possibilities required more thought, especially two men Ms. Conner had dated previously whom she still considered friends.Ms. Conner\u2019s husband let her make the decision, and she eventually decided it would be inappropriate to have them at their wedding.\u201cBefore we met each other, we had both been out in the dating scene, having fun, being 21-year-olds,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for our wedding day, something we treasured so much, we didn\u2019t want it to be tainted with our past. We didn\u2019t want to see a picture of my exes in the wedding photos.\u201dWhat this means for couples getting married is that when it comes time to draw up the guest list, more people have to decide whether they will include past relationships or hookups in their festivities.This can be a tricky, sensitive issue for both the couple and the past partner, according to Ms. Gottsman. \u201cThere really aren\u2019t any definites,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is subjective based on the feelings of the couple and the circumstances.\u201dPaul Hwang, a 24-year-old Marine at Quantico, married his wife, Rayliene Hwang, on July 7, 2017, in an apple orchard in Sacramento. He had met her through a close male friend who had dated her. Despite that tricky situation, they were still friends, and Mr. Hwang asked him to be his best man.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of a lot of weddings where it\u2019s like you went on one date with this person, so you can\u2019t invite them,\u201d he said.\u201cBut for me, even knowing that they probably had a sexual relationship when they were dating, it is in the past. You can\u2019t hold someone accountable for what they did. A kiss is just a kiss.\u201dRachel Sussman, a marriage and relationship therapist in New York, said a good test for deciding whether an ex should be invited is whether that person has been part of the life of the couple.\u201cMost couples when they get engaged, they\u2019ve been dating for two, three or four years,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone all of a sudden says, \u2018I want to invite this person to my wedding,\u2019 and their fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t met him or her, that\u2019s weird to me.\u201dEven when the bride and groom are certain about their decision, it can be an emotional choice for the former partner.Mr. Hwang\u2019s friend ended up choosing not to come to the wedding after there was a misunderstanding about the date of the wedding. Ms. Hwang said it was probably for the best. \u201cI think it would have been a diss if we didn\u2019t even invite him at all,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe it would have been a little awkward if he was there. I told him some intimate things about myself.\u201dCristina Garcia, a 38-year-old dietitian and wellness consultant in Austin, Tex., who is happily married with children, was shocked when her high school sweetheart hand-delivered an invitation to his wedding. \u201cI knew he was dating someone and they were serious, and I was happy for him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I never expected the wife would be cool with inviting me to the wedding.\u201dShe attended and found the experience baffling. \u201cThe doors opened, the bride is there, and he was looking for me,\u201d she said. \u201cOur eyes locked. Then they continued with the ceremony, and I congratulated them after and watched them do their first dance. Maybe it was his version of closure.\u201d She added that it was a moment she will never forget for her entire life.Then there are the people left out of the festivities.Jessica Birch, a 33-year-old special education teacher in Manhattan, felt isolated when she wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding of an ex-boyfriend from college who ended up dating and later marrying a mutual friend. \u201cWe were all part of the same clique in our rowing club,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was similar to any club where you have both guys and girls. You all just end up dating each other at some point.\u201dShe found out she wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding when other mutual friends inquired whether she was going. \u201cI played it off not like I wasn\u2019t invited but that I couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw all my friends at the wedding on Facebook. It really sucked.\u201dWhile couples shouldn\u2019t invite an ex to their wedding just because he or she may feel left out, there are some motivations that are more respectful and more kind than others.\u201cAre you all friends now and the bride or groom is just jealous? If that\u2019s the case, that is a sign of bigger problems to come. That person is going to be jealous of co-workers and family members down the line,\u201d Ms. Gottsman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a declaration that this is a fresh start for us, we are keeping it limited to close family and friends, that is different.\u201dOf course, not every situation with an ex is tricky. When Laurel Niedospial, a 33-year-old freelance writer in Chicago got married on June 17, 2012, she had no hesitation about inviting her ex-boyfriend, who was already married to her close friend, to the wedding. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she said. \u201cI stopped thinking about him as an ex-boyfriend years before that.\u201dHe ended up being useful. When there was miscommunication with the wedding planner about making arrangements for a s\u2019mores bar, her ex picked up the skewers and ran the whole station, helping guests spread peanut butter and marshmallows on their graham crackers.She had no doubt that she made the right decision in what could have been an awkward situation for others. \u201cThere were no feelings there,\u201d she said of the former romance. \u201cHe managed to save the day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the E.U.\u2019s Migrant Crisis Reached the Streets of Brussels", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The city is freezing. At night, Hamza Khater eats and sleeps at a volunteer-run shelter. He spends his days hanging around the international bus stop next to the Gare du Nord.Sudanese migrants like Mr. Khater are increasingly visible in Brussels, around train stations, in public squares and parks, sometimes sleeping in the streets. Mehdi Kassou, an organizer for a volunteer group that provides shelter for about 500 migrants each night, estimates that about 45 percent of them are Sudanese.Very few of the Sudanese people who have recently arrived in Brussels seem to be planning to stay: Sudan was not among the top 10 countries of origin for those applying for asylum in Belgium last month. Many, like Mr. Khater, hope to reach Britain, which is Sudan\u2019s former colonial power and has a sizable Sudanese population.Mr. Khater certainly does not want to stay in Belgium. \u201cI am afraid here,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t have an education, I don\u2019t have money, I don\u2019t speak French.\u201dMost important, he added, \u201cBelgium doesn\u2019t understand the politics of Sudan; if I ask asylum here, Belgium may send me back to Italy immediately, or worse, even to Khartoum.\u201dEuropean Union law requires migrants to apply for residency or asylum in the first country in the bloc they reach. In the past three years, tens of thousands of Sudanese have crossed the Mediterranean by boat, landing in Italy, Greece or Spain. Most applied for asylum, and only a few hundred have been deported, according to the International Organization for Migration.Many Sudanese, however, seek to move on, in secret and without papers, to Britain. Often that involves camping for months near bus stops, truck stops, train stations or seaports.So what do countries owe such transitory migrants? Belgium\u2019s state secretary for asylum policy and migration, Theo Francken, has argued that the state cannot take responsibility for those who do not claim asylum.His reasoning is that if Belgium allows a few hundred migrants to reside illegally on its territory, it could attract millions of others, potentially plundering Belgium\u2019s generous social security system.Seeing unauthorized migration rise in Brussels last summer, the Belgian government ordered a series of heavy-handed raids on informal camps and homeless shelters. Those raids \u2014 along with falling temperatures \u2014 have largely succeeded in breaking up camps in public parks, and received wide popular support.Even so, hundreds of Belgian families have reacted by inviting migrants into their homes. (Last month, the government proposed police raids on the houses of citizens suspected of sheltering unauthorized migrants.) Medical charities are providing food, clothes and assistance, and volunteers have set up shelters like the one where Mr. Khater sleeps, in a former office building. The total cost of sheltering one migrant is about 10 euros per night, organizers estimate.There have been several demonstrations against the government policies, and about 3,000 people formed a human chain around migrants at the Gare du Nord last month to prevent a police raid.The crackdown has also exposed Belgium to the possibility of rebuke on human rights grounds.The report said it was impossible to establish whether the abuses had taken place.At the Gare du Nord, Mr. Khater and several fellow travelers showed wounds and scars that they said had been inflicted by the Belgian police. One had a dislocated thumb, another a fresh cut across his jaw, yet another a stitched eyebrow. Several had open wounds. All said they knew Sudanese men who had recently been deported to Khartoum and then dropped out of contact.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t the police kind to us?\u201d Mr. Khater asked. \u201cI am running for my life. I did do nothing wrong. I don\u2019t understand the politics here.\u201dMr. Kassou, the shelter organizer, agreed that \u201ccertain officers in certain towns, not all police\u201d could be \u201cpretty violent with migrants.\u201d \u201cWe very regularly have people who enter with wounds, even bites from police dogs,\u201d he said.Sarah Frederickx, a spokeswoman for the Belgian police, said that officers treated transitory migrants in \u201ca very empathic and humane way.\u201d That being said, she added, \u201cit is possible that during certain operations, for instance when people fiercely resist police actions, officers use force, but in proportion.\u201dMany aspects of what is happening are familiar, according to Johan Leman, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the Catholic University of Leuven who is an expert on Belgian migration policy and has worked with migrants in Brussels for decades. \u201cIrregular migration from Africa to Europe isn\u2019t new,\u201d he said. Tough return policies have existed in Europe since the 1980s, and the continent experienced a refugee crisis in the 1990s after the breakup of Yugoslavia.\u201cWhat is new,\u201d he said, \u201cand what I have never seen before in Europe to this extent, is, first of all, that ministers are pounding their chests, saying, \u2018Look at me, how many people I have deported now.\u2019 And secondly, that people are being deported back to a country of which we manifestly know that the government is violating human rights \u2014 I am thinking of Sudan here.\u201dWhen police officers arrested several Sudanese migrants, including three minors, around the Gare du Nord last year, Mr. Francken, the state secretary for asylum policy, described the operation on Facebook as a \u201ccleanup.\u201d After a public outcry condemning the remark as xenophobic, he offered his apologies to the prime minister, who did not accept them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Top Aide to Netanyahu Turns State Witness as Graft Cases Multiply", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 One of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s closest and longest-serving aides appeared ready to incriminate him on Wednesday after agreeing overnight to become a government witness, the latest twist in a spiraling graft scandal that seemed to dim Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s legal and political chances of survival almost by the hour.The fast-moving police inquiry into whether Mr. Netanyahu, already battling separate bribery allegations, had provided official favors to Israel\u2019s largest telecommunications company, Bezeq, in exchange for fawning coverage on the company\u2019s online news site prompted one member of the prime minister\u2019s party to ask him to step aside and opposition politicians to call for early elections.Mr. Netanyahu, who insists he has done nothing wrong, has faced corruption allegations periodically almost since first becoming prime minister in 1996. But the latest \u2014 with its suggestion of political payoffs to a company that bills ordinary Israeli voters every month \u2014 could prove the most damning. And as the revelations mounted, one on top of another like a tottering tower, Israelis expressed increasing doubt about Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s ability to maintain his grip on power.\u201cIt was like watching a police car chase in pursuit of a robber on one of America\u2019s endless highways,\u201d Sima Kadmon, a columnist, wrote in Wednesday\u2019s Yedioth Ahronoth of the flurry of events of the day before. \u201cRiveting hours of dramatic and fateful revelations that are going to change not only the life of the man behind the wheel, but the face of our country.\u201dThe new state\u2019s witness, Shlomo Filber \u2014 who goes by \u201cMomo\u201d \u2014 was director general of the Communications Ministry from 2015 until 2017, answering directly to Mr. Netanyahu, who at the time also held the portfolio of communications minister. The ministry ruled or weighed in on a number of key regulatory decisions that provided enormous financial benefits to Bezeq and its controlling shareholder, Shaul Elovitch.Mr. Filber, who was suspended from his post a few months ago as regulators from the Israel Securities Authority closed in, was arrested this week along with a number of other high-profile friends and confidants of Mr. Netanyahu, including Mr. Elovitch, members of his family and other senior Bezeq executives.Mr. Filber\u2019s testimony promised to connect the two main arms of the Bezeq affair: the Communications Ministry\u2019s dealings with the company and the decisions taken by editors at Walla, its online news subsidiary, according to a person with intimate knowledge of the inquiry who was not authorized to speak about it publicly. In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to seek a prison sentence for Mr. Filber.Such state\u2019s witness agreements in Israel usually involve a criminal suspect giving up a bigger fish. Mr. Filber\u2019s direct superior was Mr. Netanyahu.Mr. Filber was expected to tell the police that in his role at the ministry he was carrying out explicit and detailed instructions from Mr. Netanyahu, according to Israel\u2019s Channel 2 evening \u201cNews\u201d program, and that he came to realize he was being exploited.Through a spokesman, Mr. Netanyahu responded, \u201cIt never happened.\u201d\u201cThe main question is, what does he know?\u201d said Oren Gazal-Ayal, dean of the University of Haifa law faculty and a criminal-law specialist. \u201cAccording to suspicion, Filber was the one offering Bezeq all the benefits. He changed the policies of the government from the minute he became director-general of the ministry. If Netanyahu changed the regulations to get good coverage, and you can prove that, that\u2019s definitely a criminal offense.\u201dMr. Netanyahu has described both sets of allegations as \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cdelusional\u201d and has not yet been named a suspect or called for questioning in either case.Any actual indictment may be months away, pending a hearing with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers and a decision by the attorney general.Adding to the prime minister\u2019s woes, however, Mr. Filber is not the first former ally to have turned against Mr. Netanyahu. Many analysts predicted as early as August that Mr. Netanyahu was doomed after the police signed a state\u2019s witness deal with Ari Harow, his former chief of staff and once one of his closest confidants, in Cases 1000 and 2000.By Wednesday morning, the first hairline crack in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition had become visible, as a fellow member of Likud, Oren Hazan, called on Mr. Netanyahu to step aside. It was unclear whether other lawmakers would follow: Mr. Hazan is better known for headline-grabbing stunts than for influencing his colleagues.Mr. Filber, on the other hand, is a consummate political insider.

Always in the shadows, always loyal, efficient, secretive and ideological, Bibi knew that he could count on Momo.\u201dMr. Filber\u2019s lawyers, Dror Arad-Ayalon and Yovel Nachmani, did not immediately comment after news broke of his deal with prosecutors. Nor did the police or Justice Ministry immediately put out any announcement detailing the arrangement.Mr. Filber, 54, who has described himself as a strategic and business consultant, sits on the board of the state-owned Israel Military Industries and served from 2003 to 2009 as the board secretary of the state-owned Israel Railways and as its assets and business development manager.Before that, he headed Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s headquarters in years when Mr. Netanyahu was both in and out of office. From 1996 until 2001, he held leadership positions in the Yesha Council, the umbrella organization representing Israeli settlers in the West Bank and, at the time, in Gaza.The son of a rabbi, Yaakov Filber, who was a leader in the religious Zionist movement and the founder of a yeshiva and research center, Mr. Filber lived in the West Bank settlement of Psagot before moving to the central city of Petah Tikva, east of Tel Aviv.For all his years with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Filber appears to go back even further with the head of the Israeli police, Roni Alsheich, who has overseen the sprawling corruption investigations.\u201cGood luck Roni Alsheich,\u201d Mr. Filber wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody more suited than him.

At the immaculately orchestrated soiree-cum-fashion show at her store-front-style loft in TriBeCa last night, guests sampled Malpeque oysters, deviled quail eggs and elderflower cocktails, narrowly dodging Bobbin, the designer\u2019s terrier, who frisked underfoot.They snapped photos of the coltish models poised on a dining table raised to double as a runway. In Ms. Rose\u2019s fashion presentation, among the first of New York Fashion Week, those ponytailed mannequins showed off the cheery elements of Pearl, Ms. Rose\u2019s new diffusion line.Her coral lace dresses and dotted Swiss frocks were color-keyed to the cocktail napkins. No shame in that, Ms. Rose said, adding with only a whisper of irony, \u201cNothing says chic like matching your drink to your dress.\u201dThe scene, pointedly art directed to reflect the casually patrician sensibility that is Ms. Rose\u2019s stock in trade, attested as well to her singular brand of perfectionism.\u201cLela is relentless,\u201d said Celerie Kemble, the decorator and Ms. Rose\u2019s longtime chum. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t think about making dresses so much as she thinks of creating an ambience.\u201d When Ms. Rose is working, Ms. Kemble said, there is an imaginary film reel in her head: \u201cShe is not just about making dresses \u2014 she\u2019s thinking about where she will wear them, what will food she will serve, and what would be the perfect cocktail to balance the mood.\u201dThere is method in her mania. Ms. Rose\u2019s gathering, modeled on a traditional trunk show \u2014 more like a living room Tupperware party, actually, but selling frocks, not pots \u2014 evoked nothing so much as mid-1960s Palm Beach. There, as legend has it, Lily Pulitzer began selling her giddily patterned pink and lime shifts to an intimate circle of friends, and from a fruit stand.\u201cLela is the modern-day Lily,\u201d said Robert Burke of Robert Burke Associates, the New York luxury consulting company. The comparison is apt. \u201cLily was highly social,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cInvitations to her Sunday lunches in Palm Beach were highly coveted.\u201dHer designs were festive, breezy and candidly pretty, not unlike those of Ms. Rose.Pearl, priced from about $155 to $650, is two parts crisp practicality, one part froth. A deep-pocketed, coral tone jacket can double as a dress; boxy tweed jackets can be worn over tubular sheaths.On the more overtly coquettish side is a noodle-strapped dotted Swiss sundress and, in a stroke worthy of Lily Pulitzer herself, a floral lace shift in throbbing tangerine.The ease and flirtatiousness of the clothes is part of the draw. \u201cLela has such a sense of femininity and fun,\u201d said Jenna Bush, the \u201cToday\u201d show correspondent and twin daughter of George W. Bush.So is Ms. Rose\u2019s pedigree. Her mother is Deedie Rose, the Texas art collector and Dallas grande dame. Her father was Edward Rose, a Dallas investment banker who was one of the owners, along with Mr. Bush, of the Texas Rangers baseball team. The Bushes are old family friends, Ms. Rose wants you to know. Because, as she would be first to acknowledge, in the hotly competitive fashion world, you are only as good as the people you dress.She imagines her client as a real estate agent, or maybe junior philanthropist, or chairwoman of her local P.T.A. She may reside in any one of six cities, including San Francisco, Dallas and Charlotte, N.C. Each of those cities will in fact be served by a stylist-slash-hostess handpicked by Ms. Rose to give Lela-style parties in their own homes for a far-reaching network of local clients and friends.\u201cI love the graciousness of creating a kind of salon,\u201d Ms. Rose said. \u201cI want people in each of those cities to feel a sense of connection and community.\u201dPearl will not be sold in stores or, for the moment, online, the decision to circumvent conventional retail a strategic one.\u201cIt\u2019s a form of guerrilla marketing,\u201d Mr. Burke said, \u201ca way of connecting directly to customers.\u201cShopping,\u201d he added, \u201cis not just about Facebook ads and Instagram. I do think that people are missing the emotional and physical touch of visiting stores.\u201dAnd for fans of Ms. Rose, missing the coziness of breaking bread with friends. Tireless, the designer had baked cookies. She passed out cocktail recipes and offered canap\u00e9s.\u201cI thought of matching the canap\u00e9s to the drinks,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes, but not really abashed.\u201cThank goodness, the office talked me down from that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is how one aid worker described the situation as thousands of people fled into basements and makeshift shelters in the rebel-held suburb of Damascus this week.The assault is the latest by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces on rebel-controlled areas in a seven-year civil war that has fractured the country.\u201cPeople here are hiding from the massive bombardment,\u201d he says in the video as he ducks his head to walk through the tight space.Mr. Abdullah, who has posted updates from the area for the past several years, said some women and children had been sheltering for more than 72 hours and were in need of food and water. He described the conditions as \u201cgrave.\u201dLocal humanitarian groups have relayed the same information to international partners: The safest place to be is underground.\u201cThe fact is that people are in these basements and shelters, but it doesn\u2019t even give them the mental comfort that they are going to be safe from these bombings,\u201d Ms. Khush said. \u201cEveryone is just terrified right now.\u201d While portions of the area have been subject to bombing since 2012, the recent surge of attacks is the worst there in years.  Above ground, hellish scenes are playing out. Footage posted on Monday by the Syrian Civil Defense, a group of emergency medical workers, showed people running for cover after a series of strikes.Many see the basements as the only haven in a hostile environment. They had little chance to evacuate, as the area has been blockaded for months. For Shadi Jad, a young father who has been in a basement since the beginning of the week, his shelter is a mixed blessing.\u201cHonestly, I feel the shelter is a grave, but it\u2019s the only available way for protection,\u201d he said when reached on Tuesday.But Mr. Jad, who is hiding with his wife and eight other families, said that being in close quarters had also drawn his community together. \u201cWe share stories, try to keep the fear away by telling some jokes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shelter makes the relationships deeper \"Another group of local media activists shared photos of a family huddled underground on Wednesday, baking bread in a stove. Aid groups warn that conditions in the shelters could quickly deteriorate. They lack ventilation, electricity, running water and bathroom facilities. The Unified Medical Office in Ghouta \u2014 a local aid group that works in the area \u2014 said that those conditions could lead to health problems like \u201crespiratory diseases, lice and scabies.\u201dBut people have little choice. Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations\u2019 top human rights official, called for an end to the violence in a statement on Wednesday. Hoda Khayti, 29, has lived in eastern Ghouta her whole life, and said her family, like most of their neighbors, had spent much of the week in a basement. Twelve other families joined them in one cramped space. They could hear planes constantly passing overhead. \u201cMom comes back from the shelter with lot of stories, like this woman got married, that had a baby,\u201d she said. But Ms. Khayti is sometimes hesitant to head down to the basement, because she is scared of being trapped. Often, she stays above ground in the family home while her parents and sister head to the shelter.\u201cI don\u2019t want to die in the basement,\u201d Ms. Khayti said. \u201cI saw a whole family die in the basement.

Worse, the new policy required them to spend more than $6,000 per person before it covered much of anything.\u201cIt seems to me that people who earn nothing and contribute nothing get everything for free,\u201d said Ms. Hurd, 30. \u201cAnd the people who work hard and struggle for every penny barely end up surviving.\u201dA few miles away in another wooded suburb, Emilia DiCola, 28, an aspiring opera singer who scrapes by with gigs at churches and in local theaters, has no such complaints. She qualifies for Medicaid \u2014 free government health insurance that millions more low-income Americans have gained through an expansion of the program under the Affordable Care Act.\u201cI am very lucky to have the coverage I have,\u201d said Ms. DiCola, who lives with her parents along the Merrimack River in Litchfield.Such attitudes have helped shift white working-class voters to the right and were integral in the election of President Trump. They underlie the sharp cuts to social welfare programs in the budget proposal he released this week. They help explain why the national debate over health insurance has been so bitter, and why the only government programs with broad support are those that everyone benefits from, Social Security and Medicare.They are also likely helping fuel the renewed Democratic push for a single-payer system, or at least one that provides broader access to government health insurance.\u201cDemocrats have begun to recognize the political costs of playing into the narrative that they only care about the poor,\u201d said Joan C. Williams, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law and author of a recent book, \u201cWhite Working Class: Overcoming Class Cluelessness in America.\u201dSuch proposals reflect a \u201cvery American\u201d view \u2014 that only those who are severely disabled or struck by tragedy deserve government assistance, and that anyone else who gets it is shirking, said Mark Rank, a professor of social work at Washington University in St. Louis.\u201cOur social safety net is, in general, the weakest of any of the Western industrialized countries because we have these kinds of views,\u201d Mr. Rank said.Ms. Hurd remembers watching a documentary about people signing up for Obamacare coverage last year and bristling when someone who got a big subsidy gushed about the low price.\u201cI was like, \u2018It\u2019s not expensive for you because everybody else is paying for it,\u2019\u201d she said.She also has problems with the Medicaid \u201cexpansion population,\u201d made up of working-age adults who have no disability \u2014 particularly those who aren\u2019t working as hard as she and her husband are. Cut off from the help Obamacare provided to everyone under a certain income level, as well as the contributions that employers make toward their employees\u2019 health coverage, she was caught in what she saw as an unduly penalized subset.\u201cI\u2019m totally happy to pay my fair share,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m also paying someone else\u2019s share, and that\u2019s what makes me insane.\u201dMs. Hurd finished college at the University of Massachusetts, with her parents paying for it, and has a master\u2019s degree in communications, which she got tuition-free while working in admissions at Southern New Hampshire University. She\u2019s been working about 30 hours a week at the outlet mall and a small remodeling firm while looking for a job with good benefits in communications or marketing.Her husband, Matt, started his contracting business a few years ago and is finishing his undergraduate degree with the help of a loan. They bought a 1750s farmhouse just before they married; Ms. Hurd returned to work when their son, Harry, was eight weeks old.Though roughly the same age, Ms. DiCola has followed a different course. She dropped out of the Manhattan School of Music in 2009 after her freshman year because she couldn\u2019t keep up with the tuition. Now, to supplement the scant income she gets from singing gigs, she drives for Uber and Lyft a few nights a week, sometimes more, in Boston. She earned about $15,000 last year, making sure she stayed under the threshold to qualify for Medicaid.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s no different from what corporations do all the time, taking advantage of tax breaks and that sort of thing,\u201d Ms. DiCola, a soprano who talks animatedly about Verdi and Puccini, said of being on Medicaid. \u201cFrankly, if they\u2019re allowed to do it, why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201dMedical care has been easy to access on Medicaid. She got physical therapy for an old injury, and when she needed to have an IUD surgically removed last year, she went to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, the state\u2019s most prestigious hospital. She paid for none of it. She spends most of her income on paying off her car, a used 2012 Prius with 160,000 miles on it, and her last outstanding student loan.\u201cThe coverage is actually really good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of finding my way, so the health insurance is so helpful.\u201dFor Ms. Hurd, health care has been something to avoid since she and her husband got the marketplace plan shortly after Harry\u2019s birth last year. (Before that, she had a job with benefits but quit because of her difficult pregnancy.) She went to an urgent care clinic for a throat culture last fall because unlike at her primary care practice, she could find out the cost, $150, upfront. And when Harry was up all night sobbing with a fever recently, she hesitated briefly before seeking medical help, again at urgent care.\u201cThat\u2019s ugly,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate that I, even for a moment, considered waiting it out to save money.\u201dInstead of giving its new Medicaid recipients traditional coverage through the program, New Hampshire uses Medicaid funds to buy them private plans through the Obamacare marketplace. The report, by an independent actuarial firm, found that average medical costs for the state\u2019s expansion population were 26 percent higher than for the marketplace\u2019s other customers in 2016.The firm found this raised average claim costs \u2014 a proxy for premiums \u2014 for everyone by 14 percent.One of the conditions that Gov. Chris Sununu has attached to continuing expanded Medicaid here is that most adult recipients without a disability or small children will have to work, volunteer or get job training, at least 20 hours a week. New Hampshire is among eight Republican-controlled states asking the Trump administration for approval to impose work requirements; two others, Kentucky and Indiana, already got permission last month.Ms. Hurd \u2014 who says she thinks \u201cwork is everything, honestly\u201d \u2014 is elated about the possibility.\u201cIf there were actual repercussions aside from your personal self-worth \u2014 like \u2018Hey, you may not be able to get the pills you need\u2019 \u2014 people might be more inclined to work,\u201d she said.\u201cI know I live with my parents, but I\u2019m not going on fancy trips or anything like that \u2014 I feel guilty when I buy a new lipstick,\u201d she said. She worried when she had the flu in December and lost four days of income, she said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d like not to feel like I\u2019m constantly so close to the edge.\u201dMs. DiCola started driving for Uber and Lyft three years ago, after stints at a Panera and a train station cafe. She often shuttles customers around Boston until after midnight, making up to $25 an hour \u2014 enough to pay two or three times more than the $87.50 she owes on her student loan each month, plus buy gas. Her days include pitching in on cooking and other household duties, auditions, rehearsals and studying musical scores on her couch, a cat or two by her side. She hopes to get a college degree, find a more stable career and get access to employer health coverage. But for now, with a free place to live and with Medicaid, she said, \u201cI\u2019m able to throw all my money at paying off my debt.\u201dMs. Hurd is a former Republican who volunteered for Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in 2012 and voted for Carly Fiorina in the 2016 primary, but now describes her politics as more libertarian. She\u2019s pro-immigration, not least because she sees immigrants as having strong work ethics. She voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election, she said, because she finds President Trump deeply offensive, a \u201cguy who bullied his way into power.\u201dHer father, a Trump voter from the Boston suburbs, sends her articles that are critical of the health law, and they resonate with her.Even members of her own family take advantage of a flawed system, in her view, by getting Medicaid. \u201cThey don\u2019t work because they don\u2019t want to, and they get free health insurance.\u201d She said. \u201cWhat the heck? If my husband and I, who grew up with relatively middle-class backgrounds in wealthy states, know people that mooch off the system in our immediate families, imagine what it\u2019s like elsewhere.\u201dMs. DiCola\u2019s father, a solo-practice lawyer, is also a Trump supporter, but she is a liberal Democrat and uneasily aware of the anger and frustration that unsubsidized Obamacare customers are feeling \u2014 so much so that at first, she worried about sharing her story with The New York Times and \u201cbeing dragged through the mud on some 24-hour news channel\u201d for being on Medicaid.She described her state\u2019s plan to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients as \u201cpoor-shaming.\u201d Her friends show more empathy, she said. When she needed a root canal and crown last year and Medicaid would not have paid for it (dental care is one area that Medicaid does not cover comprehensively, or sometimes at all), she posted about it on Facebook and her friends jumped in to help.Ms. Hurd has had no such peace of mind. A burst appendix would likely cost at least her individual deductible of $6,300.By late January, Ms. Hurd had begun to believe that the only way for her family to have any access to health care was to drop their insurance and save the $928 a month to spend on care when they need it. Harry\u2019s recent illness had rattled her, and Matt wanted to see a chiropractor for back pain that was threatening his ability to work.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to both treat his back issues and pay for insurance,\u201d she said one morning. She was crying, and it was time to go to work.The following week, after months of searching, Ms. Hurd got offered a full-time job with benefits, running social-media marketing for a company that sells plant nutrition products. The Hurds plan on dropping their Obamacare policy in April, when her new coverage, with a $300 monthly premium, should kick in. The deductible \u2014 $3,000 per person, up to $6,000 for the family \u2014 will still be higher than she\u2019d like, but she didn\u2019t complain. Her indignation seemed to be softening.\u201cI understand that some people cannot afford health care and shouldn\u2019t just be left to suffer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there has to be a better way than asking a very small amount of people to foot that bill.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Just one problem: The protest took place four years ago.They just don\u2019t seem to care that much.Every generation of campus activists embraces a worthy foreign-policy cause: Ending apartheid in South Africa; stopping ethnic cleansing in the Balkans; rescuing Darfur from starvation and genocide. And then there\u2019s the perennial \u2014 and perennially unworthy \u2014 cause of \u201cfreeing\u201d Palestine, for which there never is a shortage of credulous campus zealots.The case of Venezuela ought to be an especially worthy one for college students. It is urgent. It is close by. Its victims are fighting for democracy, for human rights, for the ability to feed their children.So why the relative silence? Part of the reason is that campus activism is a left-wing phenomenon, making it awkward to target left-wing villains.Even today, the criticism is amazingly muted. If Klein has seriously come to terms with Maduro\u2019s tyranny or Venezuela\u2019s catastrophe, she has not done it in The Nation, The Guardian, or anywhere indexed by LexisNexis or Factiva. Corbyn\u2019s response to Maduro\u2019s repression has been to voice his condemnation of \u201cthe violence that\u2019s been done by any side, by all sides\u201d \u2014 a piece of obfuscatory equivalence worthy of Donald Trump\u2019s Charlottesville remark. Penn and Glover seem to have moved on to other causes, like bashing Trump. Such courage.Still, it says something about the moral dereliction of too many liberals that Pence has been a clarion voice of attention and outrage at the unfolding catastrophe, while they mostly remain silent. When you\u2019ve ceded the moral high ground to the Trump administration, you\u2019ve ceded a piece of your soul.It would be nice to suppose that Venezuela\u2019s agonies will soon be at an end, on the theory that it can\u2019t go on like this much longer. People said that about Syria several years ago, too. How many more Venezuelans have to starve or drown before Western liberals do something more than merely shake their heads?Advertisement"}

Mueller III \u2014 say he has emerged as Mr. Putin\u2019s go-to oligarch for that and a variety of sensitive and often-unsavory missions, like recruiting contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine and Syria.\u201cHe can fulfill any task for Putin, ranging from fighting the opposition to sending mercenaries to Syria,\u201d she said. \u201cHe serves certain interests in certain spheres, and Putin trusts him.\u201dThe most notorious venture linked to Mr. Prigozhin, however, is the troll farm that is accused of attacking opposition figures in Russia and seeking to magnify and aggravate social and political divisions in the West. Despite his frequent denials of any involvement, his critics say he and others like him provide a way for the Kremlin to engage in such activities while maintaining a discreet distance.The indictment on Friday says, among other charges, that Mr. Prigozhin frequently met in 2015 and 2016 with Mikhail I. Bystrov, the top official in the troll factory, which ran a disinformation campaign called Project Lakhta that by September 2016 had a monthly budget of $1.2 million.Boris L. Vishnevsky, an opposition member of the city council in St. Petersburg, who has called for an official investigation into threats by Mr. Prigozhin against journalists, said the Kremlin endorsed projects like the troll farm without directly organizing them.\u201cThis is done by somebody who receives large-scale government contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he gets these contracts is a hidden way to pay for his services.\u201dWhen the troll factory was formed in 2013, its basic task was to flood social media with articles and comments that painted Russia under Mr. Putin as stable and comfortable compared to the chaotic, morally corrupt West. The trolls soon branched into overseas operations focused on Russian adversaries like Ukraine and the United States.\u201cNeither Concord Company nor other structures owned by the businessman are in any way connected with the activities directed toward meddling in the U.S. election,\u201d RBC quoted one of Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s representatives as saying.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, also denied any Kremlin connection to the Internet Research Agency.Despite Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s veil of secrecy, limited details about his personal life have emerged, mostly through the Instagram accounts of his two grown children.One picture featured his son, Pavel, walking naked on the deck of the 115-foot family yacht. Other pictures showed a private jet and a vintage powder blue Lincoln Continental, said to be Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s favorite car.His daughter Polina posted a picture of the sweeping view from his wooded compound in Gelendzhik, the resort town on the Black Sea. The compound, including a pier for the yacht, was built in an ostensibly protected forest much beloved by Mr. Putin and his cronies, according to the Anti-Corruption Foundation.Delovoy Peterburg, an independent daily newspaper published in St. Petersburg, listed him last year as ranking 83rd among the city\u2019s 304 ruble billionaires, with 11 billion rubles, or almost $200 million. The newspaper included only property in the public record, said Irina Pankratova, an investigative reporter. If all property linked to him had been counted, she said, he would rank in the Top 5.An old rust bucket that he and his soon-to-be-jettisoned partners converted to the floating New Island Restaurant became St. Petersburg\u2019s most fashionable dining spot.Eventually, Mr. Putin himself showed up, towing world leaders. He hosted President Jacques Chirac of France and his wife in 2001 and President George W. Bush in 2002. President Putin celebrated his own birthday there in 2003.During these glittering occasions, Mr. Prigozhin made sure to hover nearby, sometimes even clearing empty plates.In just the past five years, Mr. Prigozhin has received government contracts worth $3.1 billion, the Anti-Corruption Foundation reported.Some Russian contract soldiers in Syria were back in the news this month after a Feb. 7 clash between Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, and Syrian government forces aided by Russian mercenaries. Reports about exactly what happened remain murky, but anywhere from five to 200 Russian soldiers have been reported killed. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday confirmed five deaths, but has refused to confirm that it has contract soldiers fighting in Syria, fueling anger among the families of those fighting about the lack of information.It has always been difficult to find his fingerprints directly on any of these shadowy firms, said Denis Korotkov, a reporter for Fontanka. The only clues are the companies\u2019 overlapping ties, including the same managers, shared telephone numbers or IP addresses.After studying this material, Fontanka and the Anti-Corruption Foundation concluded in 2016 that significant government contracts were going to clusters of fake companies designed to circumvent federal rules on competitive bidding.State regulators also reviewed eight Defense Ministry contracts won by businesses linked to Mr. Prigozhin and issued a stern rebuke in May 2017.Russian law mandates that any contract go to the lowest bidder, but the winning tenders were only a fraction lower than the rest. Otherwise the bids were virtually identical, the Anti-Monopoly Service said, calling the 2015 bids fixed.The government announced that it would not press charges. Nobody anticipates Mr. Prigozhin appearing in a Russian court any time soon.\u201cWe don\u2019t expect him to be punished given that he is among the president\u2019s closest friends,\u201d said Maksim L. Reznik, another St. Petersburg legislator demanding that he be investigated.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from St. Petersburg, Russia, and Oleg Matsnev from Moscow.Advertisement"}

Its profits were weighed down by an increase in traffic acquisition costs \u2014 the fees Google pays companies like Apple to ensure that its search engine is the default option when people open a browser on the iPhone.On Thursday, Alphabet attributed the increase in costs to a rising number of people doing searches on smartphones. Those queries require the company to pay more to reserve screen real estate compared to searches on desktop computers.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company expects those traffic acquisition costs will continue to climb. She framed the increased expense as a positive, a sign that Alphabet was establishing an important beachhead on smartphones.\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have a strong position in a rapidly growing market,\u201d said Ms. Porat. Shares of Alphabet initially fell as much as 5 percent in after-hours trading before settling in at about a 2 percent decline.Alphabet said Google\u2019s traffic acquisition costs in the quarter increased 33 percent from a year earlier, to $6.45 billion. Last year, Bernstein Research estimated that Google would pay about $3 billion to Apple in 2017 to remain the default search option on Apple\u2019s mobile devices.Excluding the tax charge, Alphabet said its earnings per share was $9.70, compared with Wall Street\u2019s expectations for $9.98. Revenue grew 24 percent to $32.32 billion.The results underscored the strength of Google\u2019s position in digital advertising, a market it dominates with Facebook. In the fourth quarter, users clicked on 48 percent more ads on Google sites \u2014 including search and YouTube \u2014 than a year earlier.In 2017, two-thirds of every ad dollar spent on the internet went through Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s advertising systems, according to research from Goldman Sachs.

Shore succeeds admirably, particularly because she tells the story through their words. Her sympathy for their courage and her support for a democratic Ukraine aligned with the West are evident, her depictions of the sights, sounds and smells on the Maidan superb. In lucid, if occasionally overwrought, prose she draws evocative portraits of people who braved the bitter cold \u2014 and truncheons and bullets \u2014 to create a \u201cparallel polis\u201d with barricades, soup kitchens, libraries, rock concerts, fiery speakers and solidarity among Ukrainians of disparate backgrounds.This is not a work of historical scholarship, nor is it comparable to the detailed eyewitness reportage of writers like Keith Gessen or Sophie Pinkham. Shore strides through centuries of Ukraine\u2019s past, but the result verges on potted history: It offers little to readers familiar with Ukraine and not nearly enough for novices seeking to understand the stark cultural and political variations within the country or the complex forces that produced the Maidan revolution. Shore wishes to give the movement a human face, but she devotes so much space to people\u2019s appearances, professions, families, ruminations and inner thoughts that her account resembles a collage of personalities.Shore does not dispute that Yanukovych was elected fairly in 2010 yet fails to explain how a crook and a thug (\u201choodlum\u201d is her apt description), who betrayed even the inhabitants of the Donbass, his political bastion, prevailed, or why he suddenly shelved the association agreement. Given her overwhelming focus on Kiev and parts west, she says little about those Ukrainians in Crimea and the Donbass who opposed the Maidan revolt. Generally, they are voiceless \u2014 spoken for by Shore herself, or by her pro-Maidan interlocutors (who tend to characterize them as troglodytes). The internal political differences produced by Ukraine\u2019s history are obscured, or dismissed as backward when they do not align with the ideals of the Maidan.\u201cThe Ukrainian Night\u201d vividly depicts life on the Maidan. It is less effective in uncovering Ukraine\u2019s complexities and the roots of a still-unfinished revolution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Complex Red Bean Stew From Georgia", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteMany Americans fall in love with the food of Georgia (the country, not the state) after sampling khachapuri, a savory cheese-stuffed bread often served with a runny egg on top. For others, it\u2019s a plateful of handmade khinkali, the country\u2019s meaty version of soup dumplings.For me, the obsession started with a humble bean stew called lobio.Back in New York, she couldn\u2019t stop talking about the tomatoes, potatoes and beans. Georgia has been famous for its fruits and vegetables, including plums, grapes and pomegranates, for centuries. Many of its crops are still farmed in traditional, not industrial, ways.The boiled potatoes, she told me, were heartbreakingly profound, with an earthy, clover blossom sweetness.The tomatoes have never had the bitterness bred out of them, she said, making them especially complex, with a snappy acidity in their ripeness.And the beans! Mottled red kidney beans boiled until velvety soft and mashed with pungent raw garlic, browned onions and a thrilling-sounding mountain herb called blue fenugreek.While I couldn\u2019t get my hands on spectacular Georgian tomatoes or those creamy Tushetian potatoes, I could make the beans, or at least try to simmer up something similar.Alice has a lobio recipe in her book, and the internet has plenty of variations, so I cobbled together a recipe that, while not necessarily authentic, somewhat represented the deeply comforting beauty of the dish.In Georgia, the word lobio can refer to any kind of bean, from fresh green beans to the many different varieties of dried beans, which are made into stews like this one or mashed into salads often topped with walnuts: a staple ingredient in Georgian kitchens.When stewed (usually in earthenware crocks), the beans are traditionally served with mchadi \u2014 flat cakes of fried, polentalike cornbread \u2014 and fresh white suluguni, a strong brined cheese rather like feta. However, thick slices of sourdough and a mild feta or ricotta salata also make great accompaniments.One thing to note is the (optional) use of two traditional Georgian ingredients in this recipe.The first is tkemali, a sharp and fruity sauce made from sour plums. Pomegranate molasses, or even a good balsamic vinegar, provides a similarly tangy kick.You can serve lobio as a meatless main dish, or as a side dish with roasted or grilled meats or fish. Either way, its mix of sharp raw onion and soft, sweet browned onion, along with plenty of fresh green herbs, makes it hard to stop eating once you start.And to Drink \u2026cookingAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s easy to imagine knocking back a beer or two with her and emerging chums for life.Listen carefully to her words, however, and you may notice an underlying aggression. At that interview, for instance, Ms. Mulligan speaks of her potential employer \u201csizing me up, like a psychopath weighing up which ear to cut off first.\u201dSo it\u2019s not a complete surprise when events take a shivery twist. (There are also hints in the director Lyndsey Turner\u2019s ultraslick production, and in the thanks proffered by Mr. Kelly in the published text to Euripides, among others.)For much of the time, Ms. Mulligan stands before us, like a chicly coifed if barefoot comedian eager to corral an expectant audience. Those scenes are interlaced with domestic encounters with two children, who remain unseen but nevertheless seem to demand every reserve of energy that this quick-witted, expletive-prone woman can muster.The vignettes draw upon Ms. Mulligan\u2019s unheralded gifts as a mime artist \u2014 suddenly, she must play an entire family \u2014 and come with a visual commentary: At various moments, the set from Es Devlin crackles into brightly vivid life, only to revert in an instant to the neutered, anesthetizing look that pervades throughout. (Ms. Devlin and Ms. Turner, the director, are frequent, and invaluable, collaborators.)So far so good, if so depressing, though hardly more so than the world at large. But not content to leave well enough alone, Mr. Kelly dresses up his narrative in ways that detract from its power, like some overzealous puppeteer.

{"Headline": "Rick Gates, Trump Campaign Aide, Pleads Guilty in Mueller Inquiry and Will Cooperate", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A former top adviser to Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel inquiry into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election after pleading guilty on Friday to financial fraud and lying to investigators.The adviser, Rick Gates, is a longtime political consultant who once served as Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy campaign chairman. The plea deal could be a significant development in the investigation \u2014 a sign that Mr. Gates plans to offer incriminating information against his longtime associate and the former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and possibly other members of the campaign in exchange for a lighter punishment. He faces up to nearly six years in prison.Mr. Gates changed his plea on Friday during an appearance in a Washington courtroom, his eyes cast down as the government outlined the charges against him. A man who had made millions of dollars lobbying in Ukraine accepted the fate that may await him: a prison sentence for carrying out a financial conspiracy to hide the money he earned there.He also admitted that he lied to investigators this month \u2014 while under indictment and negotiating with prosecutors \u2014 about the details of a 2013 meeting about Ukraine that Mr. Manafort had with a pro-Russian member of Congress.What the dramatic courtroom scene might mean for President Trump depends on what Mr. Gates has to offer the special counsel, though at the least, the plea agreement is further evidence that the Trump campaign attracted a cast of advisers who overstepped legal and ethical boundaries. The indictments so far have not indicated that either Mr. Gates or Mr. Manafort had information about the central question of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 whether Mr. Trump or his aides coordinated with the Russian government\u2019s efforts to disrupt the 2016 election.But Mr. Gates was present for the most significant periods of the campaign, as Mr. Trump began forging policy positions and his digital campaign operation engaged with millions of voters on social media platforms such as Facebook. Even after Mr. Manafort was fired by Mr. Trump in August 2016, Mr. Gates remained with the campaign at the request of Stephen K. Bannon, who took over as head of the campaign.From there, Mr. Gates assumed a different role \u2014 as a liaison between the campaign and the Republican National Committee \u2014 and traveled aboard the Trump plane through the end of August.In addition to offering visibility into the Trump campaign, Mr. Gates might be able to provide prosecutors with glimpses into decision-making in the months after Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory. Mr. Gates was a senior aide on the presidential inaugural committee, and in the months after the inauguration, he worked with America First Policies, the main outside group supporting the Trump presidency.Besides the agreement with Mr. Gates, the special counsel\u2019s team has already secured guilty pleas from two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. Michael T. Flynn, the president\u2019s first national security adviser, and George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy aide during the campaign, have both pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and agreed to cooperate with the inquiry.Mr. Gates\u2019s plea deal came together over the past few days, according to people familiar with the process. In a letter to friends and family, Mr. Gates said there had been false news stories about an impending plea deal over the past two weeks.But, he added, \u201cDespite my initial desire to vigorously defend myself, I have had a change of heart. The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and the circuslike atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much. I will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process.\u201d[Read our 2017 profile of Rick Gates \u00bb]Testimony from Mr. Gates could give Mr. Mueller\u2019s team a first-person account of the criminal conduct that is claimed in the indictments \u2014 a potential blow to Mr. Manafort\u2019s defense strategy. On Friday, Mr. Manafort pledged to continue the fight.\u201cNotwithstanding that Rick Gates pleaded today, I continue to maintain my innocence,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence. For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.\u201dAfter Mr. Gates\u2019s plea hearing, prosecutors filed a new indictment against Mr. Manafort. That indictment did not allege new charges against him, but was done for procedural purposes as prosecutors pursue separate cases in Washington and Northern Virginia.Mr. Gates falsely told investigators that Mr. Manafort had told him that the subject of Ukraine had not come up at the meeting, even though Mr. Gates had helped draft a report to Ukraine\u2019s leadership after the meeting about what had transpired, according to the court papers.Court records detail a byzantine scheme he and Mr. Manafort employed from about 2006 to 2015 in which they funneled millions of dollars they earned from their work as political consultants in Ukraine into shell companies and foreign bank accounts. The men worked in various capacities with Viktor F. Yanukovych, the onetime president of Ukraine and a longtime ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.They then hid the existence of the companies and accounts \u2014 set up in Cyprus, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Seychelles \u2014 from American tax authorities.\u201cGates helped maintain these accounts and arranged substantial transfers from the accounts to both Manafort and himself,\u201d prosecutors argued in the charges against Mr. Gates made public on Friday. Acting on Mr. Manafort\u2019s instructions, Mr. Gates classified the overseas payments as \u201cloans\u201d to avoid having to pay income taxes.Mr. Mueller\u2019s team found that more than $75 million passed through offshore accounts, and that Mr. Manafort laundered more than $18 million to furnish a lavish, largely tax-free lifestyle. Mr. Gates transferred more than $3 million from the offshore accounts, court documents show.Mr. Manafort purchased multimillion-dollar homes, expensive clothing, antiques and a Range Rover. Mr. Gates used the money to pay his mortgage and school tuitions, and for the interior decorating of his home in Virginia.The work the two men did for their firm, Davis Manafort, connected them to numerous people with ties to the Kremlin. One was Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and an ally of Mr. Putin\u2019s. Mr. Deripaska has been denied a visa to travel to the United States because of allegations that he is linked to organized crime operations, claims he has denied.Court records unsealed Friday revealed other lobbying schemes, including how Mr. Manafort used offshore accounts to wire more than 2 million euros to pay a group of former senior European politicians to take pro-Ukraine positions and lobby in the United States. In an \u201cEyes Only\u201d memo that Mr. Manafort wrote in 2012, the purpose of the \u201cSuper VIP\u201d effort was to assemble a group of \u201cpolitically credible friends who can act informally and without any visible relationship with the Government of Ukraine.\u201dAfter their Ukraine work was disclosed in news reports in August 2016, when Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates were working for the Trump campaign, they \u201cdeveloped a false and misleading cover story\u201d to distance themselves from Ukraine, according Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors.Then, they covered their tracks when reporting their income to the Internal Revenue Service. Two months after Mr. Manafort left the campaign, according to the court documents, his accountant emailed him a question about whether he had any foreign bank accounts.\u201cNone,\u201d he replied.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Rick Gates\u2019s employment after the election. He worked for the presidential inaugural committee, not the transition team. The article also misstated how long Mr. Gates traveled on the Trump campaign plane. He traveled with the candidate through the end of August, not Election Day.Mark Mazzetti reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

If I\u2019d thought about them at all, I would have reflected that everything has a story, but I didn\u2019t. Back in the 1980s, when I came to New York, they were simply a thing you had to order with Chinese takeout because somebody always wanted them, even though they usually tasted like leftover spaghetti with Skippy.Before this, though, cold sesame noodles in New York were the specialty of one particular Sichuan-born chef, Yu Fa Tang. Called Shorty by everybody, Tang came here in the early \u201960s after working for more than a decade in Taiwan. By 1967 he had his own restaurant on East Broadway, Hwa Yuan Szechuan Inn, where among other renditions of Sichuanese food he made cold sesame noodles that would lodge themselves in the memories of generations of New Yorkers and be imitated, lamentably, by takeout cooks all over town. At its peak it reportedly went through 500 pounds of noodles a day.Hwa Yuan is an imposing restaurant, built by Shorty\u2019s son Chien Lieh Tang and his grandson James Tang to plant the family name solidly in this century. To the left of the entrance is a lounge where translucent backlit panels cast everything in a streaked-marmalade glow. Straight ahead is the first dining room, and there are more up the stairs to the right.The tables sit under white cloths, and the places are set with white china traced with gold. To the right of the plates are two pairs of chopsticks on a white-china rest, one for serving and the other for eating.Needless to say, the cold sesame noodles are mandatory, at least on a first visit. They are, for one thing, truly cold. Not left-out-on-the-counter cold, but trickling-mountain-spring cold. The temperature accentuates their smooth surface and, like the slivers of cucumber, makes the small zap of chile oil call out more clearly. The first time I ate them the sauce needed a little more salt and vinegar, but the next time it had a finely balanced tension. If you know only the sugary peanut-butter imitation, tasting Hwa Yuan\u2019s original must be like hearing Van Morrison for the first time when you\u2019ve grown up on Ed Sheeran.Chien Lieh Tang is the chef at the resurrected Hwa Yuan, and although his cooking is not hard to appreciate, a little orientation may help. First, a warning: Those who believe that the only good Sichuan food makes you weep, sniffle, moan, call 911 or crawl under the table will need to adjust their standards. Hwa Yuan serves many family recipes that reflect an earlier stage of Sichuan cooking and Shorty Tang\u2019s time in Taiwan. While chiles are often present, they rarely dominate. Nor does the kitchen try to lard extra umami into every dish. The best food at Hwa Yuan tries to impress through charm, not arm-twisting.Family pride being the point here, dishes that carry the names Tang or Hwa Yuan tend to be excellent. Not, I\u2019m afraid, the Hwa Yuan dry-aged shell steak, which got impressive flavor from basting with marrow but was knotted with tough membranes when I tried it.But Tang\u2019s Amazing Spicy Wine Chicken was a treat, very tender hunks of dark meat in a delicate sauce of Shaoxing rice wine, bean paste and chile oil. Tang\u2019s Amazing Tofu was a minor discovery, seared squares of pressed tofu with fresh green chiles in a sauce that\u2019s more interesting than you\u2019d guess from its pale tan color. Hot Tang Tang noodles may sound like cold sesame noodles run through the microwave; they are something completely different, short strands of noodle in a steaming cup of sour-and-spicy broth that has a businesslike edge of roasted dried chiles.And Whole Fish with Hot Bean Sauce, Tang Family Creation is a bona fide star, the dish I know I\u2019ll order again even if I\u2019m not in the mood for cold noodles. It had a devoted following at the original restaurant, where it was made with carp. Now it is barramundi, precisely cooked and resting in a rusty mash of chile oil, fermented soybeans and chopped scallions. It\u2019s a forceful dish that\u2019s still noteworthy for its balance.As for the Hwa Yuan crab cake, I have no idea whether it lives up to the name. The kitchen was always out of it, along with such other intrigues as duck liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 and foie gras with fruit.The other major warning: My Peking duck did not deserve the fanfare it gets on the menu, where it is called Beijing duck. I phoned ahead to reserve a duck and a half for a large group, was told on arrival that the half duck wasn\u2019t available, settled for the whole duck, and found that it wasn\u2019t worth ordering in advance, or the $65 it cost. The carving was imprecise enough to make me glad it was only a roast duck under the knife and not a heart-surgery patient, and while the meat was juicy, pink and flavorful, the skin was flabby and as crisp as boiled spinach.Less heralded menu entries warrant a look, though. There is no reason to believe that soup dumplings, which arrived in New York by way of Shanghai long after Shorty Tang\u2019s heyday, will be any good at Hwa Yuan. They are. So are the thick and juicy pan-fried dumplings.I can never resist snow-pea shoots, and have never come across any as delicious as Hwa Yuan\u2019s. The dry-saut\u00e9ed string beans are about average, but stir-fried brussels sprouts with bacon is a rewarding variation on Sichuanese cabbage with pork.Sichuan cooks seem to have a special understanding of potatoes, which may explain why the little marble-size ones here, cooked kung pao style with peanuts and dried chiles, are so unusually good.I hope to fake my way into reproducing the dish at home, which would make me the latest in a long line of Hwa Yuan imitators.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResycookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poor People Deserve Better Than Food in a Box", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe president\u2019s proposed budget that was unveiled this week includes a radical change to the way the food-stamps program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, works. Now, recipients of SNAP benefits choose produce, meat, fish and other groceries for themselves. Under his proposal many SNAP recipients would have half their monthly benefits replaced by packages of food selected by the government.As someone who grew up needing food stamps and free school lunches, I cannot understand the logic or lack of empathy behind this plan.I spent my entire childhood in poverty, reliant on public assistance from the day I was born until my high school graduation and with a few brief sporadic returns after that. Some of my most vivid childhood memories involve accompanying my mother to the store, where she exchanged food stamps for the groceries our family needed. In those days, food stamps came in paper form, so she had to perform a ritual at the checkout counter, tearing each voucher from its booklet.These days, electronic cards called E.B.T.s, which can be used like credit cards at checkout, eliminate the awkward process of fumbling with booklets. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less painful to be so poor that you need help paying for food. Being poor means getting shamed and criticized for each minor decision you make, both by politicians and your neighbors standing in line behind you at the grocery store.Federal guidelines already dictate what can and cannot be purchased with food stamps, yet poor people are subjected to endless commentary and condemnation from cable news pundits to Facebook friends over their grocery selections. Are they picking items with enough nutrition? Are they choosing products that are more expensive, or more enjoyable, than they deserve?Americans of all income levels occasionally make food choices that aren\u2019t the healthiest or most economical, but it\u2019s the poor \u2014 who often have few other ways to indulge themselves and their children \u2014 who are judged most harshly when they do so.As a result, poor people are constantly required to explain their circumstances, and justify their every choice. This is especially true for parents who must rely on social programs to feed their children. The proposed Harvest Box further reinforces the notion that low-income parents can\u2019t be trusted to determine what\u2019s best for their own children. The implication is that wiser authority figures should dictate what these families should and can eat.It\u2019s hard to imagine that many of the people who create or oversee these programs have any actual experience with poverty. This lack of insight into the real lives of poor people leads those in charge to come up with ideas that are ridiculously impractical, unrealistic and even laughable.They\u2019re as out of touch as celebrities who\u2019ve tried to do the \u201cfood stamp challenge\u201d \u2014 surviving for a week or a month on the food they can buy with an amount equal to the benefits poor people receive \u2014 and end up blowing their entire budget on limes and black licorice. I\u2019m curious how what should go into these prearranged packages would be determined. I also want to know what accommodations will be made for those with food allergies or dietary restrictions.Until recently, my mother was eligible for a similar monthly food package as part of a program for the elderly. Transportation issues made it difficult for her to even pick up these boxes, but when she did get them, she ended up giving away at least half the items because they were foods doctors told her not to eat or that she simply didn\u2019t like.Assessing the SNAP system to identify ways to improve efficiency and reduce fraud is a good thing. But making a major change that deprives low-income people of much of the already limited control they have over one of the most basic elements of their daily existence is not only cruel, it is a recipe for huge waste.Bobbi Dempsey is a writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Trolls Were Sloppy, but Indictment Still \u2018Points at the Kremlin\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Trolling political opponents has become so routine in Russia, such a part of the everyday landscape, that operations are typically performed without much effort to cover any tracks.So when Russian trolling techniques were exported to the United States as part of the effort to influence the 2016 presidential election, it seems to have been done with the same lack of discipline that characterizes the practice in Russia.Just because the operation was thinly veiled, however, does not mean that the Russian trolling \u2014 creating provocative online posts about immigration, religion and race to try to sway voters \u2014 lacked high-level support.\u201cBecause it targets someone pretty close to the Kremlin, it really points at the Kremlin,\u201d said Konstantin von Eggert, a veteran journalist and political analyst, referring to the indictment. \u201cSuch things are very tightly controlled in Russia. You cannot launch your own private war against the United States.\u201dOthers noted, however, that degrees of control vary. There is a saying in Russian that the Kremlin has many towers, meaning that various bureaucratic cabals and government agencies hold differing and sometimes competing interests.The Kremlin; the F.S.B., the main security service; and the S.V.R., or the foreign intelligence service, all have interests overseas, which complicates singling out the troll farm\u2019s ultimate godfather.Also, this kind of operation is designed for deniability, with the overall mandate endorsed by the government but probably not the day-to-day operations.\u201cPeople do not go ask permission from Putin: \u2018Vladimir Vladimirovich, can we go hack the servers of the Democratic Party?\u2019 It\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Anton Merkurov, an internet analyst. \u201cPutin never really uses the internet, so he doesn\u2019t understand how it works.\u201dThose named in the indictment have proved difficult for reporters to reach, with their cellphones often shut off and no response to messages left for them on social media.The overall aim of the Russian government \u2014 be it through trolling, hacking or disinformation \u2014 was to spread confusion and unease about government institutions in the West and to shore up popular support at home. The actual techniques were unlikely to be laid out in a paper trail, Mr. Merkurov noted.The fact that the efforts of the troll farm described in the indictment \u2014 the fake campaign protests in Florida or New York; the myriad accounts mimicking Americans set up on Twitter and Facebook; the trips to the United States to organize it all \u2014 were so easy to trace back to the Internet Research Agency that it probably underscores that the intelligence services were not involved in running the organization.The government and its proxies had been using bots and trolls for so long against its internal critics that it probably did not consider that shifting the operations overseas demanded a significantly different approach, said Vladimir Frolov, a foreign affairs analyst.\u201cIt was very ad hoc, very amateurish,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not consider this to be a sensitive operation. They used easily traceable methods.\u201dThose operations involved highly sophisticated penetration of cybernetworks, the analysts noted, whereas the troll farm work is akin to graffiti \u2014 writing nasty messages on Twitter and Facebook.If there was any substantial Russian influence in the election, it was far more likely from the information hacked from the Democratic Party headquarters that was leaked to the press, Mr. Frolov said.In Russia, all kinds of dirt about opposition figures turns up online, or even on state television channels, ranging from documentaries that set out to prove these politicians are fifth columnists on the payroll of the State Department to videos from hidden hotel room cameras that show them engaging in extramarital sex.So for many Russians, the main surprise after the United States indicted the most notorious troll farm was that the work might be considered criminal.Lyudmila Savchuk, an internet activist who went undercover as an employee at the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, said that there should be thousands of names in the indictment, not just 13 top managers.\u201cWe are in a situation now where these people are not even criticized by society, much less punished legally,\u201d Ms. Savchuk said in a telephone interview. No troll or propagandist ever bears any responsibility for what they write in Russia, she said.The Internet Research Agency was initially formed in 2013 to attack members of the political opposition, like Aleksei A. Navalny, Mr. Putin\u2019s most outspoken critic. The basic task of the trolls was to flood social media with articles and comments that painted Russia under Mr. Putin as a stable, comfortable country in contrast to the chaos and moral corruption of the West, according to two former trolls who worked there. From domestic matters it moved on to attacking Ukraine and eventually the West.In Russia, one discussion about the ramifications of the indictment was the extent to which it might actually help the Kremlin. The charges laid out in the indictment roughly correspond with Mr. Putin\u2019s position that perhaps rogue patriots are responsible not only for the trolling, but also for the email hacking and other cyberattacks connected to the U.S. election.The fact that there were no senior government officials named probably helps Russia, said Mr. Frolov, because that echoed statements from Mr. Putin last summer that any election meddling was the work of eager Russian civilians rather than government agents.\u201cThe first impulse is to dismiss it as inconsequential, something that makes clear that there is no evidence of Russian state involvement in what Mueller describes as an interference operation,\u201d Mr. Frolov said, referring to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who brought the indictment. \u201cAssuming it ends up only with those pranksters, that gives Moscow room to maneuver, the ability to distance themselves from this.\u201dOn Saturday, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, dismissed the indictment as \u201cjust blabber.\u201d\u201cI have no response. We see these statements and indictments multiplying,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said at an international security conference in Munich, Germany.The official reaction basically mocked the idea that 13 people could somehow muster a negative impact on American democracy. \u201cMueller\u2019s list: Russian superagents are capable of anything\u201d read one sarcastic headline on a television website.Follow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquharOleg Matsnev and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Moscow, Ivan Nechepurenko from St Petersburg and Steven Erlanger from Munich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook and Google Struggle to Squelch \u2018Crisis Actor\u2019 Posts", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe companies have since aggressively pulled down many posts and videos and reduced the visibility of others. Yet on Friday, spot searches of the sites revealed that the noxious content was far from eradicated.On Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, searches for the hashtag #crisisactor, which accused the Parkland survivors of being actors, turned up hundreds of posts perpetuating the falsehood (though some also criticized the conspiracy theory). Many of the posts had been tweaked ever so slightly \u2014 for example, videos had been renamed #propaganda rather than #hoax \u2014 to evade automated detection. And on YouTube, while many of the conspiracy videos claiming that the students were actors had been taken down, other videos that claimed the shooting had been a hoax remained rife.Facebook faced renewed criticism on Friday after it was revealed that the company showcased a virtual reality shooting game at the Conservative Political Action Conference this week. Facebook said it was removing the game from its demonstration of its new virtual reality products.The resilience of misinformation, despite efforts by the tech behemoths to eliminate it, has become a real-time case study of how the companies are constantly a step behind in stamping out the content. At every turn, trolls, conspiracy theorists and others have proved to be more adept at taking advantage of exactly what the sites were created to do \u2014 encourage people to post almost anything they want \u2014 than the companies are at catching them.\u201cThey\u2019re not able to police their platforms when the type of content that they\u2019re promising to prohibit changes on a too-frequent basis,\u201d Jonathon Morgan, founder of New Knowledge, a company that tracks disinformation online, said of Facebook and YouTube.Mary deBree, head of content policy at Facebook, said the company had not been perfect at staving off certain content and most likely would not be in the future.\u201cFalse information is like any other challenge where humans are involved: It evolves, much like a rumor or urban legend would. It also masks itself as legitimate speech,\u201d she said. \u201cOur job is to do better at keeping this bad content off Facebook without undermining the reason people come here \u2014 to see things happening in the world around them and have a conversation about them.\u201dA YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement that the site updated its harassment policy last year \u201cto include hoax videos that target the victims of these tragedies. Any video flagged to us that violates this policy is reviewed and then removed.\u201dSam Woolley, an internet researcher at the nonprofit Institute for the Future, said far-right groups had started using internet brands to describe minorities \u2014 like \u201cSkype\u201d to indicate Jewish people \u2014 to trick software and human reviewers.Those who post conspiracy theories also tend to quickly repost or engage with similar posts from other accounts, creating a sort of viral effect that can cause the sites\u2019 algorithms to promote the content as a trending topic or a recommended video, said David Carroll, a professor at the New School who studies tech platforms.That duplication and repackaging of misinformation \u201cmake the game of snuffing it out Whac-a-Mole to the extreme,\u201d he said.That game played out across the web in the past few days, after a video suggesting that one of the most vocal Parkland survivors, David Hogg, was an actor became the No. 1 trending video on YouTube. After a public outcry, YouTube removed the video and said it would take down other \u201ccrisis actor\u201d videos because they violated its ban on bullying. YouTube has since scrubbed its site of many such videos.Yet some of the videos remained, possibly because they used slightly different terminology. One clip that had drawn more than 77,000 views by Friday described the shooting survivors as \u201cdisaster performers\u201d instead of \u201ccrisis actors.\u201dOther videos that were not about the Parkland survivors but that called the entire shooting into question also stayed online. A video posted last week by Alex Jones, the founder of the conspiracy theory site Infowars, titled \u201cRed Alert! Evidence Mounts Florida Attacks Is a Giant False Flag\u201d had attracted more than 300,000 views by Friday.On Facebook, some of the posts the social network had vowed to ban were still gaining traction. One lengthy post had been shared more than 3,800 times by early Friday. The post included a photo of Mr. Hogg and his classmate Emma Gonzalez with the text \u201cGlobalist Deep State Crisis Actors.\u201dAfter The New York Times contacted the author of the post, a self-described political analyst named John Miranda, the post disappeared. It is unclear if Facebook removed it. Mr. Miranda did not respond to a request for comment.The tech companies\u2019 increasing efforts to remove misinformation have a side effect: angering some of their most active users.Moe Othman, a comedian and commentator on YouTube who has about 60,000 subscribers, said that within 10 minutes of posting a video on Wednesday that suggested some Parkland students were actors, YouTube removed it and placed a strike on his account. YouTube terminates accounts after three strikes.Mr. Othman said in a private message on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. We live in a world where information is one of the most important tools.\u201d He added, \u201cIn this case, I see YouTube as a censoring machine.\u201dWould he stop using YouTube?

{"Headline": "House Passes Online Sex-Trafficking Bill After Big Tech Companies Back Off", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe House on Tuesday passed a bill that gives victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking, adding a new level of accountability for internet companies.Silicon Valley had strongly opposed the bill, because it would chip away at an existing law that gives internet companies broad immunity for the content that people put on their services. Tech companies that argued against the bill said that the current law has encouraged free speech online and helped the internet thrive.But sex trafficking victims and law enforcement officials say the existing law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has been too loosely applied by sites like Backpage.com, a site known for prostitution and sex trafficking. Some large online companies, including Facebook, eventually backed off from their opposition to the bill after its scope was narrowed.\u201cCongress never intended for the internet to be a haven for criminal activity,\u201d said Representative Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican who introduced the bill, known as the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. \u201cThis is not a slippery slope. It is a narrow amendment to stop crimes by businesses online that they weren\u2019t able to commit offline.\u201dA similar bill in the Senate was expected to pass soon.The new legislation would not affect most internet companies. A victim would need to prove a site had knowingly facilitated sex trafficking to successfully sue the company. But not all online companies could hide behind the Section 230 shield.The bill\u2019s passage in the House signaled an important turning point for an industry that has largely operated free of regulations. Pressure has been mounting for social media companies and other internet giants to be better stewards of their powerful platforms.Facebook, in particular, has come under pressure over the spread of misinformation and the exertion of foreign interference during the 2016 presidential election. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called for regulations, including disclosures on political advertising, but those efforts have been slow to gain wide support.\u201cClearly the environment has changed a lot for big internet companies over the past year,\u201d said Paul Gallant, a tech and telecom industry analyst at Cowen & Co. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t think there is a willingness for the government to pursue fundamental business model changes.\u201d\u201cWe all have a responsibility to do our part to fight this,\u201d Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote in a post on the site this week. \u201cWe at Facebook support efforts to pass amended legislation in the House that would allow responsible companies to continue fighting sex trafficking while giving victims the chance to seek justice against companies that knowingly facilitate such abhorrent acts.\u201dSome large tech companies, including Oracle, IBM and HP, have supported the new legislative effort all along. But many start-ups, including those represented by Engine Advocacy, a trade group, remained opposed to the bills.Engine Advocacy said part of the bill would hurt start-ups that lean heavily on user-generated content, and could lead Congress to take more actions to weaken the openness of the internet.Advertisement"}

And it must be soothing to know that as you travel the world you will find an Atelier waiting for you to climb up on a comfortable red leather stool, watch the cooks dressed in what look like black pajamas, admire the slightly supernatural colors of the vegetables and fruits submerged in water inside glass vases, recline into a menu filled with Robuchon classics and small variations on the same key ingredients (eggplant, quail, squab, lobster), all at prices that most people can\u2019t afford, but you can.Lulling familiarity was not Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s aim when he built the first Atelier almost 15 years ago. Having won just about every honor the French gastronomic world offers at his first restaurant, he had officially retired, and when he came back it was only to knock the whole system on its side. His idea was a restaurant where the food, made to his excruciatingly precise standards, would be served not at tables but at a U-shaped counter. The format may have been borrowed from Japan or Spain, but in France the effect was radical, as were the late-night closing hours and no-reservations policy.The proof of L\u2019Atelier\u2019s success is how un-shocking this sounds today.I also remember a stunned awareness that I\u2019d do it again. I had had no idea anything could taste as good as the simple combination of a langoustine and a basil leaf inside a see-through wrapper of fried brik pastry, or the far more complex glass of sea urchin suspended in lobster jelly under a quarter-inch of cauliflower cream that was like an insanely luxurious Jell-O salad.Nothing on the menu at the new Atelier spun my senses around like those two dishes, not even the langoustine, which is on the menu there, too, but seems to have lost the juicy sweetness I remembered.Out of three dinners, my first was the most patchy. A $44 pair of mini-burgers topped with foie gras were more like an expensive caterer\u2019s trick than a Robuchon brain wave. A vaguely spiced mush of eggplant under a runny boiled egg, for $32, was so unappealing I couldn\u2019t finish it.Things got better from there, and sometimes much better, though rarely much cheaper. Those two dishes were what the menu calls \u201csmall tasting portions,\u201d and as you\u2019d imagine, the appetizers and main courses come with higher prices. Three tasting menus, from $145 to $325, are not particular bargains. (Taking some of the edge off, service is included.)Mr. Bellanca and his crew are at their best with careful refinements of classic French cooking. Slabs of roasted duck breast with cracked pepper and kumquat preserves, which I had in a main-course portion for $64, did everything you\u2019d want canard \u00e0 l\u2019orange to do, and did it with style and confidence. There was a handsomely improved $42 blanquette of veal cheeks with tender-crisp vegetables and a little disc of buttered rice pilaf.The beef tartare is chopped to little pieces but not beyond, smoothed with egg yolk, dressed with enough mustard to make it stand out in a crowd, and served with the fries that McDonald\u2019s sells only in my dreams. It comes close to being a model of the form in every way except the price, $52.The $34 beet salad was full of adventure, starting with a throat-catching scoop of green-mustard sorbet and continuing with some of those famous Robuchon dots, each of which turned out to be a perfectly delicious sauce made from, say, green apples or avocado. But not many other dishes seemed interested in startling anyone.The service strikes a rare balance of charm and formality that was missing from the uptown location. There will be smiles when you get there, and smiles later when you whisk your kugelhopf off to wherever it is you go with your kugelhopfs.Whether this is a restaurant for you is first of all a question of money; there is no way to eat a satisfying meal at L\u2019Atelier without spending a lot of it. If the prices don\u2019t bother you, then neither should my nagging sense that the cooking is not as exciting as it could be. Nobody goes to chains, even expensive ones, for new sensations.An earlier version of this review misstated the top price for a tasting menu. It is $325, not $395.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Judge a Wine by the Grape on Its Label", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolThe word \u201cvarietal\u201d is among the most misused in wine.Many people think of it as a synonym for \u201cgrape,\u201d as in, \u201cWhat varietals are in that wine?\u201d Not to be pedantic, but that is wrong. Varietal is not a noun, it is an adjective. One may properly refer to a \u201cvarietal wine,\u201d like a cabernet sauvignon or a chardonnay, in which the wine is made with a dominant grape variety.This distinction pertains directly to our most recent topic, California grenache, in which we had one varietal wine, made entirely out of grenache, and two blends, in which grenache was one of several varieties in the wine.Before 1978, when that rule was enacted, a California wine could be called grenache or pinot noir if it contained just 50 percent of that grape. That offered too much wiggle room for winemakers to add inferior varieties.Then, the federal government increased the required proportion to 75 percent, with states having an option to raise it even further. In Oregon, the rule is 90 percent, with the exception of cabernet sauvignon, which, because it is historically blended with other grapes, remained at 75 percent.The Old World, for the most part, did not label its wines varietally, though certainly exceptions are easy to find \u2014 Alsace is an example. In France, it is understood that Chablis will taste different than Vouvray does, and those qualities were associated with the places. So no need to label the Chablis as chardonnay and the Vouvray as chenin blanc.But midcentury California lacked the same longstanding geographical traditions that dictated a wine\u2019s character. Often, California winemakers appropriated European geographical designations, calling their wines names like Chablis, Rhine wine, Chianti and Burgundy.From the 1970s onward, this has become the dominant identification for American wines. It\u2019s hard for many Americans nowadays to conceive of any other preferable method. Indeed, European producers who want to compete in the global marketplace, especially for inexpensive wines, have fought for the right to label their wines varietally.One, the Jolie-Laide, gives an indication of its blend on the label, with grenache and syrah written in big letters, and viognier and muscat d\u2019Alexandria in a subordinate font. But the Donkey & Goat does not list any grapes on its label, and information was not easy to obtain. This led to some confusion.Actually, the Gallivanter does contain quite a bit of grenache, though I understand why some curious readers thought otherwise. In previous years, the blend was completely different; in 2015, pinot noir and syrah were used. But Jared Brandt, an owner of Donkey & Goat, told me that the blend was changed in 2016. That year, it was made with a plurality of merlot and a sizable percentage of grenache, along with syrah, mourv\u00e8dre and a few others \u201cfor fining tuning,\u201d he said.Mr. Brandt did not want to detail exact percentages. \u201cSpecificity is something we are trying to get away from,\u201d he said. \u201cAs winemakers, we think that blends are often more complex and pleasing.\u201dBlending has a long and honorable tradition. In the old days, before winemakers had the science and technology to manipulate wines, having a palette of grapes with varying characteristics could do the trick.Blending grapes is a more natural, nuanced method of making up for deficiencies than, say, dumping in a bag of tartaric acid or powdered tannins. It\u2019s also why it can be more difficult to make a mono-varietal wine like Burgundy, where, except in very rare circumstances, the red grape must be pinot noir and the white chardonnay. In those cases, winemakers hope that the same grapes grown in different places, even in different rows of the same vineyard, will contain all the desired characteristics to make a complete wine.The 2016 Dashe, made entirely of grenache, was fascinating. It was balanced in its own right, packed with red fruit flavors, which were initially a bit jammy but tightened with exposure to air, becoming stonier.Yet fruitiness was the dominant character, and, as someone who does not generally gravitate to powerfully fruity wines, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether a blend might have diminished the berry-flavored wallop.The 2015 Jolie-Laide \u2014 with its blend of grenache and syrah, and tiny amounts of the aromatic white grapes viognier and muscat \u2014 seemed like a more complex mouthful, with the bright grenache fruit given depth by the dark, spicy syrah. It was earthy, lightly tannic and altogether intriguing.These three wines are obviously too small a sample for sweeping generalizations, but that will not stop me from offering a few thoughts. For one thing, I thought the three wines affirmed the traditional wisdom of using other grapes to harmonize with grenache. The 100-percent grenache Dashe was a fine, pure wine, but it seemed less complete than the other two. Would blending have given it more depth and a wider spectrum? Maybe.The tasting also underlined a deficiency in the labeling rules, which perhaps encourages winemakers to reach that 75 percent threshold so they can give the wine the easier-to-market varietal label. You could argue that California merlot suffered qualitatively as winemakers often used too high a percentage of the grape in their blends simply so they could call it merlot. Only in a very few places, like the Right Bank of Bordeaux, can complete wines be made with that much merlot.In California, it will not be easy to get away from the varietal label, as Mr. Brandt of Donkey & Goat knows. He is often asked which grapes are in a blend when they are not specified on the bottle.\u201cI like to say that it is whatever they want it to be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been an uphill battle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Redemption of Chris Hughes", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfileChris Hughes was raised by Lutheran parents in Hickory, N.C., and they taught him, by example, to tithe. Every year, they gave 10 percent of their income to the church and other local charities, and Mr. Hughes carried that tradition into adulthood. But in 2008, when he sold $1 million of his Facebook shares on private markets, and the amount of money he needed to give away increased exponentially, he started thinking more seriously about where his contributions might make the most impact.\u201cI grew up looking at the price almost down to the penny on everything from a bottle of juice to a can of soda,\u201d he told me in early February, explaining why he wanted to get \u201cthe most value\u201d out of philanthropy. We were sitting in the East Village office of the Economic Security Project, an organization Mr. Hughes co-founded with two other activists, Dorian Warren and Natalie Foster, to fund the work of technologists, academics, policymakers and others exploring the idea of a guaranteed basic income for low- and middle-income Americans.Mr. Hughes is one of the co-founders of Facebook, for which he did \u201cthree years\u2019 worth of work for nearly half a billion dollars,\u201d as he puts it, emphasizing the extreme nature of his success. He and Mark Zuckerberg were roommates at Harvard, and early on, Mr. Hughes ran the company\u2019s communications and marketing department. The social network\u2019s colossal success fast-tracked Mr. Hughes\u2019s career. In 2008, he joined Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign to launch and manage My.BarackObama.com, a robust system that organized Obama supporters and was viewed as instrumental to his victory. In 2012, when Facebook went public and The New Republic came up for sale, he bought it, hoping to herald the publication into a digital future and expand its reach. His tumultuous ownership ended in 2016, when he sold the magazine. Later that year, he joined with Mr. Warren and Ms. Foster to form the Economic Security Project.In his new book, \u201cFair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn,\u201d out this week, Mr. Hughes, 34, traces his ascent to show how the forces that influenced his and Facebook\u2019s success \u2014 technological advancements, globalization and the rise of private equity firms \u2014 have created a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d economy in which only a small group of people succeed.\u201cI think that when people enjoy success of many sorts it is oftentimes easy to forget all of the factors that contribute to making that possible,\u201d he said, citing his own upbringing. He grew up in a stable, middle-class family, the only child of a paper salesman and a schoolteacher. As a child, he took advantage of government-run after-school programs and was placed in \u201cgifted\u201d classes. At 14, he searched online for the \u201cbest high school in America,\u201d turning up Phillips Academy, a prestigious private school in Andover, Mass.; Mr. Hughes applied and talked his way into a scholarship. All these factors, he argues, factored into his success even before he landed in a dorm room with Mr. Zuckerberg.In \u201cFair Shot,\u201d he offers a solution to balance the scale: a guaranteed income of $500 a month for adults earning less than $50,000, including nontraditional workers like parents and students. His proposal is that such a program be paid for through a tax on the country\u2019s highest earners, those whose annual income is $250,000 or more. His plan would reach 60 million adults and lift 20 million out of poverty overnight, he writes, while providing those in the middle class with more financial stability.\u201cThe guaranteed income as an idea is so simple that oftentimes people just sort of skip over the power of cash itself,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cWe think, Oh my God, income inequality \u2014 it\u2019s so incredible, all the stats are so insane, but what can we do about it? It\u2019s got to be education or it\u2019s got to be more job training. It\u2019s got to be a higher minimum wage. I say, \u2018Yes, yes and yes.\u2019\u201d But we need to do more, he insists.The Economic Security Project\u2019s office is part university library, part tech start-up, with dark leather and wood furniture alongside a white meeting pod near the entrance. It seems to reflect Mr. Hughes\u2019s sensibilities \u2014 his admiration for old, established institutions and his embrace of digital technology. When I arrive for our interview, Mr. Hughes greets me warmly, and we sit in what appears to be the office\u2019s only conference room, enclosed by a glass wall. His Southern accent is barely detectable, and in conversation, he is measured and cautious, laying out his argument with his hands, becoming riled only when I bring up the tax bill (\u201cthe most perplexing and infuriating move\u201d) and the fact that some might view their success as completely self-generated (\u201cthat\u2019s just flat wrong\u201d).Before he started the Economic Security Project, Mr. Hughes had been working on the issue of the guaranteed income internationally through GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that, as the name suggests, operates a cash transfer program that puts money into the hands of those who need it. Mr. Hughes was inspired by the organization\u2019s ideals, and he started to wonder whether a similar model could work domestically.\u201cThere was no real organization in the United States focused on exploring how a guaranteed income might work,\u201d he said.But rather than go in \u201cguns blazing,\u201d he explained, \u201cwe said: \u2018This is a promising idea. Let\u2019s bring together a network of people to think about this collaboratively and see where it goes.\u2019\u201d The Economic Security Project was originally conceived as a temporary, two-year initiative, but has since been extended to 2020.Mr. Hughes\u2019s cautiousness is a direct result of his experience at The New Republic. Despite his intention to \u201cmake it a publication that millions of people would adore and really value,\u201d the result was not so idyllic. He invested $25 million, moved the magazine to a slick new office and hired top talent from other publications. By late 2014, his investment was not paying off, and he brought in Guy Vidra, a former Yahoo executive, to be the C.E.O., hoping he might be able to make The New Republic a digital media company. Mr. Vidra and Mr. Hughes decided to replace Franklin Foer, the editor at the time, but the news reached Mr. Foer first, and he resigned, prompting mass resignations across the publication. What followed was a media maelstrom, and a little over a year later, unable to turn the publication\u2019s profits around, Mr. Hughes sold the magazine.\u201cChris was pretty anxious about where things were headed,\u201d Mr. Foer said on a recent call, adding: \u201cThere were lots of larger forces remaking journalism, and because of Chris\u2019s biography and because of some of the ham-fisted ways in which he handled things, he kind of fell into a morality play. It was pretty easy to cast the story as a parable about journalism, and I think that helps explain the heat of the coverage that fell on him.\u201dIn retrospect, Mr. Hughes said he regretted his approach at The New Republic. \u201cI went in with very big-picture kinds of goals and went too far too fast,\u201d he said, before I could ask. \u201cNow, I work on this big-picture, similarly idealistic kind of idea of a world where everyone has some basic financial security through cash, but I don\u2019t think we necessarily need to start off by giving $1,000 to everybody.\u201dThe plausibility of his idea is a matter of debate. Branko Milanovic, a leading scholar on income inequality, and Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, both believe the plan is unrealistic given the partisan divisions of the current political climate. Mr. Baker also noted that policy changes to restructure the economy, such as weaker patent and copyright laws and public funding for generic medication, were a more urgent need. The Stanford professor and economist Nicholas Bloom brought up the potential for fraud, adding that government enforcement would be difficult.Mr. Hughes is aware that his proposal is far-reaching. \u201cThis is a big idea and it\u2019s an expensive idea, but I do think that it is in line with the scale of the problem, which is also immense,\u201d he said.Mr. Hughes said his own windfall gave him the mental space to think about and pursue his goals, and now, he feels a responsibility to pay it forward. When I ask him where this impulse comes from, his face softens. \u201cFrom my parents.\u201d His father wanted him to be successful, he explained, but \u201cthere was also a sense that you don\u2019t do better at the expense of others.\u201dGiving people cash, in Mr. Hughes\u2019s view, is not only the most effective way to tackle inequality today, it is also the most humane: \u201cIt\u2019s truly a belief that people can be trusted and deserve the opportunity to design their lives, to chase their own dreams.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For both, it is the first time they have crossed into a correction since early 2016.The Dow plunged more than 1,000 points Thursday, its second decline of more than 1,000 points this week. The S. & P. 500 dropped 100 points, its third decline of more than 100 points in its history.On a percentage basis, the Dow fell 4.15 percent, the S. & P. 500 dropped 3.75 percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.9 percent.The bigger pictureAnxieties about inflation have driven the much of decline over the past week and a half. The yield on the benchmark Treasury note climbed above 2.85 percent \u2014 its highest level since 2014 \u2014 for the second time this week. Higher yields can crimp economic activity by raising borrowing costs, while also making riskier assets like stocks less appealing to bonds.Many market watchers say that investors should not worry about the recent spate of volatility in the stock market. Such swings, they say, are normal. They point to strong corporate earnings and a strengthening economy both in the United States and abroad as reasons to be optimistic about stocks.Investor sentiment has reversed in recent weeks as the sell-off in stocks gained momentum.According to the American Association of Individual Investors\u2019 weekly survey, bullish sentiment, or the percentage of respondents that say stocks will rise over the next six months, declined to 37 percent. The drop ended a streak of eight straight weeks with bullish sentiment above its historical average of 38.5 percent.It began the year at nearly 60 percent, its highest level since 2010.The contextThe survey has proved to be a good contrarian indicator. That means overly bullish sentiment often signals that the stock market is ripe for a pullback, while overly bearish sentiment often indicates that market may soon rally.The chip maker said its board had rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised $121 billion offer.The reasons\u2022 \u201cThe Broadcom proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm.\u201d\u2022 The offer \u201cfalls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction.\u201dQualcomm said that it was willing to meet with Broadcom to see if its issues with the offer could be addressed.The contextQualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.Till this week, many investors wondered whether Snap and Twitter had much of a future at a time when Google and Facebook are sucking up such a large share of digital advertising dollars. But after Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even as they remain in the shadow of Facebook and Google.\u2014 Peter EavisBlackRock itself raises a different comparison, according to Sarah Krouse of the WSJ \u2014 to Warren Buffett:The \u201cbest known\u201d example of BlackRock\u2019s approach with this new vehicle is Berkshire Hathaway, according to a fund-raising document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Omaha conglomerate run by Mr. Buffett is well known for its long-term ownership of companies.BlackRock\u2019s Long-Term Private Capital fund would be a tenth of Berkshire\u2019s $101 billion in cash. But it too would look to buy and hold positions for more than 10 years. Over all, though, this seems more akin to private equity.The practice has grown on Wall Street with the rise of activist investors, with investment banks touting their defense capabilities to corporate clients.Before becoming finance editor at the Journal, Mr. Berman oversaw the paper\u2019s business coverage and was its M.&A. reporter prior to that.Mr. Berman, who will join as a managing director and be based in New York, will start on Feb. 26.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedAndrew, with a bit of contextDennis follows in the footsteps of Steven Rattner, who worked as a reporter at the NYT in the 1980s before going to work as a banker at Lazard and becoming an influential financier. (Today, Mr. Rattner overseas Michael Bloomberg\u2019s fortune.)Dennis was my fiercest reporting competitor over the last decade and is one of the most talented financial journalists in recent memory.Mr. Wolin, who will remain based in Washington, will take over from the London-based Susan Gilchrist, who will become chairwoman of Brunswick\u2019s global clients operations and focus on client work full time.Alan Parker, Brunswick\u2019s founder, said in a telephone interview of the move, \u201cIt reflects the growth of the business and the business opportunity in America.\u201dThe contextIn some ways, the appointment of Mr. Wolin reflects that trend. Beyond his time at the Treasury Department, he previously worked as a senior executive at The Hartford, an insurer. And he was previously a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration.\u201cIncreasingly, I think senior executives and boards of directors have come to understand that a lot of their challenges and opportunitiess sit at the intersection of business and governments and society and so forth,\u201d Mr. Wolin said in a phone interview.Or as Mr. Parker put it, \u201cMore and more we hear ourselves described as a critical issues business.\u201dOther moves at Brunswick\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe recent stock market freak-out may have abated, but the dynamics that drove the sell-off \u2014 worries that faster global growth and hotter inflation will trigger faster-than-expected rate hikes \u2014 are alive and well in the currency markets.On Thursday, the Bank of England raised its growth forecasts for the United Kingdom, and Mark Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said rates would likely have to be increased faster than previously expected.The British pound promptly popped by more than 1 percent against the dollar, and yields on British government bonds rose. Treasury bonds yields in the United States also rose, with the 10-year note offering yields of nearing 2.90 percent.The sight of bond yields nearing 3 percent should keep stock investors on edge amid the growing conviction we\u2019re moving out of the era of low-interest rates, which were such a key ingredient for the near-decade-long bull market in stocks.\u2014 Matt PhillipsThe bigger pictureWhat business cares about in the proposal:\u2022 Nearly $300 billion in additional spending over the next two years\u2022 $20 billion for infrastructure spending\u2022 A lifting of the debt ceiling until March 2019The agreement will cause federal budget deficits to grow even larger, on top of the effects of the sweeping tax overhaul that lawmakers approved in December.

On Wednesday, for a brief time, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube featured David Hogg, a survivor of the massacre last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.The caption claimed, falsely, that Mr. Hogg, 17, was not a student, but an \u201cactor.\u201dThe video, originally posted last August, was a brief local news segment. In it, Mr. Hogg was interviewed by the CBS affiliate in Los Angeles after witnessing a dispute between a lifeguard and a swimmer at Redondo Beach.On Tuesday, a YouTube user who went under the name \u201cmike m.\u201d copied and re-uploaded the video with a new caption: \u201cDAVID HOGG THE ACTOR....\u201dThe reposted video moved its way up the trending list overnight. By Wednesday morning, it had accumulated more than 200,000 views.\u201cI had no idea where all the attention was coming from,\u201d said \u201cmike m.\u201d in an online chat interview with The New York Times. \u201cI just noticed it started to take off.\u201dMany commenters were confused. \u201cWhy is this on trending, especially on news? Nothing special,\u201d wrote one. Others, tipped off by the caption calling Mr. Hogg an actor, knew exactly what they thought they were seeing: \u201cSomeone get this kid an Oscar!\u201d one wrote.By noon on Wednesday, YouTube had pulled the video for violating its policy on harassment and bullying.It was not the first time that YouTube had served not just as a source of fringe conspiracy theories, but as an accomplice in their rapid spread.In the wake of this latest tragedy, which left 17 people dead at the school in Parkland, YouTube still seemed caught by surprise by the rise of another video meant to peddle a baseless theory.\u201cIn 2017, we started rolling out changes to better surface authoritative news sources in search results, particularly around breaking news events,\u201d YouTube, which is owned by Google, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen improvements, but in some circumstances these changes are not working quickly enough. In addition, last year we updated the application of our harassment policy to include hoax videos that target the victims of these tragedies.\u201dUnlike the other unhinged clips that have garnered significant attention on YouTube in the recent past, the video of the Parkland survivor originated with neither a conspiracy-oriented media organization like Infowars nor one of the popular YouTubers who have catered to far-right subcultures and fringe political factions.Instead, it was posted to the infrequently updated account run by \u201cmike m.\u201d Up until the reposting of the video featuring Mr. Hogg, the account had fewer than a dozen videos and fewer than 1,000 followers. Although he declined to provide much information about himself or give his full name, \u201cmike m.\u201d said that he was a 51-year-old man living in Idaho.His uploads included a handful of little-watched videos suggesting he is an avid fan of conspiracies. What inspired him to traffic in an unfounded theory about the Parkland shooting \u2014 aside from \u201chaving more time on my hands these days,\u201d he said \u2014 were posts he had seen on the popular conspiracy site Godlike Productions. He pointed to comments on the site that claimed Mr. Hogg had been \u201ccoached\u201d before giving interviews to members of the media who covered the massacre. It\u2019s also where he found references to the beach video from last August.Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Mr. Hogg addressed the explosion of conspiracy theories head-on. \u201cI\u2019m not a crisis actor,\u201d said Mr. Hogg, who had been visiting family and friends when he appeared in the Los Angeles news segment. \u201cI\u2019m someone who had to witness this and live through this and I continue to be having to do that. I\u2019m not acting on anybody\u2019s behalf.\u201dThe video posted by \u201cmike m.\u201d rapidly gained steam nonetheless.What propelled this one to popularity \u2014 and eventually into YouTube\u2019s promotional apparatus \u2014 came from outside the platform.Links to the video proliferated on 4chan, where users have gleefully embraced the conspiracy theories and mocked the shooting victims. When it hit YouTube\u2019s Trending page, some on 4chan celebrated: \u201cTRENDING IN THE USA,\u201d began one thread in the far-right politics board called /pol/. \u201cWE\u2019RE BREAKING THE CONDITIONING.\u201dThe \u201cmike m.\u201d video also found traction on Twitter, on Facebook and in stories and comment threads on conspiracy sites. It rose in the circuitous and unexpected manner of a viral video, rather than one that had been calculated to game YouTube\u2019s algorithms by seizing on interest in breaking news or tragedy \u2014 it had no catchy headline, no recognizable personality, no vast theorizing. And yet it blasted through YouTube\u2019s safeguards and somehow kept going, exposing the platform as vulnerable to sudden influence from inside and outside its walls.After YouTube removed the video, \u201cmike m.\u201d said his account had received a \u201cstrike\u201d \u2014 that is how YouTube warns users that they have broken the site\u2019s rules or violated its guidelines. (Three strikes and you\u2019re out.) \u201cI mean, why strike me over a beach confrontation video???\u201d he said. A second video he had posted about the shooting was gaining popularity Wednesday morning, he said, until it, too, was deleted, and another strike was added to his account.Anonymous and remorseless, \u201cmike m\u201d was undeterred. \u201cThere is more to this kid than appears on MSM,\u201d he said, using the common shorthand for \u201cmainstream media.\u201d Asked if he would think twice about posting such videos in the future, he said, \u201cNo not at all.\u201dHe said he was worried about his account getting deleted, adding: \u201cBut I am not going to stop.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Ethical \u2018Dark Side\u2019: Harvard, Stanford and Others Want to Address It", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, in the wake of fake news and other troubles at tech companies, universities that helped produce some of Silicon Valley\u2019s top technologists are hustling to bring a more medicine-like morality to computer science.And at Stanford University, the academic heart of the industry, three professors and a research fellow are developing a computer science ethics course for next year. They hope several hundred students will enroll.The idea is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations \u2014 like autonomous weapons or self-driving cars \u2014 before those products go on sale.\u201cTechnology is not neutral,\u201d said Professor Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. \u201cThe choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications.\u201dBut until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning \u2014 computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Mr. Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-M.I.T. ethics course.\u201cA lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data,\u201d Professor Levy said. \u201cIf data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise.\u201dThe curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data \u2014 like whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records \u2014 to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Mr. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions like: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans?Some universities offer such programs in their information science, law or philosophy departments. At Stanford, the computer science department will offer the new ethics course, tentatively titled \u201cEthics, Public Policy and Computer Science.\u201dThe expectations for the course are running high in part because of Professor Sahami\u2019s popularity on campus. About 1,500 students take his introductory computer science course every year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Iranian Photographer\u2019s Unflinching Look at His Country\u2019s Revolution", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKaveh Kazemi's images of the Iranian revolution and its aftermath reveal the country's transition from a different era, and a contrast with its social upheaval today.That picture, from 1979, captured the end of an era. Soon, Iran\u2019s parliament passed a law making the Islamic veil compulsory for all women, even visiting dignitaries and tourists. The country remains one of the few in the world to ask people to dress according to the state\u2019s wishes.Four decades later, some women have again taken to the streets, removing their veils in protest. Feb. 11 is the 39th anniversary of the revolution that ousted the Shah and led to the Islamic republic\u2019s creation. But instead of celebration, there is general dissatisfaction, as well as tensions over the economy and the political system. Nationwide protests that started in December lasted more than a week, leaving 25 people dead and nearly 5,000 detained.With cameras everywhere and an unending torrent of images on social media, we forget how photography documents history. In Iran, where the state has long tried to impose its own versions of the truth, Mr. Kazemi\u2019s work has aged particularly well. His images of the revolution, its aftermath and the war with Iraq have now been published in \u201cRevolutionaries, the First Decade,\u201d which shows that while today there is upheaval in Iran, and opponents abroad hail it as the start of a new revolution, it\u2019s still very far from those early tumultuous years.His book has been as successful as a photo book can be in Iran, perhaps because it offers an alternative \u2014 and more realistic \u2014 narrative of the events leading to the 1979 revolution and its aftermath. Over the decades, the Iranian state has smoothed over the early era\u2019s rawness, chaos and pain. Instead, state media and history books now portray it by relying on images of Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s return from exile, masses cheering and a new, Islamic administration taking hold.  That one objectionable picture is of a banner showing the late founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, with a protester\u2019s fist in front of it. \u201cI never understood what the issue was with that particular image,\u201d said Mr. Kazemi. The book shows many taboo topics, like a sequence of a post-revolution firefight between competing groups. Years of bloody infighting have long been ignored by the state media\u2019s narrative of Iran\u2019s visual contemporary history, with those in power preferring to pretend \u2014 with images at least \u2014 that they led the revolutionary vanguard from the start. His images show looting, burning and chaos during the revolution. During the war with Iraq, Mr. Kazemi accompanied soldiers to the front to show the agony of combat, rather than jubilant images of victorious soldiers that the state media preferred. He found people waiting for fuel in long ration lines, and went to houses destroyed by Iraqi missiles. He also followed protests where women refused to wear the Islamic veil, while men smile arrogantly at them. Official news media rarely show images of the transition years before the veil became compulsory, going as far as editing out those women without scarves for their archives. Mr. Kazemi waited decades before he could publish these pictures. \u201cI did not want to compromise on the images I wanted to show and frankly, I thought for many years that getting a permit to publish such a book was a near-impossible dream,\u201d he said. The fact that he could publish his straightforward book now is a sign that there has been a change of view among some in the Iranian leadership. \u201cSomehow some reforms are working,\u201d he said, \u201cand those in power are much more realistic nowadays.\u201dHis black and white images also show how long ago the revolution occurred: The anti-American slogans and murals feel dated, as do the mustaches, hippie pants and now-classic American cars. Iranian society has changed and modernized beyond recognition, but what remains a fixture are the ruling clerics with their turbans and cloaks. Mr. Kazemi has witnessed it all. The book\u2019s final pages are devoted to the death of Ayatollah Khomeini, a moment when many thought the Islamic republic would soon end. He showed the millions who flocked to his funeral, an event that stretched over several days of public mourning. After the funeral, a new leader was elected, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is still in power.\u201cFor me, photography is best at its simplest and purest form, looking at things directly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just clicking the shutter, you also have to convey a message.\u201d What message exactly? \u201cTo put in perspective what you are witnessing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The prosecution has requested that he remain under arrest.Mr. Ramadan is the author of several books on Islam and on the Western world, and is considered by some experts to offer a moderate, tolerant version of the faith. But critics, especially in France, say he is a demagogue who hides radical views behind a polished media persona.The women\u2019s accusations have put a dent in his projected image as a pious family man. He has characterized them as part of an organized campaign of slander by his enemies.Mr. Ramadan was taken into custody for questioning on Wednesday, when he answered a police summons in Paris. Now that a formal investigation has begun, Mr. Ramadan\u2019s fate remains uncertain.In France, complex criminal cases are handled by special magistrates with broad investigative powers. Defendants placed under formal investigation will not automatically go to trial, as the magistrates can drop cases they believe show insufficient evidence.If Mr. Ramadan goes to trial and if he is convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison on the charge of rape, and up to 20 years on the separate charge of rape of a vulnerable person. That charge was included because Mr. Ramadan\u2019s second accuser is partly disabled, requiring her to walk with a crutch because of a car accident.Ms. Ayari had already written about the assault in a 2016 book on how she had been drawn to Salafism, a radical Islamist movement, before breaking away from the ideology. But she had not identified the attacker as Mr. Ramadan.The second accuser, who has not been identified publicly, filed a complaint against Mr. Ramadan shortly after, accusing him of having raped and assaulted her in a hotel room in the central French city of Lyon in 2009.The woman, a 45-year-old convert to Islam, told French newspapers that she had corresponded with Mr. Ramadan on Facebook and met him in his hotel on the sidelines of a conference to discuss religion. When she went to his room, she said, she was raped and beaten.Both women said Mr. Ramadan had threatened them into silence.Mr. Ramadan is a grandson of Hassan al-Banna, who founded the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in the 1920s.Advertisement"}

Her son has food allergies, and a scene in the film shows blackberries being used as a weapon. The backlash to the scene has already drawn an apology from the filmmakers.\u201cPeter Rabbit,\u201d which came out last week, features live actors and computer-generated animals. A human character named Tom McGregor is allergic to blackberries. In a quest to gain access to his garden, rabbits pelt him with fruits and vegetables before using a slingshot to send a blackberry flying into his mouth.It works.\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Beatrix Potter will be turning in her grave about now,\u201d Ms. Rose, who lives outside Guildford in Surrey, England, said in an interview on Facebook Messenger. \u201cAllergies are often not taken seriously enough anyway. To have them trivialized on the big screen by such a popular character is immensely disappointing.\u201dIn an emailed statement on Sunday, the filmmakers and Sony Pictures apologized: \u201cFood allergies are a serious issue. Our film should not have made light of Peter Rabbit\u2019s archnemesis, Mr. McGregor, being allergic to blackberries, even in a cartoonish, slapstick way.\u201dThe statement, which was attributed in part to the film\u2019s director, writers and producers, added, \u201cWe sincerely regret not being more aware and sensitive to this issue, and we truly apologize.\u201dWhen the rabbits fire a blackberry into Mr. McGregor\u2019s mouth, Mr. Mendez said, \u201cthere\u2019s a close-up of his face, and it\u2019s him holding his neck like he\u2019s choking.\u201d When Mr. McGregor collapses and appears to be dead for a moment, the rabbits cheer.\u201cMaking light of this condition hurts our members because it encourages the public not to take the risk of allergic reactions seriously, and this cavalier attitude may make them act in ways that could put an allergic person in danger,\u201d it said.Mr. McGregor, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is made out to be the villain for most of the movie. He is determined to keep rabbits off his property using whatever he needs, from garden tools to an electric fence.Peter Rabbit is rascally too, and he seems to delight in mocking and hurting Mr. McGregor as the two battle for dominion over the garden.The movie fits an old trope of children\u2019s shows in which two nemeses (like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny, or Tom and Jerry) face off, often with slapstick violence in the form of explosions, high-speed crashes or falling anvils.Dr. Andrew Adesman, the chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center of New York in Queens, said he remembered watching Wile E. Coyote cartoons as a child. He said the blackberry attack in \u201cPeter Rabbit\u201d is a little different because it purposely exploits a person\u2019s health condition.\u201cThere\u2019s some research out there suggesting that what is depicted in this movie is a real-world experience for some children with life-threatening food allergies,\u201d Dr. Adesman said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cI can understand the outrage.\u201dNicole Drey of Merrick, N.Y., said her son Brayden, 7, has such severe allergies that she takes him to movie theaters early in the day, when the air and the seats are as clean as possible.They went to see \u201cPeter Rabbit\u201d on Friday morning, Ms. Drey said in a phone interview. And when Mr. McGregor collapsed onscreen, she tried to reassure her son. \u201cI just kept explaining to him that it\u2019s make believe, it\u2019s not real, and people don\u2019t act that way,\u201d she said.Brayden did not like it.\u201cI was really afraid about the one part where they shot the blackberries,\u201d he said. \u201cI was upset because he had to use his EpiPen.\u201dIn real life, he added, using the EpiPen is \u201cscary.\u201dMs. Drey said that she knew it was just a children\u2019s film, but that \u201cpeople that don\u2019t deal with this don\u2019t understand.\u201d She has spent years helping Brayden deal with bullying, isolation, medical appointments and the everyday logistical challenges of finding safe food.\u201cI think there should have been a trigger warning, and we should have been notified somehow,\u201d she said of the movie. \u201cPut it out there, so we can at least talk to our kids about the contents and then make an informed decision.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were at a restaurant in Harlem when Mr. Cheeks, also unattached, walked through the door.\u201cHe looked extra nice that day,\u201d said Ms. Darrisaw, who wasted no time turning that old spark into a new flame. \u201cYou should take me on a date,\u201d she said, momentarily stunning Mr. Cheeks.Mr. Cheeks, who said that Ms. Darrisaw \u201cseemed on par with my original feeling that she was stuck up,\u201d said he simply told her, \u201cFine, give me your number.\u201dHe did not call that weekend. \u201cI thought maybe he just blew me off,\u201d she said.As it turned out, Mr. Cheeks lost his cellphone in a cab and had to ask their mutual friend, through Facebook, for Ms. Darrisaw\u2019s number. When he finally connected with her in August 2012, she appeared to be putting him off, saying that she was headed to the 2012 Olympics in London, and would start a new job shortly thereafter.

{"Headline": "The Scion of a Pakistani Political Dynasty Comes Out", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe video, posted on the internet last summer, wasn\u2019t supposed to be the coming-out story of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.South Asian viewers might not have recognized Mr. Bhutto\u2019s face but they certainly knew his name. In his native Pakistan, the news media voraciously covered the short film. The reaction focused, in a negative way, on him being a queer Muslim man.\u201cPerhaps I was a bit na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Bhutto said in a phone interview. \u201cI had been under the radar for so long, I didn\u2019t think people cared as much as they did.\u201dBut the reason viewers across the world clamored about the video, and why it continues to stir controversy, was because Mr. Bhutto is the grandson and namesake of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the founder of the Pakistan Peoples Party (P.P.P.), a left-wing political party that held power in Pakistan on and off since 1967. (The current governing party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, is a center-right conservative group.) After leading the country for much of the 1970s, the elder Zulfikar Bhutto was overthrown in a military coup and executed in 1979. Three of his children who went into politics, most prominently the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, later suffered similarly violent ends.Equally impassioned but hostile reactions from overseas South Asians to the video centered on Mr. Bhutto\u2019s sexuality, especially on the 10-second-long scene capturing his joyful drag performance. In Pakistan, same-sex sexual acts are prohibited by law, and there are no anti-discrimination laws to protect L.G.B.T.Q. citizens, although the Senate recently approved amendments to a bill that allows trans people to choose their gender without needing to appear before a medical board.Drag is not openly accepted in Pakistan. The closest thing may be the performances by hijras \u2014 transgender or intersex people who were categorized as males at birth but who do not conform to traditional ideas of masculinity. While they do not fit the Western definition of drag queens, they dance and sing at public ceremonies while wearing women\u2019s clothing. At first, Mr. Bhutto was reluctant to discuss his own use of cross-dressing. \u201cBut now the cat\u2019s out of the bag,\u201d he said. \u201cDrag is an integral part of my practice; what point is there being shy and tiptoeing around it anymore?\u201dIt was another act of hatred that spurred Mr. Bhutto to also weave his identity as a gay person into his art. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen, an American Muslim man, killed 49 people at a popular Orlando gay club. The tragedy, and unsubstantiated rumors that Mr. Mateen may have been a closeted gay man, opened up a rare mainstream discourse, both in United States and in the Muslim world, on queerness in Islam. It became clear to Mr. Bhutto that \u201cpeople think you\u2019re either queer or you\u2019re Muslim, and that somehow those two things are in opposition to one another.\u201dDuring that period, Mr. Bhutto attended his first drag show. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t used to it, it\u2019s very impactful: the makeup, the costume, the performance, the songs,\u201d he said. He first tried his hand at drag a few months later, at a local bar. Over time, he began building his performances around music and spoken-word sections that address his religion and cultural background \u2014 \u201cwhich can be surprisingly jarring and political to the audience,\u201d he said.\u201cThere are some misguided ideas about what Islam represents and the threat that Muslim men pose,\u201d Mr. Bhutto explained. By combining homoerotic images of musclebound men with embroidered sections of flowery cloth, and by emphasizing the calligraphic Arabic script, he seeks to challenge assumptions about Muslim masculinity.Last fall, \u201cMussalmaan Musclemen\u201d was included in the Karachi Biennale. Though it was the first time that Mr. Bhutto had been home since the \u201cTurmeric Project\u201d video caused an uproar, he said that he wasn\u2019t nervous \u2014 he has always made sure to maintain a low profile when he travels to Pakistan. But it would be more difficult to stay incognito if he were openly practicing his art there, which, he said, is why he\u2019s not interested in moving back to the country.\u201cI respect what my father did,\u201d Mr. Bhutto said. \u201cHe dedicated his entire life to a cause, he made himself physically vulnerable for a cause, I respect that \u2014 but, honestly, it\u2019s not for me.\u201dThe exhibition \u201ctackles the representation of Islam and Muslims all over the world but through a queer lens,\u201d Mr. Bhutto said. At least in America, he noted, \u201cthese days, identifying as Muslim is more tricky than identifying as queer, funnily enough.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the title of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto\u2019s mixed-media series. It is \u201cMussalmaan Musclemen,\u201d not \u201cMusaalmaan Muscleman.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Martin, an ex-convict who was sought out for his firsthand knowledge of the dangers and hope found behind bars. In interviews and in speeches, he recounted being stabbed by fellow inmates as a teenager at Rikers and earning a college degree as an adult in an upstate prison while serving a sentence for armed robbery.As his reputation as a fund-raiser and advocate grew, so, too, did talk that he was using his professional prominence to pursue sexual relationships with women who were drawn to the criminal justice reform movement \u2014 and in some instances engaging in sexual misconduct.According to a statement last week from JLUSA, the organization conducted an investigation in November and found no misconduct by Mr. Martin. But then in December Mr. Martin quit, telling the board that his leaving was in the best interests of the organization. The abrupt departure intensified speculation about his conduct.The New York Times has learned that an employee of the organization was paid $25,000 in 2015 as part of an agreement that concealed her allegations that Mr. Martin had groped and propositioned her in his apartment during what was supposed to be a work meeting.In an interview, she said the August 2015 incident changed her life.\u201cI joined JLUSA to empower people and instead had all the power taken away from me,\u201d the woman, 32, said. \u201cI was rendered powerless and silenced while he was empowered with an even bigger microphone.\u201dThe encounter took place when the organization was still forming a board. The review of the employee\u2019s allegations and the confidential agreement made with her were handled by Arabella Advisors, a philanthropy services firm that manages the New Venture Fund, one of the early nonprofit supporters of JustLeadershipUSA.As part of the agreement, which The Times has reviewed, the woman had promised not to discuss the allegations or money she received. She said she agreed to termination and $25,000 in compensation after declining an offer to remain with the nonprofit but to work from home.When she learned of Mr. Martin\u2019s resignation, she suspected that there were other instances of misconduct. After she was contacted by The Times, she said she had decided to breach the nondisclosure pact because she wanted to support other women who had talked to The Times about their experiences with Mr. Martin.Two of those women, both of whom work for criminal justice nonprofits, said in interviews that they were subjected to lewd acts by Mr. Martin \u2014 incidents that occurred after the confidential agreement with the former employee. In separate incidents, in 2016 and 2017, the women said, Mr. Martin masturbated in front of each of them.Like the former employee, the two other women said they wanted to preserve their privacy, and they agreed to be interviewed on the condition that their names not be published.Mr. Martin, 47, through an attorney, denied any inappropriate conduct with the former employee or with the other two women.\u201cGlenn vehemently denies any of the allegations that are the subject of this article. These allegations are simply not true,\u201d Keith White, his lawyer, said in a statement.Vivian D. Nixon, chairwoman of the JLUSA board, said the employee never approached her about her concerns and that the \u201cinvestigation and settlement were not shared with the founding JLUSA board of directors.\u201d\u201cWe were not made aware of any concerns by our fiscal sponsor about moving forward with the formation of JLUSA under Glenn Martin\u2019s leadership,\u201d Ms. Nixon said in a statement.Lee Bodner, president of the New Venture Fund, said in an emailed response to questions, \u201cI talked to our lawyer, and everything here is covered by confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations and we cannot discuss them.\u201dOn Tuesday, Ms. Nixon and the organization condemned abuse and harassment while also saying space needed to be made for both victims and offenders to heal.But in its early days, the organization was based in Mr. Martin\u2019s Harlem apartment and had a small staff. The employee who later made her accusations said she was inspired to work for the group because many of her relatives had been incarcerated and, in her view, unfairly punished by the justice system.On a Monday in August 2015, the woman and another employee stuffed envelopes for a fund-raiser at Mr. Martin\u2019s apartment from around 4 p.m. until 7 p.m. The woman said it was the first time she had been in Mr. Martin\u2019s home.After the woman and the other employee left, she glanced down at her phone at around 7:30 p.m. and saw that Mr. Martin had texted her at 7:09 p.m. \u201cWas going to ask u to get a drink with me and discuss JLUSA 2016 planning.\u201dShe returned to his building for the meeting. For about two hours, they talked about work over a bottle of wine. But at around 10:15 p.m., Mr. Martin shifted the tone of the conversation and told her he was attracted to her, she said.Mr. Martin \u201ccomes toward me and kisses me. He touches my face, shoulder, waist, breasts. I shake my head. I say no and look down at the ground for a while and his hands are all over me. He tells me he fantasizes about me all the time. He says I need to let him get this out of his system. That phrase is said at least three times until I leave.\u201dHis advances, including requests to join him in his bedroom, continued. \u201cHe repeatedly said he\u2019s not going to sleep with me but that I should come into the bedroom with him,\u201d she wrote in the email, which The New York Times has reviewed.The woman finally left, receiving a text from Mr. Martin at 10:48 p.m. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re safe.\u201dShe responded at 10:54 p.m., \u201cHome now.\u201dShaken, the woman told her husband what happened that night. In the following days, she said she also told Arabella and David Mensah, a consultant who still works with JLUSA. Mr. Mensah did not respond to messages for comment. Arabella referred questions to the New Venture Fund.On Thursday, a few days after the incident, Arabella\u2019s senior director of human resources responded, \u201cJust wanted to quickly let you know that I have received this email and will be circling back with you very soon. I also wanted to say that I\u2019m very sorry to hear this happened to you.\u201dThe next month, the woman officially left and agreed to accept the payment. In an email on Sept. 10, 2015, the senior human resources director said Mr. Martin would be informed that she was leaving and would inform other staff. \u201cAs discussed previously the communication will be neutral and absent any of the details about what happened or the terms of this agreement,\u201d the director wrote.About four months later in January or February of 2016, another woman, 35, said she met Mr. Martin at a panel discussion, and then he pursued her through direct messages on Facebook. Interested in talking to him about justice reform, she said she accompanied Mr. Martin to his apartment one evening.She said she found him attractive, but a chat over wine took a lewd and unexpected turn after Mr. Martin went to his bedroom. She said he was lying on the bed and asked her to join him, which she said she declined to do. \u201cThe best way to describe it was a whining \u2018Why don\u2019t you want me?\u2019\u201d she recalled.He then pulled out his penis and masturbated, she said. \u201cI felt paralyzed. I couldn\u2019t move or walk away. I couldn\u2019t. I was stuck there,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018He\u2019s not embarrassed?\u2019\u201dShe said she saw him once more, seeking an apology that she did not receive. She also tearfully told her new boss what had happened, because she feared Mr. Martin had spread a different story within the justice reform community.\u201cPeople would be drooling to hear him talk,\u201d the woman said. \u201cYou look at this man and there\u2019s a trail of women who have been harmed. You\u2019re hurting the women that are doing the work.\u201dIn February 2017, another woman, a 29-year-old social worker, met Mr. Martin when he visited her organization to talk about justice reform. He later encouraged her to apply for a job at JLUSA but almost immediately began to make unwanted advances, she said.The advances, which the woman said she now views as harassment, contributed to her decision to withdraw her application, she said. Mr. Martin continued to contact her, and in March, she went to confront him at the office in Harlem, she said. \u201cHe tried to kiss me. He grabbed my neck. He tried to pull my pants down,\u201d she said, noting that they were alone in the office.She said she fended him off, but then he masturbated in front of her. She said she \u201cfroze.\u201d \u201cI was completely demoralized,\u201d she said.She spoke to two friends who confirmed to The Times that the woman told them what happened. One of the friends provided text messages that the woman sent her showing her concern about the earlier advances.After Mr. Martin resigned, the woman approached The Times. She said she had been reluctant to speak out about Mr. Martin, who had become the face of criminal justice reform in the city.\u201cI thought I was going to harm quote, unquote the movement.\u201dSusan Beachy contributed research.Follow Nikita Stewart on Twitter: @kitastew.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sexual Misconduct Spurs New Elections: The #MeToo Races", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese and other allegations of sexual misconduct led to resignations by nearly a dozen state and federal lawmakers in recent months, setting off a flurry of special elections around the country to fill seats suddenly left open by the #MeToo reckoning.Yet the candidates running to replace these disgraced men \u2014 many of whom are women \u2014 are hesitating to put sexual harassment front and center as an issue in their campaigns. In at least eight state legislative and two congressional races, including special elections in Minnesota and Oklahoma that were held last week, the subject has rarely been mentioned in advertisements, rallies or when knocking on doors.In Minnesota, Karla Bigham, a Democrat who won a special election on Feb. 12 to replace a disgraced member of her own party, found slightly more interest in the issue, though it did not dominate conversations.\u201cPeople were well aware of why we were having a special election,\u201d Ms. Bigham, who has been a union organizer, said. \u201cThey expected a change and I talked about that on the doors in Minnesota \u2014 we need a cultural change in the Capitol.\u201dSome candidates said they have hesitated to press the issue because sexual harassment does not weigh as heavily on voters\u2019 minds as do other concerns, such as the economy, local issues or their approval or disapproval of President Trump.In most years, there are scores of special elections around the country to fill vacancies in statehouses and Congress. Most occur after a lawmaker dies or resigns after winning higher office, getting a political appointment or taking a private-sector job.This year, sudden openings after revelations of sexual misconduct have added to the count, creating a new brand of #MeToo elections.That is because most were in districts that are safely Republican or Democratic, and voters have shown no inclination to punish the party of a lawmaker who quit after accusations of sexual misbehavior.In Minnesota last week, Jeremy Munson, a Republican, retained a State House seat for his party in a rural district after the resignation of former Representative Tony Cornish. Leading up to the special election, Mr. Cornish campaigned for Mr. Munson. In an interview, Mr. Cornish said, \u201cI didn\u2019t run into any negativity in personal appearances or anything else.\u2019\u2019Mr. Cornish, a former deputy sheriff of Blue Earth County, stepped down after a lobbyist in the capital, Sarah Walker, said he had propositioned her for years.Ms. Walker said she viewed it as outrageous that a candidate would want Mr. Cornish\u2019s endorsement on the campaign trail. \u201cTo me it seems to speak to the Republicans\u2019 total disregard or concern about sexual harassment allegations,\u201d she said.The Arizona district covers reliably Republican suburbs outside Phoenix, and it is widely expected to remain in Republican hands. State Senator Debbie Lesko, another Republican seeking the seat, said she has largely avoided the subject of Mr. Franks\u2019s disgrace, although occasionally it comes up on the trail.\u201cI usually respond by saying, \u2018Well, in the Republican primary, it\u2019s myself and 11 men running, and I\u2019m not going to sexually harass anyone,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lesko said.Some of the candidates hoping to replace Raul Bocanegra, a California state assemblyman accused by women of groping or unwanted advances, are closely linked with the movement that ousted him. One accused Mr. Bocanegra, a Democrat, of harassing a co-worker last fall; another declared her candidacy after calling for his resignation last year, but has since decided to run in the general election rather than the special election.\u201cI think there\u2019s definitely a feeling for the people running that it\u2019s incumbent for them to bring respectability back to the seat,\u201d said Adama Iwu, a lobbyist who helped to organize a campaign against sexual harassment in California politics.But Dan Schnur, a lecturer in political communications at the University of Southern California, said the issue has not dominated races to replace Mr. Bocanegra or to replace Matt Dababneh, another Democratic lawmaker, who is accused of masturbating in front of a female lobbyist.\u201cRunning against a candidate facing these kind of accusations is a different type of challenge than running to replace one,\u201d Mr. Schnur said.In Oklahoma, a Republican easily held onto a State Senate seat that had been occupied for nearly a decade by Bryce Marlatt, who was arrested last year after his Uber driver accused him of grabbing and kissing her. (He has pleaded not guilty.)Casey Murdock, a rancher and state representative who won Mr. Marlatt\u2019s seat in the heavily Republican district, said voters occasionally told him they were disappointed in Mr. Marlatt. Mr. Murdock said he was skeptical about the Uber driver\u2019s accusations. \u201cI still, I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said.Mr. Murdock\u2019s Democratic opponent, Amber Jensen, said that with 32 percent of the vote, she had outperformed expectations for a Democrat running in this rural stretch of northwest Oklahoma. She spoke with voters who grimaced over the allegations against Mr. Marlatt, but said she did not make them a central part of her campaign.\u201cAt the end of the race, we all still have to live in the same town,\u201d said Ms. Jensen, who owns a construction company. \u201cBut behind the scenes, that is something that drove me forward because \u2014 well, because, me, too. I\u2019ve been victimized before. I\u2019m really tired of men making the decisions for women.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fact-Checking a Facebook Executive\u2019s Comments on Russian Interference ", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRob Goldman, Facebook vice president for ads, tweeted about Russia\u2019s disinformation effort. President Trump then cited him. We fact-checked Mr. Goldman.Mr. Goldman defended Facebook in his tweets, saying that the Russian-bought ads on the social network were not primarily aimed at swaying the vote result. His posts went viral on Saturday when President Trump cited them as proof that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was about something other than giving him an election victory.We fact-checked Mr. Goldman\u2019s eight tweets. Here\u2019s what we found.The Russians \u201cengaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump,\u201d the indictment said. The indictment does show that Russian operatives used social media \u2014 particularly Facebook \u2014 to try to sow division among Americans. But to reiterate, the indictment said that the Russians\u2019 goal was to sway the 2016 election toward a particular outcome. That aim was pursued not just through ads, which Mr. Goldman focuses on, but through Facebook pages, groups and events. The protests in Houston in May 2016 were among many rallies organized by Russian operatives through Facebook. While the Houston protest was anti-Islamic, as Mr. Goldman said, he failed to note that the goal in promoting the demonstration was to link Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign with a pro-Islamic message. According to the indictment secured by Mr. Mueller, there were many other examples of Russian operatives using Facebook and Instagram to organize pro-Trump rallies. At one protest, the Russian operatives paid for a cage to be built, in which an actress dressed as Mrs. Clinton posed in a prison uniform.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the month when protests organized by Russian operatives were held in Houston. It was March 2016, not November 2017.Advertisement"}
