{"Headline": "A Lifetime of Making Art, but New to Selling It Online", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringSuzanne Massion has been making art her whole life.But relying solely on the traditional brick-and-mortar gallery to sell her art isn\u2019t working for her anymore. In October, after going nearly two years without a sale at a gallery where she had a nine-year relationship with the owner, she decided to market her pieces more energetically online.Ms. Massion is following a path taken by other older artists who, eager to continue creating and attempting to earn a living from art in their retirement, are turning to online sales to supplement or replace their gallery ties. With the change, older artists are having to learn to engage with an ever-widening pool of buyers on the internet.The experience can be unsettling, she said.\u201cGoing online and selling online was for me hitting a brick wall. The technological aspect of selling art online was foreign to me,\u201d said Ms. Massion, who had a steep learning curve, starting with learning how to upload digital images.The move to online sales is happening as drawings and photos are more frequently shared on sites like Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram, whether by professional artists or hobbyists. \u201cThe growth of social media has made artists of us all,\u201d said David Winton, the chief executive of Kalisher, a company outside Chapel Hill, N.C., that places original art in businesses and other commercial spaces.After a representative from Kalisher began looking for Cleveland artists for a local client, Mr. Dibble landed a big commission in 2015. The result: 24 paintings hung as a single unit on display in the Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel. He earned just over $19,000 for the job.Mr. Stein still sees a need to continue marketing in the physical world. He has been keeping some work with a gallery in Britain, while also being digitally savvy. \u201cArtists will need more than one platform,\u201d he said.Artists over the age of 50 make up a significant contingent of those represented by online galleries. Artsy.net estimates that nearly 50 percent of living artists represented on its site are older than 50, with similar proportions at Artnet.com and Ugallery.Ruth Finkelstein, associate director of the Robert N. Butler, Columbia Aging Center at Columbia University, said people typically don\u2019t retire from highly creative activities. \u201cYou do it as long as you can.\u201dFledgling and more established artists may also sell on well-known sites like Etsy, eBay and others. Carolyn Edlund is the executive director of the Arts Business Institute, a nonprofit group on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The association conducts workshops in major cities and online for artists who want to start a business. \u201cEntry into the marketplace is incredibly easy,\u201d she said, making it crowded.Some see that as a virtue. Rachel A.J. Pownall, an art economist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who prepared a report on art market trends for the European Fine Art Fair, said in an email: \u201cThe online developments are helping the art market blossom by reaching many more buyers through a large number of business models.\u201d She said that the online market could be a boon for older women whose work might have been overlooked by traditional galleries.Ms. Pownall, who co-authored the recent paper, \u201cGlass Ceilings in the Art Market,\u201d said female artists, to establish themselves in the marketplace, have to be better than average.\u201cAn online presence using an art e-commerce platform,\u201d Ms. Pownall said in the email, \u201cis therefore likely to be a more attractive option for sales for females, who have more to gain by circumventing the traditional channels of the dealer and gallery, and hence my intuition that female artists are more prone to move online.\u201dTo be sure, there can be some potential downsides to going online, but even those are changing. Artists have long relied on traditional galleries, for example, to navigate contracts and help them market their work. Now, online galleries are also bridging that gap. UGallery helps artists with pricing and offers advice about a professional path, and Saatchi Art has an artists relations team.\u201cWe help the artist prepare for every shipment, no matter how complicated, and act as his or her liaison with the courier services, managing any customs clearance issues on behalf of the artist and the art buyer,\u201d Saatchi Art\u2019s chief curator, Rebecca Wilson, said in an email.Artists who place their work on nonexclusive sites also need to be familiar with the terms, Ms. Grissom said. One artist who was showing her work online realized belatedly that she had agreed to a markdown of unsold units of a limited-edition work. Rather than sell the pieces at a discount, the artist removed her remaining work from the site.For now, the two business models, off- and online, co-exist.Regardless of where one sells, Mr. Dibble said, \u201cThe hardest thing in the world is to sell a painting at a fair price.\u201d So he\u2019s keeping his ties to brick-and-mortar galleries in Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland; and New York City, while remembering that unlike them, the internet never closes.An earlier version of this article misstated how Kalisher, a company that places art in businesses, found Matthew Dibble\u2019s artwork. It found his art directly online and by visiting Cleveland and talking to local artists, not by scouting the online outlet Saatchi Art.Advertisement"}

Ms. Bonatsos spoke at one such event this month in San Francisco. And Jalak Jobanputra, founder of the start-up investment firm Future Perfect Ventures, and other blockchain developers gathered in New York this month to discuss the issue. They later announced that they would form a blockchain diversity advocacy group called the Collective Future and create a diversity pledge for crypto companies to sign as a show of commitment.\u201cThe early days are what decide the culture of an industry and who gets involved in making the decisions,\u201d Ms. Jobanputra said. She cited the venture capitalists who funded eBay and Amazon and whom they funded next.\u201cWomen always question if they\u2019re qualified,\u201d she said. \u201cBut look at these clowns around us.\u201dThe response to some of the events has been encouraging, some of the women said. Brit Morin, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, recently held a blockchain gathering for women that sold out in an hour. She moved the meeting to a bigger venue, where all 500 seats sold out again. So she set up a livestream for the event; that evening, 16,000 viewers joined to watch.\u201cWe have an opportunity to rebuild the financial systems,\u201d Ms. Morin said. \u201cWomen want to be part of that.\u201dThe resistance follows increasing outrage at the lack of diversity in virtual currencies, punctuated by the sexist incidents involving DateCoin\u2019s Facebook ad and Prodeum, the blockchain-for-fruit start-up. Neither company returned requests for comment.\u201cIt just coincidentally happened that there were more men than women speakers,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not intentional not to include them. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t have time to include them.\u201dWhen others in the cryptocurrency industry realized the conference\u2019s after-party would be held at a strip club, they encouraged Mr. Levin to change locations. He said the strip club was the most convenient and safest venue he could find.\u201cDowntown Miami doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of event spaces,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cAnd we needed a lot of security.\u201dThe year before, the conference\u2019s kickoff party featured underwear-clad models \u2014 painted gold and covered in Bitcoin logos.\u201cMoe does something just as sexist every year,\u201d said Rose Chan, who founded the World Bank\u2019s blockchain working group and now runs her own cryptocurrency project. \u201cHe switches it up, which actually means that he thinks about it.\u201dOne group of female investors said they had decided to boycott the conference in the future.Mr. Levin said this reaction surprised him. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people who had a great time,\u201d he said.At some women-in-crypto events, frustration is giving way to anger and sadness. On a recent night, about 50 young women interested in cryptocurrencies gathered at the Woman\u2019s Club of Palo Alto. Some were engineering students at nearby Stanford University.Over wine, they shared their stories \u2014 some had been mistaken for hired models, others propositioned during job interviews, and many men had not believed they were engineers at all.Catheryne Nicholson, the chief executive of BlockCypher, which provides infrastructure for blockchain applications, explained to some of the younger women why the gender situation had deteriorated.\u201cNow there\u2019s a lot of money, and the men think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m a whale now,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re a little more full of themselves.\u201dKaren Hsu, BlockCypher\u2019s head of growth, said she thought some of the gender concerns had been overstated. She said that at a recent conference, she had been asked if she was a speaker, which was validating.\u201cIt was nice because he didn\u2019t think I was a booth babe,\u201d Ms. Hsu said, referring to hired models who stand near the booths of start-ups to draw the attention of conference attendees.Other women spoke about how the culture of blockchain was slowly wearing them down. Jay Graber, a developer at Zcash, a new cryptocurrency aimed at enhanced privacy, was wearing small green earrings she had made out of RAM sticks used in cryptocurrency gear. She said she had become interested in blockchain after joining the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011, and she viewed the technology as a tool that could take power away from big central banks. Now she\u2019s not so sure.\u201cI never felt insecure before I got into this space,\u201d Ms. Graber said. \u201cBut I just realized there is no one else like me. It is a very hard feeling when you don\u2019t see anyone who is like you.\u201dMs. Graber said she had considered leaving the industry.\u201cI have this perpetual sense of being on the outside of that conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a general state of alienation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She set her sights on meeting an artist, and at a party in 1991, she did. Chatting with the sculptor and musician Terry Adkins, Ms. Williams gave him a thorough grilling on his bona fides. Mr. Adkins, in turn, scoffed at her preferences in art. That night he proposed, and nine months later they were married.The following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Ms. Williams-Adkins.How did you and your husband put this collection together?We didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but Terry would do trades with friends. It was organic. He loved his students [at the University of Pennsylvania] and collected their work. Jamal Cyrus was one of his students and Demetrius Oliver. Wilmer Wilson was in Terry\u2019s last class.Would he do trades even for the African art?Have you continued to collect on your own?I go to benefits and I will buy things.

{"Headline": "How to Break Up With Your Phone", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe moment I realized I needed to break up with my phone came just over two years ago. I had recently had a baby and was feeding her in a darkened room as she cuddled on my lap. It was an intimate, tender moment \u2014 except for one detail. She was gazing at me \u2026 and I was on eBay, scrolling through listings for Victorian-era doorknobs.I\u2019m not going to try to explain this particular personal passion. The point is that a good 15 minutes had probably passed before I finally caught sight of my daughter looking at me, her tiny face illuminated by my phone\u2019s blue light. I saw the scene as it would have looked to an outsider \u2014 her focused on me, me focused on my phone \u2014 and my heart sank. This was not the way I wanted things to be.Two years later, I feel that I\u2019ve succeeded. Here are some of the key things I learned on how to navigate a successful breakup and create a better relationship with your phone.Create triggers that will remind you of your goals and make it easier to live up to them. If you want to spend more time reading, leave a book on your bedside table. If you want to cook more, lay out a shopping list for that recipe you\u2019re eager to try. Set up a charging station for your phone that\u2019s not in your bedroom, and buy a stand-alone alarm clock.On the flip side, avoid triggers that will set you up for failure. Delete social media apps from your phone. (Use the clunkier browser versions instead.) Disable notifications, including those for email. (I allow only those from phone calls, text messages and my calendar.) Establish a rule \u2014 for yourself and your family \u2014 of not keeping phones on the table during meals.It\u2019s amazing how often we pick up our phones \u201cjust to check\u201d then look up 20 minutes later wondering where the time has gone. I call these \u201czombie checks,\u201d and they\u2019re nearly guaranteed to be unsatisfying or make you feel like you\u2019re wasting your life.Leave your phone at home while you go for a walk. Stare out of a window during your commute instead of checking your email. At first, you may be surprised by how powerfully you crave your phone. Pay attention to your craving. What does it feel like in your body? What\u2019s happening in your mind? Keep observing it, and eventually, you may find that it fades away on its own.If all else fails, consider your own mortality. How many people on their deathbeds do you think are going to say, \u201cI wish I\u2019d spent more time on Facebook\u201d? Keep asking yourself the same question, again and again and again: This is your life. How much of it do you want to spend on your phone?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Old House Is a Chore", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRight at Home23 PhotosHow hard could it be to replace a 90-year-old toilet? It seemed like something a plumber could handle, maybe even the one standing in my bathroom in 2013, telling me that a crack in my tank meant mine was toast.No problem, I thought, I\u2019ll just swap it out.And this is when I learned rule number one for owners of old houses: Never utter the phrase \u201cjust swap it out.\u201dI will not belabor the details of early 20th-century plumbing, but trust me when I say that if I had simply replaced my commode, a new model would have been perched roughly half a foot from the wall. To get to the shower, I would have had to climb over the new fixture.The solution? Rip up the original tile floor and move the plumbing. Other problems would have followed: The mint-colored wall tiles would have likely been damaged and needed replacement, too. I might have had to open the kitchen ceiling to access the pipes above. In other words, to replace the toilet, I would have had to gut my vintage 1924 bathroom to the tune of $25,000.Buy a newer house and, for the most part, replacement parts are available at your local Home Depot. Not so with an old home that still has its original charm. Plumbing ages, for example, and can crumble when you try to replace a fixture. Champions of older homes will tell you that the structures were built with high-quality materials meant to last, and that is certainly true. But when something does reach the end of its life \u2014 like a decades-old crystal doorknob that falls off in your hand \u2014 you\u2019ll spend days surfing eBay looking for a replacement, because nothing like it exists on Wayfair.\u201cWe\u2019re just a bunch of stupid city dwellers thinking, \u2018Oh, no big deal! I\u2019m going to buy a 150-year-old house and fix it,\u2019\u201d said Stella Gilgur-Cook, who started the Montclair Rehabers group in December after she discovered that repairing the grand staircase of her \u201cVictorian-ish\u201d four-bedroom in Montclair, N.J., was actually a big deal.Mrs. Gilgur-Cook, 41, a health care administrator, and her husband, Josh Cook, 41, who works in video and film production, moved with their two children from a rental in Forest Hills, Queens, last August. The couple did not set out to buy a fixer-upper, but ended up with a house that needed some work. (Don\u2019t they all?)As their first project, they wanted to remove carpeting from the staircase and sand off layers of old paint. But carpet has a way of hiding secrets, and removing theirs revealed serious damage to the top steps. \u201cYou could put your hand between where the step ended and the next riser started,\u201d Mrs. Gilgur-Cook said. \u201cWe freaked out.\u201dThat\u2019s when they decided to call a professional, and promptly learned rule number two of homeownership: Good luck finding one. (Especially one who knows how to restore, not just replace, parts in an old house.)Mrs. Gilgur-Cook interviewed \u201ca whole parade of people.\u201d Some said they could do the work, but then never came back. Others insisted the whole structure had to be ripped out and replaced. She hired one contractor, but the crew quit after sanding the first step. Finally, she found a company that specialized in old staircases and, for $8,000, fixed hers.Old houses woo you with character. Step into a center-hall colonial, and you swoon over crown molding and carved woodwork. But it is the antique kitchen or bathroom that is the real conversation piece. (You think my toilet is funky; I haven\u2019t even told you about my shimmery bathroom wallpaper, a rather bold update made by the previous owners. As I have no idea what lurks behind that sturdy paper, I have resisted removing it and bringing the bathroom back to its original state. Besides, the bling has kind of grown on me.)Mr. Roginski also works as a consultant to homeowners, chastising the ones who have succumbed to the lure of newness and replaced their rattling wood windows with silently sliding, but charmless, double-paned ones, and advising others on how to avoid such a fate.Wondering what to do about your shabby shutters? Read the Old House Guy\u2019s exhaustive treatise on the subject, prefaced with an ominous warning: \u201cWhat one thinks is a simple mistake will destroy a home\u2019s curb appeal. Don\u2019t let this happen to you!\u201dWhen you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either roll up your sleeves and get to work, or need a Xanax.Which brings us to rule number three: Do It Yourself is harder than it looks.Sure, Nicole Curtis can scale a ladder and bring an ornate gable roof back to its original glory in 30 minutes flat on the DIY Network show \u201cRehab Addict,\u201d but try that project with your better half on a Saturday afternoon and you may discover that you\u2019re lacking in this particular life skill. Or, as Mrs. Gilgur-Cook put it, \u201cYou suddenly realize all the adult things you don\u2019t know how to do.\u201dCall in the pros and chances are they will tell you to toss, not fix, your old stuff. \u201cThere\u2019s this phenomenon in the recent world where people don\u2019t try to fix it,\u201d said Gary Tjader, owner of ThisOldToilet, which is based in Los Altos, Calif.Of course, you could always learn how to be handy. Kelly Hobby-Bishop had never done home improvement until 2010, when she moved in with her soon-to-be husband, Sean Bishop, who owned a 1911 Craftsman-style house in Pasadena, Calif., with original built-in cabinetry and a very long to-do list of repairs. \u201cLet\u2019s say this, we were the ugliest house on the block,\u201d Ms. Hobby-Bishop, 36, a storyboard artist, said of the five-bedroom bungalow.But she and Mr. Bishop, 46, also a storyboard artist, set out to restore the house to its once-respectable state on a $100,000 budget. Rather than hire a general contractor, Ms. Hobby-Bishop oversaw the work and relied on a skilled handyman, Manuel Chavez, for many tasks. \u201cHe\u2019s my renovation guru,\u201d she said.Ms. Hobby-Bishop devotes hours to tasks like sourcing old-growth wood to match the existing wood, or arguing with window installers over how to replace a 100-year-old pane of broken glass so it has the same seasoned look as the other panes. \u201cYou have to fight for the character,\u201d she said.If your house is old enough \u2014 built, say, before the American Revolution \u2014 character is unavoidable. \u201cNothing is square, nothing is even, no window is the same size,\u201d said Lindsay DiGiacomo, 35, whose 1756 Mendham Township, N.J., four-bedroom home still has its original windows. Forget sash pulleys; hers are held open with wooden pegs.The house, which Mrs. DiGiacomo owns with her husband, Brian DiGiacomo, 43, a lawyer, has three fireplaces, one with a built-in bread oven and a caldron to boil water. \u201cIt\u2019s so \u2018Little House on the Prairie,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf you go into my attic, the beams that hold up the ceiling are a legitimate tree with bark still on it.\u201dThe couple\u2019s two young sons like to drop bits of \u201ctreasure\u201d into the cracks between the wide, unfinished plank floors. With a flashlight, the DiGiacomos can spot other artifacts beneath the floorboards, perhaps deposited by other children decades ago.Mrs. DiGiacomo has uncovered her own treasures, including a tackle box stored in the attic that held letters, some written in the late 18th century by two brothers named, oddly enough, Will and Bill; a 19th-century receipt for a horse carriage; an election ballot from 1880; and guidelines for how to operate a distillery, once part of the now three-acre property.Modern conveniences like recessed lighting or an open floor plan are not options in a house this old. \u201cEverything that you do, you have to think about \u2014 and really, really think about it,\u201d Mrs. DiGiacomo said. \u201cWill this work for this space? What\u2019s behind this wall?\u201dWhen the 60-year-old wood-shake roof needed to be replaced, Mrs. DiGiacomo had to hunt down a supplier in Canada who could make the shingles and then try to find someone who knew how to handle such a project. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a research-aholic,\u201d she said.Spend enough time trying to figure out what is behind a wall, and eventually you get good at it, even if you didn\u2019t think you ever would. Or at least, that is what I have been told.\u201cWe had no idea what we were getting into,\u201d said Ms. Wroblewski, 44. The roof, foundation and fireplace all needed repairs. \u201cWe thought the work would be a chore, but that it would be worth it in the long run.\u201dInstead, Ms. Wroblewski discovered that she actually liked the process. The turning point came, she said, when the couple removed salmon-covered asbestos shingles from the exterior, revealing gorgeous Victorian cedar shingles beneath. \u201cIt looked like a dollhouse,\u201d Ms. Wroblewski said. \u201cIt was a magnificent thing.\u201dAfter that, they were hooked. \u201cWhen you realize that with the right people you can bring a house back to life and back to its stately place in the town, it feels like a good use of my energy,\u201d she said. It also helps that she found a good contractor.In 2016, the couple moved with their two children to a six-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot house built in 1894 on Upper Mountain Avenue, a grand road of stately homes in Montclair. The house, Ms. Wroblewski said, \u201cis untouched by the passage of time.\u201dTime did, however, leave its mark on the boiler and air-conditioning system \u2014 neither worked when the family moved into the $1.289 million home. A structural beam also needed immediate attention. But where an unseasoned homeowner might be visited by a panic attack, Ms. Wroblewski sees a project. \u201cI never thought I was this person,\u201d she said.As for me, I\u2019m still not convinced I\u2019m that person.Advertisement"}

The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge. But that\u2019s OK \u2013 persuading customers to pay more arguably requires as much genius as getting people to adopt the technology in the first place.\u201dAmazonCritics cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:Amazon.com is going gangbusters. But some of the nearly $700 billion internet retailer\u2019s fastest-expanding \u2013 and most profitable \u2013 businesses could be ones that irritate users. Over time, that could sully the company\u2019s image.AlphabetCritics cornerJennifer Saba of Breakingviews:Alphabet is stuck at the letter G. The holding company of Google was created to safeguard against conventionality and let moonshot ideas, like self-driving cars, flourish. Almost three years in, it\u2019s basically still just Google. Which means, in turn, that the A in Alphabet stands mainly for advertising.It wouldn\u2019t hurt Alphabet to put more energy into revenue sources that don\u2019t start with a G.Why now\u2022 Walt Disney\u2019s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.Critics cornerTara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly:\u201cCBS isn\u2019t safe from the industry\u2019s broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom won\u2019t provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities. Those synergies may amount to some $500 million based on what past deals have yielded, according to Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. That could create quite a lift for CBS\u2019s earnings.\u201dBelinda Johnson is moving up. Laurence Tosi is moving out. And don\u2019t expect the company to go public this year.Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company\u2019s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis.Between the linesThe context The company lineHere\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson:\u201cShe takes critical functions that might be seen as constraints in other companies, and clears a path so they can become competitive advantages and facilitate the growth of the business.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies:\u201cHaving worked with Belinda over the years and at Airbnb, I have been consistently impressed by her ability to anticipate issues and leverage strategic opportunities. She combines technical expertise with great care for her colleagues.\u201dAnd here\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi:\u201cHe helped Airbnb establish a rigorous financial discipline, aided our expansion into new businesses including into luxury rentals, which is now one of our core businesses, and helped us develop new and innovative ways to grow Airbnb and our businesses.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSome of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook.Facebook\u2019s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe.The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook\u2019s future growth. The company\u2019s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe\u2019s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States\u2019, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.That\u2019s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin\u2019s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg.The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday.More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex.\u201cThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,\u201d said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. \u201cIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.\u201dThe digital money flyaroundDetails, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point.The contextWhile a potential joint venture between Alphabet and Aramco isn\u2019t necessarily connected to the latter company\u2019s IPO, if a deal is struck before the offering, advisers to the company could pitch the pact as a way for investors to bake in technology valuations.It isn\u2019t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company \u2014 and therefore command a higher multiple \u2014 but it\u2019d be interesting to see bankers make that argument.\u2014 Stephen GrocerFrom the release:\u201cI am excited to join NEA because they understand how to work with visionary entrepreneurs to build successful technology and health care enterprises,\u201d Immelt said. \u201cI have a passion for these sectors and I am eager to work with NEA and its partners to develop great businesses, nurture talented leaders and grow diverse teams.\u201dand:\u201cJeff is deeply knowledgeable about the complex global innovation landscape we\u2019re operating in today and he understands how businesses must evolve to compete and win in that environment, particularly across industrial and medical technologies,\u201d said Scott Sandell, Managing General Partner, NEA.(Worth noting: Mr. Immelt\u2019s successor at G.E. is struggling to turn that company around. See below.)\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s where our colleague Peter Eavis says investors should focus:Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Today\u2019s a big day for tech earningsThe Treasury secretary argued that the cuts would eventually pay for themselves, but conceded that it wouldn\u2019t happen this year.The policy flyaroundAnalysts\u2019 takes:\u2022 Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch write, \u201cThis shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.\u201d\u2022 Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \u201cIn short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell\u2019s first press conference.\u201d\u2022 Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton said, \u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation.\u201dAnalysts over at Deutsche Bank think so. They wrote in a research note yesterday:As the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), G.E. increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.G.E. is the last survivor of the index\u2019s 12 original components from when it started in 1896, and has been in it continuously for more than 110 years.\u201cWe will be looking at how the company, from the board on down, handles the allegations,\u201d said Karen Wells, who directs the investigations and enforcement bureau at the state gambling commission.She said allegations in the settlement agreement weren\u2019t disclosed before the commission granted Wynn a license in September 2014, or at any point before The Wall Street Journal report.Shares in Wynn Resorts fell more than 3 percent yesterday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russians Bought Bank Accounts From California Man, Mueller Says", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a lucrative business. For several years, Richard Pinedo, a Southern California computer science major, would open bank accounts in his name and sell them online to shadowy purchasers for cash. In other cases, he served as a middle man, buying accounts in other people\u2019s names and flipping them on the internet.The operation was illegal, \u201cdesigned to circumvent the security features of large online digital payment companies,\u201d according to court papers. The company Mr. Pinedo set up, Auction Essistance, brought in tens of thousands of dollars between 2014 and December 2017.Some of that business, it now appears, was done with a Russian operation that used social media platforms to sow political discord around the 2016 presidential election.The connection was apparently unwitting. Mr. Pinedo\u2019s lawyer, Jeremy I. Lessem, said in an interview that Mr. Pinedo had no knowledge of his clients\u2019 identities or motivations and \u201caccepted full responsibility\u201d for his actions. Mr. Pinedo had no connection to Mr. Trump, his company or his campaign, the lawyer said.\u201cTo the extent that Mr. Pinedo\u2019s actions assisted any individuals, including foreign nationals, with interfering in the American presidential election, it was done completely without his knowledge or understanding,\u201d Mr. Lessem said.In a rare statement, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, backed up that assessment. He said that prosecutors had \u201cno evidence and there is no allegation he was a witting participant in the Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. elections and political processes.\u201dA knock at the ranch-style home where Mr. Pinedo lives in suburban Santa Paula went unanswered on Friday.According to prosecutors, Mr. Pinedo obtained thousands of bank account numbers by registering accounts in his own name or buying them in the names of others online.Many of the accounts used stolen American identities, the authorities said. Though Mr. Pinedo \u201cwas not directly involved in the registration of these accounts using stolen identities,\u201d they wrote, \u201che willfully and intentionally avoided learning about the use of stolen identities.\u201dAnd though he did not know the precise identity of his Russian clients, Mr. Pinedo \u201cfrequently\u201d bought and sold account numbers with people he knew were outside the United States, the prosecutors said.Several of those account numbers were ultimately sold to Russians involved in the election influence operation, the documents show. They were used by the Russians to open PayPal accounts and allowed the Russians to get around company security measures meant to verify the identity of account holders.The PayPal accounts were then used to make purchases, including on social media accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based operation at the center of the Russian disinformation campaign. In total, the Russians obtained and used 14 bank account numbers between June 2016 and March 2017. It is unclear how many were purchased from Mr. Pinedo.\u201cSome PayPal accounts were used to purchase advertisements on Facebook\u201d promoting fake social media accounts created by the Russians, the papers said.Their goal, as has now been well documented, was to sow discord in the American political process. And it included efforts designed to aid the presidential candidacy of Donald J. Trump and hurt that of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\u201cWe offer services that will enable you to get back onto eBay or Amazon ranging from pre-made eBay & Paypal accounts or verification tools,\u201d the site said. \u201cWe guarantee our accounts are legitimate and not hacked or stolen like most other sellers offer.\u201dAt the time he was running Auction Essistance, Mr. Pinedo also appears to have been working as a marketing director of SEO Distortion, a digital marketing company, according to a LinkedIn page bearing his name that was taken down late Friday. According to that profile, Mr. Pinedo received an associate degree in computer science from Ventura College in 2009.\u201cRicky Pinedo is not your typical person who has a love for technology or is computer crazed,\u201d it reads. \u201cHis ever-changing need for more advanced challenges and goals had spawned the beginning of starting a company that hones in on bringing businesses to the world wide web.\u201dLouis Keene contributed reporting from Santa Paula, Calif.

{"Headline": "The Rich Have Abandoned Rich-People Rugs", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "Persians? That\u2019s Paul Manafort money! Now rich people are trying not to spend millions on something that they and their little dogs walk over.Supported byEven in an increasingly expensive Manhattan, $3.5 million still pays for a lot, like a 2,000-square-foot apartment (without south-facing light) and 12 years of private school for one of the children. But if you\u2019d like to outfit the living room of that apartment with the very finest Persian carpet Jason Nazmiyal is selling out of his Midtown showroom, you\u2019ll need an additional $3.5 million.For decades, antique Persians, hand-knotted from silk and often taking years or even decades to produce, were the gold standard of floor coverings for the swank, the sine qua non of Oriental rugs. Then the market got flooded with fakes, tastes shifted, and people became aware that most of what they were being sold was as likely to return a profit as a decade-old flat screen TV.\u201cI selected it from the catalog,\u201d Mr. Talley said. \u201cI knew it was going to be just the thing for my living room, which by the way has Truman Capote\u2019s famous Victorian sofa, with an exotic palm-tree pattern.\u201dOne of the claims in the 30-page indictment involved a series of excursions to an antique rugs dealer based in Alexandria, Va., where Mr. Manafort is said to have spent $934,000 in eight transactions between 2008 and 2010.\u201cI\u2019m imagining a lot of gold-plated stuff and pseudotapestries,\u201d said Wendy Goodman, the design editor of New York magazine. \u201cNeedlepoint faux 14th-century furniture and bath curtains in silk taffeta that the Manaforts were told was water-repellent. What do you think the interior of the cars look like? Was it sheer fur?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it was kosher,\u201d Mr. Nazmiyal said, echoing the opinions of more than half a dozen other Persian carpet experts. \u201cIf you want to buy jewelry and you\u2019re going to spend a million dollars, you go to see Faberg\u00e9, you go to Cartier and Tiffany. When you go to a local, neighborhood store for rare and expensive rugs, in all probability that dealer is going to contact a dealer in a big metropolitan area to get it on consignment and bring it to you. That drives the price up. There\u2019s more hands involved. People hear about it.\u201dMr. Manafort wasn\u2019t even a fixture on the auction scene, a typical stomping ground for those looking for deals on highly collectible pieces.It was purchased by the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha for $33.74 million, but turned out to be an outlier.Shortly afterward, Ms. Otsea retired and Sotheby\u2019s shut down the American wing of its rug department. (There are still carpet specialists based in London.) \u201cThere was a time 15 or 20 years ago where if you were decorating a Fifth Avenue apartment you would buy a $100,000 antique Persian rug,\u201d Ms. Otsea said. \u201cBut the audience for that tapered off so much.\u201dBlame our increasingly casual culture, one in which the perfect pair of jeans replaced the ornate Christian Lacroix gown as a status object. There has in fact been a 40-year move toward folkloric, less formal carpets. Wool is the new silk. Established imperfections are part of the sales pitch.The film director Joel Schumacher was part of the first wave of design geeks collecting Navajo rugs, which started becoming more popular in the 1970s.\u201cI got to Hollywood as a costume designer, and one of the things you do as a costume designer is shop all the time,\u201d Mr. Schumacher said. Around the time he was outfitting Diane Keaton for \u201cSleeper,\u201d Mr. Schumacher walked into an antiques store and spotted a chandelier wrapped in what turned out to be a Navajo rug. \u201cI said to the guy, \u2018Could I buy the rug?\u2019\u201d Mr. Schumacher said. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, I use that as padding.\u2019\u201dIt took just $50 to wear the shopkeeper down, and Mr. Schumacher got hooked (no pun intended).He loved the way the kaleidoscopic geometrics looked with wicker furniture and books strewn all over the place. So he bought more and more Navajos, plunking the larger ones on the floor, the midsize ones on top of beds and the smallest over banisters and pool chairs.Andy Warhol and Ralph Lauren began collecting Navajo rugs, too. Sotheby\u2019s held auctions for them. Still, prices remained relatively close to earth, at least compared to Persian rugs.The asking price was $20,000; he paid half that, in cash.In the early 2000s, ABC Carpet on lower Broadway ushered in its own major rug trend, selling Orientals that had been dyed in bright colors like pink, blue, red or silver. Seemingly every well-off woman who relied on Jennifer Aniston for hairspiration had one.Prices for a large living room rug typically start at about $21,000, though six-figure carpets are not unheard-of, said Ms. Provisor, showing off a 150-knot wild silk rug with metallic soumak that she once made for a client in a custom size (17 feet by 18 feet) for $147,000.\u201cSome of them have held their value,\u201d Ms. Provisor said.Today, the most obvious trend in upscale carpeting is the Moroccan Berber rug, which is not, though it may appear that way, a discovery by trust-funded Brooklyn millennials or the design firm Roman and Williams.In the early 2000s they began popping up in European design magazines. The designer Jenna Lyons plunked down a few thousand dollars at Nazmiyal for a shaggy six-foot-wide, brown-and-white, diamond-patterned Beni Ourain (named after the nomadic tribespeople of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco who make them).They were shaggy enough to stage orgies on, but not so louche as to turn anyone into a 21st-century Austin Powers.\u201cFor four or five thousand dollars, you could get a good one,\u201d Mr. Korban said. \u201cPeople went to Morocco and brought them back. They were on eBay and 1stdibs. With a Serge Mouille sconce and a fig tree, your house looked like the C\u00e9line showroom. Now, I think it\u2019s a bit of a Domino magazine-Whole Foods clich\u00e9. No offense to anyone who has them, but on to the next.\u201d\u201cThe knockoffs are the worst,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I understand the desire for a uniform. It\u2019s easy, it\u2019s foolproof, and it\u2019s great for most people who don\u2019t want to spend tons of money.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the decade when ABC Carpet and Home ushered in the trend of dyed Oriental rugs.

{"Headline": "The Bowie You\u2019ve Never Seen", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "\u201cDavid Bowie Is,\u201d an exhibition that unveils the rock icon\u2019s complete artistry, expands as it arrives at its final stop: the city he called home.David Bowie loved Little Richard. Many artists of his era did, of course, but Bowie was so enamored, the legend goes, that he brought a photograph of the flamboyant rock \u2019n\u2019 roll pioneer into the studio whenever he was recording. In 1982, when he made \u201cLet\u2019s Dance,\u201d his biggest-selling album, he and his collaborator Nile Rodgers first spent a week going on \u201can artistic quest\u201d to museums and record archives, Mr. Rodgers said, in search of inspiration. Then one day Bowie produced an image of Little Richard in a red suit getting into a red convertible. \u201cNile, darling, this is what I want my record to sound like,\u201d he said.Mr. Yokobosky, in partnership with the Victoria and Albert curators Victoria Broackes and Geoffrey Marsh, aimed to oblige, scouring eBay for rare vinyl singles and programming the bubble lights that spell out BOWIE in the entrance to appear as they were last seen, in a series of pop-up concerts in New York in 2002. The material is culled from a collection of about 80,000 artifacts maintained by Bowie\u2019s archivist, Sandra Hirshkowitz. Notable pieces like the delicate backdrop from his 1980 performance on Broadway in \u201cThe Elephant Man,\u201d and his large assemblage of fan art are both included in the exhibition. It\u2019s laid out first biographically \u2014 the early years of David Jones, his given name, with drawings he made of his parents, and the same kind of saxophone that was his first musical instrument \u2014 and then thematically, tracking Bowie, the stage name he gave himself in 1965, through his many evolutions, jumpsuit by mesmerizing jumpsuit.Mr. Yokobosky, also the director of exhibition design for the Brooklyn Museum, foregrounded the costumes, and added sections focusing on Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded \u201cYoung Americans,\u201d and New York, as well as flourishes like lighting in the shape of a lightning bolt.Here are recollections from Bowie\u2019s friends and colleagues, whose joint projects are featured in the exhibition.Mr. Yamamoto, a Japanese designer, recalled getting a call in the middle of the night in Tokyo from a producer who was working with Bowie as he was staging his first concert in New York as Ziggy Stardust, in 1972 at Carnegie Hall. There\u2019s something interesting going on here, the producer said. Come see it. Mr. Yamamoto flew in the next day, and went directly to the show.\u201cWhen I saw him for the first time, I felt like his world or aesthetics were surging upon the whole theater,\u201d Mr. Yamamoto wrote in an email, via a translator. They met soon after, and collaborated for years, including on a one-legged knit \u201cZiggy Stardust\u201d jumpsuit and an embroidered silk bikini and short kimono for \u201cAladdin Sane.\u201dThe black-and-white jumpsuit with the bowed legs is stiffer and heavier-looking in person than it is in photographs: Bowie somehow wore it lightly. (It unsnaps along the sleeve and sides to go on.) \u201cWhat I created was rather planar compared to European clothes,\u201d Mr. Yamamoto said. \u201cI designed them, figuring out a way so that he looked larger than his real size or more solid, like costumes of Noh or Kabuki.\u201d His pieces were also created for Hikinuki, the Kabuki technique of a quick costume change onstage.Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.This meeting of Eastern and Western culture was rare then, he said. \u201cI think a mysterious chemical reaction was triggered to occur in the mixture of the different natures. I don\u2019t think the same thing would possibly happen again. It was,\u201d he said, a \u201cprecious encounter.\u201dIn most cases Bowie did his own makeup. \u201cI have loads of pictures of him backstage getting himself ready, in ridiculous extravagant costumes, having a drink in a plastic cup,\u201d Mr. Rock said. After Bowie traveled to Japan and met Kabuki performers, \u201chis makeup got even more exotic. This Japanese makeup was like little pots, there was a lot of little powders involved, all carefully laid out, ready to go,\u201d before a show, \u201calong with the cigarette packs, and maybe a banana or two.\u201dHe was \u201csurprisingly organized. I remember one day up at his office, I was hanging out, and he showed me these rows of tapes that he had of his live shows. He was certainly doing it from the Ziggy days.\u201d He added: \u201cThere was a certain lunacy, if you like, to his vision, but it turned out not to be so lunatic. Whatever it was that drove him inside, he was working well ahead of the pack, and he stayed there, right until the end.\u201d\u201cDavid called me and he said, \u2018I think you can read minds,\u2019\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I can\u2019t read minds, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019\u201dHe was always interested in hoaxes, she said. He instructed her to sit by her fax machine with a pen and a piece of paper, and when he called to put the phone down. They were to wordlessly draw for one minute, then fax the results to each other. (It was 1998.)\u201cI thought, this is a waste of time, but I really liked David a lot, so I was like, O.K., I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Ms. Anderson said, \u201cand the first one that came through, was kind of breathtaking.\u201d Their sketches had notable similarities, words and squiggles in the same place on the page. They each made 10 total.\u201cI kind of loved them,\u201d Ms. Anderson said, \u201cbecause they were really strange rhymes.\u201d\u201cI think he understood happiness and pleasure really well,\u201d she said, \u201cand also, he wasn\u2019t pushing difficult stuff away. As an artist, he loved stuff that had real pain in it. I thought of him as such a successful human being.\u201dAt the height of his Ziggy Stardust fame, Bowie claimed he was retiring. In the spring of 1973, Mr. Yokobosky said, he was invited to create an episode of a new NBC late-night program \u201cMidnight Special.\u201d \u201cIt was an experiment, to see if people would watch TV after Johnny Carson,\u201d Mr. Yokobosky said. Bowie was in the midst of writing \u201cwhat he hoped would be a musical version of \u20181984,\u2019\u201d though he never got the rights to Orwell\u2019s book. So the title of Bowie\u2019s variety special, \u201cThe 1980 Floor Show,\u201d became a play on \u201c1984.\u201dNatasha Korniloff\u2019s threaded cobweb and gold body suit, with the black-manicured hands cupping the chest, was originally even skimpier: There was a jockstrap and a third hand at the crotch area that was censored by NBC, and removed \u2014 nobody knows what became of it. The costume was remade to add the one-legged and very small booty shorts. (In some of these costumes, the waist is 23 inches.)Ms. Korniloff was the costume designer for \u201cPierrot in Turquoise,\u201d a late-60s English stage show that Bowie appeared in with his early mentor, the British mime and dancer Lindsay Kemp. Mr. Kemp later wrote that Bowie was simultaneously having an affair with both of them.The white silk-and-satin suit, above, is by Freddie Burretti, Bowie\u2019s longtime tailor, whom he met at a London gay club, and who went on to make many of Bowie\u2019s most elegant ensembles \u2014 and the turquoise lightning bolt jumpsuit.Makiko Inoue contributed translations from Tokyo.Jan. 11, 2016Jan. 16, 2016March 22, 2013Jan. 14, 2016Jan. 14, 2016Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Go-for-Broke Renovation", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Location9 PhotosIn any renovation, there is the dream and then there is the reality \u2014 and the two are often worlds apart. Such was the case when Josh Lapidus and Tara Consi bought a three-story brick townhouse in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, built in the 1890s, with plans to add a fourth floor for a new master suite.After closing on the home for about $1.7 million in April 2013, they called in an engineer who delivered a stomach-churning report.\u201cThe whole south-facing wall was crumbling,\u201d said Ms. Consi, 45, a stay-at-home mother who once worked for the interior designer Miles Redd. \u201cAll the beams and joists were cracked and bowed. The brick in the party wall had become like flour.\u201dMr. Lapidus, 44, a high school teacher at the Urban Assembly Maker Academy, added: \u201cWe basically found out that the house was falling down.\u201dThe news was especially distressing because the property was supposed to be a spacious upgrade from their previous home, a 13-foot-wide townhouse around the corner that they bought in 2004 for about $1.25 million.That house \u201cwas super-charming,\u201d Ms. Consi said, with 19th-century woodwork, plaster crown molding and decorative marble fireplaces. But over time, they began to feel squeezed by its narrow layout as their children, Delila, now 13, and Parker, now 11, grew up.\u201cEverything was awkward,\u201d Mr. Lapidus said. The front door opened directly into the living room, the dining table had to be parked against one wall of the kitchen and dragged out for dinner every night, and the children\u2019s bedrooms were two stories above their bathroom, with no closets.Mr. Lapidus and Ms. Consi had spent years looking at bigger houses nearby, and had made numerous offers, but were outbid every time. Resigned to staying put, they hired Mr. Coburn to develop plans to renovate their matchbox-size home shortly before stumbling upon their new house.At 18 feet wide, it offered the generous spaces they longed for and appeared to need a renovation that was mostly cosmetic, along with the addition. But after they discovered the structural problems, their renovation budget of $900,000 ballooned to about $1.3 million, and the timeline grew to more than two years.\u201cI definitely wanted all of the traditional touches\u201d for the interior architecture, said Ms. Consi, who planned to furnish the house with vintage midcentury-modern and contemporary pieces.Ms. Consi had been so smitten with the woodwork in their old home that she cut away a piece of window trim and removed a staircase spindle so they could be copied for the new townhouse, reinstalling the originals before putting the house on the market.To create the storage space the family\u2019s previous home lacked, Mr. Coburn designed extensive built-in cabinetry and shelving, including a bar hidden behind paneling between the living room and the kitchen, a workstation with integrated desks in the family room and a bookcase that wraps around a home office doorway. The children also have generous closets behind pocket doors.Mr. Coburn added the new top floor for the master suite under a standing-seam copper mansard roof, which brought the size of the four-bedroom, three-bathroom home to about 2,700 square feet.To furnish the rooms, Ms. Consi spent months scouring stores and websites like Etsy, Chairish, 1stdibs and eBay, in search of pieces both old and new, including a midcentury dining table by Arne Vodder, 1950s Arteluce lamps and a new Oscar sofa from SCP, with guidance from Ms. Hammond. \u201cShe really enjoyed the digging,\u201d Ms. Hammond said. \u201cFinding the perfect pieces was a gradual process that lasted several years.\u201dThe family moved into their new home in September 2015, and sold their previous one for $2.35 million, which partially made up for the cost of the renovation.The process was a shock at the outset, but looking back, there isn\u2019t much they would change.\u201cWe have a brand-new, gorgeous house now,\u201d Ms. Consi said. \u201cEven though it was quite an experience going through this whole project, it turned out to be my dream house.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Ethical \u2018Dark Side\u2019: Harvard, Stanford and Others Want to Address It", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, in the wake of fake news and other troubles at tech companies, universities that helped produce some of Silicon Valley\u2019s top technologists are hustling to bring a more medicine-like morality to computer science.And at Stanford University, the academic heart of the industry, three professors and a research fellow are developing a computer science ethics course for next year. They hope several hundred students will enroll.The idea is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations \u2014 like autonomous weapons or self-driving cars \u2014 before those products go on sale.\u201cTechnology is not neutral,\u201d said Professor Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. \u201cThe choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications.\u201dBut until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning \u2014 computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Mr. Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-M.I.T. ethics course.\u201cA lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data,\u201d Professor Levy said. \u201cIf data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise.\u201dThe curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data \u2014 like whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records \u2014 to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Mr. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions like: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans?Some universities offer such programs in their information science, law or philosophy departments. At Stanford, the computer science department will offer the new ethics course, tentatively titled \u201cEthics, Public Policy and Computer Science.\u201dThe expectations for the course are running high in part because of Professor Sahami\u2019s popularity on campus. About 1,500 students take his introductory computer science course every year.Advertisement"}
