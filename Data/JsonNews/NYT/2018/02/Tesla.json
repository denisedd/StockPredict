{"Headline": "Car Navigation Systems Plot a Course Forward Against Phone Apps", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsHow do you get someone to pay hundreds of dollars for an inferior product, when most people already have a better one in their pocket?That\u2019s the problem facing carmakers trying to sell built-in navigation systems when superior alternatives such as Apple\u2019s Maps, Google Maps and Waze are available for free to anyone with a smartphone \u2014 which is almost everybody.And next-generation navigation systems are not just an important way for carmakers to interact with drivers. They are also a crucial step in the development of autonomous vehicles.Garmin and TomTom \u2014 companies that became best known for GPS units that sit atop the dash \u2014 are also major providers of mapping data and in-dash user interfaces to car manufacturers.TomTom is \u201ccollecting data on a large scale, learning how to aggregate it to spot trends in traffic for autonomous vehicles,\u201d its chief executive, Harold Goddijn, said. \u201cAll the car manufacturers will need to share that data.\u201dBut for now, many carmakers bundle their navigation systems with other features, forcing buyers to take one in order to get something else they actually want.Do you want your gauges to appear on a digital display, instead of a standard instrument panel, in your new vehicle? Buyers of certain trim levels of some Audi and Volvo models may have to purchase a bundle that includes navigation. Volvo charges an additional $1,400 in its XC60, while Audi\u2019s could cost as much as $3,000, depending on the vehicle.Buyers of Alfa Romeo\u2019s base Giulia model who want Sirius XM satellite radio must take the navigation system, too \u2014 at a cost of $1,900.\u201cThis business model is not sustainable,\u201d said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director of connected vehicles and services.Even with their limitations, in-dash systems have some advantages. They\u2019re convenient and uncluttered. There\u2019s no need to find a way to suspend a smartphone and its dangling charge cable in the middle of the instrument panel. They use a vehicle\u2019s built-in controls, and there\u2019s no danger of running out of power.But in-dash systems typically store data locally, meaning information may be inaccurate and outdated. Upgrading such systems can be difficult or even impossible. Even when it can be done, it can be a multistep process of downloading new data to a flash drive and then transferring it to the vehicle.In a recent test of a 2015 model-year car, the built-in navigation system had no listing for a winery that has been in business for 15 years. Both Apple Maps and Google Maps found it in a split second. That\u2019s because smartphone navigation apps are cloud based, continually updated with new information.But in-dash systems are closing the gap. On the way are products that are connected to the cloud and easily upgraded via an over-the-air data connection. Tesla uses over-the-air updates to occasionally renew its maps, while Ford has already used such updates to add CarPlay and Android Auto functionality to models with its Sync3 system.And soon, maps will rely not just on stored information but on constantly updated data gleaned from a vehicle\u2019s cameras and sensors and data from other drivers.\u201cPressure from Google Maps and Apple Maps made automobile manufacturers realize they have to step up with over-the-air updates of their maps and their software,\u201d Mr. Goddijn said.HERE\u2019s next-generation in-dash navigation technology will debut this year in Audi\u2019s new A8 sedan and the 2019 Porsche Cayenne. The A8 will, among other things, use HERE technology to learn a driver\u2019s route preferences, and then make more informed route suggestions.Drivers can use the HERE smartphone app at home to plan a route, which will be automatically transferred to the in-vehicle system. When the driver reaches his or her destination, the app will pick up from there for foot or public transit directions.Route-mapping will be handled on HERE\u2019s servers, which will take into account traffic conditions far off the planned path that could nevertheless affect navigation. In addition, map data will include not just the road itself but information on weather, curves, inclines, junctions and city limits, allowing the vehicle to adjust its speed accordingly.In-dash navigation systems will also use information gleaned from a vehicle\u2019s sensors and cameras to position a vehicle in a lane, with accuracy within eight inches.\u201cOur sensor technology will allow us to tell drivers to remain in one lane on a road for the fastest travel time,\u201d Mr. Butler, of Ford, said.Technology from TomTom will let drivers indicate whether they\u2019re looking for the fastest route, or the one with the least stop-and-go traffic, and be instructed accordingly. When a single vehicle using HERE technology passes over a pothole, it will be recorded and subsequent vehicles directed around it.HERE is already accumulating such passively derived road data from 500,000 vehicles across the world. Currently, the company is sharing its data with only its three big German owners. In the United States, about 14 percent of cars on the road have the sensors necessary to transmit road conditions, Mr. Butler said.With the development of autonomous vehicles, that sort of information becomes even more important, enabling a car to learn about road conditions from other vehicles and safely navigate around accidents, tie-ups, potholes and flash floods.\u201cCurrently, our in-dash navigation systems are at a disadvantage compared to smartphone apps,\u201d Mr. Butler said. \u201cBut soon, we\u2019ll be at an advantage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Bush said that with Mr. Immelt, the answer is yes.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing less marriage counseling with 12 adults,\u201d Mr. Bush said of his board, adding that Mr. Immelt would be a partner to take advice from (and occasionally whine to).An outside perspective\u201cWhat Jeff brings is an understanding of scale on a couple of dimensions, not only in terms of people and processes but also how you think about scaling with your partners.\u201d\u2014 Henry Ellenbogen of T.

But because the agreement gives both parties what they wanted most, the deficit impact appears to be of little concern. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Speaker Paul D. Ryan all quickly embraced it.\u201dCritics corner\u2022 Hard-line conservatives were unsparing in their assessment of the deal.\u2022 Representative Nancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats, said she could not agree to any budget deal that was not accompanied by a debate over legislation to protect the fate of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers.\u201cRevenue was $286 million, up 72 percent from a year earlier and about $30 million more than analysts had expected. Daily users rose nine million to 187 million, the best growth in over a year. The retention rate of new Android users, a special focus for Snap, jumped nearly 20 percent over the previous year.\u201d\u201cThe company lost $350 million in the quarter, or 13 cents a share, which was narrower than the loss of 16 cents that was expected by analysts. And it also contrasted with the carnage of the prior quarter, when Snap recorded a net loss that was twice the forecast.\u201dThe bigger pictureThe results have helped quell some of the concerns about the company\u2019s slowing revenue and user growth in the face of increased competition from the likes of Facebook.Critics cornerIn the early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump lamented that in the \u201cold days,\u201d stocks would rise on good economic news, saying \u201cToday, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake.\u201d The tweet did not elaborate on what he meant by the \u201cold days\u201d or explain further his analysis of why stocks plummeted on Friday and Monday.Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the fall was pegged to good economic news stems from Friday\u2019s job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment.\u2014 Michael D. Shear and Alan RappeportIn recent months, many powerful men have had to step down from senior positions as they have faced accusations of sexual harassment, but none were the head of a public company like Mr. Wynn. How would the board, shareholders, regulators, customers and unions react?We now know something about the shareholder perspective: Shares in Wynn Resorts were up 7 percent in early-morning trading today. Regulators in Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau are still conducting their own investigations.But the biggest unresolved question remains the board and its conduct.The board set up a committee of independent directors to carry out an investigation after the WSJ article, but it was not clear how rigorous it would be. The board did not have a track record for holding Mr. Wynn accountable.In an email exchange with me, Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard law professor and an expert in corporate governance, asked why the board did not suspend Mr. Wynn from his position pending the investigation, or demand that he not interact with Wynn Resorts employees, a step that would have limited his ability to influence the board investigation.One remaining way to assess the board\u2019s resolve will be Mr. Wynn\u2019s separation agreement, which is not yet finalized.When the WSJ article was published, Mr. Wynn denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, calling them \u201cpreposterous.\u201d On Tuesday he said, \u201cI have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity.\u201dIt is not clear why Mr. Wynn decided to step down. It may have been pressure from gaming regulators. Customers might have been pulling back.Mr. Wynn may have wanted to preserve the value of his own stake in Wynn Resorts. But as it stands, it does not look like the board was a strong force.\u2014 Peter EavisSteve Wynn has stepped down from his $17 billion casino empire, a little over a week after allegations of forced sex and other sexual misconduct claims emerged in a WSJ investigation.Top executives spent hours with Mr. Wynn going over plans for a new casino he would like to build in Las Vegas, according to a person familiar with the matter, while the company\u2019s general counsel hopped on a call with other executives to discuss the Vegas Strong Fund, a nonprofit formed in the aftermath of last year\u2019s mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, according to a person familiar with the call.He also attended the company\u2019s 1,500-guest Super Bowl party on Sunday, the WSJ says.In a statement, Mr. Wynn blamed his exit on \u201ca rush to judgment\u201d that took \u201cprecedence over everything, including the facts.\u201dThe big questions\u2022 Do other S. & P. 500 C.E.O.s now have something to fear?\u2022 And is the Wynn empire \u2014 from Las Vegas to Macau to, soon, Massachusetts \u2014 now ripe for a takeover or breakup?Critics\u2019 cornerLAT staff have chafed at the decisions of Tronc and its chairman, Michael Ferro. More from Sydney Ember of the NYT:Many employees at The Times have of late adopted the mantra \u201canyone but Ferro,\u201d but it is also not clear what decisions Dr. Soon-Shiong, who largely made his fortune selling generic drugs and developing a new type of cancer drug, will make as the paper\u2019s owner.The deals flyaroundAs the stocks calmly glided higher in 2017, investors from hedge fund titans to day traders poured billions in to bets that volatility would continue to fall.Those wagers blew up this week.Now investors are selling the exchange company behind the trading in volatility.Shares of the C.B.O.E. Global Markets, whose volatility index facilitated those wagers, are down 17 percent since the start of the sell-off. Thursday they are off 3 percent.Critics cornerBlame the VIX/machines/debt?\u2022 Steven Mnuchin suggested yesterday that algorithms might be behind the whipsawing: \u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions.\u201dOn one side: Brian Chesky, the home rental giant\u2019s co-founder and C.E.O., who wants it kept private a while yet.More from Olivia Zaleski:Despite pledging support for Chesky\u2019s desire to keep Airbnb private, Sequoia Capital partner Alfred Lin, along with Jeff Jordan of Andreessen Horowitz, wanted to explore the possibility. In December, they asked Michael Grimes, the head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, to present options for going public, said people close to the bank.Ultimately, Mr. Tosi \u2014 who didn\u2019t see eye to eye with Mr. Chesky on other issues and generally did not fit in at Airbnb \u2014 resigned.An Airbnb spokesman denied there was ever any intent to pursue an I.P.O. this year.The tech flyaroundMr. Carstens also argued that cryptocurrencies were freeloading on existing financial infrastructure and the legitimacy that came from being linked to it.Most digital currencies are unlikely to survive in their current form, and investors should prepare for coins to lose all their value as they\u2019re replaced by a small set of future competitors, Goldman\u2019s Steve Strongin said in a report dated Feb. 5.\u201cCrazy things can come true.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Slack\u2019s C.F.O.

{"Headline": "California Today: Earthquake Insurance Sales Spiked in 2017", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.For years, scientists have warned that we are due for a major earthquake. But getting Californians to buy earthquake insurance was a difficult sell \u2014 only around 10 percent of households in the state have it.Then came the natural disasters of 2017. Glenn Pomeroy, chief executive of the California Earthquake Authority, the nonprofit organization that oversees the insurance program, says that fires and mudslides in California, the flooding in Houston, and the earthquakes in Mexico all helped persuade many more Californians to sign up.Last year the earthquake authority saw a record increase of 90,000 new customers, compared with an average annual increase of 7,000 over the previous decade.The \u201chorrible run of natural catastrophes,\u201d Mr. Pomeroy said in an interview, \u201ccrystallized people\u2019s thinking about the need to be protected.\u201dAll of this would seem to be good news for California \u2014 more people insured presumably means a steadier recovery after an earthquake.Yet the increase came with unintended consequences. For reasons related to the way the earthquake authority is capitalized, the sharp increase in customers means the authority has to buy more reinsurance \u2014 the insurance that insurance companies buy for themselves to spread risk. This means the authority will be forced to raise rates around 2 to 4 percent annually, according to Mr. Pomeroy.\u201cWe are on the horns of a dilemma,\u201d Mr. Pomeroy said. \u201cIf we keep growing at rates that we are now growing there\u2019s going to come a day when we are going to have start raising rates to the point where it will then become unaffordable again.\u201dLast month in a speech to the authority\u2019s governing board, Mr. Pomeroy sketched out an idea for a \u201cbackstop\u201d that would impose an \u201cextremely small\u201d assessment on all Californian homeowners with insurance, not just those with earthquake insurance, in the case of a very large earthquake. That would help bring rates down, he said.

{"Headline": "Stocks Plunge as Market Enters \u2018Correction\u2019 Territory", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter watching stocks march higher for nearly nine years, investors are suddenly confronting a new reality: The long, smooth ride is over. And it doesn\u2019t feel good.Major stock indexes suffered a steep drop in late trading on Thursday, the second-straight day that stocks dived shortly before the markets closed. The 3.75 percent decline pushed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down more than 10 percent from its peak in late January. That means the market is technically in correction territory \u2014 a term used to indicate that a downward trend is more severe than simply a few days of bearish trading.\u201cWe\u2019ve been trained that the market does nothing but go up,\u201d Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said of investors. \u201cAnd then suddenly, they\u2019re anxious, they\u2019re sitting nervously on the sidelines, and then they can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dTrying to pinpoint the exact reasons for the last week\u2019s tumble is a fool\u2019s errand. But the most likely culprit appears to be fear that central banks will increase interest rates in an effort to fend off inflation and ensure that fast-growing economies don\u2019t overheat. Those fears were stoked Thursday when the Bank of England warned that it might raise interest rates faster than investors had expected.The past week has offered a vivid illustration of how, in a market dominated by fast-moving, computerized trading strategies, things can go from good to bad in the blink of an eye. Last Thursday, markets were on an epic winning streak. But a bad day last Friday was followed by more selling, which begot more and more selling.In addition to the S.&P. 500\u2019s drop on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.15 percent. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index \u2014 a measure of the choppiness of markets \u2014 surged by 21 percent.The S.&P. 500 crested at 2,872.87 on Jan. 26. Since then, it has fallen almost 10.2 percent, or 292 points, to close at 2,581 Thursday.The sell-off continued in Asia on Friday. Shanghai\u2019s stock market was down about 4 percent midday, while shares in Hong Kong and Tokyo had fallen more than 3 percent. Futures contracts that track stocks in the United States traded erratically, suggesting that the markets on Friday could be in for another day of uncertainty.The market correction does not mean that the bull market in stocks \u2014 which have been roaring since March 2009 \u2014 is over. Markets also experienced a correction in early 2016 before shaking off their jitters and continuing to climb.Indeed, such ups and downs are routine in most market environments. What makes the past week feel different is that an eerie calm had blanketed markets for the previous year.Noah Weisberger, a managing director at AB Bernstein, said that over the past few decades, a 10 percent drop would normally happen every 18 months or so.\u201cIt\u2019s disquieting, it feels terrible, it\u2019s eye-popping when you look at the screen, but it doesn\u2019t yet tell you that something is broken,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a change in behavior relative to 2017, but then again, 2017 is an anomalous period with incredibly low volatility in the market, a very smooth glide-path higher.\u201dVolatility is back \u2014 with a vengeance. Among the reasons for that is the rise of computer-driven trading, which can accelerate the pace of upward or downward price movements. When algorithms pick up \u201csell\u201d signals, they can instantly shift trading strategies and move billions of dollars.\u201cThat\u2019s probably partly why you\u2019re seeing these big swings in the market,\u201d said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush, an investment firm. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s being driven by human hands.\u201dThe long bull market \u2014 stocks were up more than 300 percent at their peak in late January \u2014 has been underpinned, in part, by the extraordinary efforts of the world\u2019s central bankers to re-energize growth in the aftermath of the American financial crisis and the deep global recession that followed.Those efforts helped push interest rates to the lowest levels since World War II, making the safest investments unappetizing and prodding investors toward the stock market.In the face of broad global growth, some think the central banks will raise interest rates faster than previously expected, eroding a crucial source of confidence that the stock market climb would continue.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.Earlier Thursday, the Bank of England said as much, strengthening its forecasts for economic growth and stating that it may have to raise interest rates \u201csomewhat earlier and to a somewhat greater extent than we thought in November.\u201dThat statement sent up interest rates \u2014 or yields \u2014 on British government bonds, known as gilts.Yields on Treasuries followed suit, rising as high as 2.88 percent before retreating slightly. The sight of yields on United States government bonds approaching 3 percent seemed to give the markets pause.Higher government bond yields can make it more expensive for individuals, companies and governments to borrow money. They serve, for example, as the foundation for the interest rates that banks charge on fixed-rate mortgages.Investors are trying to figure out whether the global economy can keep growing at its current pace if rates rise \u2014 a concern that is contributing to the recent swings in stock prices.But there\u2019s reason to be optimistic about the economy\u2019s resilience.Government data released on Thursday showed that claims for unemployment insurance in the United States remained low, near levels not seen since the early 1970s. That suggests unemployment \u2014 which was 4.1 percent in January \u2014 is likely to remain low in the near future.Corporate profits also appear solid.But some of the biggest losers in Thursday\u2019s rout were stocks that had done well this year. Canada Goose, for example, which had been up more than 20 percent this year, sank 16.6 percent. Tesla, which had climbed 10.8 percent this year, fell 8.6 percent.Other hard-hit stocks belonged to companies that could be vulnerable to inflation because rising prices could pinch their profits.On Thursday, the underwear and sock behemoth Hanesbrands saw its shares tumble nearly 11 percent, making it the worst-performing stock in the S.&P. 500. Early in the day, the company offered a weaker than expected forecast for the year because of rising prices for commodities \u2014 although the company\u2019s chief executive noted that Hanesbrands would try to pass on some of those costs to customers.Even the most successful companies could not dodge Thursday\u2019s carnage. Shares of Apple fell 2.75 percent, knocking more than $22 billion off its market value.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Google\u2019s Bosses Became \u2018Unpumped\u2019 About Uber", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, used to be like brothers. Google invested in Uber. The internet giant\u2019s top lawyer even served on Uber\u2019s board of directors.But that \u201cbig brother, little brother\u201d relationship deteriorated into paranoia as both companies pursued the creation of autonomous vehicles, Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former chief executive, said on Wednesday.The dissolution of Uber\u2019s relationship with Google demonstrates the finicky nature of the ties that bind \u2014 or break \u2014 tech conglomerates and promising start-ups.It\u2019s something Google understands well. Years ago, Google was tightly aligned with Apple. But the relationship soured as Google started developing smartphone software. Steve Jobs, who was Apple\u2019s chief executive, rightly believed that Google\u2019s Android would become a competitive threat to the iPhone.When Google initially invested in Uber in 2013, Larry Page, Google\u2019s chief executive at the time, and David Drummond, Alphabet\u2019s top lawyer, were mentors, Mr. Kalanick said. Alphabet remains an investor in Uber.The two companies, he said, had a \u201clittle brother, big brother\u201d dynamic because Uber was \u201ctrying to get more of their time than they were willing to give.\u201dAfter Mr. Page repeatedly spurned meetings to discuss combining Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service with Google\u2019s work on self-driving vehicles in some sort of partnership, Mr. Kalanick said, his company started to develop its own autonomous car technology.Uber hired a team of robotics experts from Carnegie Mellon University, deepening the division between the two companies.\u201cGenerally, Google was super not happy, unpumped about us doing this,\u201d said Mr. Kalanick, who stepped down as Uber\u2019s chief executive in June. He recalled that Mr. Page had been \u201cangsty\u201d and asked him: \u201cWhy are you doing my thing?\u201dAs Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Levandowski discussed ways to work together, they exchanged hundreds of text messages. The messages were presented in court on Wednesday and were mostly a variation on how important it was to win the race for self-driving cars.Mr. Kalanick said he did not recall, however, what he had meant by some of the text messages he sent to Mr. Levandowski, including one that read, \u201cBurn the village.\u201dIn another exchange, Mr. Levandowski sent Mr. Kalanick a link to a scene from the movie \u201cWall Street\u201d in which Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, argues \u201cgreed, for the lack of a better word, is good.\u201dWhen asked whether he had watched the scene, Mr. Kalanick said he thought so. His emoji response was a hint. \u201cI mean there is a winky-face there,\u201d he said.Once Uber and Otto struck a basic agreement for an acquisition in April 2016, months before the deal was announced, Mr. Kalanick told Uber executives in a meeting that \u201cgolden time is over \u2014 it\u2019s now wartime.\u201d At another meeting, he discussed how it was necessary for Uber to find and use \u201ccheat codes.\u201dMr. Kalanick explained that this phrase was not as nefarious as it sounded. Cheat codes \u201care elegant solutions to problems that haven\u2019t been thought of,\u201d he said. Tesla, for example, has customers pay tens of thousands for cars but loads those vehicles with sensors that provide data to support its self-driving car efforts.Mr. Kalanick said he had another testy conversation with Mr. Page in October 2016, after Uber announced its acquisition of Otto. Interestingly, Mr. Page was worried that Uber was developing its own flying car technology.Mr. Kalanick insisted that Uber wasn\u2019t working on flying cars, but he said Mr. Page was mad that Uber was hiring Google employees and taking its intellectual property. To which, Mr. Kalanick said, he responded, \u201cYour people are not your IP.\u201dIP is an abbreviation for intellectual property.As Uber\u2019s lawyers questioned him, Mr. Kalanick recalled how he had had so much fun as the company\u2019s chief executive. He liked \u201cbeing in the trenches\u201d with small teams. But when asked about the Otto acquisition and the hiring of Mr. Levandowski, Mr. Kalanick was understated.\u201cIt\u2019s not as great as we had thought at the beginning,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Auto Magnate Buys $9 Billion Stake in Daimler", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Chinese businessman who owns the Geely automotive group has acquired a $9 billion stake in Daimler, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks.The investment by Li Shufu, which Daimler confirmed Friday in a regulatory filing in Germany, represents 9.69 percent of the company.In a statement, Daimler said it was pleased to have Mr. Li as a \u201clong-term-oriented shareholder\u201d and described him as \u201c an especially knowledgeable entrepreneur with a clear vision for the future, with whom one can constructively discuss the change in the industry.\u201d\u201cDaimler has got a broad-based portfolio and footprint in China,\u201d Daimler said, noting that Beijing Auto remained \u201ca strong partner on site.\u201dThe Daimler stake was purchased by an investment company headed by Mr. Li called Tenaclou3 Prospect Investment, according to the Daimler filing.Geely could not be reached for comment.Mr. Li is from Zhejiang, a coastal province south of Shanghai. He got his start in business in refrigerator manufacturing in 1986, and moved into motorcycles and then automobiles in the 1990s, according to biography on Volvo\u2019s website. He is now regarded as one of the wealthiest people in China. Bloomberg estimates his net worth at $13.8 billion.Mr. Li has been working to acquire an array of global automotive holdings and turn Geely Auto into the dominant player in China.Reports of his interest in purchasing a Daimler stake have been appearing in the German media for weeks. This month, he appeared by video at an automotive conference in Germany, but did not discuss the matter. \u201cBuilding up brands in the European market has been the goal from the start,\u201d he said, according to a translation of his remarks.In the Chinese market, Geely Auto has become a top-selling brand. It sold more than one million vehicles last year. Geely Holding has also started an automotive brand, Lynk & Co, aimed at wealthier buyers.Daimler sold 2.3 million Mercedes-Benz cars worldwide last year, about a quarter of them in China. The company also makes commercial vans, trucks and buses.Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor who runs an automotive research center at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said many people in Germany were cautious about investments by Chinese companies. \u201cThey need China \u2014 however, they also fear it,\u201d he said in an email.He added that Geely could give Daimler an important partner. \u201cWith Mr. Li and Geely, Daimler has open access to the largest market of the world,\u201d he said.Daimler and other automakers are scrambling to develop electric vehicles to comply with increasingly stringent emissions standards that will take effect in China and Europe in the coming years. Daimler is working on both electric cars and battery-powered trucks.Volvo announced last year that all of its models would be hybrids or electric cars by 2019.Britain and France have said they hope to halt sales of gasoline-powered cars by 2040. China says it would like to do the same, but has not given a target date.GAC also expects to open a development center in Michigan and a design center in Los Angeles in the first half of this year, the executives said. The company established a technology lab in Silicon Valley last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Falcon Heavy, in a Roar of Thunder, Carries SpaceX\u2019s Ambition Into Orbit", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. \u2014 From the same pad where NASA launched rockets that carried astronauts to the moon, a big, new American rocket arced into space on Tuesday. But this time, NASA was not involved. The rocket, the Falcon Heavy, was built by SpaceX, the company founded and run by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.\u201cIt seems surreal to me,\u201d Mr. Musk said during a news conference after the launch.The launch of this turbocharged version of the workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which has been carrying cargo to space for years, marks an important milestone in spaceflight, the first time a rocket this powerful has been sent into space by a private company rather than a government space agency.The rocket carried a playful payload: Mr. Musk\u2019s red Roadster, an electric sports car built by his other company, Tesla. Strapped inside the car is a mannequin wearing one of SpaceX\u2019s spacesuits. They are expected to orbit the sun for hundreds of millions of years.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of silly and fun, but silly and fun things are important,\u201d Mr. Musk said.The success gives SpaceX momentum to begin developing even larger rockets, which could help fulfill Mr. Musk\u2019s dream of sending people to Mars. To do that, he has described a new-generation rocket called B.F.R. (the B stands for big; the R for rocket) that might be ready to launch in the mid-2020s.The near-flawless performance of the Heavy on Tuesday \u201cgives me a lot of confidence we can make the B.F.R. design work,\u201d Mr. Musk said.He added that he hoped the launch would encourage other companies and other countries to aim for more ambitious goals in space.\u201cWe want a new space race,\u201d he said. \u201cRaces are exciting.\u201dFor now, the Heavy will enable SpaceX to compete for contracts to launch larger spy satellites, and some experts in spaceflight are encouraging NASA to use private rockets like the Heavy instead of the gigantic and more expensive rocket, the Space Launch System, that is currently being developed in part to take astronauts back to the moon.\u201cIt basically gives them another tool in their toolbox for accomplishing the space community\u2019s goals,\u201d said Phil Larson, an assistant dean at the University of Colorado\u2019s engineering school who previously worked as a senior manager of communications and corporate projects at SpaceX.SpaceX successfully launched its newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, in February.Although delayed by high-altitude winds, the countdown proceeded smoothly, without any of the glitches that have bedeviled other maiden launches of new rockets.The Heavy roared to life, a plume of smoke and steam shooting sideways from the launchpad. It rose from the pad, with an impossibly bright glare of 27 engines beneath it.About 15 seconds later, a thunderous roar, traveling at the speed of sound, rolled over the spectators.Just over three minutes after it blasted off, the most suspenseful part of the flight was over, as the boosters dropped off and the second stage continued into Earth orbit.Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads at Cape Canaveral. In the past few years, SpaceX has figured out how to routinely bring a booster stage back in one piece to fly again on future flights.The one blemish on the mission was that the center booster, which was to set down on a floating platform in the Atlantic, slammed into the water instead, because some of the engines failed to ignite for the final landing burn.Since 2010, the company has been sending the smaller Falcon 9 rocket into orbit, deploying satellites and carrying cargo to crews aboard the International Space Station. The company has disrupted the global launch business with its lower prices and reusable boosters.The Falcon Heavy is capable of lifting 140,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit, more than any other rocket today. Because all three boosters are to be recovered to fly again, a Falcon Heavy launch costs not much more than one by the company\u2019s existing rocket, Mr. Musk said. SpaceX lists a price of $90 million for a Falcon Heavy flight, compared with $62 million for one by Falcon 9, a bargain in the context of spaceflight.Mr. Musk estimated that his company had spent more than half a billion dollars on Falcon Heavy and said that the program was almost canceled three times.SpaceX has booked coming Heavy flights for Arabsat, a Saudi Arabian communications company, and the United States Air Force.However, the market for the Heavy is smaller than what Mr. Musk envisioned when he announced development of the rocket in 2011. Back then, he expected that SpaceX\u2019s launches would be evenly split between Falcon 9s and Heavies.But the development of the Heavy took years longer than anticipated \u2014 the central booster had to be redesigned to withstand the stresses of the powerful side boosters \u2014 and with advances in miniaturization, the trend is toward smaller satellites. SpaceX also boosted the capability of the Falcon 9, which now can launch many of the payloads that would have originally required a Heavy.In addition to its central booster, the Falcon Heavy was equipped with two additional side boosters that essentially tripled its power at liftoff. While the Heavy uses many of the same components as the Falcon 9, Mr. Musk had cautioned that failures during a test flight would not be surprising. In particular, he worried about complex buffeting of air flowing past the boosters, which is difficult to predict even with the most sophisticated computer simulations.In the past year, SpaceX has tabled many of the plans for future development of the Heavy. The company had intended to use the rocket to launch one of SpaceX\u2019s capsules, known as the Dragon, without people, on a mission to land on Mars. That was scrapped last summer.Instead, SpaceX is focusing its efforts on the B.F.R. It would be a two-stage rocket: a powerful booster to provide lift out of Earth\u2019s gravity and then a spaceship on top for interplanetary missions. The full vehicle would not be ready until the 2020s, but Mr. Musk said he had \u201caspirational\u201d hopes to begin short hopper tests of the spaceship portion next year.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article gave the wrong name for an asteroid mining company.

{"Headline": "To Power the Future, Carmakers Flip on 48-Volt Systems", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWhile automakers sketch out a world of sleek and silent electric cars or even self-driving pods that are more den than dragster, the all-electric future is further off than it may appear.Car companies, starting with Volvo last summer, have laid out plans to electrify entire lineups of vehicles. But the fine print makes it clear that the coming decade and beyond will focus not just on massive battery packs powering electric motors, but also on adding a little extra juice to the venerable internal combustion engine.Increasingly, that juice will arrive in the form of new electrical systems built to a 48-volt standard, instead of the 12-volt systems that have dominated since the 1950s. Simpler than Prius-type drivetrains and less expensive than Tesla-scale battery power, the new electrical architecture both satisfies the demands of cars made more power hungry by their gadget load and enables the use of lower-cost hybrid drive systems.Earlier proposals to take cars to a 42-volt standard fizzled for cost reasons, but recent regulatory developments and the hardware that will one day make autonomous cars feasible have reignited the urgency.Besides the drop in battery prices and control electronics, other factors have made 48-volt technology worth re-examining, said J\u00fcrgen Wiesenberger, director of the hybrid electrical vehicles unit at Continental North America. \u201cThe market was not ready for them in the past because of cost, but the 2013 fuel price spike changed that,\u201d he said.In limited ways, 48-volt systems have already found their way into vehicles, including the Porsche Cayenne and Bentley Bentayga S.U.V.s., where they operate the antiroll bars that keep the body level when cornering hard.But the more integrated applications of the technology, amounting to what\u2019s known as a mild hybrid system, offer the greatest value \u2014 up to 70 percent of the benefit of a full hybrid at 30 percent of the cost, according to industry analysts. Continental projects that 48-volt mild hybrid systems will account for 14 percent of global new vehicle sales in 2025, as sales of vehicles powered exclusively by gasoline or diesel engines drop to 65 percent.Audi, which is bringing 48-volt systems to the 2019 A7 and A8, replaces its conventional alternator with a larger, water-cooled alternator-starter. Rather than merely charging the battery and powering accessories, it restarts the warmed-up V6 engine after it shuts down at a stoplight and recaptures energy when slowing down to charge a lithium-ion battery in the trunk.This design has another trick up its sleeve: It will also start the engine after the car goes into an engine-off coasting mode at speeds between 34 and 99 miles an hour, for up to 40 seconds, all in the cause of saving fuel.Power gains are possible, too. In the SQ7, a diesel S.U.V. that Audi does not currently sell in the United States, an electric motor drives a vane-type supercharger. Similar in operation to a turbocharger, this device delivers its power boost at low engine speeds without the lag of an exhaust-driven turbo. And Mercedes-Benz is equipping the new in-line six-cylinder engine of the 2019 CLS 450 with its EQ integrated starter-generator system. In this design, the electricity is produced in the space between the engine and transmission. In motor mode, it adds 21 horse power and 184 pound-feet of torque for quick getaways, and it can take over for the gas engine at a steady-state cruise.And 48-volt mild hybrid systems can work in heavy-duty applications: Fiat Chrysler will follow the belt-alternator approach with its eTorque system in Ram pickups and the Jeep Wrangler.Why 48 volts? Settling on this level holds the electrical system under the 60-volt safety threshold of what is considered high voltage, where power cables must be orange and special connectors, costing 10 times as much, are required, said Mary Gustanski, chief technical officer of Delphi Technologies.For now, the more powerful systems run alongside the traditional 12-volt electronics rather than replacing them altogether. This dual-voltage strategy avoids the need to redesign simple, reliable components like the motors that open windows and adjust seats.\u201cA full switch-over makes no sense,\u201d Oliver Maiwald, a senior vice president for powertrain technology at Continental, a major industry supplier, said. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee a need to redesign these low-tech, low-cost parts.\u201dThe advantages of the new 48-volt systems are considerable. They offer fuel economy improvements of up to 15 percent, Ms. Gustanski said, and would cost an automaker between $650 and $1,000 to add to the vehicle \u2014 well under the approximately $3,000 it costs to install a full hybrid system. Powering a supercharger electrically can bring a 30 percent gain in torque at low engine speeds, at an added cost of about $250.And there are still more potential applications for 48-volt systems: Electrically heated catalytic converters, for example, could be an important advance in reducing cold-start emissions.There\u2019s little question that the automobile will be increasingly dependent on electric power to meet fuel economy mandates and carbon dioxide limits. Battery electrics, shrinking in cost and growing in range, will be part of the solution. So will plug-in hybrids, which pack enough battery reserve for the needs of most daily commuters.But skeptics may wonder why engineers are devoting so much effort to developing the mild hybrid systems that could be seen as stopgap measures on the path to a fully electric vehicle fleet.It is the reality of how long it takes for the automotive fleet to turn over that really clarifies the picture. A forecast by IHS Markit, an industry analyst firm, said 10 percent of vehicles built around the world seven years from now would have 48-volt systems.\u201cIn 2025, more than 95 percent of vehicles sold globally will still have internal combustion engines,\u201d Ms. Gustanski said. \u201cSo even in 2030, 48 volts will be part of the mix.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.\u2019s rule.The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: \u201cCourts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition\u2014tell the S.E.C.\u2014Congress imposed.\u201d By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers.One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don\u2019t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.\u2019s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation.\u2014 Peter J. HenningWhy?There didn\u2019t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish.Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday\u2019s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on.In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained.\u2014 Peter EavisBroadcom\u2019s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders. From the news release:Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS\u2019s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP\u2019s activist stockholders.Let\u2019s take a look at the math\u2022 Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price.\u2022 Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn\u2019t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year.The bet on the shareholder meetingBroadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm\u2019s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees.A Qualcomm representative didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe deals flyaroundLittle in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey\u2019s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cIf these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place.During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter.The tower would be the first major project under New York City\u2019s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area.Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software.Here\u2019s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor\u2019s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: \u201cWe are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.\u201dGlassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants.Skadden\u2019s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.The judge overseeing the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T\u2019s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not \u201cmade a credible showing\u201d that the White House had singled it out for retribution.The decision puts a crimp in AT&T\u2019s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal.AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list \u2014 but could call him during the trial if needed.The trial begins March 19.Symptom A: Albertsons buying Rite Aid to gain scale and enter the pharmacy businessSymptom B: Walmart\u2019s online sales growing just 23 percent in the fourth quarter, after it splashed out on Jet.com, Bonobos and more\u201cIt\u2019s the battle of the old generation versus the new generation,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. \u201cAnd right now the companies that are gaining share is the new generation.\u201dCritics\u2019 cornerElsewhere in Amazon newsFrom Peter Eavis:For the first time \u2014 and after much protest \u2014 public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of their C.E.O.s.

{"Headline": "California Today: How a Market Tumble Affects California", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.\u201cSell off!\u201d \u201cCrash!\u201d Investors bracing for \u201cuncertainty.\u201dIn an interview on Tuesday afternoon, Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, a professor of finance at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, put the market decline in context for the Golden State.Here are some things to keep in mind:The market\u2019s impact on capital gains \u2013 and the state budgetWhen the stock market goes down, the amount of money Californians who sell stock must pay in capital gains taxes also decreases. The state\u2019s tax code is very progressive, which, in this case, Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said, compounds the problem.California has one of the highest top tax brackets in the country, and the state relies heavily on those top earners to fill its coffers. (In 2014, the top 1 percent of earners paid 48 percent of all state income taxes in California, according to a 2016 article in the Economist.)\u201cSince the top 1 percent of Californians own a lot of stocks, a stock market decline that results in lower capital gains could have a disproportionately large impact on California \u2013 and its state budget,\u201d Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said.We have a lot of tech companies in California \u2013 and their stocks tend to feel the impact of market movement more acutelyTech companies like, say, Apple, tend to sell products known as \u201cconsumer durables\u201d \u2013 products like an iPhone that do not have to be bought frequently because they last for a long time. When people are feeling strapped, they tend to cut back on buying those types of products.Those companies tend to be \u201chigh beta,\u201d Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said, meaning that tech stocks move more than \u201cone for one\u201d with the stock market. Companies like Apple, she said, have a beta above one, meaning that a 10 percent drop in the market tends to be associated with a larger than 10 percent drop in their stock prices.\u201cThe industry composition of our businesses matters because some industries like tech are more affected by the underlying economic drivers of the stock market decline,\u201d Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said.The big pictureAll that said, Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen urged people to keep things in perspective.\u201cThe stock market has declined, but it\u2019s a pretty modest decline compared to how much the run up has been,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s now basically flat for this year, but it still went up a huge amount last year.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The year was 1968, and California-born Peggy Fleming took to the ice at the Stade de Glace in Grenoble, France \u2014 a 19-year-old with a shot at Olympic gold.

Let\u2019s talk about tech.The HomePod reviews are in, and the verdict is: It\u2019s middling!Apple\u2019s smart speaker was originally due to ship last year. Now, after a delay and lots of speculation that it would face a rough go against Amazon\u2019s Echo, Apple\u2019s device is finally on sale.But most reviewers appraising the device this week suggested that it was best to wait. There are some interesting features in HomePod, but it has a long way to go to beat the competition.What doesn\u2019t it do well? Pretty much everything else, reviewers said. It\u2019s expensive \u2014 $349 versus $85 for an Echo. It\u2019s locked into Apple\u2019s music service, while competing systems let you play songs from a variety of sources.And most frustratingly, it\u2019s not very smart. Where Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s devices can answer a variety of questions and perform lots of different tasks (like order up an Uber or Lyft), HomePod\u2019s brain, Siri, needs evolution. Brian was particularly upset that the device kept playing music he didn\u2019t like. And for Nilay, the biggest complaint was that HomePod couldn\u2019t set two timers at once \u2014 basically table stakes in the smart speaker game.None of these are fatal. Siri is a cloud-based service, which means Apple can keep improving it from afar. Echo, too, wasn\u2019t so great to begin with. So I wouldn\u2019t count Apple out. The smart assistant war has barely started.Travis Kalanick took the stand, drank a whole lot of water, offered his thoughts on greed and Google, and introduced the world to the crazy lexicon of tech bros: \u201cunpumped,\u201d \u201cangsty\u201d and, most mysteriously of all, \u201claser is the sauce.\u201dAt the heart of the case is one question: Did Uber steal trade secrets from Waymo, Google\u2019s self-driving car spin-off, when it purchased Otto, a self-driving company founded by former employees of Waymo?The trial is expected to go on for weeks, but early on, Waymo seemed to score some wins. Kalanick conceded that during a \u201cjam sesh\u201d with Anthony Levandowski, the former Waymo engineer alleged to have stolen its secrets, he discussed the key technology at issue in the case, laser sensors. That\u2019s apparently when Kalanick jotted a note that included his conclusion that \u201claser is the sauce\u201d \u2014 it suggested Levandowski had convinced Kalanick of the importance of Waymo\u2019s tech.I\u2019m sure Uber\u2019s lawyers were unpumped about that.Here\u2019s something noteworthy from social media land. Snap and Twitter have long appeared at a disadvantage to the 800-pound social media gorilla, Facebook, and the smaller companies\u2019 financial results often proved it.There\u2019s some serious stuff here. This is the biggest rocket ever launched by a private company, and it paves the way for an even-larger rocket planned by Musk, called B.F.R., which could help realize Musk\u2019s dream of colonizing Mars. (As my colleague Kenneth Chang explained in this family-friendly newspaper about B.F.R.: \u201cThe B stands for big; the R for rocket.\u201d)But let\u2019s forget the serious stuff for a second.

{"Headline": "Tesla Model 3, Elon Musk\u2019s Grail, Remains a Costly Pursuit", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, Elon Musk had a Tesla Roadster launched toward an orbit around the sun. A day later, he and his car company came back to earth.The electric-car maker said Wednesday that it lost more than three-quarters of a billion dollars in the fourth quarter as it scrambled to root out glitches from its manufacturing operations and ramp up production of its highly anticipated Model 3 sedan.In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Musk, the chief executive, acknowledged that Tesla still faced challenges in putting the Model 3 into mass production. \u201cWe were in a deeper level of hell than we expected, still a few levels deeper than we would like to be,\u201d he said.Analysts fret about the hiccups Tesla has encountered and how much money it must spend while trying to move into high-volume production.\u201cCash burn does matter, as it is a finite resource, and ramp delays on the Model 3 only exacerbate the cash burn,\u201d Brian Johnson, a financial analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note to investors.In July, as Model 3 production was about to begin, Mr. Musk ratcheted back expectations, resetting his target to 20,000 vehicles a month by December. But difficulties producing battery packs at Tesla\u2019s Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory, and other glitches in the car\u2019s assembly process combined to slow output to a crawl.Mr. Musk said Tesla had developed a new automated production line that would be installed in the Gigafactory in March, easing hitches in supplying batteries to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., which was once operated jointly by Toyota Motor and General Motors.Tesla now hopes to be able to produce 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of March and 5,000 a week by the end of June. Mr. Musk said it aimed eventually to produce 500,000 Model 3s a year.\u201cThey haven\u2019t delivered what they\u2019ve promised, but does it matter?\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to matter to their investors and the customers who\u2019ve put down deposits. When investors don\u2019t put any more money into the company, then you will know it\u2019s a problem.\u201dOn a positive note, Tesla reported it used up only $277 million in cash in the fourth quarter. That was down from $1.4 billion in the third quarter. On a full-year basis, however, the company used nearly $3.5 billion in cash, more than twice the amount from 2016.The company\u2019s loss in the quarter amounted to $3.04 per share on an adjusted basis, slightly less than analysts had forecast, and $4.01 unadjusted.Tesla has lost money in eight of the last nine quarters. Mr. Musk said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that it would begin to generate net income in 2018, as Model 3 production and deliveries rose.The company\u2019s shares were little changed in extended trading after the earnings report. They had risen 3.3 percent during the regular session.Even if Model 3 output rises, Tesla will have to spend heavily on two future vehicles \u2014 a battery-powered semi truck and another car, the Model Y.While working on the Model 3, Mr. Musk has continued to seek new barriers to break in other areas.\u201cIf we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt,\u201d Mr. Musk said Wednesday, \u201cI think we can solve Model 3 production.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puns and Anagrams", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayVARIETY PUZZLE \u2014 Puns and Anagrams are two ingredients in a cryptic puzzle, also called a \u201cBritish puzzle\u201d after its popularity in England (and much of Europe). They\u2019re pretty fiendish! Every clue has at least one form of trickery, you\u2019re rarely able to completely solve any clues with crosses, and the misdirections can be creative, frankly, to the point of mild lunacy. Tempting, right? If you\u2019re interested in getting into cryptic crosswords, today\u2019s variety is a great gateway drug. If the idea makes you shudder, you should try this puzzle by Sam Ezersky anyway; it draws from a different set of skills than a regular crossword puzzle, requires and rewards a sense of humor, and is very gratifying (and possible!) to solve.First of all, there are usually a ton of anagrams, which are the equivalent of multiple-choice questions on a very difficult exam, although they\u2019re not labeled such. The thing is, the answer is in front of you; you just need to scramble up some letters. A nice, approachable example of this would be 6D, \u201cSteals electric cars.\u201d One word, reordered, defines the rest of the clue; so S-T-E-A-L-S becomes TESLAS, \u201celectric cars.\u201d Other straightforward clues like this are 20A, 34A, 59A, 57D.The next step, putting together longer words, or anagramming two words in a clue or an entry, appears at 10A, 17A, 32A, 38A, 10D, 14D, 31D and 44A, among others. 32A, for example, is a common crossword entry that reads pretty funny, but HELP COIN \u2014> PINOCHLE.Sometimes the clue will scramble one name into another, which is a little tricky: 16A, Maori woman, for example, anagrams Maori to Moira. Have you seen Catherine O\u2019Hara as Moira Rose in \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d? Hilarious.There are also clues with some misdirection \u2014 like numbers that need to be simply spelled out (1A) or converted to letter(s) by the Roman numeral system (1D). A couple don\u2019t use every last speck of a clue, which is permitted. 13D, for example, \u201cDepot near Las Vegas,\u201d leaves the Vegas out to solve to ARSENAL. A few clues have a side of pun with their anagram; don\u2019t be surprised to need to know a bit of both for a clue like 41D, where an \u201cex\u201d can become an X, or 45D, where \u201cwell-head\u201d tells you to use the \u201chead\u201d of the word \u201cwell\u201d in your answer \u2014 W.What did you think?!Advertisement"}

It was SpaceX.If you saw a light moving slowly across the sky earlier this week, it was a space Tesla. More specifically, it was the second stage of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket, which launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida early in the day on Tuesday.The payload on the rocket was a red Tesla Roadster from Elon Musk, the chief executive of both SpaceX and Tesla, which are both California companies. Since it was a test flight, Mr. Musk put the Tesla on board, instead of heavy and boring concrete, and sent it on an elliptical orbit around the sun that would extend beyond Mars\u2019s orbit.The light in the sky was the final engine burn that pushed the car away from Earth and onto its interplanetary journey.This was of course not the first time Mr. Musk\u2019s company has freaked out Californians.In December, a night launch of a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base left a surrealistic glowing trail in its wake above Los Angeles. On Twitter, Mr. Musk reassured the world, \u201cIt was definitely aliens.\u201d The Falcon Heavy by itself won\u2019t transform the space industry \u2014 there\u2019s currently only a limited need for a rocket that big \u2014 but the nearly flawless flight showed that ambitious privately financed space ventures can succeed.Mr. Musk said that no government money went to the development of the Heavy, which cost more than half a billion dollars. That\u2019s a good thing, since his next project is even more ambitious \u2014 a two-stage behemoth spaceship for taking people to Mars, among other tasks.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

Her heart was not working well, her breathing was labored, there was a call from the nursing-home doctor, who brought up the subject of hospice.This happened the same week Elon Musk was sending a red sports car with a make-believe driver into space.\u201cMy mother no longer seems to be as crazy as she once did,\u201d I tell my friend Herb. \u201cHer insanity is converging with Elon Musk\u2019s. She and a Tesla may be blasting off at the same time.\u201dMy mother\u2019s crisis is averted by antibiotics. The next day I am at the nursing home with videos of the Falcon Heavy SpaceX launch because, like I say, space travel is Ma\u2019s thing.\u201cDoes this Elon Musk know about me?\u201d Ma says, because in the Ma universe, even before the stroke and the dementia, life revolved around Ma.\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Ma,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s been very busy, getting this thing up there. They shot it up from what used to be Cape Kennedy. You remember we went there once?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll write him a letter and tell him I want to go,\u201d Ma says.The mysteries of the human brain \u2014 I am talking about Ma\u2019s now, not Elon Musk\u2019s. Before her stroke three years ago, my mother was an adventurous traveler, going to the Amazon, the Nile, the Gal\u00e1pagos. Now she\u2019s planning on being among the first visitors to Mars, although lately she\u2019s been worrying about the flight taking off without her. My brothers and I tell her that won\u2019t happen, Mars isn\u2019t ready for tourism.But distinguishing fantasy and reality is harder these days, so here I am at the nursing home, showing Ma the photo of Elon Musk\u2019s red Roadster in space, with a guy who for all she knows could be Buzz Aldrin at the wheel.\u201cNow remember, this isn\u2019t a real person, Ma,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a mannequin in a spacesuit. The car isn\u2019t actually going to Mars, it\u2019s going to be circling the sun like Mars and Earth. We\u2019re in the same orbit.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Ma says.This was Mom\u2019s medical condition when I got the call from the nursing home doctor: Bronchitis, the chronic obstructive lung disease getting worse, shortness of breath, and of course her longstanding heart disease and diabetes. There was also a discussion about whether hospice or hospital was preferred.\u201cDo you believe we\u2019re looking at the beginning of a dying situation here?\u201d I had asked.\u201cNo,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cWe\u2019re just looking at a change of status, and it could go either way.\u201dI do think it\u2019s the beginning of the end for my mother \u2014 not this week or even this month, but I do see a sharper downward trajectory. My mother is sleepier these days, more likely to zone out, more anxious. We do not discuss her death, but I know she believes in some sort of afterlife. I do not.Still there seems to be an image associated with death, of an ascension upward, which many people share. I experienced it years ago myself. I had had an abortion, the psychological aftermath of which was not as simple as I thought it would be, and when I got home, sleeping off the anesthesia, I dreamed of a large cinder, a life that had been snuffed out before it had the opportunity to happen, shooting through space.Why was that image of a snuffed-out life moving through space? Why wasn\u2019t it buried in the ground? I understand that nobody wants to dwell on the decay and rot that is a certainty, but why does so much death imagery have to do with moving skyward? One could almost believe there was a biological memory dating to the big bang:Wowza! Did you see that magnificent galactic explosion? I can\u2019t help thinking it\u2019s the beginning of something big. My mother the galaxy. From star stuff I came and to star stuff I shall return. But first, I\u2019d like to grow a face and see Paris. My mother was active in two synagogues when she lived in Florida, and one of the things she did was prepare bodies for burial. It\u2019s not disturbing, she told me; it\u2019s an honor. You wash them, you dress them in a shroud, you sit with them until they\u2019re buried so they\u2019re not alone. That traditional Jewish burial was what I figured Ma would want for herself.It occurs to me now, however, with Ma\u2019s Mars fixation, that she might, when the time comes, enjoy being cremated and shot into space. \u201cEnjoy\u201d probably isn\u2019t the word, but you know what I\u2019m saying.But I can\u2019t see discussing this with Ma. The days are over when she talked about death as another adventure. She is suggestible now, vulnerable to unhappy stories \u2014 the other day it was \u201cKing Kong.\u201d She didn\u2019t say what upset her, but what could it be other than the tragic, persecuted Kong, furry as the kittens and puppies Ma sometimes thinks sleep with her, in his death spiral off the Empire State Building.And of course, there\u2019s that problem with dementia; who\u2019s in charge, Pre-Stroke, Adventure Travel Ma or Nursing Home Ma?Actually, the person who is in charge is me. I am my mother\u2019s medical advocate, I will have the final word about how it will end, in a hospital or hospice: in a nest of tubes or with a hospice musician playing show tunes? With me telling Ma that Mars is not ready for tourism, or saying I got a call from Elon Musk and he has readied a rocket just for her?I lean toward a journey that will take her toward the stars.Advertisement"}

It outlined the Chinese government\u2019s aggressive plan to treat A.I. like the country\u2019s own version of the Apollo 11 lunar mission \u2014 an all-in effort that could stoke national pride and spark agenda-setting technology breakthroughs.\u201cIt is remarkable to see how A.I. has emerged as a top priority for the Chinese leadership and how quickly things have been set into motion,\u201d said Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security who helped translate the manifesto and follows China\u2019s work on artificial intelligence. \u201cThe U.S. plans and policies released in 2016 were seemingly the impetus for the formulation of China\u2019s national A.I. strategy.\u201d\u201cWe are still waiting on the White House to provide some direction\u201d on how to respond to the competition, said Tim Hwang, who worked on A.I. policy at Google and is now the director of the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative, a new organization created by the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and others to fund ethical research in artificial intelligence.American companies like Amazon and Google have done more than anyone to turn A.I. concepts into real products. But for a number of reasons, including concerns that the Trump administration will limit the number of immigrant engineers allowed into the United States, much of the critical research being done on artificial intelligence is already migrating to other countries, including tech hot spots like Toronto, London and Beijing.To China\u2019s growing tech community, driving the industry\u2019s next big thing \u2014 a mantra of Silicon Valley \u2014 is becoming a tantalizing possibility.\u201cThanks to the size of the market and the rapid experimentation, China is going to become one of the most powerful \u2014 if not the most powerful \u2014 A.I. countries in the world,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft and Google executive who now runs a prominent Chinese venture capital firm dedicated to artificial intelligence.The 2016 A.I. reports were shepherded by President Barack Obama\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy.The O.S.T.P., which has overseen science and technology activities across the federal government for more than four decades, is now run by the deputy chief technology officer Michael Kratsios. He had worked as a Wall Street analyst before serving as chief of staff for an investment fund run by Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist who supported Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential run. The administration has yet to name an office director or fill four other assistant posts.In a recent interview, Mr. Kratsios was adamant that any concerns over the administration\u2019s approach to A.I. were unfounded.\u201cArtificial intelligence has been a priority for the Trump administration since Day 1,\u201d he said. Mr. Kratsios added that the administration was particularly concerned with the development of A.I. in national security and as a way of encouraging economic prosperity.Many staff members in Mr. Kratsios\u2019s office are exploring issues related to artificial intelligence, he said. Mr. Kratsios also meets with a committee, set up by the Obama administration, that coordinates A.I. policy across the government.\u201cThe key thing to remember is that the front line of A.I. policy is at the agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House is a convener and a coordinator.\u201dIn an echo of plans laid out by the Obama administration, China\u2019s government said it intended to significantly increase long-term funding for A.I. research and develop a much larger community of A.I. researchers.There are several ways to do that, according to the Obama administration and China. First, educate more students in these technologies. Second, recruit experts from other countries.At the same time, both policy statements urged companies to share more technology and data. Huge pools of data are need to \u201ctrain\u201d A.I. systems, and in the United States much of this is locked up inside companies like Facebook and Google. Mr. Lee said China already has an enormous advantage here because its large population will generate more data and its companies are more willing to share.Artificial intelligence has been a focus of Chinese technologists for some time. By 2013, China was already producing more research papers than the United States in the area of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the main technology driving the rise of A.I., according to the Obama reports. Deep learning, which allows machines to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, is one of the main technologies driving the rise of artificial intelligence.It is unclear how much China as a whole is spending. But one Chinese state has promised to invest $5 billion in A.I., and the government of Beijing has committed $2 billion to an A.I. development park in the city. South Korea has set aside close to $1 billion of its own. Canada, already home to many of the top researchers in the field, has also committed $125 million to, in part, attract new talent from other countries.It is also difficult to say just how much the government of the United States is spending. Government organizations like the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation continue to fund new research in universities and the private sector. According to an O.S.T.P report, the federal government spent about $1 billion a year in 2015. The Trump administration says that spending jumped to $3 billion in 2017. But the current administration said that was not an apples-to-apples comparison to the 2015 tally, because it was not certain how the Obama administration made it calculations.\u201cWe may have a bunch of small initiatives inside the government that are doing good, but we don\u2019t have a central national strategy,\u201d said Jack Clark, a former journalist who now oversees policy efforts at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab co-founded by Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is confusing that we have this technology of such obvious power and merit and we are not hearing full-throated support, including financial support.\u201d\u201cThey are headed in precisely the wrong direction,\u201d said Thomas Kalil, who led O.S.T.P\u2019s Technology and Innovation Division under President Obama. \u201cThat is particularly concerning given that China has identified this as a strategic priority.\u201dGoogle operates another important lab in Montreal. Its London lab, DeepMind, may be home to more top-notch A.I. researchers than any other lab on earth. And Google recently unveiled new labs in both Paris and Beijing. Facebook, after creating its own lab in Canada, recently pumped 10 million euros, or more than $12 million, into its existing operation in Paris. And Amazon is opening a lab in Germany.Inside these facilities, researchers still create technology for their American employers. As the labs grow and the products get better, some employees can be expected to leave to start their own companies and hire their own employees.Google\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s work in China has already led to Chinese start-ups like Malong, which is building image recognition systems, and a major A.I. investment fund run by Mr. Lee.\u201cWhen it is close to you, something like Microsoft Research has real economic value,\u201d said Mr. Clark, of OpenAI.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

Since 1990, Southern California has added more than 100 miles of light and heavy rail in Los Angeles County, and more than 530 miles of commuter rail regionwide, according to a recent study. And yet, traffic remains terrible. How can that be?Experts and officials have many possible explanations for the decline: competition from ride-share companies, changes in immigration policy that impact some of the region\u2019s most reliable transit users, and the fact that some would-be riders just don\u2019t think public transit is safe.\u201cTransit today relies on a high rate of use by a narrow base of people,\u201d the report\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cBut if that narrow base of people is acquiring vehicles, transit\u2019s healthy future lies in reversing those circumstances, and striving for at least a low rate of use by a broad base of people.\u201dIn a region of 18.8 million people, they note that about 77 percent use public transit rarely or never.

{"Headline": "Stocks Enter Correction Territory: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 Stocks enter correction territory.\u2022 Qualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s revised offer.\u2022 Snap and Twitter: From also-rans to worthy contenders?\u2022 BlackRock is reportedly setting its sights on Berkshire Hathaway and the Blackstone Group.\u2022 A top WSJ editor heads to Lazard.\u2022 Brunswick Group has named Neal Wolin as its new C.E.O.The Dow Jones industrial average and S.&P. 500 went more the 400 days without a pullback of 5 percent.That streak ended this week, and on Thursday, the two indexes fell into correction territory, defined as a pullback of at least 10 percent from their high. For both, it is the first time they have crossed into a correction since early 2016.The Dow plunged more than 1,000 points Thursday, its second decline of more than 1,000 points this week. The S. & P. 500 dropped 100 points, its third decline of more than 100 points in its history.On a percentage basis, the Dow fell 4.15 percent, the S. & P. 500 dropped 3.75 percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.9 percent.The bigger pictureAnxieties about inflation have driven the much of decline over the past week and a half. The yield on the benchmark Treasury note climbed above 2.85 percent \u2014 its highest level since 2014 \u2014 for the second time this week. Higher yields can crimp economic activity by raising borrowing costs, while also making riskier assets like stocks less appealing to bonds.Many market watchers say that investors should not worry about the recent spate of volatility in the stock market. Such swings, they say, are normal. They point to strong corporate earnings and a strengthening economy both in the United States and abroad as reasons to be optimistic about stocks.Investor sentiment has reversed in recent weeks as the sell-off in stocks gained momentum.According to the American Association of Individual Investors\u2019 weekly survey, bullish sentiment, or the percentage of respondents that say stocks will rise over the next six months, declined to 37 percent. The drop ended a streak of eight straight weeks with bullish sentiment above its historical average of 38.5 percent.It began the year at nearly 60 percent, its highest level since 2010.The contextThe survey has proved to be a good contrarian indicator. That means overly bullish sentiment often signals that the stock market is ripe for a pullback, while overly bearish sentiment often indicates that market may soon rally.The chip maker said its board had rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised $121 billion offer.The reasons\u2022 \u201cThe Broadcom proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm.\u201d\u2022 The offer \u201cfalls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction.\u201dQualcomm said that it was willing to meet with Broadcom to see if its issues with the offer could be addressed.The contextQualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.Till this week, many investors wondered whether Snap and Twitter had much of a future at a time when Google and Facebook are sucking up such a large share of digital advertising dollars. But after Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even as they remain in the shadow of Facebook and Google.\u2014 Peter EavisBlackRock itself raises a different comparison, according to Sarah Krouse of the WSJ \u2014 to Warren Buffett:The \u201cbest known\u201d example of BlackRock\u2019s approach with this new vehicle is Berkshire Hathaway, according to a fund-raising document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Omaha conglomerate run by Mr. Buffett is well known for its long-term ownership of companies.BlackRock\u2019s Long-Term Private Capital fund would be a tenth of Berkshire\u2019s $101 billion in cash. But it too would look to buy and hold positions for more than 10 years. Over all, though, this seems more akin to private equity.The practice has grown on Wall Street with the rise of activist investors, with investment banks touting their defense capabilities to corporate clients.Before becoming finance editor at the Journal, Mr. Berman oversaw the paper\u2019s business coverage and was its M.&A. reporter prior to that.Mr. Berman, who will join as a managing director and be based in New York, will start on Feb. 26.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedAndrew, with a bit of contextDennis follows in the footsteps of Steven Rattner, who worked as a reporter at the NYT in the 1980s before going to work as a banker at Lazard and becoming an influential financier. (Today, Mr. Rattner overseas Michael Bloomberg\u2019s fortune.)Dennis was my fiercest reporting competitor over the last decade and is one of the most talented financial journalists in recent memory.Mr. Wolin, who will remain based in Washington, will take over from the London-based Susan Gilchrist, who will become chairwoman of Brunswick\u2019s global clients operations and focus on client work full time.Alan Parker, Brunswick\u2019s founder, said in a telephone interview of the move, \u201cIt reflects the growth of the business and the business opportunity in America.\u201dThe contextIn some ways, the appointment of Mr. Wolin reflects that trend. Beyond his time at the Treasury Department, he previously worked as a senior executive at The Hartford, an insurer. And he was previously a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration.\u201cIncreasingly, I think senior executives and boards of directors have come to understand that a lot of their challenges and opportunitiess sit at the intersection of business and governments and society and so forth,\u201d Mr. Wolin said in a phone interview.Or as Mr. Parker put it, \u201cMore and more we hear ourselves described as a critical issues business.\u201dOther moves at Brunswick\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe recent stock market freak-out may have abated, but the dynamics that drove the sell-off \u2014 worries that faster global growth and hotter inflation will trigger faster-than-expected rate hikes \u2014 are alive and well in the currency markets.On Thursday, the Bank of England raised its growth forecasts for the United Kingdom, and Mark Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said rates would likely have to be increased faster than previously expected.The British pound promptly popped by more than 1 percent against the dollar, and yields on British government bonds rose. Treasury bonds yields in the United States also rose, with the 10-year note offering yields of nearing 2.90 percent.The sight of bond yields nearing 3 percent should keep stock investors on edge amid the growing conviction we\u2019re moving out of the era of low-interest rates, which were such a key ingredient for the near-decade-long bull market in stocks.\u2014 Matt PhillipsThe bigger pictureWhat business cares about in the proposal:\u2022 Nearly $300 billion in additional spending over the next two years\u2022 $20 billion for infrastructure spending\u2022 A lifting of the debt ceiling until March 2019The agreement will cause federal budget deficits to grow even larger, on top of the effects of the sweeping tax overhaul that lawmakers approved in December.
