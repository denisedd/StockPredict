{"Headline": "Russia Isn\u2019t the Only One Meddling in Elections. We Do It, Too.", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBags of cash delivered to a Rome hotel for favored Italian candidates. Scandalous stories leaked to foreign newspapers to swing an election in Nicaragua. Millions of pamphlets, posters and stickers printed to defeat an incumbent in Serbia.The long arm of Vladimir Putin? No, just a small sample of the United States\u2019 history of intervention in foreign elections.Most Americans are understandably shocked by what they view as an unprecedented attack on our political system. But intelligence veterans, and scholars who have studied covert operations, have a different, and quite revealing, view.\u201cIf you ask an intelligence officer, did the Russians break the rules or do something bizarre, the answer is no, not at all,\u201d said Steven L. Hall, who retired in 2015 after 30 years at the C.I.A., where he was the chief of Russian operations. The United States \u201cabsolutely\u201d has carried out such election influence operations historically, he said, \u201cand I hope we keep doing it.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this kind of thing since the C.I.A. was created in 1947,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, now at the University of Georgia. \u201cWe\u2019ve used posters, pamphlets, mailers, banners \u2014 you name it. We\u2019ve planted false information in foreign newspapers. We\u2019ve used what the British call \u2018King George\u2019s cavalry\u2019: suitcases of cash.\u201dThe United States\u2019 departure from democratic ideals sometimes went much further. The C.I.A. helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia.But in recent decades, both Mr. Hall and Mr. Johnson argued, Russian and American interferences in elections have not been morally equivalent. American interventions have generally been aimed at helping non-authoritarian candidates challenge dictators or otherwise promoting democracy. Russia has more often intervened to disrupt democracy or promote authoritarian rule, they said.Equating the two, Mr. Hall says, \u201cis like saying cops and bad guys are the same because they both have guns \u2014 the motivation matters.\u201dThis broader history of election meddling has largely been missing from the flood of reporting on the Russian intervention and the investigation of whether the Trump campaign was involved. It is a reminder that the Russian campaign in 2016 was fundamentally old-school espionage, even if it exploited new technologies. And it illuminates the larger currents of history that drove American electoral interventions during the Cold War and motivate Russia\u2019s actions today.\u201cI\u2019m not in any way justifying what the Russians did in 2016,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cIt was completely wrong of Vladimir Putin to intervene in this way. That said, the methods they used in this election were the digital version of methods used both by the United States and Russia for decades: breaking into party headquarters, recruiting secretaries, placing informants in a party, giving information or disinformation to newspapers.\u201dHis findings underscore how routine election meddling by the United States \u2014 sometimes covert and sometimes quite open \u2014 has been.C.I.A. officials told Mr. Johnson in the late 1980s that \u201cinsertions\u201d of information into foreign news media, mostly accurate but sometimes false, were running at 70 to 80 a day. In the 1990 election in Nicaragua, the C.I.A. planted stories about corruption in the leftist Sandinista government, Mr. Levin said. The opposition won.Vince Houghton, who served in the military in the Balkans at the time and worked closely with the intelligence agencies, said he saw American efforts everywhere. \u201cWe made it very clear that we had no intention of letting Milosevic stay in power,\u201d said Mr. Houghton, now the historian at the International Spy Museum.At least once the hand of the United States reached boldly into a Russian election. American fears that Boris Yeltsin would be defeated for re-election as president in 1996 by an old-fashioned Communist led to an overt and covert effort to help him, urged on by President Bill Clinton. It included an American push for a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia four months before the voting and a team of American political consultants (though some Russians scoffed when they took credit for the Yeltsin win).But what does democracy mean? Can it include secretly undermining an authoritarian ruler or helping challengers who embrace democratic values? How about financing civic organizations?In recent decades, the most visible American presence in foreign politics has been taxpayer-funded groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which do not support candidates but teach basic campaign skills, build democratic institutions and train election monitors.It is easy to understand why Mr. Putin sees such American cash as a threat to his rule, which tolerates no real opposition. But American veterans of democracy promotion find abhorrent Mr. Putin\u2019s insinuations that their work is equivalent to what the Russian government is accused of doing in the United States today.\u201cIt\u2019s not just apples and oranges,\u201d said Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s comparing someone who delivers lifesaving medicine to someone who brings deadly poison.\u201dWhat the C.I.A. may have done in recent years to steer foreign elections is still secret and may not be known for decades. It may be modest by comparison with the agency\u2019s Cold War manipulation. But some old-timers aren\u2019t so sure.\u201cI assume they\u2019re doing a lot of the old stuff, because, you know, it never changes,\u201d said William J. Daugherty, who worked for the C.I.A. from 1979 to 1996 and at one time had the job of reviewing covert operations. \u201cThe technology may change, but the objectives don\u2019t.\u201dAn earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Aleksei Navalny, a political opponent of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had received grants from the National Endowment for Democracy. In fact, an organization employing him received one $23,000 grant from the endowment in 2006.Scott Shane is a national security reporter for The Times and a former Moscow correspondent.Advertisement"}

Below is a look at some of the facts and figures he cited that were accurate, false or could use some additional context. Also, Mr. Trump is not the first president in 45 years to enact tax cuts. Tax legislation was signed into law by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Further, the cuts passed under Mr. Reagan and Mr. Obama were larger, as a share of the economy, than those recently signed by Mr. Trump. Under the Obama administration, the United States offered to cut emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels, by 2025, as part of the Paris agreement.Mr. Trump is likely referring to the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program to help poorer countries mitigate the effects of climate change.

The corruption allegations that ensnared Mr. Lee\u2019s son and heir \u2014 and that last year felled Park Geun-hye, then South Korea\u2019s president \u2014 involved bribery via sports sponsorships.\u201cThe zeitgeist is calling for chaebol reform,\u201d said Sun Dae-in, director of research at SDInomics, a think tank in Seoul, the capital, using the Korean term for the family-run business empires. \u201cThat puts the chaebol in a very sensitive position.\u201dOne result: Korean companies, fearful that their contributions would be \u201cmisinterpreted,\u201d were skittish for a long time about sponsoring the Pyeongchang Games, said Chang Sea-jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore.\u201cThe political issues have not directly affected the planning or preparations of the Games, but they were certainly a distraction for local engagement,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Pyeongchang committee said by email. She declined to comment on how far the committee had been behind on its funding before Mr. Moon\u2019s appeal last July.For many South Koreans, conflicted feelings toward the nation\u2019s business champions have already dampened the Olympic spirit. Last week, Ju Mi-ryung, 41, traveled an hour with her son to an official Olympic exhibition center in Seoul to show him the curling demonstration and the virtual-reality bobsledding.\u201cIt\u2019s a problem that the chaebol score political points through sporting events like this,\u201d Ms. Ju said.Still, the chaebol are not skipping Pyeongchang entirely.Today, by contrast, Samsung is being \u201cextremely cautious,\u201d said Nam Lee, a professor at Chung-Ang University in Seoul. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to wake up people\u2019s concealed bad feelings against Samsung and Chairman Lee.\u201dHyundai said its promotional activities for Pyeongchang were extensive and had \u201cno precedent.\u201d Other chaebol companies, however, shied away from the topic. Samsung declined to comment on how its marketing for Pyeongchang stacked up against previous Games. An LG spokeswoman said the group\u2019s subsidiaries were not permitted, under the terms of their sponsorship, to promote their own brands in connection with the Games. A Korean Air spokesman declined to comment.A backlash against big business has been a long time coming in South Korea. For decades governments have tolerated lawbreaking tycoons so long as their companies bolstered the nation\u2019s economic might \u2014 or, in the case of the Olympics, the nation\u2019s global prestige.Samsung\u2019s role started earlier.Pyeongchang\u2019s long march to the Winter Games began in 2003, when the mountain town went up against Vancouver, British Columbia, and Salzburg, Austria, for the 2010 Olympics. When International Olympic Committee members arrived in Prague to vote, they found the city festooned with blue-and-white Samsung banners. The company also sponsored a music festival and running race there. Pyeongchang organizers said that Samsung\u2019s activities weren\u2019t connected to the Olympic bid.Vancouver won in the end, but only by a hair. Pyeongchang\u2019s strong showing surprised many.As the committee prepared to decide, in 2011, among Pyeongchang, Munich and Annecy, France, Mr. Lee crisscrossed the globe to ask other I.O.C. members for their backing.Pyeongchang won.Raymond Zhong reported from Hong Kong, and Park Jeong-eun from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Insurance 101: Butler Undergrads Write Coverage for Dogs and Pianos", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Can you trust college students with pepper spray? If they sell blankets to other students to make money, might they be contributing to a bedbug infestation in the dorms? And how many drunken teenagers are dancing on the campus pianos instead of playing Shostakovich?These questions, at their core, are about risk. And if you want to protect yourself from risk that has financial ramifications, you probably need insurance. Which is how it came to pass that undergraduates at Butler University found themselves in the underwriting business.Here in the university\u2019s Davey Risk Management and Insurance Program, 13 upperclassmen are underwriting those pianos and fellow students who seek to corner the market on fleece blankies.If you still think insurance is boring, you haven\u2019t really thought it through. The industry is at least partly about the fascinating science of human behavior, from recklessness to neglect, and our collective efforts to behave responsibly that never end in total success.Still, insurance companies try to train and tame us. They provide a safety net for at least some of our inevitable failures at the same time that they charge as much in premiums as they possibly can.The industry does lack sex appeal, though.As he made his way through the industry, however, Professor Finn discovered that it had a risk management problem of its own: There were not enough young people seeking entry-level jobs.The student-run insurance company was born of a brainstorm with Michael M. Bill, the co-founder and chairman of MJ Insurance, a local firm. MJ Insurance eventually offered up $250,000, in part to help the student-run company get square with its Bermuda regulators.Yes, the student insurers get to travel there to learn more about the industry. No, it\u2019s not a boondoggle. In fact, the trip to Bermuda is something of an inspiration once they meet their peers. \u201cWorking in insurance and risk management is really desirable among the young people from there,\u201d said Anna Geist, a junior who serves as treasurer and vice president for casualty underwriting at the student company.To the students, learning by doing through an on-campus insurance entity makes intuitive sense. They may even have a competitive advantage. \u201cWe go here,\u201d said Josh Toly, a Butler senior who is the student company\u2019s chief marketing officer and vice president for property underwriting. \u201cWe know the ins and outs of the buildings better than a standard insurance company would.\u201dThey also track each of the university\u2019s dozens of Steinway pianos through a detailed spreadsheet and set premium prices in part through shopping other carriers. The complexity of underwriting the pianos comes from context, Professor Finn said. \u201cIn terms of the risks of specific Steinways, they\u2019re inherent in who has it and where it is and how it\u2019s cared for,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it a Steinway with an idiot frat member with a beer, or is it in a recital hall?\u201dThe students do not have carte blanche to raise piano premiums to the moon just to see how much money they can extract from university finance administrators who are keen to provide a learning experience. \u201cIf we overinsure, we\u2019re wasting money,\u201d Professor Finn said. \u201cBut if we underinsure, well, that would be the day the music died.\u201dAll undergraduates in the business school must start a company as part of their coursework, but administrators have traditionally set certain parameters. Food service, for instance, used to be off limits, given the risk of poisoning people. But the student-run insurance company, which provides coverage for all of the student enterprises, figured out how to cover those start-ups, in part by codifying the minimum amount of coverage the company requires the suppliers themselves to have.The premiums the students charge the university are not cheaper than the coverage that their company is replacing. So the students try to win on service, sniffing out risks that the school might have overlooked.Take the university\u2019s telescope, for instance. Though the school had been insuring it for $1 million, the students discovered that the replacement cost was closer to $2 million. Moreover, the equipment could be exposed, quite literally, if the observatory\u2019s sliding roof panel was ever open during a storm, especially if the power went out and the mechanism to close it did not work.This had happened at least once in the past. \u201cThere would be a Ph.D. running like crazy to shut it down, and perhaps that would be the day they tripped and rolled their ankle,\u201d Professor Finn said. The students persuaded the university to spend $2,000 for a backup power unit for the panel.Things don\u2019t always go so smoothly. While taking a close look at the physical environment surrounding the rare books in the library, the students saw that drains above some of the valuable objects were leaking.But if you\u2019re an undergraduate and you need to work with a librarian twice or three times your age to fix what seems, to an insurance underwriter, like an urgent problem, it can be delicate.So did the students issue recommendations or give orders? \u201cBoth,\u201d said Derek DeKoning, the senior who serves as the student insurance company\u2019s chief executive. And did the librarians consider him and his colleagues to be useful or just uppity? \u201cProbably a little bit of both,\u201d he said.Indeed, the librarians\u2019 dean had a talk with Professor Finn\u2019s dean, and he eventually apologized for the fact that the staff felt a bit blindsided.\u201cThey are our allies now,\u201d Professor Finn said. \u201cBut this is what you don\u2019t get in a textbook: how to not freak out a librarian and then how to get him or her unfreaked out if you do.\u201dA earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified an instructor of a class at Butler University that operates an insurance company.

{"Headline": "U.S. Blocks a Chinese Deal Amid Rising Tensions Over Technology", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 United States officials have torpedoed a Chinese state-backed group\u2019s plan to buy an American electronics company, signaling the Trump administration\u2019s continuing skepticism toward Chinese investment deals, particularly those that involve transferring technological know-how.Xcerra, a Massachusetts-based provider of equipment for testing computer chips and circuit boards, said this week that it was withdrawing from its $580 million sale to an investment group backed by a Chinese government-controlled fund.The reason, according to Dave Tacelli, Xcerra\u2019s president and chief executive, was that the deal was not likely to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency Washington panel that operates largely out of the public eye. The committee, known as Cfius, plays an advisory role to the president, but it can effectively block foreign acquisitions of American companies over national security concerns.\u201cDespite our best efforts to secure approval, it has become evident that Cfius will not clear this transaction,\u201d Mr. Tacelli said. The deal would ultimately have been financed by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, a $21 billion fund that counts several Chinese state-run companies as investors.In scuttling the purchase of Xcerra, American officials have struck at a major priority area for China\u2019s innovation policies.Progress so far has been mixed. Despite government subsidies, the technologies at China\u2019s leading chip makers remain generations behind those at Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.In the business of semiconductor assembling, packaging and testing, however, China has surged to become a world leader. Xcerra designs and makes equipment to test chips, but it doesn\u2019t manufacture chips themselves.Advertisement"}

Are you in a relationship? What\u2019s your emotional problem? Why are you so upset about a heart?\u2019\u201dIn preparation for Valentine\u2019s Day, Mr. Halper will be chalking hearts around SoHo today, on Broadway between Canal and Houston Streets.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Warmer weather awaits on Wednesday.The roses, the chocolates, the love notes, the prix fixe menus \u2014 for some, it\u2019s all a little ... triggering.The series, which began on Sunday, continues at locations across the system.Today and tomorrow, you can join a health program exploring Seasonal Affective Disorder.On Thursday, you can see a one-woman show about the tale of Venus and Adonis or \u201cCampfire Heartbreak,\u201d a concert (and time to vent) with comforting country music.This weekend, you can attend a stand-up comedy show about love (or the lack thereof), and discussions with medical professionals about the science behind heartbreak.Alexandra S.

Daily users rose nine million to 187 million, the best growth in over a year. The retention rate of new Android users, a special focus for Snap, jumped nearly 20 percent over the previous year.\u201d\u201cThe company lost $350 million in the quarter, or 13 cents a share, which was narrower than the loss of 16 cents that was expected by analysts. And it also contrasted with the carnage of the prior quarter, when Snap recorded a net loss that was twice the forecast.\u201dThe bigger pictureThe results have helped quell some of the concerns about the company\u2019s slowing revenue and user growth in the face of increased competition from the likes of Facebook.Critics cornerIn the early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump lamented that in the \u201cold days,\u201d stocks would rise on good economic news, saying \u201cToday, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down.

Shear and Alan RappeportIn recent months, many powerful men have had to step down from senior positions as they have faced accusations of sexual harassment, but none were the head of a public company like Mr. Wynn. How would the board, shareholders, regulators, customers and unions react?We now know something about the shareholder perspective: Shares in Wynn Resorts were up 7 percent in early-morning trading today. Regulators in Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau are still conducting their own investigations.But the biggest unresolved question remains the board and its conduct.The board set up a committee of independent directors to carry out an investigation after the WSJ article, but it was not clear how rigorous it would be. The board did not have a track record for holding Mr. Wynn accountable.In an email exchange with me, Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard law professor and an expert in corporate governance, asked why the board did not suspend Mr. Wynn from his position pending the investigation, or demand that he not interact with Wynn Resorts employees, a step that would have limited his ability to influence the board investigation.One remaining way to assess the board\u2019s resolve will be Mr. Wynn\u2019s separation agreement, which is not yet finalized.When the WSJ article was published, Mr. Wynn denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, calling them \u201cpreposterous.\u201d On Tuesday he said, \u201cI have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity.\u201dIt is not clear why Mr. Wynn decided to step down. It may have been pressure from gaming regulators. Customers might have been pulling back.Mr. Wynn may have wanted to preserve the value of his own stake in Wynn Resorts. But as it stands, it does not look like the board was a strong force.\u2014 Peter EavisSteve Wynn has stepped down from his $17 billion casino empire, a little over a week after allegations of forced sex and other sexual misconduct claims emerged in a WSJ investigation.Top executives spent hours with Mr. Wynn going over plans for a new casino he would like to build in Las Vegas, according to a person familiar with the matter, while the company\u2019s general counsel hopped on a call with other executives to discuss the Vegas Strong Fund, a nonprofit formed in the aftermath of last year\u2019s mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, according to a person familiar with the call.He also attended the company\u2019s 1,500-guest Super Bowl party on Sunday, the WSJ says.In a statement, Mr. Wynn blamed his exit on \u201ca rush to judgment\u201d that took \u201cprecedence over everything, including the facts.\u201dThe big questions\u2022 Do other S. & P. 500 C.E.O.s now have something to fear?\u2022 And is the Wynn empire \u2014 from Las Vegas to Macau to, soon, Massachusetts \u2014 now ripe for a takeover or breakup?Critics\u2019 cornerLAT staff have chafed at the decisions of Tronc and its chairman, Michael Ferro. More from Sydney Ember of the NYT:Many employees at The Times have of late adopted the mantra \u201canyone but Ferro,\u201d but it is also not clear what decisions Dr. Soon-Shiong, who largely made his fortune selling generic drugs and developing a new type of cancer drug, will make as the paper\u2019s owner.The deals flyaroundAs the stocks calmly glided higher in 2017, investors from hedge fund titans to day traders poured billions in to bets that volatility would continue to fall.Those wagers blew up this week.Now investors are selling the exchange company behind the trading in volatility.Shares of the C.B.O.E.

Thursday they are off 3 percent.Critics cornerBlame the VIX/machines/debt?\u2022 Steven Mnuchin suggested yesterday that algorithms might be behind the whipsawing: \u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions.\u201dOn one side: Brian Chesky, the home rental giant\u2019s co-founder and C.E.O., who wants it kept private a while yet.More from Olivia Zaleski:Despite pledging support for Chesky\u2019s desire to keep Airbnb private, Sequoia Capital partner Alfred Lin, along with Jeff Jordan of Andreessen Horowitz, wanted to explore the possibility. In December, they asked Michael Grimes, the head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, to present options for going public, said people close to the bank.Ultimately, Mr. Tosi \u2014 who didn\u2019t see eye to eye with Mr. Chesky on other issues and generally did not fit in at Airbnb \u2014 resigned.An Airbnb spokesman denied there was ever any intent to pursue an I.P.O. this year.The tech flyaroundMr. Carstens also argued that cryptocurrencies were freeloading on existing financial infrastructure and the legitimacy that came from being linked to it.Most digital currencies are unlikely to survive in their current form, and investors should prepare for coins to lose all their value as they\u2019re replaced by a small set of future competitors, Goldman\u2019s Steve Strongin said in a report dated Feb. 5.\u201cCrazy things can come true.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Slack\u2019s C.F.O.

{"Headline": "5 Takeaways From the Release of the Democratic Memo", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 An application to wiretap a former associate of President Trump\u2019s campaign in fall 2016 \u201cmade only narrow use\u201d of information provided by a former British spy who compiled a notorious dossier about Mr. Trump and Russia, according to a memo released by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee on Saturday.Democrats on the committee wrote the document to counter a Republican memo that portrayed as scandalous the application to wiretap Carter Page, the former Trump campaign associate.The Republican memo accused law enforcement officials of abusing their surveillance powers because they relied on information provided by the former spy, Christopher Steele, without saying his research into purported links between Mr. Trump and Russia was financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.The Democrats, calling the Republican memo deeply misleading, produced the rebuttal to detail what they said were inaccurate claims and material omissions.Here are some key takeaways from the Democratic memo:The Democratic memo says the application made \u201cnarrow use\u201d of information from Mr. Steele\u2019s sources. It describes multiple other categories of information, including yearslong suspicions that Mr. Page was being recruited by Russian spies, and revealed that the F.B.I. had interviewed Mr. Page about his ties to Russian intelligence officials in March 2016.It also discussed Moscow\u2019s apparent overtures to another Trump campaign official and its general meddling during that period, which prompted the F.B.I. to open the Trump-Russia investigation in late July \u2014 before the bureau\u2019s investigative team received Mr. Steele\u2019s information.Some of that material remains redacted in the version of the memo made public on Saturday.By contrast, Republicans have portrayed Mr. Steele\u2019s information as the central focus of the application, filed to the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The Republican memo said it formed \u201can essential part\u201d of the application, and in a separate memo, Senators Charles E. Grassley and Lindsey Graham, Republicans of Iowa and South Carolina, stated that \u201cthe bulk\u201d of the application was Mr. Steele\u2019s information.The Democratic memo also says that what the F.B.I. did use from Mr. Steele did not include the salacious parts of his dossier. Instead, it says, the bureau chiefly relied on the dossier\u2019s claims that Mr. Page had met with a Kremlin official as well as a close associate of President Vladimir V. Putin during a July 2016 trip to Moscow, during which the official offered to provide compromising information about Mrs. Clinton to the Trump campaign.Notably, the Democratic memo also said that in subsequent renewals of the wiretap application, the Justice Department \u201cprovided additional information obtained through multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele\u2019s reporting.\u201dThe Republican memo complained that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was not told that the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. had financed Mr. Steele\u2019s research, suggesting that the judges were misled about the credibility of his information. Democrats have called that claim misleading because the judges were told of a political motive, just without specific names.The Democratic memo provides a verbatim excerpt from the application, which stated that the F.B.I. believed that Mr. Steele had been commissioned by someone \u201clikely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign,\u201d referring to Mr. Trump.The wiretap application included a Yahoo News article from September 2016 that discussed the investigation into Mr. Page\u2019s Russian ties. The Republican memo portrayed the application as having improperly used that article as corroboration of Mr. Steele\u2019s claims, even though it later emerged \u2014 in a spring 2017 court filing \u2014 that Mr. Steele had been a source for it.The Democratic memo calls that a false claim by the Republicans. Instead, it says, the Justice Department referred to the Yahoo News article \u2014 as well as another one the Republican memo failed to mention \u2014 \u201cnot to provide separate corroboration for Steele\u2019s reporting, but instead to inform the court of Page\u2019s public denial of his suspected meetings in Moscow.\u201dThe Republican memo portrayed the wiretapping of Mr. Page as a partisan conspiracy. Notably, the Democratic memo reveals that all four judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court who approved the initial surveillance \u2014 which began in October 2016 \u2014 as well as three 90-day renewals were appointed by Republican presidents.To approve such a wiretap of an American, a judge must decide that there is sufficient evidence that the target is probably an agent of a foreign power, or knowingly aiding foreign agents.When the Justice Department repeatedly sought the court\u2019s permission to renew the surveillance of Mr. Page, the Democratic memo said, it cited new information it was gathering through the wiretap.\u201cThe court-approved surveillance of Page allowed F.B.I. to collect valuable intelligence,\u201d the Democratic memo said. It asserted that the repeated renewals \u201cdemonstrate that the F.B.I. collected important investigative information and leads by conducting court-approved surveillance.\u201dWhat that intelligence was, however, was redacted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Wall Street Writes Its Own Rules", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionOn July 25, 2013, a high-ranking federal law enforcement officer took a public stand against malfeasance on Wall Street. Preet Bharara, then the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, held a news conference to announce one of the largest Wall Street criminal cases the American justice system had ever seen.Steven A. Cohen, the founder of SAC and one of the world\u2019s wealthiest men, was never criminally charged, but his company would end up paying $1.8 billion in civil and criminal fines, one of the largest settlements of its kind. He denied any culpability, but his reputation was still badly \u2014 some might argue irreparably \u2014 damaged. Eight of his former employees were charged by the government, and six pleaded guilty (a few later had their convictions or guilty pleas dismissed). Mr. Cohen was required to shut his fund down and was prohibited from managing outside investors\u2019 money until 2018.Now, with the prohibition having expired in December, Mr. Cohen has been raising money from investors and is set to start a new hedge fund. He\u2019ll find himself in an environment very different from the one he last operated in. His resurrection arrives as Wall Street regulation is under assault and financiers are directing tax policy and other aspects of the economy \u2014 often to the benefit of their own industry. Mr. Cohen is a powerful symbol of Wall Street\u2019s resurgence under President Trump.As the stock market lurched through its stomach-turning swings over the past week, it was hard not to worry that Wall Street could once again torpedo an otherwise healthy economy and to think about how little Mr. Trump and his Congress have done to prepare for such a possibility. Stock market turbulence typically prompts calls for smart and stringent financial regulation, which is not part of the Trump agenda. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s first acts as president was to fire Mr. Bharara, who made prosecuting Wall Street crime one of his priorities. Mr. Trump has also given many gifts to people like Mr. Cohen.On the presidential campaign trail, Mr. Trump made promises to help working-class Americans \u2014 the \u201cforgotten men and women\u201d who have seen their opportunities for meaningful economic advancement decline over the past two decades, even as those at the top of the economic ladder have become even wealthier. Once in office, he abandoned many of those promises. Instead, he has placed the considerations of high finance at the top of his priorities, far exceeding what even his friends at big banks, hedge funds and private equity firms could have hoped for.The most potent evidence may be found in the handling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers against unfair practices by banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions. Its first permanent director, the former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray, ran the agency aggressively, to the loud protest of the banking industry and its Republican allies in Congress.After Mr. Cordray\u2019s departure in November, Mr. Trump replaced him with the White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who once described the agency as a \u201cjoke.\u201d Mr. Mulvaney immediately started cutting back its power. The agency must ask for new funding each quarter; its most recent request was for $0, which suggests that he intends to starve it of cash.There are other signs of Wall Street\u2019s rising influence. The new tax act passed by Mr. Trump\u2019s party includes an array of benefits for the investor class. During the campaign, Mr. Trump promised to eliminate the \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole, which gives many hedge fund and private equity fund managers tax rates that are lower than those of most people who pay income tax. He declared that hedge fund managers were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d through their extra-low taxes.Regulators who police the financial markets have been told in ways that are subtle and not so subtle to pull back on aggressive enforcement. Republicans, with the help of some Democrats, are taking steps to weaken the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010 with the intent of making the financial system safer and of discouraging certain kinds of risk-taking by banks and other financial firms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor Wants City Charter Revision to Tackle Campaign Finance", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio will use the first State of the City address of his second term to announce a plan to change the City Charter as a way to improve the city\u2019s campaign finance system.Mr. de Blasio, who was plagued during his first term by ethical questions over his political fund-raising and the favors he did for deep-pocketed donors, will announce his plan on Tuesday night in his annual address, according to his press secretary, Eric F. Phillips.The mayor will direct the commission \u2014 whose members he will appoint \u2014 to lower the limits for allowable campaign contributions to political candidates significantly, Mr. Phillips said. Donors currently can give candidates for citywide office no more than $4,950 during a four-year election cycle, while they can give a City Council candidate a maximum of $2,750.\u201cWe need a charter revision commission, we need to go at the specific idea that one of the things that most discourages people is money in politics,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Monday night on NY1. \u201cPeople want to get money out of the political process as much as possible.\u201dThe mayor is also expected to propose a more generous model for public financing of elections, Mr. Phillips said. He said the commission will also be directed to consider possible reforms to the city\u2019s Board of Elections and to find ways to promote greater voter participation.One area that he will not instruct it to examine will be the issue of outside nonprofit groups created to take donations to support an elected official\u2019s policies, like the Campaign for One New York, which was created for Mr. de Blasio, and whose efforts were later examined by state and federal investigators. Mr. Phillips said it was not necessary because the city had already passed a law limiting donations to such groups.The path to election reform is somewhat muddled; most rules governing contribution limits and the matching funds program that provides public money to candidates are derived from legislation passed by the City Council. In addition, the Board of Elections is governed by state law, and it was not clear how it might be altered through changes to the City Charter.Voters would have to decide on any proposals from the commission in a referendum. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s commission will seek to complete its work in time for voters to consider them in November, Mr. Phillips said.In calling for a charter revision, Mr. de Blasio is using a tactic beloved by his two most recent predecessors, Michael R. Bloomberg and Rudolph W. Giuliani, who convened charter revision commissions on some six different occasions. Those commissions were often criticized as being too closely controlled by the mayor and too narrowly focused \u2014 sometimes with the goal of pushing pet projects or political initiatives or seeking policy changes that would have been more appropriately handled as legislation by the City Council.Before that, a highly respected charter revision commission was created by Mayor Edward I. Koch and passed by voters in 1989. It led to far-reaching changes in the way city government is organized.Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., the chairman of the 1989 commission, said that he was briefed on the mayor\u2019s proposal by a City Hall aide on Monday and approved of the focus on voting and campaign finance changes. \u201cI think it\u2019s an extremely good idea,\u201d Mr. Schwarz said.He said that the key to a successful revision was whether the commission is independent of the mayor. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to say, \u2018Here are subjects I\u2019d like you to look at,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schwarz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad way to say, \u2018Here is what you have to do.\u2019\u201dA spokeswoman for City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who has vowed to lead a more independent Council, noted that the Council is considering its own legislation to convene a charter review commission.That charter revision legislation would create a different sort of commission, whose members would be appointed by the Council, the mayor and other elected officials.\u201cWe\u2019re a little upset because we would like to make sure that it\u2019s a real charter revision and not something you get called five minutes before the appointments are made,\u201d said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president who worked with the public advocate, Letitia James, to have the legislation introduced.She said that she would like to see consideration of changes that give the City Council more control over the way money is budgeted and spent by city agencies, among other reforms.\u201cThe issue is, a charter revision commission should be independent, it should be a wide base of appointments from different entities of city government,\u201d Ms. Brewer said.Mr. de Blasio will announce other programs on Tuesday to encourage voting and other types of civic engagement. Those include an effort to encourage people to participate in the 2020 federal census and a program, to be led by a newly created chief democracy officer, to get more people to register to vote. He will expand a program to encourage 17-year-olds to register to vote and he will provide money to enhance computer security at the Board of Elections.On Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo proposed adding money to the state budget to provide for a statewide early voting system, in which some polling stations would be open during the 12 days before an election.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the Manhattan borough president.

So what exactly should you look for in an app\u2019s privacy policy?We looked at dozens of apps that promise to help you make money from the comfort of your smartphone, and most of them aren\u2019t worth your time. Some, however, do what they promise, even if the trade-off is a good bit of your personal data.If you\u2019re willing to trade, the following (free) apps are well established and can legitimately help you earn cash back. No, you won\u2019t fund your retirement or put a down payment on your home, but you can earn a few bucks to pay for your latte \u2014 or dare we suggest avocado toast?If you don\u2019t mind searching the web, answering surveys or watching videos, you can earn a few \u201cSwagbucks,\u201d which you can then trade in for gift cards at places like Amazon, Starbucks and Home Depot.Shopkick rewards you for shopping at stores you probably visit anyway: CVS, Marshalls and Best Buy are a few of its partner retailers.\u201cShopkick I primarily use in Target,\u201d Ms. Lowe said. \u201cBecause why not get rewarded when you\u2019re there?

It is the latest sign of discontent among athletes over the handling of the Russian doping scandal, which corrupted the 2014 Winter Olympics as well as scores of other events across several years.Russian officials were not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for the International Biathlon Union declined to comment.The International Olympic Committee\u2019s executive board is meeting Saturday to determine whether to lift the suspension on Russia\u2019s National Olympic Committee and allow its athletes to march with the Russian flag during Sunday\u2019s closing ceremony for the Pyeongchang Games.Doping by Russian athletes infested biathlon for years. The revelations in 2016 unmasked the larger state-led doping program. Yet the I.B.U. has resisted calls to move events from the country, saying those decisions were made before the World Anti-Doping Agency declared Russia\u2019s antidoping noncompliant.\u201cThe I.B.U.\u2019s recent decision to move forward with the World Cup Final in Tyumen, Russia, is completely unacceptable,\u201d the U.S. athletes said in a statement.Their decision follows a similar stand made by the Canadian team. Czech officials, cited by the French news agency Agence France-Presse, said their athletes would also boycott the event. Sweden\u2019s Sebastian Samuelsson said his team was also poised to boycott events in Russia. Samuelsson won a silver medal in Pyeongchang last week.\u201cThe outcry from our fellow athletes from around the world has been respectful, strong and definitive. In addition to the dozens who expressed their opinion to the I.B.U. Athletes Committee members ahead of the meeting in January 2018, the I.B.U. received letters representing over 30 athletes, from eight countries, and included three 2018 Olympic Champions,\u201d the American statement added.The World Anti-Doping Agency has declared Russia\u2019s drug testing authority noncompliant, a status it says it will maintain until Russia publicly accepts that there was a state-backed doping program and allows WADA officials full access to data from the main testing laboratory in Moscow.Russian biathletes were among scores of athletes barred from competing at the 2018 Games after an investigation into the doping conspiracy, which involved the state security apparatus clandestinely switching tainted urine samples for clean ones.The former I.O.C. President Jacques Rogge in 2011 was so concerned about the country\u2019s biathlon federation that he urged Russia\u2019s president at the time, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to take stronger action. Grigory Rodchenkov the former head of Russia\u2019s doping laboratory, who became a whistle-blower, said in a sworn statement that billionaire Brooklyn Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov played a role in obscuring the scheme when he led the Russian Biathlon Union. Prokhorov, who denies the claim, is helping to financed a New York defamation suit against Rodchenkov by three banned biathletes.Russia\u2019s doping problems have overshadowed the participation of more than 160 of its athletes in Korea. They have participated under the I.O.C.\u2019s flag and worn neutral uniforms, a condition of their entry into the Games.Two of the four athletes to fail drug tests here have been Russian, with the most recent failure coming Friday, on the eve of the critical I.O.C. meeting that will rule on the status of its banned Olympic Committee and what happens at the closing ceremony.Rebecca R.

After a sip or two by tailgates, some headed out in search of a meal, their tourist dollars funneled into a downtown betting on a rebound.\u201cWe are having an impact on the community, for sure,\u201d said Ricardo Petroni, a co-owner of Equilibrium, which opened in 2016 in a former meatpacking plant that had been seized over nonpayment of taxes. \u201cWhen we moved here, you could see old scars of bad times,\u201d Mr. Petroni added, \u201cbut you can tell that now, new things are flourishing.\u201dAcross the country, in once-bustling manufacturing centers, breweries are giving new fizz to sleepy commercial districts. If alcohol-based businesses were blamed for a breakdown of society in the Prohibition era and beyond, breweries are now being seen as a force for good.\u201cThe economic ripple effects are definitely there,\u201d said David Barnett, a Chicago-based senior research analyst for JLL, the commercial brokerage firm. Breweries \u201ccreate a cool tourism aspect for out-of-towners, but it\u2019s been good for residents as well.\u201dAlthough they are small, those breweries pack an economic jolt. In 2016, they contributed about $68 billion to the national economy, the association said.The Northeast, Midwest and West still represent much of the industry, but 36 states doubled their production of craft beer from 2011 to 2016, according to Mr. Barnett, who last year wrote \u201cThe Craft Beer Guidebook to Real Estate,\u201d a JLL report. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to ignore an industry that has grown this much,\u201d he said.In searching for places to make specialty beverages like sour beers and stouts, breweries seemed to adhere to a formula. They like early-20th-century buildings with up to 10,000 square feet and lofty ceilings, said Sandy A. Barin, a vice president with the commercial real estate firm CBRE based in Minneapolis who counts brewers among his clients.Usually renters instead of owners, breweries in Minneapolis typically sign five-year leases and pay $4.50 a square foot annually, Mr. Barin said, although tenants are usually on the hook for renovations, even if landlords offer credits for finishes like paint and carpeting. \u201cThe setup is usually pretty expensive,\u201d he said.Over all, breweries, usually with tap rooms, occupy about 624,000 square feet in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro region, up from 507,000 square feet in 2016. And in 2017, 11 new breweries opened in that area, according to CBRE, with 11 more expected this year.Offering food broadens breweries\u2019 appeal, making a visit to them into \u201cmore of an all-inclusive night out,\u201d Mr. Barin said.Breweries have boomed nationally in the last few years. The industry was on track to post a growth rate of 5 percent in 2017, based on midyear calculations, said Bart Watson, the association\u2019s chief economist. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much of a slowdown,\u201d he said.But in many places, the industry remains highly subsidized, raising questions about whether breweries can make it on their own, and how long that might take.The building that houses Equilibrium, for instance, was sold to the brewery for $260,000, with $225,000 of that forgivable if the brewery remained in business for at least five years, said Mr. Petroni, who along with his partner, Peter Oates, invested $1.4 million to upgrade the property. Ten people work there today.\u201cWe realized in the 1980s and 1990s that industry wasn\u2019t really coming back to any of these cities,\u201d said Maria Bruni, the economic development director of Middletown. \u201cOur community is very supportive because we\u2019ve been staring at these buildings for 20 years and doing nothing.\u201dFinancing from New York State, which under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has become a major backer of the brewing industry, seems to also be a key. Equilibrium, for example, has so far received $204,000 in state grants.Though breweries are plentiful, none were on the city\u2019s west side, a blue-collar former furniture-making center, when Mr. Andrus and his partner, Max Trierweiler, sought to open one in a dormant 1891 firehouse. Neighbors who were worried that another bar would hurt the struggling area spoke out at zoning meetings, he said.But opponents may have come around since the brewery opened in 2012. Mitten closes earlier than bars in the area, Mr. Andrus said, \u201cand we attract a lot of families.\u201d The brewery, which is profitable, seems to have also attracted investment in the neighborhood. Across the street is a gin distillery, in a former clothing store, and another corner has a barbecue joint, in a former hamburger stand. Other breweries have also arrived in the area.Perhaps unsurprisingly, property values are also on the rise. Mitten\u2019s 6,000-square-foot firehouse, which cost $220,000, is worth about $600,000, Mr. Andrus said, which is \u201clargely because of us.\u201dWhether craft breweries are a fad or will endure may come down to drinkers\u2019 tastes, but evidence suggests passion for the product is high.On that January day in Middletown, Bob Helligrass and Jaime Loughridge, friends from the Albany area, sat eating lunch at Tapped, a bistro next to Equilibrium that opened around the same time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slovak Journalist Found Shot to Death at Home", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRATISLAVA, Slovakia \u2014 A 27-year-old Slovak journalist who had been investigating corruption has been found shot to death at his home along with his fianc\u00e9e, the authorities said Monday.The killing \u2014 which appeared to be the first targeted slaying of a journalist in Slovakia\u2019s modern history \u2014 was immediately condemned by officials, who vowed to investigate.The journalist, Jan Kuciak, and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Kusnirova, both 27, appear to have been killed on Thursday in the village of Velka Maca, in western Slovakia, according to the office of the general prosecutor. Their bodies were found on Sunday after Ms. Kusnirova\u2019s mother was unable to reach her.Ms. Kusnirova was shot in the head and Mr. Kuciak in the chest, the authorities said.\u201cIf it turned out that the death of the investigative reporter was connected to his work, it would mean an unprecedented attack on the freedom of press and democracy in Slovakia,\u201d Prime Minister Robert Fico said in a statement.The killings were condemned by the European Union and by journalists across Slovakia.\u201cMurder of journalists is a clear sign of a crime against one of the most important pillars of liberty: freedom of speech and the right of citizens to check the powerful and those who break the law,\u201d a group of top Slovak news editors said in a statement. They were joined by colleagues from the Czech Republic \u2014 which until the end of 1992 was joined with Slovakia as one country \u2014 and from Reporters Without Borders and other human rights groups.\u201cThe E.U. cannot accept that a journalist is killed for doing his job,\u201d he said. \u201cI call on Slovak authorities to launch a thorough investigation, with international support, if needed, for Jan Kuciak.\u201d\u201cWe are shocked and stunned about the message that Jan Kuciak and his companion obviously have been the victim of a cruel assassination,\u201d the company said in a statement. It said that if the crime was intended \u201cto deter\u201d the company from uncovering any misconduct, \u201cwe will use this as an opportunity to take our journalistic responsibility\u201d with even greater determination.At a news conference, the top police official, Tibor Gaspar, said the killings were most likely connected to Mr. Kuciak\u2019s reporting. Investigators were trying to piece together what he had been working on most recently.The country\u2019s elite was unified in condemning the deaths, and the government offered a reward of 1 million euros to anyone with information leading to the killer or killers.\u201cI am shaken and terrified that something like this could happen in Slovakia,\u201d President Andrej Kiska said in a statement. \u201cThe coldblooded murder of young people is an atrocity that has to be punished. We have to find the people who did this and secure the safety of journalists.\u201dThe justice minister, Lucia Zitnanska, said in a statement: \u201cSlovakia can\u2019t be a country where journalists are murdered.\u201dMr. Kuciak, who studied journalism in Nitra, Slovakia, had written about shady financing or tax evasion in companies connected to well-known Slovak oligarchs and businessmen, many of them linked to the governing party, or to two powerful men: Robert Kalinak, the interior minister, and Jan Pociatek, a former finance minister. His most recent articles focused on a Slovak oligarch, Marian Kocner, and his companies.In October, Mr. Kuciak wrote on Facebook that he had filed a report on Mr. Kocner for threatening him the previous month. Mr. Kocner, he wrote, said that he would \u201ccollect dirt\u201d on the reporter and his family and would not stop until he would \u201cnever write anything again.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Kocner issued a statement deploring the killings and calling allegations that he had threatened Mr. Kuciak absurd.Last fall, Mr. Kalinak, the interior minister, ridiculed journalists who asked about the threats. \u201cThis is what you do, dig up dirt,\u201d he said.Slovakia joined the European Union in 2004 and is generally seen as having a robust legal system. Last year, it was ranked 17th in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index. However, media ownership is heavily concentrated in the hands of a few businesspeople, and dissenting voices often face pressure.Veronika Remisova, an opposition lawmaker, said that Mr. Fico, the prime minister, and Andrej Danko, the speaker of Parliament, had created an environment of hostility for journalists by demeaning and criticizing them publicly. She and other opposition politicians called for Mr. Kalinak, the interior minister, to step down because, they said, the police had failed to protect Mr. Kuciak.On Monday night, candles were lit in Bratislava and other cities in Slovakia and in Prague in memory of the slain journalist and his fianc\u00e9e.Peter Nagy, another journalist, said he and his wife, who is expecting a baby in three months, were planning a demonstration on March 13 to demand accountability.\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be born to a society where people are afraid to speak up and journalists are afraid to work,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cMurder of a journalist is a murder of society, of the voice of public and of our values.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Republican Advantages Are Eroding in the Race for House Control", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetirements and reversals in gerrymandering give Democrats a clearer path to a majority. Slowly but surely, the considerable structural advantages \u2014 like incumbency, geography and gerrymandering \u2014 that give the Republicans a chance to survive a so-called wave election are fading, giving Democrats a clearer path to a House majority in November.The Republicans still retain formidable advantages, enough to win the House while losing the national popular vote by a wide margin. But their edge has shrunk considerably over the last few months, and even more over the last few years. One way to think about it is how well Democrats would need to do on the generic ballot \u2014 a poll question that asks voters whether they\u2019ll vote for Democrats or Republicans for Congress \u2014 to win the House. A bigger Republican structural advantage means the G.O.P. can withstand a larger Democratic advantage on the generic ballot.By this measure, the Republican advantage has probably dropped by about two percentage points since 2014, when Republicans won the party\u2019s largest House majority since 1929. Since then, four court rulings have softened or even torn up Republican gerrymanders in four big states: Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and most recently Pennsylvania, where the state Supreme Court struck down the congressional map last month. The decisions in Florida, North Carolina and Virginia have already cost the Republicans a net of three House seats while generally eroding their position elsewhere in those states, giving Democrats better opportunities in 2018. It\u2019s too early to have a good idea of how much Republicans might lose in Pennsylvania, but it is reasonable to expect that the new map will cost the party at least one seat and erode its position in several others.Over all, the number of G.O.P. retirements in plausibly competitive districts isn\u2019t extraordinarily high. But some of the Republican retirements have been especially damaging: longtime incumbents who have a tradition of running far ahead of the national party and dissuading strong challengers, like New Jersey\u2019s Frank LoBiondo or Pennsylvania\u2019s Charlie Dent. Their retirements could easily be the difference between a non-competitive race and a Democratic victory. As measured by biographical indicators like military experience or past elected officials, Democratic recruitment is only somewhat above average at this stage. But much like the Republican retirements, the best Democratic recruits have often been extremely valuable. Often, Democrats have succeeded in finding their very best candidates in white working-class districts where President Trump fared well in 2016. His strength threatened to move many traditional battlegrounds into the Republican column. The Democratic path to a House majority arguably looked even more difficult after the 2016 presidential than it did before \u2014 even though Democrats picked up seven seats in that election, since so many traditional battleground districts swung hard for Mr. Trump.In contrast, the Democrats don\u2019t have much of a bench at all in many of the well-educated but traditionally Republican districts where Mr. Trump struggled the most. Here it\u2019s the Democratic fund-raising that is most impressive. Last quarter, 134 Democrats in 83 districts raised at least $100,000 in individual contributions. Those successes have been disproportionately concentrated in well-educated areas. It\u2019s the working-class districts where Democrats are likeliest to have true recruiting holes, like New York\u2019s 24th or California\u2019s 21st. That might seem somewhat odd because Democrats have had so much success luring top-tier candidates in working-class districts. Advertisement"}

Federal ownership of these assets can result in sub-optimal investment decisions and create risk for taxpayers.While the Blackstone Group is raising $40 billion for its own infrastructure fund (half of which is coming from Saudi Arabia), it\u2019s hard to see private investors filling in the $1.3 trillion required to fulfill the Trump administration\u2019s vision.To break it down numerically:\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe recent, complacency-shaking declines in stock prices will have forced investors to take more seriously the yardsticks used to assess whether stocks are worth buying. None of the metrics on their own reliably can predict the direction of stocks, but when markets are freaking out and much is a blur, well-chosen indicators can steady the nerves and clarify the mind.The most important indicator right nowIt\u2019s the 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price. A higher yield reflects greater inflation fears among investors \u2014 and a higher likelihood of that interest rates are going up.Stock investors fear higher interest rates for two main reasons:\u2022 Most immediately, they make stock valuations look less attractive\u2022 In the longer term, they can eventually slow economic growth.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has retreated to 2.83 percent Monday, while United States stocks are trading higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all up more than 0.5 percent.Adding to the funThe government inflation figures come out on Wednesday.The valuation questionThe recent volatility in the stock market has stirred up the valuation debate. Put more directly, did the declines take stock prices down to level where they no longer look expensive?Still, history shows why that might not be the case. In 1997, the rule of 20 gave roughly the same answer as we have now, but stocks kept zooming higher. (Of course, that bull run did not end well. By 2001, the stock market was down below 1997 levels.)If you find the debate over valuation unsatisfactory ...There are also technical indicators, which look at how traders react to a wide selection of market measurements. One of the most interesting right now is the 200-day moving average on the S.&P. 500.But at one point Friday, it looked like that was where things were heading. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, or 2539, before recovering and closing the week above 2619, up 1.5% on the day.The 200-day moving average\u2014the continually updated average price of the past 200 days\u2014is considered a strong measure of investor sentiment. If the S&P 500 had continued to fall below the average, it would have conveyed real bearishness. The S&P 500 hasn\u2019t closed below that moving average in 408 trading sessions, going back to around the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, according to LPL Financial.\u2014 Peter EavisIt really is a remarkable achievement by Fuji. Without putting up any cash, they will acquire majority control and ownership of a venerable American icon. In exchange, we \u2013 the existing Xerox shareholders \u2013 will receive (1) an additional, indirect 25% interest in a Fuji subsidiary that just last year disclosed a $360 million accounting scandal caused by a \u201cculture of concealment\u201d and Fuji\u2019s failure to have adequate management systems and (2) a one-time special dividend financed with our own assets.The backstoryAt the end of last year, Mr. Icahn launched a campaign to unseat the Xerox\u2019s board, and late last month, he and Mr. Deason pressured the company to explore a deal \u2014 including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture.Xerox said it \u201cconsidered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the \u2018best path to create value\u2019 for the company.\u201d\u2014 Stephen GrocerHere are some of Mr. Tan\u2019s comments:On concerns the deal won\u2019t win regulatory approval and Broadcom\u2019s offer of an $8 billion breakup fee if it doesn\u2019t:\u201cYou know, I\u2019m kind of a frugal guy.

Combined with her deep private sector background, Dina will be a source of ideas and inspiration for our students.\u201dMany had been wondering where Ms. Powell would go after her tenure in the Trump administration.

The party failed to win a parliamentary majority, and a coalition led by Ms. Ardern\u2019s center-left Labour Party formed the government.The new opposition leader, Simon Bridges, the youngest of the contenders at 41, billed himself as the candidate offering a \u201cgenerational change.\u201d Five lawmakers ran for the post to lead the National Party\u2019s 56 members in Parliament.Paula Bennett will retain her role as deputy leader.Mr. Bridges, a former prosecutor who cited his \u201cyoung family\u201d in interviews ahead of the vote, will now lead the effort to defeat Ms. Ardern, 37, in New Zealand\u2019s 2020 election.Mr. Bridges was minister for transport and for economic development in the previous National-led government, and has represented the city of Tauranga since 2008.

But before they set off, their guide, a bearded, pony-tailed man who resembled a storybook Jesus, warned them in jest: \u201cThere is no insurance for this tour, which makes it very Lebanese.\u201dOver the next four hours, the guide, Ronnie Chatah, pointed out sites associated with Lebanon\u2019s civil war, discoursed upon the protests and assassinations that have punctuated the city\u2019s more recent history, and even showed his guests what may or may not be the birthplace of Keanu Reeves.The tour, which Mr. Chatah gives every Sunday afternoon, also seeks to bring to life the culture and history of a Middle Eastern capital better known internationally for its wars and assassinations than for its architecture and archaeology.While he mentions his father\u2019s killing during the tour and points out his grave next to a mosque downtown, he does not dwell on it and refrains from casting blame, seeking to give what he calls \u201can impartial tale of a complicated city\u2019s past.\u201d\u201cThe hardest thing to do is to access Beirut\u2019s history,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are walking alone, you\u2019ll miss the whole story.\u201dThat history is rather expansive. A Mediterranean seafront city of about 2.2 million, Beirut has been home over the centuries to Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs and many others. Its last century alone has been packed with momentous events involving the Ottomans; the French; the Palestinians; a 15-year civil war; a war between Israel and Hezbollah, the militant group and political party; and a large refugee influx from neighboring Syria.But there is little public commemoration of any of it.Many of the city\u2019s historic sites are neglected and unmarked, or they have been bulldozed to make way for apartment blocks. Scars from the civil war, which ended in 1990, are everywhere, mostly bullet holes and shrapnel markings on buildings. But that conflict\u2019s history is not taught in public schools because the subject is still so contested and politically and emotionally sensitive.Mr. Chatah\u2019s tour is one modest effort to remedy this historical amnesia for anyone with $20 and four free hours on a Sunday afternoon.This week, a few dozen people showed up in a plaza on the city\u2019s west side near an airline office and a cafe to take the tour. They were a mix of foreigners and local residents \u2014 a Swedish couple with two boys; some Italian aid workers; an engineer for Lebanon\u2019s national airline; some British finance workers on vacation; a woman with blue hair.After an introduction, Mr. Chatah led the way through 13 stops, pointing out landmarks, telling stories and explaining the roots of Lebanon\u2019s peculiarities. On the steps of the Central Bank, for example, he explained how the country\u2019s currency had crashed during the civil war, leading it to be pegged at about 1,500 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, a rate that still stands.The group passed the First Armenian Evangelical Church, where he talked about the Lebanese diaspora \u2014 Lebanese expatriates greatly outnumber Lebanese living inside the country \u2014 as well as the country\u2019s complex political system and its 18 recognized religious sects.And standing between a beautifully maintained historic mansion and an old house collapsing into a weed-filled lot, he explained why development in the city had been so uneven. Disputes between far-flung relatives often prevented the unanimity needed to sell property, and the government lacked the power to declare eminent domain and intervene.The most glaring example of such a property dispute, he said, involves Beirut\u2019s Holiday Inn. He called it \u201cthe largest headache we have in this city, the headache we can\u2019t solve.\u201dThe huge, 26-story tower opened to great fanfare in 1974, but closed the next year when the civil war broke out and gunmen moved in to take advantage of its commanding views of downtown. Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, moved in for a while but was later pushed out, and the city\u2019s many other fighters struggled to control the building or shell their enemies who were holed up inside.The building is now a towering concrete shell covered with bullet holes, its owners unable to agree on whether to sell it or redevelop the site, Mr. Chatah said. \u201cThey are waiting for Lebanon to be stable again,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will ever happen.\u201dOther stops included the old Jewish Quarter, now a high-security zone where Saad Hariri, the prime minister, lives. The only trace of Lebanon\u2019s Jews, nearly all of whom have left the country since the war surrounding the creation of Israel, is the Maghen Abraham Synagogue, a white building with yellow trim and Hebrew lettering above the entrance.Given the sensitivities around anything having to do with Judaism or Israel, the synagogue is not open to the public. It is not even visible from public streets.Near the end, the tour stopped in Martyrs\u2019 Square, the traffic-clogged center of the city. There, Mr. Chatah told his tour group, the Ottomans once hanged people and the Lebanese protested against French rule and, much later, both for and against the presence of the Syrian Army in Lebanon. The latter side got its way when the Syrians pulled out in 2005.The tour itself has ridden the waves of Beirut\u2019s tribulations.Mr. Chatah began it in the late 2000s, when tourists traveling between Istanbul, Cairo and Damascus often stopped in Beirut. He was soon giving tours seven days a week, he said.But after the conflict in Syria broke out in 2011 and a wave of new bombings and assassinations shook the city, business tapered off and the tourists were gradually replaced by aid workers.\u201cI rode that roller coaster that went from tourism to conflict tourism,\u201d Mr. Chatah said.Then, on Dec. 27, 2013, his father was killed and he decided to leave the country, spending a few years in Scotland to write and grieve.As with most political assassinations in Lebanon, there have been no investigations or arrests in his father\u2019s killing, he said. But being away made him realize that he loved Beirut in a way he had not before. So he returned last year and soon revived the tours, considering them a tribute to his father.Most people on the tour knew Mr. Chatah\u2019s history but said it made little difference in how he laid out the city\u2019s history.\u201cWe all have personal history here,\u201d said Rosy Raggi, who took the tour with six other Lebanese friends. \u201cHis personal history is not as important as how he tells the story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel Strikes New Deal With Old Partners, at a High Cost", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it was telling that Ms. Merkel, in power for 12 years, looked more weary than jubilant.The new deal with the same old coalition partners \u2014 her conservative alliance and the left-leaning Social Democrats \u2014 is precisely the government that Germans had voted against in inconclusive elections last September. It leaves the far-right Alternative for Germany as the country\u2019s leading opposition party. And it comes at a high cost for Ms. Merkel, the incredible shrinking chancellor, who had to relinquish key ministries.But what is troubling for many Germans is not necessarily bad news for Europe, which for years has depended on stability in Berlin and has been waiting in limbo as Ms. Merkel stumbled toward a deal.The new arrangement must still be approved by the Social Democrats\u2019 rank and file. But if endorsed, the coalition may provide France\u2019s new president, Emmanuel Macron, with the partner he has been looking for to help buck up the European Union and move it away from the austerity policies that were identified with Ms. Merkel\u2019s old team and often blamed for stifling growth.In the new coalition, the powerful German Finance Ministry, once led by a hard-line Merkel ally, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, will be run by a Social Democrat. The party was critical of the government\u2019s tightfisted policies and may prove more flexible.\u201cA slightly weakened Germany could be one of the things that helps create a sense of a more balanced Europe,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.\u201cCertainly, the fact that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is not finance minister will be greeted with enormous relief,\u201d he said, referring to anger in parts of Europe over painful austerity measures after the eurozone crisis.It is hard to overstate the scope of German influence over European affairs during the Merkel era, especially in economic policy. Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble became the face of the German-led austerity policies imposed on debtor countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal and, especially, Greece. Even as the Obama administration and an array of economists called for looser policies, the Germans held firm.Beyond economics, Ms. Merkel has been the rock of European foreign policy, demanding a tough line on maintaining economic sanctions against Russia after the conflict in Ukraine while other European countries were far less enthusiastic.And it has been Ms. Merkel who has pointedly stood up to President Trump, to the cheers of many Europeans and others who have embraced her as a defender of the liberal order.But now the political landscape has shifted, not only in Germany, but also elsewhere in Europe.The rise of Mr. Macron in France, if celebrated by those who support a stronger European Union, is also being interpreted as a rebalancing of power away from Berlin.But France still needs Germany, not least to help bridge a growing rift between east and west on the Continent. Nationalist leaders in Central and Eastern Europe, led by Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, are challenging the liberal consensus at the heart of the European bloc.The window to reshape Europe is short: Come fall, the last leg of the Brexit talks, a hard-fought election in the German state of Bavaria and the prospect of European elections will make it harder.The answer of Ms. Merkel and the Social Democrats \u2014 in no small part to persuade Germans that their \u201cgrand coalition\u201d straddling left and right was still needed \u2014 was to cast their lot fully with the mission to salvage the European project.In what is otherwise a fairly unexciting governing pact, the Europe chapter \u2014 short and vague, but prominently displayed on the first five pages of the 177-page document \u2014 stands out.\u201cA New Departure for Europe!\u201d its ambitious headline reads, before listing proposals that include working toward greater powers for the European Parliament and creating a European Monetary Fund to help protect the eurozone against financial crises. Not all of Mr. Macron\u2019s most prominent proposals, like a European finance minister, are featured in the coalition document.But Germany will increase its contribution to the European Union budget, the paper pledges. And it will cooperate with Europe on defense and migration.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that Europe is the first chapter in a German coalition treaty,\u201d said Henrik Enderlein of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. \u201cThis is a clear signal that the government wants to work with President Macron on reforming and strengthening Europe.\u201d\u201cOn the open-to-closed spectrum, this was a signal for openness,\u201d he added.But unlike in France, where Mr. Macron ran on a transparently pro-European platform, campaigning with a European flag and playing the European anthem on election night, Europe hardly featured on the German campaign trail.\u201cThe challenge is that this was never tested in a real election,\u201d Mr. Leonard said.Alternative for Germany immediately dismissed Wednesday\u2019s deal as proof that Europe\u2019s elites were ignoring the concerns of ordinary voters once again.\u201cOne wonders, why Mr. Macron doesn\u2019t just move into the Chancellery,\u201d scoffed Alexander Gauland, a former member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives who became a lawmaker for Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD. Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives, he said, had betrayed their values and become \u201can empty shell.\u201dThe fact that the Interior Ministry\u2019s portfolio was broadened to include a \u201cheimat\u201d \u2014 homeland \u2014 department to address issues of identity and integration did nothing to appease the AfD. Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, a well-known far-right firebrand in the party, called the coalition deal \u201cun-German.\u201dSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, a tired-looking Ms. Merkel praised the deal as the \u201cbasis of a good and stable government, which our country needs, and which many around the world expect from us.\u201dFor many, the coalition deal represented a bittersweet success, a sort of short-term fix with potentially steep political costs: a backlash in the making that could push ever more voters to the extremes.In the two years since Ms. Merkel opened Germany\u2019s door to more than a million migrants, the country\u2019s political landscape has changed drastically, and much of the chancellor\u2019s ability to forge consensus has eroded.All three parties now returning to government had their worst election results since the 1940s.\u201cThe Merkel era is synonymous with a strong and stable Germany; that\u2019s what we had for the last decade,\u201d Mr. Enderlein said. \u201cThat era is coming to an end. And we don\u2019t yet know what comes after.\u201dThere is no guarantee that this coalition will last a full term, he said. There is not even a guarantee that it will happen: The unhappy grass roots of the Social Democratic Party still need to approve it by postal ballot and many balk at the thought.Two stints as Ms. Merkel\u2019s junior partners saw the party\u2019s vote share slump from 34 percent in 2005 to 20 percent in September. Recent polls give it 17 percent support, just two percentage points more than the AfD. Some worry that another four years in a coalition could see the AfD overtake the Social Democrats.But the alternative may be no better: If the coalition collapses and Germany is forced to call a snap election, the extremes will benefit \u2014 both inside and outside the main parties, analysts predict.\u201cThis is the worst possible outcome,\u201d said Mr. Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cexcept for all the other ones.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to the Social Democrats. The party had control of the Finance and Foreign Ministries from 2005 to 2009. It is not a first for a junior coalition party.Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Planners of Deadly Charlottesville Rally Are Tested in Court", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThere is one thing about this case that should be made crystal-clear at the outset,\u201d the suit maintains. \u201cThe violence in Charlottesville was no accident.\u201dThe nine named plaintiffs \u2014 students, clergy members and local residents who say they were hurt in Charlottesville \u2014 have accused the event\u2019s leaders of plotting to deprive them of their civil rights by encouraging their followers to arm themselves and partake in violence. (Heather Heyer\u2019s family is not among the plaintiffs.)The defendants \u2014 an array of neo-Nazis, white identitarians and old-line pro-Confederates \u2014 have ridiculed the charges as an act of \u201clawfare\u201d maliciously intended to silence them and destroy them financially.\u201cThe goal here is to break us and keep us from taking to the streets,\u201d said Jeff Schoep, the leader of the National Socialist Movement. \u201cThat should concern all Americans, no matter where you stand on the political spectrum.\u201dAs the case moves forward, it is likely to explore the limits of the First Amendment\u2019s broad free-speech provisions and the principle that incitements to violence are not protected. Discovery in the case may also expose the links between the far-right groups and their often opaque sources of financing.\u201cI thought you could bring a suit under that same strategy,\u201d Ms. Kaplan said, \u201cagainst the groups in Charlottesville.\u201dMost of the defendants are being represented by two less prominent lawyers: James Kolenich, who is based in Cincinnati, and Elmer Woodard, who works in the Virginia countryside about two hours south of Charlottesville.Before the current case, Mr. Kolenich had never represented a member of the alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and is often anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic and anti-women.In order to prove that a conspiracy existed, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers will have to show that the leaders of the rally worked together in planning and encouraging racially motivated violence. Under the law, if a conspiracy is eventually established, all of its participants can be held accountable for the actions of its separate members.Ms. Kaplan called those leaked communications \u201ca lawyer\u2019s gift,\u201d and she used them in drafting her complaint. They seemed to show a Discord channel for the rally filled with calls for violence.\u201cI\u2019m ready to crack skulls,\u201d one person wrote. Others said they planned to go to Charlottesville with wrenches, pipes and wooden sticks. One man claimed he was going with a cache of rifles that \u201cwill shoot clean through a crowd at least four deep.\u201d There were also plans to shuttle people to the rally grounds in what was called a \u201cHate Van.\u201dOne of the defendants, Michael Peinovich, the co-host of a podcast called \u201cThe Daily Shoah,\u201d downplayed the Discord messages as \u201cidle chitchat\u201d in his motion to dismiss. \u201cEdgy humor and memes are part of Internet subculture,\u201d Mr. Peinovich wrote, \u201cand while some may not understand them, and some may find them offensive, the sharing of such jokes and memes cannot credibly be seen as evidence of a conspiracy to commit violence.\u201dAnother defendant, Richard B. Spencer, one of the country\u2019s most prominent white supremacists, wrote in his dismissal motion that \u201charsh and bold words, as well as scuffles, are simply a reality of political protests.\u201dMr. Spencer, who is representing himself after several lawyers refused to take him as client, went on to say: \u201cFree societies, not only in the United States, but around the world, accept this as a cost of free assembly and maintaining a vibrant political culture.\u201dThe chief planner of the Charlottesville event, Jason Kessler, wrote in an email this month that even though he was initially concerned about the lawsuit, he now considers it an opportunity to \u201cgo on offense.\u201d Mr. Kessler said he plans to use the case to attack the \u201choax narrative\u201d that the right-wing marchers were responsible for the violence.\u201cAfter all the lies about the event are laid out before the public and they realize how badly some very powerful people wanted to shut down our free speech rally,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI think the public will be hungrier than ever to hear what we actually went there to say.\u201dIn a different political climate, Mr. Mehlhorn said, the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division might have investigated and sued the planners of the Charlottesville protest.But, he added, \u201cThese days, we do not expect the Justice Department or government lawyers to pursue any of these actions.\u201dSome experts on far-right extremism question whether the lawsuit will reveal anything beyond what is already known about the far-right groups, that they are hardly rich and tend to crowdsource what money they get.Professor Rosenthal said that rather than ruin the far-right groups, the lawsuit may just push them off the streets and back on to the internet, where they existed quietly for years.\u201cBecause the world is cyber,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s tough to put people entirely out of business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Big Utility Is Embracing Wind and Solar", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsDENVER \u2014 Imagine planning your next trip and finding that Delta was selling first-class seats for less than the cramped middle seats in the back of the plane.So you fly first class to New York and walk into the best French restaurant, only to discover that every dish is cheaper than the burger and fries down the street. Waiter, bring the duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange!Fanciful as that might sound, something a bit like it is happening right now in the world of electricity.Xcel Energy is a utility company with millions of electric customers in the middle of the country, from Texas to Michigan. In booming Colorado, the company asked for proposals to construct big power plants using wind turbines and solar panels.The bids have come in so low that the company will be able to build and operate the new plants for less money than it would have to pay just to keep running its old, coal-burning power plants.You read that right: In parts of the country, wind and solar plants built from scratch now offer the cheapest power available, even counting old coal, which was long seen as unbeatable.So the plan will be cheaper, but why will it be better?Because it will cut Xcel\u2019s emissions. That includes the carbon dioxide that is warming the planet, of course, but it also includes other pollutants, like the fine particles that can send children to the hospital with asthma attacks.Under the leadership of Benjamin Fowke, a gray-haired chief executive trained in finance, Xcel intends to get far ahead of the clean-power requirements that have been imposed by its regulators.Across its eight-state system, Xcel predicts that well over half its electricity will come from renewable sources by the mid-2020s. It will be one of the cleanest large utility companies in the country.Now, to be clear, the low bids that Xcel is getting include some federal subsidies for clean power. Those subsidies are entirely defensible, but both parties in Congress have agreed to phase them out in a couple of years. Mr. Fowke is jumping now in part to lock in the subsidized prices.Yet costs for renewable technologies are coming down so much that by the time the federal subsidies expire, wind turbines and large-scale solar arrays will still be competitive in large parts of the country.The same trend is occurring all over the world, even in countries that do not offer subsidies, with renewable projects routinely beating fossil-fuel projects in countries like Mexico and India. We are confident more price declines are coming.The costs of huge batteries are also falling, and it looks as if they will turn out to be a big help in managing the variability of wind and solar power. Xcel is already testing a battery project near Denver, and it may buy more batteries as part of the new plan.How, exactly, did the cleanest energy technologies get on a path to become the cheapest?In a way, the story is as old as Henry Ford and his Model T, or in more recent times, the amazing progress of computer chips.As they scale up, new technologies often follow a \u201clearning curve\u201d that cuts the cost. But it\u2019s not automatic. You have to build more and more units to drive the prices down.That happened naturally with consumer products like Model Ts and cellphones, since everybody who saw the things wanted one. But the electricity system was a hidebound, monopolistic industry that used to spend virtually nothing on innovation.For decades, utility executives who were wedded to coal regarded solar panels and wind turbines as expensive trinkets. But some farsighted political leaders saw the potential as early as the 1970s.President Jimmy Carter was one. Jerry Brown, then serving as California\u2019s youngest-ever governor, was another. Republican leaders in windy states, like Terry Branstad and Charles Grassley of Iowa, also got on board.A combination of state clean-power mandates and federal subsidies helped to increase the market, as did similar policies in Europe. It has taken a couple of decades, but we are reaching a point where the new energy technologies are going to be cheap enough to drive a lot of the old coal-burning power plants off the market.More ominously, the administration recently imposed costly tariffs on solar panels made in China. That is unquestionably bad for the solar industry, but we think it will turn out to be a temporary setback.The real question now is how fast can the fossil-fuel plants be shut down. Even with favorable economics, human and institutional inertia is such that the remaining coal plants could take a long time to die.States need to find ways to help utilities make the right decisions, perhaps by sharing some of the short-term costs of the shutdowns. They also need to protect workers who lose their jobs, and compensate communities that stand to lose part of their tax base.Despite such concerns, the cost trends are clear, and inexorable. Mr. Fowke has positioned Xcel to take advantage of them, and a handful of other power companies across the country are taking similar steps.But most utilities are still doing only what governments have required of them. With the best power plants becoming the cheapest, isn\u2019t it time for their leaders to seize the future, too?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018An Extraordinary Moment\u2019: Explaining the Russia Inquiry", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow likely would impeachment proceedings be if the Russia investigation uncovers obstruction of justice? Could the inquiry unveil President Trump\u2019s tax returns? Why are anonymous sources necessary to our investigative work?Mark Mazzetti, The Times\u2019s Washington investigations editor, discussed the Russia inquiry in New York on Feb. 13 with fellow Times reporters Michael Schmidt and Scott Shane, and Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at The New School. You can view a recording of the panel below._____However, I said \u201cusually,\u201d and almost everything about this episode is unusual. It would be foolish to try to make predictions with any certainty. The expectation is that Mr. Mueller will deliver his findings to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who will then decide how to proceed from there._____Yes, I would assume that Mr. Mueller has access to any financial documents he wants, including the president\u2019s tax returns. As for \u201cbringing charges,\u201d it is generally assumed that the special counsel won\u2019t bring criminal charges against the president if he finds anything criminal, whether it\u2019s financial crimes or something else. The current Justice Department guidance is that a sitting president cannot be indicted, and most legal experts believe that Mr. Mueller will follow that guidance.Instead, it\u2019s generally assumed that Mr. Mueller would make recommendations to Mr. Rosenstein, who would then pass them along to Congress._____I think your frustration is natural, especially because The Times and other news outlets have been covering an investigation that doesn\u2019t have a clear end. And I agree with you that there is a real danger of creating an anti-Russia hysteria that would be dangerous not only in this country but also overseas.At the same time, I\u2019ll defend the amount of attention that The Times has paid to the Russia story and to Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. It is an extraordinary moment: Intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia took active steps to disrupt an American presidential election, and the Justice Department is investigating whether President Trump or his advisers helped assist that campaign. The investigation has already brought the indictment of the former Trump campaign chairman \u2014 albeit on charges unrelated to Russian collusion \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. during the course of the investigation. These are very significant developments, and reason to keep digging on the story._____It\u2019s still difficult to imagine the circumstances under which the Republican-controlled House of Representatives would move to impeach the president. If Mr. Mueller\u2019s report to Mr. Rosenstein contains evidence of obstruction of justice \u2014 or lays out an argument for why President Trump has broken the law in another way \u2014 then that would certainly increase the pressure on Congress to act in some fashion. If such a report goes to Congress, in theory the House Judiciary Committee could begin impeachment proceedings. Again, that\u2019s very difficult to imagine in the current Congress.If the Democrats retake the House in the November election, then obviously the odds of impeachment proceedings would go up significantly._____The president\u2019s personal lawyers said in November that Mr. Trump had begun to cover his own legal costs. Before then, the Republican National Committee had spent several hundred thousand dollars footing the legal bills.Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has used some of its cash to cover the legal fees for Mr. Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. According to campaign finance filings, the campaign paid nearly $238,000 in July and August to the office of Alan S. Futerfas, the lawyer for Donald Trump Jr._____Many readers raise concerns about the use of anonymous sources, and not just on stories about the Russia investigation. Anonymous sources are not ideal, and we should always try to make available as much information as possible about any motivations or rationale the sources have for remaining anonymous.That said, stories about the Russia investigation \u2014 or any sensitive national security issue \u2014 would not be possible without the use of anonymous sources. During an ongoing federal investigation, much of it involving classified information, sources often will only speak to reporters if they are assured that their names won\u2019t be used. We believe it\u2019s important to get the information they have in order to write stories that get to the facts underlying all the facets of this investigation: from Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the 2016 election, to the contacts between President Trump\u2019s advisers and Russians, to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry.But this doesn\u2019t mean we accept any information, grant anonymity and publish it. We always have to assess the motivations and potential biases of sources, and judge the information they provide against information we get from other sources. Readers need to trust that we don\u2019t publish stories that blindly advance the agenda of anonymous people, and it\u2019s up to us to earn that trust._____Not necessarily. Most legal experts say that colluding \u2014 or working together \u2014 with a foreign power during an election is not illegal in and of itself. Where campaign officials could get into trouble is if they were coordinating with Russia to do something that violates American law. If, for example, campaign officials told Russians to break into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers, then the officials could be in legal jeopardy.__________Your friend is right. The C.I.A. has a long history of so-called influence operations to help favored candidates in foreign elections with money or propaganda, and on a few occasions even helping overthrow elected leaders seen as hostile to the United States. Such operations were more common during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union was often assisting a leftist candidate, and frequently involved open assistance as well as espionage. Election meddling by Americans appears to have become rarer in recent decades, though such covert operations sometimes don\u2019t come to light for years.__________You\u2019re right, there has been vastly more attention paid to what happened in 2016 than what could happen in future elections. That\u2019s true of the media, Congress and most of the rest of the government. Occasionally, members of Congress will speak out about how there needs to be a coordinated focus to prevent the same thing from happening in the November elections and, of course, the next presidential election in 2020, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any comprehensive plan to deal with the problem yet. American law enforcement and intelligence officials have already warned that Russian operations are underway to try to disrupt the 2018 campaign, though it\u2019s unclear exactly what they are seeing at this point.View a recording of our panel \u201cRussia and the 2016 Election: What Lines Were Crossed?\u201d here:Michael S.

Griffin is growing concerned about inflation.\u2022 The Fed\u2019s regulatory action against Wells may have some bite.\u2022 Broadcom puts more pressure on Qualcomm\u2022 How worried should JPMorgan clients be about health care?\u2022 How much more will Wells Fargo have to do?Measured by points, those are steep drops \u2014 the biggest on record for the indexes. The previous largest point declines for each benchmark came in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.But Monday\u2019s plunge was far less impressive on a percentage basis. The Dow\u2019s fall ranked as its 100th biggest, while the S. & P. 500\u2019s slide was the 127th biggest in the index\u2019s history, according to S & P Dow Jones Indices.Here is how Monday\u2019s sell-off stacks up against two other major tumbles.But points are not the best way to compare the magnitude of a stock index\u2019s declines across eras. As the stock market has risen, big point moves have translated into increasingly smaller percentage changes. The Dow and the S. & P. 500 have more than doubled from their closes on Sept. 29, 2008.\u201cBlack Monday\u201d was a petrifying moment \u2014 an even bigger decline in both points and percentage than the stock market crash of 1929. But unlike the 1929 crash, the slide in 1987 did not contribute to a wider economic slump. The stock market recovered its losses by early 1989.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Peter EavisAs the U.S. stock markets look wobbly for the first time in nearly two years, at least one major investor is sounding a bearish tone.In a Jan. 31 letter to investors, Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago hedge-fund firm Citadel, wrote that even though the broader economic backdrop continues to be positive, he sees several warning signs that could turn stock prices downward.The end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy is one factor, Mr. Griffin wrote, that could pressure stocks. But the prospect of inflation, or a rapid rise in the prices of goods and services, is making him especially nervous.\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the nascent signs\u201d of rising inflation in a variety of countries, he wrote. As a result, he added, money managers at Citadel, which runs a variety of hedge funds, are \u201ccarefully positioning\u201d for a surprise, sharp upturn in inflation.Mr. Griffin added that he is also concerned about geopolitical risks, writing that his money managers need to be able to handle negative events if they do occur, \u201cincluding a trade policy misstep or a military conflict.\u201d He did not elaborate.In an interview with CNBC in November, Mr. Griffin said the stock market was in the \u201cseventh inning\u201d of a rally. He said through a spokesman on Monday that he still thinks there are several innings to go before a downturn begins and that he is more bearish on bond prices than stocks at the moment.\u2014 Kate KellyWith 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.The numbers\u202275 percent of companies are reporting earnings above estimates, above the five-year average.\u2022 Companies that are beating estimates are doing so by a 4 percent margin, below the five year average.\u202280 percent of companies have reported revenue above estimates, a record high.\u2022 All 11 sectors are reporting earnings growth.Wells Fargo\u2019s stock is down more than 7 percent Monday, suggesting that investors believe the growth cap will have some bite. With the economy strengthening and interest rates rising, banks can expect to earn higher profits as they make more loans and suffer fewer losses from defaults. Indeed, this optimistic scenario has helped send bank stocks on a tear in recent months. Now, the question is to what degree Wells Fargo will have to sit out the good times.Wells Fargo executives on Friday suggested that the cap would have limited financial impact, saying it would reduce this year\u2019s net profits by $300 million to $400 million, which works out at less than 2 percent of 2017\u2019s earnings. One reason the earnings hit might be small is that the bank can stay within the cap by selling short-term, lower-risk investments that don\u2019t earn much. Another way the bank intends to limit the negative impact is by reducing the amount of deposits on which the bank pays out a relatively high interest rate.Crucially, Wells Fargo said that it hopes to increase the size of its loan book. The hope is that, by shedding the low-risk investments, the bank will create the room to make more mortgages, credit card loans and loans to businesses, while staying within the limit.But it may not turn out to be as straightforward as that.The growth cap comes after a lackluster year for Wells, which reduced its loans 1 percent last year, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent at Bank of America. Investors waiting for catch-up growth at Wells may have to wait still longer. Also, much depends on whether Wells Fargo can now satisfy the Fed\u2019s concerns. Any indication that the bank is struggling to comply with the regulator\u2019s demands could set off more turmoil at the bank. There is also a possibility that the tactic of shedding of low-risk investments while making more loans could increase the overall risk of Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet.Brian Kleinhanzl, a banks analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote on Sunday that the Fed\u2019s action will \u201cmean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,\u201d adding, \u201cWells will also have to maintain the balance sheet while other banks are growing, and we view this as defensive versus peers.\u201d\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 A takeover price of $82 a share, up from its original offer of $70\u2022 A \u201csignificant\u201d breakup fee if a deal were to be halted for antitrust reasons\u2022 A \u201cticking fee\u201d that Broadcom would pay in cash if a deal took more than a year to closeIt said the new \u201cbest and final\u201d offer would be withdrawn if Qualcomm either pushed its annual shareholder meeting back from March 6 (when Broadcom hopes to unseat the entire board) or if it paid more than $110 a share for NXP Semiconductor.Other cryptocurrencies are falling as well. Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin are all down Monday.How far can Bitcoin fall?Simon Tobler, a trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told Bloomberg: \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold the $8,000 level, Bitcoin may fall to $5,000, where the next big support is. The market is lacking big buyers.\u201dMore from Anna Wilde Mathews, Dana Cimilluca and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:In a reflection of the sensitivity of the subject, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon hit the phones Tuesday to assuage clients\u2019 concerns, people familiar with the matter said. So did some of the firm\u2019s health care bankers, who get paid handsomely to help clients with mergers and other deals and worry the move could cost them business.More from Emily Flitter, Binyamin Appelbaum and David Enrich:The settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.From her interview with Judy Woodruff:\u201cI don\u2019t want to label what we\u2019re seeing a bubble \u2014 as a bubble.\u201cBut I would say that asset valuations generally are elevated, and this is a characterization that we have offered up, for example, last summer in our monetary policy report.\u201d\u2022 Getting bigger by merging with another media company doesn\u2019t solve CBS\u2019s problems. Selling to a tech giant with great online distribution does more.\u2022 Amazon\u2019s exceptionally deep pockets would let CBS bid for expensive must-watch content like sports rights amid tougher competition.The deals flyaroundMore from David Segal of the NYT:\u201cIn my years of running the P.R.C.A., I have never seen anything worse, never seen anything equal to it,\u201d Francis Ingham, director general of the trade association, said in an interview. \u201cThe work was on a completely new scale of awfulness. Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of entrepreneurs [in Silicon Valley] developing the next app for clothes shopping who say, not ironically, that \u2018We are changing the world.\u2019 You\u2019re not changing the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goodbye Castros, Hello Communist Party", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhat are we to make of this succession? One optimistic reading is that this could be the first step toward democracy. A more realistic reading is that Cuba is heading for more of the same: undemocratic one-party rule.If the Cuban Communist Party \u2014 the only party allowed to participate in elections under the one-party regime \u2014 were smart, it would try to get out while the getting is good. By transitioning to democracy on its own terms, the party could reap benefits.Newly configured institutions and laws (for example, electoral laws) could be tailor-made to its advantage. The party could take advantage of this new freedom from the Castros to produce new freedoms for Cubans, thus generating good will that could translate into votes.But the longer the Communists wait, the less viable this exit strategy becomes \u2014 and the more likely that the party will eventually succumb to full-blown regime collapse.Unfortunately for the Cuban people, there are few signs that this option is being considered. Instead, most signs point to a continuation of the status quo \u2014 a succession to a non-Castro, yes, but not a transition to a freer regime. The Cuban regime remains fairly protected from domestic pressures to become more democratic, even if it is ultimately in the Cuban Communist Party\u2019s long-term interests to do so.After the succession, Cuba\u2019s regime will remain cornered by the Castro family, the military and by a regulatory system designed to restrict the growth of business and political organizations, minimizing the pressure to democratize.Perhaps the only possible pressure for greater democracy after the succession could come from a conflict between the party and the military. These are separate entities, each with its own culture, resources and base of support. It is conceivable that an eventual conflict between the party and the military could produce a political earthquake, which could in theory produce a political transition.Mr. Castro understands this better than anyone in Cuba. That is why he may decide to stay in charge of both groups, and as long as that is the case, the potential for a free Cuba will remain limited.Javier Corrales is a professor of political science at Amherst College and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cFixing Democracy: Why Constitutional Change Often Fails to Enhance Democracy in Latin America.\u201d James Loxton is a lecturer in comparative politics at the University of Sydney and the co-editor of the forthcoming \u201cLife after Dictatorship: Authoritarian Successor Parties Worldwide.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weinstein Company Sale Delayed by N.Y. Attorney General Lawsuit", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fire sale of the Weinstein Company hit a last-minute snag on Sunday, when Eric T. Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general, filed a lawsuit against the studio and its fraternal founders alleging that they repeatedly violated state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and coercion.The lawsuit, filed electronically in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, appeared timed to at least delay a sale, which had been expected to be finalized on Sunday. If financiers get spooked, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s move could ultimately kill the proposed deal, putting the Weinstein Company on an almost certain path to bankruptcy.\u201cAny sale of the Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated, employees will be protected going forward, and that neither perpetrators nor enablers will be unjustly enriched,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said in a news release.The investor group, led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, who is best known for running the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, has also publicly said it would create a multimillion-dollar settlement fund (in addition to insurance that is already in place) for women who have accused Mr. Weinstein of abuse.The brothers, who jointly own about 42 percent of the Weinstein Company, would receive no cash from the proposed sale, according to the two people briefed on the deal. Other equity holders, including the advertising giant WPP Group, may also be wiped out.But the final-stage talks came to a screeching halt on Sunday afternoon, according to the two people briefed on the process, as the investor group received word that Mr. Schneiderman was about to file a lawsuit based on an ongoing four-month investigation into the Weinstein Company\u2019s internal dealings.The lawsuit, which refers to Harvey Weinstein by his initials, says that the company\u2019s management and board of directors \u201cwere repeatedly presented with credible evidence of HW\u2019s sexual harassment\u201d of company employees and interns \u201cand his use of corporate employees and resources to facilitate sexual activity with third parties.\u201dIn one instance, a woman who complained to human resources later discovered that it was forwarded by email to Mr. Weinstein, the legal papers say. The lawsuit added that, by guaranteeing the silence of victims and other employees through nondisclosure agreements, the company enabled Mr. Weinstein\u2019s \u201cunlawful conduct to continue far beyond the date when, through reasonable diligence, it should have been stopped.\u201dThe lawsuit detailed, in the words of one employee, a \u201ctoxic environment for women. The suit says Mr. Weinstein had used female employees to aid him in his pursuit of sexual targets. It says that two employees described having to procure injectable erectile dysfunction medication for Mr. Weinstein and says that one of them received a bonus for obtaining the medication \u201cand was at times directed by HW to administer the injections.\u201dThe court filing mentions the possible sale of the company, saying that it could leave victims \u201cwithout adequate redress\u201d and could provide financial benefits to Mr. Weinstein or his enablers. Eric Soufer, director of communications and senior counsel to Mr. Schneiderman, said the attorney general\u2019s office considered asking a judge for a temporary restraining order that could block the sale but opted not to and filed the civil rights lawsuit instead. He added that the office reviewed the proposed terms of the sale and that they did not include a victims compensation fund.The lawsuit could result in fines against the company and the Weinstein brothers, and it calls for the defendants to pay restitution and damages to the victims.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s lawsuit does not name Mr. Glasser, who is the chief operating officer, but it refers to him by his title and says that the sale of the company could result in employees reporting to some of the same managers \u201cwho failed to investigate\u201d Mr. Weinstein\u2019s conduct or protect female employees from him.A spokesman for Ms. Contreras-Sweet declined to comment. The Weinstein Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement, \u201cWhile Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior was not without fault, there certainly was no criminality, and at the end of the inquiry it will be clear that Harvey Weinstein promoted more women to key executive positions than any other industry leader.\u201d Mr. Weinstein has denied all allegations of \u201cnon-consensual sex.\u201dAmy Spitalnick, the press secretary for Mr. Schneiderman, said that his office had recently reached out to representatives for Ms. Contreras-Sweet to emphasize the importance of adequately compensating victims, protecting employees and not rewarding those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein\u2019s misconduct. \u201cWe were surprised to learn they were not serious about discussing any of those issues or even sharing the most basic information about how they planned to address them,\u201d Ms. Spitalnick said.Ms. Contreras-Sweet was stunned by Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s public call for assurance that any sale ensure that victims are compensated, according to one person briefed on the matter, in part because that was already part of her proposal. The person added that Ms. Contreras-Sweet had not spoken to Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office before Sunday because Weinstein Company lawyers had blocked conversations by citing nondisclosure agreements signed as part of the sale process.Ms. Contreras-Sweet outlined her plans for the company in a letter to its board in November, when she first made her offer.\u201cI will be Chairwoman of a majority-female board of directors,\u201d she wrote in the letter. \u201cWomen will be significant investors in the new company and control its voting stock.\u201d The studio is expected to be renamed if the deal goes through.Other bidders were only interested in pieces of the Weinstein Company, namely its 277-film library, which includes titles like \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d and \u201cDjango Unchained.\u201d The Weinstein Company also has a television division that makes \u201cProject Runway\u201d and is working on a pair of dramas for the Paramount Network, which is owned by Viacom.To stay afloat while it has pursued a sale \u2014 the studio employs about 150 people \u2014 the Weinstein Company at first sought loans from Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm, and Colony Capital, the private equity firm run by Thomas J. Barrack Jr. Those efforts failed, making a sale all the more important to avoid bankruptcy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lesson on Immigration From Pablo Neruda", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 Chile, like numerous other countries, has been debating whether to welcome migrants \u2014 mostly from Haiti, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela \u2014 or to keep them out. Although only half a million immigrants live in this nation of 17.7 million, right-wing politicians have stoked anti-immigrant sentiment, opposed the increased rates of immigration in the past decade and directed bile especially against Haitian immigrants.Chileans aren\u2019t alone in witnessing growing xenophobia and nativism, but we would do well to remember our own history, which offers a model for how to act when we are confronted with strangers seeking sanctuary.On Aug. 4, 1939, the Winnipeg set sail for Chile from the French port of Pauillac with more than 2,000 refugees who had fled their Spanish homeland.A few months earlier, Gen. Francisco Franco \u2014 aided by Mussolini and Hitler \u2014 had defeated the forces of the democratically elected government of Spain. The fascists unleashed a wave of violence and murder.Among the hundreds of thousands of desperate supporters of the Spanish Republic who had crossed the Pyrenees to escape that onslaught were the men, women and children who would board the Winnipeg and arrive a month later at the Chilean port of Valpara\u00edso.The person responsible for their miraculous escape was Pablo Neruda, who, at the age of 34, was already considered Chile\u2019s greatest poet. His prestige in 1939 was indeed significant enough for him to be able to persuade Chile\u2019s president, Pedro Aguirre Cerda, that it was imperative for their small country to offer asylum to some of the mistreated Spanish patriots rotting in French internment camps.Not only would this set a humanitarian example, Neruda said, but it would also provide Chile with much needed foreign expertise and talent for its own development. The president agreed to authorize some visas, but the poet himself would have to find the funds for the costly fares of those \u00e9migr\u00e9s as well as for food and lodging during their first six months in the country. And Neruda, once he was in France coordinating the operation, needed to vet the \u00e9migr\u00e9s to ensure they possessed the best technical skills and unimpeachable moral character.An unrelenting nativist campaign by right-wing parties and their media, sensing a chance to attack the president\u2019s Popular Front government, painted the prospective asylum seekers as \u201cundesirables\u201d: rapists, criminals, anti-Christian agitators whose presence, according to one chauvinistic editorial in Chile\u2019s leading conservative paper, would be \u201cincompatible with social tranquillity and the best manners.\u201dNeruda realized that it would be cheaper to charter a ship and fill it up with the refugees than to send them, one family at a time, to Chile. The Winnipeg was available but since it was a cargo boat it had to be refurbished to accommodate some 2,000 passengers with berths, canteens for meals, an infirmary, a nursery for the very young and, of course, latrines.While volunteers from the French Communist Party worked around the clock to ready the vessel, Neruda was gathering donations from all over Latin America \u2014 and from friends like Pablo Picasso \u2014 to finance the increasingly exorbitant enterprise. Time was short: Europe was bracing for war, and bureaucrats in Santiago and Paris were sabotaging the effort. With only half the cash in hand one month before the ship was set to sail, a group of American Quakers unexpectedly offered to supply the rest of the required funds.Through it all, Neruda was fueled by his love for Spain and his compassion for the victims of fascism, including one of his best friends, the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, who had been murdered by a fascist death squad in 1936.As Chile\u2019s consul during the early years of the Spanish Republic, Neruda had witnessed the bombardment of Madrid. The destruction of that city he loved and the assault upon culture and freedom were to mark him for the rest of his life and drastically change his literary priorities.After the fall of the Republic, he declared, \u201cI swear to defend until my death what has been murdered in Spain: the right to happiness.\u201d No wonder he proclaimed the Winnipeg to have been his \u201cmost beautiful poem\u201d as it steamed away \u2014 without him or his wife, as they did not want to occupy space that was better occupied by those whose lives were in danger.And when that magnificent, gigantic, floating \u201cpoem\u201d of his, after a hazardous voyage, finally reached Valpara\u00edso, its passengers \u2014 despite the protests of right-wing nationalists and Nazi sympathizers \u2014 were given a welcome befitting heroes.Awaiting the penniless survivors of Franco\u2019s legions was President Aguirre Cerda\u2019s personal representative \u2014 his health minister, a young doctor named Salvador Allende. Cheering crowds amassed on the dock, singing Spanish songs of resistance, gathered to greet the refugees, some of whom already had jobs lined up.The refugees who came ashore on the Winnipeg would go on to help fashion a more prosperous, open and inventive Chile. They included the historian Leopoldo Castedo, the book designer Mauricio Amster, the playwright and essayist Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Morales and the painters Roser Bru and Jos\u00e9 Balmes.Almost 80 years later, those undesirables pose disturbing questions for us, both in Chile and elsewhere. Where are the presidents who welcome destitute refugees with open arms despite the most virulent slander against them? Where are the Nerudas of yesteryear, ready to launch ships like poems to defend the right to happiness?Ariel Dorfman is the author of the book of essays \u201cHomeland Security Ate My Speech\u201d and the novel \u201cDarwin\u2019s Ghosts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Over 100 Charges, 34 People and 3 Companies: The Investigations Surrounding Trump, Explained", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was last updated on Jan. 25, 2019.Since President Trump took office, his administration has been clouded by federal investigations that carry the specter of devastating legal and political consequences.In the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s election interference, 34 people and three companies have been charged on more than 100 criminal counts. Six of them \u2014 including three Trump associates \u2014 have pleaded guilty, and one, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, was convicted. Twenty-five others are Russians accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential election.In a separate inquiry pursued by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer, pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including campaign finance violations related to payments he made to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Here is a look at the charges and the people facing them as a result of the investigations.Mr. Manafort pleaded not guilty to those charges and additional charges related to his alleged failure to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to launder money. A second trial for those charges was set for September in Washington. The campaign finance violations relate to two payments Mr. Cohen said he made to two women during the 2016 campaign to prevent them from publicly airing their allegations that they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump had requested the payments be arranged.Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea deal did not include a requirement that he cooperate with federal prosecutors. However, he can provide information or evidence to them or Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators later. Mr. Papadopoulos initially told investigators that he met with the professor, who has known ties to the Kremlin, before he joined the Trump campaign. In fact, the meeting happened days after he became a campaign adviser, and he repeatedly tried to arrange meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign.He has been cooperating with the Mueller investigation since his arrest last July at Dulles Airport outside Washington. Mr. Papadopoulos was the first person to plead guilty in the inquiry.Although his sentencing is delayed, court documents indicate Mr. Flynn will face zero to six months of prison time.The first senior White House official to agree to a deal with prosecutors, Mr. Flynn has been cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. He said in a statement at the time that the decision to cooperate and the guilty plea \u201creflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country.\u201dMr. Pinedo has been cooperating with the Mueller investigation.The men were first indicted in October, and both pleaded not guilty. For nearly four months, Mr. Gates stood by that decision but said in February that \u201cthe reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and the circuslike atmosphere of an anticipated trial\u201d had prompted a change of heart.Mr. Gates, who agreed to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigation, testified against Mr. Manafort.Three of the Russians were also indicted with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud and five were also charged with aggravated identity theft.None of the defendants were arrested, as Russia rarely extradites its citizens to the United States to face legal proceedings. But the indictments are designed to openly name and shame the Russians in order to make it difficult for them to continue to work or travel abroad. They also risk capture and extradition if they travel outside Russia.Mr. Kilimnik may never stand trial since, like the other Russians indicted in the investigation, he is a Russian citizen currently living in his home country. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people who have pleaded guilty in the Mueller investigation. It is five, not four.Advertisement"}

President Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner\u2019s news network, CNN, and said before the election that the deal should be stopped.The bigger pictureCecilia Kang of the NYT: For the first time, and after much protest, public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of the chief executive. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed nearly eight years ago, required the disclosure, and firms are now disclosing it in proxy reports for 2017.Companies, lobbyists and some compensation experts spent years criticizing the rule, arguing that it revealed little about pay trends and was of little use to shareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal-leaning think tank, on Tuesday noted that Honeywell was the first United States corporation to release the ratio. The company\u2019s C.E.O., Darius Adamczyk, had a total pay package of $16.8 million in 2017, which was 333 times the pay of the median employee.The rule allows certain companies to exclude some foreign employees from the calculation of the ratio. Honeywell excluded workers from several countries where pay is most likely lower than in the United States. \u201cThe 333:1 ratio that Honeywell is reporting most likely would be even wider if Honeywell took all its workers into account,\u201d the Institute said.\u2014 Peter EavisA federal judge in Manhattan, in a brief order, rejected a motion filed by lawyers for Mr. Cohen and his firm, Point72 Asset Management, to temporarily seal a complaint filed last week by Lauren Bonner, an employee of the firm. Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer had asked the judge to seal the lawsuit, which alleges the firm underpays female employees and fosters a hostile workplace for women, pending the resolution of another motion to push the matter into arbitration.Judge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan said the request to seal the entire complaint was \u201cnot narrowly tailored\u201d and was inconsistent with the \u201cpresumption of public access\u201d to court records.Lawyers for Mr. Cohen had sought to seal the order because it contained details of other employees\u2019 compensation packages. The lawsuit also detailed a testosterone-fueled \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d atmosphere in which men commented frequently on women\u2019s bodies and belittled their abilities.\u2014 Matthew GoldsteinAndrew writes:More from the column:There is precedent for credit card issuers to ban the purchase of completely legal products. Just this month, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America banned the use of their cards to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.To be clear: Those three banks won\u2019t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle \u2014 the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex.The United States Treasury Department is flooding the market with debt.

Consensus estimates for 2018 capex have increased by $17 billion (3 percent) since the passage of tax reform.\u201d\u2022 Last month 39 S.&P. 500 companies increased their dividend, while for the first since 2012 no companies cut their payments.\u2022 Buying back shares remains a priority of companies, Goldman writes. Over the past 2 \u00bd months, S.&P. 500 firms have announced $171 billion of buybacks, $67 billion of which has come this year, a 22% increase from the same period in 2017.In the same note, Goldman also took a closer look at this earnings season.By many measures, corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in the past decade. Goldman points out:\u2022 Companies in the S.&P. 500 are set to report that profit grew 15 percent last quarter. That\u2019s the fastest pace since 2011.\u2022 The percentage of companies beating estimates is at its highest level since 2010. The percentage beating sales forecast is at its highest since 2004.But the stock reaction to S.&P. 500 companies either beating or missing expectations \u201chas been muted relative to history.\u201dThe reason? Investors are more focused on tax reform and earnings forecasts for 2018, Goldman writes. Analysts have raised their 2018 earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 by 7 percent so far this year.Some contextHigher profit margins because of the lower corporate tax rate are driving much of the increase in this year\u2019s earnings forecast. A point that becomes clearer by looking at 2018 sales estimates. Analysts have increased their revenue forecasts by only one percentage point and much of that increase comes from higher oil prices boosting forecasts for energy companies.Remember when the company said that it was changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea and shift its corporate focus to virtual currencies?\u2022 Long Blockchain has named a new C.E.O., Shamyl Malik.\u2022 It plans to spin off its beverage division into the publicly traded Long Island Brand Beverages by June 30, and the company\u2019s last C.E.O., Philip Thomas, will be on the new business\u2019 board.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cWe\u2019re making real progress putting our unique assets to work to serve customers in all the ways they want to shop.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedIn real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.The tech flyaroundThe new offer may have come at an opportune time: I.S.S., the influential proxy adviser, recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for four of Broadcom\u2019s six board nominees.

{"Headline": "How to Bid for the N.F.L.\u2019s Biggest Prize: Team Ownership", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersAfter the last down is played and a new Super Bowl champion hoists the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday, the focus of the National Football League will turn to another prize: the sale of one of its 32 teams. The winning bidder will pay a huge sum for a property that is as close to a guarantee of fame and fortune as there can be.The next owner of the Panthers will have to be incredibly wealthy. N.F.L. ownership rules say that only individuals can buy a team \u2014 so no corporate partnerships or funds \u2014 and that the general partner has to put up at least 30 percent of the purchase price, which runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars. The buyer is also limited in the amount that can be borrowed.\u201cThe meek may inherit the earth, but you have to be a billionaire to own an N.F.L. team,\u201d said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp, who has been a financial adviser to two-thirds of the N.F.L. teams.The last team to be sold was the Buffalo Bills in 2014 for $1.4 billion, which set a record. The Panthers are expected to fetch far more.\u201cThe N.F.L. is the most profitable league,\u201d said Sal Galatioto, president of Galatioto Sports Partners, who represented Dan Snyder in his purchase of the Washington Redskins in 1999 for $800 million.He added that the league divvied up the money from national television and merchandise deals evenly among the teams. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in Buffalo or New York, you get the same share of revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only difference is the venue revenues.\u201dEach team, no matter its record, received about $244 million in 2016 from television revenue alone. Add in tens of millions of dollars from merchandise revenue, and a team has enough money for its entire payroll before a ticket is sold.For billionaires, the lure can be enticing. But what does it take to become the next member of the exclusive N.F.L. team owners club? Here are four things buyers should consider.When Arthur Blank, a co-founder of Home Depot, bought the Atlanta Falcons in 2002 from the team\u2019s original owners, he committed to making the Falcons better for the city. The same could be said for Robert McNair, who worked for four years to persuade the N.F.L. to return to Houston in 2002.\u201cYou want to determine what the primary motivation of the buyer is,\u201d said Joseph A. Bailey III, who was the chief executive of the Miami Dolphins a decade ago, during Wayne Huizenga\u2019s ownership of the team. He said many incentives drove bidders, including asset appreciation, a sense of civic duty, access to other owners, a legacy for heirs or simply a love of the sport.Mr. Bailey, who runs the sports leadership practice at RSR Partners, said that if he were consulting a buyer on the purchase of the Panthers, he would determine that motivation and structure the bid accordingly.All N.F.L. teams generate an incredible amount of money, but not all franchises have the same aura. Jerry Jones, the charismatic and forthright owner of the Dallas Cowboys, is in a league of his own for promoting and monetizing the value of his team, which is said to be the most valuable sports franchise in the world.He is also the only owner to have opted out of the shared revenue agreement so that he can, for example, produce Cowboys apparel on his own and keep all the revenue from it.But if you\u2019re not buying a team like the Cowboys, or for that matter the New England Patriots, who are vying for their sixth Super Bowl victory on Sunday, you have to consider the team\u2019s potential. A popular team can bring in extra revenue from the fans who buy seats, hot dogs and beer at the stadium.It all comes down to marketing. For instance, Shahid Khan, owner of Jacksonville Jaguars since 2012, has to compete with two other professional football teams and a half-dozen major college football programs in Florida.Determining what the seller wants in a buyer isn\u2019t always straightforward. Clint Murchison Jr., who owned the Cowboys from their creation in 1960 to 1984, had specific criteria for a buyer.\u201cHe wanted to sell it to someone who was a Texan and lived in Dallas and had a real affinity for the state,\u201d said Mr. Bailey, who worked for the Cowboys from 1970 to 1989.Mr. Murchison chose Harvey Bright, a Texas businessman known as Bum, who made his money investing in oil and gas. Mr. Bright sold the team to Mr. Jones in 1989.Some sellers want to keep the team in the family, Mr. Bailey added, while others seek \u201ca pure transaction.\u201d Still others look for a buyer who will allow them to remain a limited partner.Mr. Ganis of Sportscorp said he expected Mr. Richardson to seek a buyer for the Panthers who would do right by his partners: \u201cKnowing him, he will fulfill his fiduciary obligations to his partners, which is more in line with the highest and best proposal that is likely to pose the fewest issues to the N.F.L.\u201dThe final factor is that the buyer has to be someone the league wants. At the end of the day, three-quarters of the 32 owners need to approve the sale of a team.\u201cThere\u2019s a limited group of people who are predisposed to buying a team,\u201d said Bob Reif who was the chief marketing officer of the Rams from 2005 to 2016, during a time when they were sold and moved to Los Angeles from St. Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s rare the N.F.L. doesn\u2019t know who\u2019s going to come up as an owner.\u201dMr. Khan had bid on the Rams and seemed poised to prevail, but in the 11th hour, Stan Kroenke, who owned part of the team, exercised the option to buy the rest. Mr. Khan was able to buy the Jaguars, the next team that came up for sale.\u201cWhen you\u2019re buying a team, you\u2019re not only making a deal between you and the seller, you also have to get the blessing from the N.F.L.,\u201d said Anthony Di Santi, global head of sports finance and advisory at Citi Private Bank. \u201cThe buyer and seller can agree on price, but if the league doesn\u2019t like the buyer or doesn\u2019t like the price, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One of my most important responsibilities is succession, and I am blessed to have a spectacular leader and investor like Jon Gray to whom I can hand the reins,\u201d Mr. James said.The Federal Reserve chairman took his position this year facing plenty of economic factors that could stoke inflation, including:\u2022 Resurgent global economies\u2022 Years of cheap and plentiful credit\u2022 Joblessness falling to multiyear lows, making it easier for workers to get a raise or a bonus, which could push up companies\u2019 costsThen the Fed\u2019s job got harder.

The huge new government demand for credit could push up interest rates in the markets. The Fed may be fine with that, given that it is expected to raise interest rates this year. But if interest rates in the bond market spike higher than investors expect, or the Fed is happy with, Mr. Powell would face his first big challenge as Fed chairman.\u2014 Peter EavisIn its prime, Chipotle Mexican Grill positioned itself as the paragon of clean, casual, cool dining, a darling of Wall Street, a restaurant industry innovator.Basically, nothing like Taco Bell.How the tables have turned.

Shireen Mazari, an opposition politician, said in a Twitter post that the country\u2019s reappearance on the list was a \u201cmajor disaster for foreign policy and diplomacy.\u201dA spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Mohammad Faisal, said at a news briefing on Friday that the country would await an official statement from the task force. \u201cOnce things get clearer, we will be able to comment,\u201d Mr. Faisal said.Alexandra Wijmenga-Daniel, a spokeswoman for the task force, known as F.A.T.F., would not comment on the news reports, saying only that \u201cPakistan was subject to F.A.T.F. monitoring in the past,\u201d and \u201cexited this process in 2015.\u201dThe task force was created in 1989 to fight money laundering before its mandate extended to fight terrorism financing. While the group does not issue binding requirements or sanctions, countries placed on its list face intense international scrutiny and financial pressure.The United States led the effort to nominate Pakistan as part of a broader strategy to pressure the country to cut alleged links to Islamist militants causing chaos in Afghanistan.\u201cPakistan has had a full-speed locomotive train coming its way since 2005, and despite dozens of meetings and warnings, Pakistan has failed to grasp the situation,\u201d Mosharraf Zaidi, a foreign-policy commentator and newspaper columnist, said in an interview on Friday.He was referring to the year that Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant group accused of carrying out the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai, India, was put on a United Nations list of global terrorist groups. The United States, India and other Western countries have repeatedly called for Pakistan to take stronger action against a charity that acts as a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba.But Pakistan said most of the concerns had been addressed since 2015. The State Bank of Pakistan introduced a comprehensive set of new rules against money laundering and terror financing, officials said. Parliament approved legislation to tackle money laundering. And an independent financial monitoring unit was established with the sole mandate of receiving, analyzing and disseminating suspicious currency transaction reports.Lashkar-e-Taiba, however, has continued fund-raising even as officials have seized its properties. The group\u2019s founder, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, remains free despite an American bounty of $10 million. Last year, Mr. Saeed started a political party, the Milli Muslim League, raising concerns that the group was trying to gain legitimacy.On Jan. 20, the United States and Britain jointly submitted a letter to the global task force nominating Pakistan for the list. France and Germany subsequently backed the move.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris, and Sewell Chan from New York.Advertisement"}

There was little talk of economic issues, even though Mr. Pence has in the past conducted an economic dialogue with Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso.Mr. Pence\u2019s tough words about North Korea could widen fissures between the Trump administration and South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, who has pursued a more conciliatory approach to the North.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts in Hand, Companies Spend More on Themselves Than on Wages", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump promised that his tax cut would encourage companies to invest in factories, workers and wages, setting off a spending spree that would reinvigorate the American economy.Companies have announced plans for some of those investments. But so far, companies are using much of the money for something with a more narrow benefit: buying their own shares.Those so-called buybacks are good for shareholders, including the senior executives who tend to be big owners of their companies\u2019 stock. A company purchasing its own shares is a time-tested way to bolster its stock price.But the purchases can come at the expense of investments in things like hiring, research and development and building new plants \u2014 the sort of investments that directly help the overall economy. The buybacks are also most likely to worsen economic inequality because the benefits of stocks purchases flow disproportionately to the richest Americans.What companies do with the trillions of dollars they\u2019re bringing back to the United States, and the money they will save each year on their tax bills, will in large part determine whether the plan is a success or a failure.As the tax cuts kick in, companies have laid out a variety of uses for the money. Some are paying out one-time bonuses to employees. Others are raising salaries. Others plan to open new factories.In the fourth quarter, American companies\u2019 investments in things like factories and business equipment grew by 6.8 percent. That was the fastest growth rate since 2014, but far from the giant surge in capital spending that was promised ahead of the tax overhaul.But the buying back of shares is also at record levels.Almost 100 American corporations have trumpeted such plans in the past month. American companies have announced more than $178 billion in planned buybacks \u2014 the largest amount unveiled in a single quarter, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm.Such purchases reduce a company\u2019s total number of outstanding shares, giving each remaining share a slightly bigger piece of the profit pie.On Monday, Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire might be open to buy some of its shares. The remarks helped send Berkshire\u2019s stock \u2014 and the broader market \u2014 higher.\u201cI\u2019m expecting buybacks to get to a record for 2018,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m disappointed, there\u2019s a lot of people with me.\u201dThe flurry of planned buybacks has been good for the stock market. Early this month, stocks were down more than 10 percent from their January peak. The prospect of companies flooding markets with \u201cbuy\u201d orders helped the market recoup some of its losses.The broader impact on the economy is less clear. Economists believe a rising stock market benefits the economy, helping support consumer and business confidence. But the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of American households, who own 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40 percent of all stocks.Ultimately, the effect of the rising stock market depends on how those wealthy investors use their windfall. It helps the economy more, for example, if they put the money toward productive new companies than if they invest in government bonds.Companies typically decide to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories based on whether they will make the company more profitable \u2014 not merely because the companies are sitting on a pile of money that they otherwise would have paid in taxes.At a news conference Thursday, the head of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, acknowledged that many companies were spending their money on buying their own shares.\u201cRight now we\u2019re going to have an adjustment where you see probably more dividends and share buybacks than wage increases,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cBut going forward we\u2019re going to see a lot of capital formation and wage growth.\u201dThat is not what happened in 2005, when a one-time tax holiday allowed companies to repatriate money on the cheap. That plan, championed by President George W. Bush, was sold as a way to get American companies to invest more in the domestic economy.Studies have shown that the tax change lifted companies\u2019 stock prices but did not expand their American work forces.Until the early 1980s, the practice of buying shares with corporate money was considered borderline illegal because it was thought to potentially open the company up to charges of manipulating share prices.But in 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that gave the green light to most share repurchases, as long as they followed certain rules.Historically, American companies had paid out profits with a quarterly check, known as a dividend. But after the S.E.C.\u2019s rule change, companies started using more of their profits to buy their own shares, in the process giving their shareholders a bigger piece of the company.Buybacks soon soared. By 2016, the most recent year for which there is complete data, companies spent $536 billion on purchasing their own shares, according to data from S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.That was about 5 percent less than those companies spent on new plants, research and development and other investments. By contrast, 20 years ago, companies spent four times as much on such investments as they did on buybacks.\u201cWe have some causal evidence that because of short-termism companies are doing some stock repurchases that maybe they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Heitor Almeida, a professor of corporate finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s causing them to reduce investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Online, a Diverse Winter Olympics. But on the Ground?", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPYEONGCHANG, South Korea \u2014 To say the Winter Olympics are not racially diverse is like noting the weather in Pyeongchang is cold. This is not surprising.The Winter Games have deep Scandinavian roots, and draw athletes from the colder, predominantly white \u2014 and often wealthy \u2014 regions of the United States, Germany and Austria.But looking across social media as the Games pick up, some of the biggest stars have been an unexpectedly diverse group.They are not necessarily medal contenders, nor underdogs. And their outsize presence on social media belies the reality on the ground here of an overwhelming white population of athletes.The undeniable advantage in the Winter Games has long gone to nations with the strongest national governing bodies, which are the biggest financing system for athletes in training.The Jamaican bobsled athlete Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian knows that advantage firsthand. A New Jersey native, she was recruited by the United States to bobsledding as a 22-year-old and competed in the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Yet Fenlator-Victorian, a dual citizen of the United States and Jamaica, decided to represent Jamaica in the Pyeongchang Games.\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that little girls and boys see someone that looks like them, talks like them, has the same culture as them, has crazy curly hair and wears it natural, has brown skin-included in different things in this world,\u201d she said, fighting back tears.\u201cWhen you grow up and you don\u2019t see that, you feel that you can\u2019t do it and that is not right,\u201d she said. \u201cSo coming back home to Jamaica, I wanted my Jamaican people to see that they can do it \u2026 if they want to be a winter Olympian and do Alpine ski, now they see their fellow Jamaican in the Winter Olympics.\u201dNearly 3,000 athletes from 92 countries are competing in the Pyeongchang Olympics. Six of those nations \u2014 Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore \u2014 are competing in the Winter Olympics for the first time.Asia has also become a major force in the Olympics movement as the host for the next two Games after Pyeongchang. The next Summer Olympics will be held in Tokyo in 2020, and the next Winter Olympics will be held in Beijing in 2022.For its part, the United States Olympic Committee said that its team is the most diverse it has fielded at a Winter Olympics.Of the 243 athletes, 10 are African-American and 10 are Asian-American. The U.S.O.C. does not release data on other racial and ethnic groups because the national governing bodies for individual sports collect and report the data and have done so inconsistently (the sports ask but do not require athletes to report their racial and ethnic identities).Jason Thompson, the director of diversity and inclusion at the committee, said progress has been made in fielding a more diverse team, but that more needs to be done to recruit athletes across racial and ethnic groups.\u201cI think we\u2019re not where we want to be,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a huge jump to show that winter sports are for everybody.\u201dThe sports that have seen the biggest increase in racial diversity are those drawing so-called crossover athletes \u2014 those talented in one sport who adapt to a new one.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just that they haven\u2019t been introduced to the sport,\u201d Thompson said. Many bobsled athletes, for example, are former elite track sprinters.Biney, an effervescent 17-year-old and the first African-American woman to compete for the United States in speedskating at the Winter Olympics, has quickly become a social media darling.She was born in Ghana and moved to the United States at the age of 5. She learned how to skate soon after, but her coach told her father she was too fast for figure skating. So she enrolled in speedskating.\u201cI think it hit, I think it finally hit,\u201d Biney said at the opening ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m actually here at the Olympic Games. Holy cow. It\u2019s awesome.\u201dIn her Twitter post, Biney said of Davis: \u201cYou\u2019ve inspired me and paved the way as the first African-American speed skater to make an Olympic team.\u201dDavis has been in conflict with the U.S.O.C. after it used a coin flip to decide which athlete out of two finalists would carry the American flag in the opening ceremony.The committee, he said in a Twitter post last week, \u201cdishonorably tossed a coin to decide its 2018 flag bearer.\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d he added. \u201cI can wait until 2022. #BlackHistoryMonth2018 #PyeongChang2018\u201dIf Biney is feeling the pressure of paving the way for the next generation of African-American women entering the sport, she is taking it with stride. She was full of laughter on Saturday shortly after securing her spot in the final 16 in the 500 meters. \u201cI\u2019m just ready to get out there on Tuesday and let it rip,\u201d she said.Thirteen athletes from eight African nations will be competing in South Korea, the largest representation of athletes from African nations in any Winter Games. There has yet to be a Winter Olympics medal awarded to any athlete representing an African nation.The Nigerian bobsled team has high, perhaps sky high, expectations to change that.\u201cThis could be something that would be really cool, something that we give back, something that people could just be proud of and we could be just kind of low key, get it done, and we could just live in that legacy,\u201d Seun Adigun, the captain and driver of the team, said in Pyeongchang. \u201cOr, people would get really, really excited, and then we\u2019d have to figure out how to manage life that way.\u201dThey already are celebrities in the athletes\u2019 village.Yet they did not get to the Games easily.Just the cost of equipment and travel can quickly overwhelm an athlete reaching for qualification. And for nations without Olympic delegations, much of the work that normally falls on organizing bodies instead falls on the athletes.Nigeria had no bobsled federation until the women on the team created one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Plan: Modest Federal Incentives, Facing Long Odds", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Monday will propose offering $100 billion in federal incentives to encourage cities and states to invest in road, bridge and other building projects, the centerpiece of a plan to spur $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending over the next decade without devoting significant federal money.The proposal, to be unveiled the same day as Mr. Trump\u2019s 2019 budget, faces long odds on Capitol Hill, where members of both parties \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 are skeptical of any plan that fails to create a dedicated new funding stream to address the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. Lawmakers are also doubtful that such a small federal investment will be sufficient to spur an infrastructure spending boom.The president, who plans to invite Democrats and Republicans to the White House this week to call for a sweeping bipartisan infrastructure initiative, will propose to devote a total of $200 billion in federal dollars to the program, according to senior White House officials who previewed the plan on the condition of anonymity. Half of that amount would go toward matching funds that states and cities commit to financing their own infrastructure projects.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, the officials said, would also provide $50 billion in block grants to governors to fund rural infrastructure projects, and a $20 billion increase in loans and bonds to finance transportation, water, rail and other projects. A major element of the proposal would be to speed the approval of such projects to two years, the latest in a series of attempts by the Trump administration to reduce government regulations, including a host of environmental restrictions, that corporations say are costly and burdensome.The blueprint represents Mr. Trump\u2019s long-awaited strategy for fulfilling a campaign promise to spearhead a $1 trillion effort to rebuild the nation\u2019s dilapidated infrastructure and create thousands of jobs in the process. The effort was relegated to the back burner during the president\u2019s first year in office, as his White House struggled without success to overhaul the health care system and then threw its energy and political capital into pushing through a $1.5 trillion tax cut along party lines.Over a period of months, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic advisers, led by Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, repeatedly said a concrete infrastructure proposal was coming but no such plan had materialized, despite heavily promoted events like White House \u201cinfrastructure week.\u201dNow, White House officials say they are ready \u2014 after months of what they characterized as behind-the-scenes meetings with members of both political parties \u2014 to push through a plan that they concede will not be enacted without the support of both Democrats and Republicans.The odds of such a bipartisan effort coming together in the current political environment are long. White House officials said the new spending would be offset by unspecified cuts elsewhere in the budget, which are all but certain to be roundly criticized by Democrats.Many infrastructure experts consider the ratio Mr. Trump\u2019s aides are proposing for a public-private plan \u2014 essentially creating $6.50 in private investment for every federal dollar spent \u2014 to be largely out of reach. And the president plans to leave it up to lawmakers, who are deeply divided on how to finance any infrastructure effort, to decide on key questions such as whether to enact a gas tax to pay for it or slash other types of spending.\u201cThe president has said that he is open to new sources of funding,\u201d a senior White House official told reporters on Saturday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the plan in advance of its release. \u201cWe will be quite flexible in terms of how we accomplish those objectives.\u201dThe plan also proposes $20 billion for so-called transformative programs, described by the official as \u201cnext-century\u201d infrastructure, and it would set aside $10 billion for a capital financing fund to handle projects that the federal government is currently building.To expedite the building of infrastructure projects, Mr. Trump will propose a new \u201cone agency, one decision\u201d model in which one federal agency would take the lead in moving a project through the permitting process within 21 months, with final action within three months after that.The official said the White House wanted to shorten the process while preserving environmental protections that exist under current law.But progressive groups and public interest organizations rushed to condemn the plan on Sunday, arguing that Mr. Trump was trying to gut environmental rules under the guise of an infrastructure initiative.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s infrastructure proposal is a disaster,\u201d Shelley Poticha, the managing director of the Healthy People & Thriving Communities Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. \u201cIt fails to offer the investment needed to bring our country into the 21st century. Even worse, his plan includes an unacceptable corporate giveaway by truncating environmental reviews.\u201dBusiness groups, however, broadly praised the president\u2019s forthcoming proposal, saying it represents a long overdue investment that would provide a boost to American companies.\u201cIn calling for a substantial, $1.5 trillion investment, President Trump is providing the leadership we have desperately needed to reclaim our rightful place as global leader on true 21st-century infrastructure,\u201d said Jay Timmons, the president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers. \u201cThere is no excuse for inaction, and manufacturers are committed to ensuring that America seizes this opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rhodes Scholarships Go Global as Students From Anywhere Now Qualify", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIf we believe in our mission to find incredibly talented people who will change the world for the better, they\u2019re just as likely to be found in Indonesia as in Ohio,\u201d said Charles R. Conn, the chief executive of the trust and warden of Rhodes House at Oxford. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel constrained by who Rhodes was as a person, but perhaps each Rhodes scholar needs to reflect on that when they accept the money.\u201dWhen Rhodes died in 1902, he left instructions and money in his will for more than 50 students from a few current or former British possessions to study at Oxford, and five scholarships were soon allocated for German students. From the start, some scholarships were set aside for students from southern Africa, but for decades all of the recipients from those countries were white.For generations, as the scholarships became among the most prestigious in the world, countries were added to the list gradually \u2014 British possessions, or former ones, in Africa and Asia, though some were later removed. Women were not eligible until the 1970s, students from some countries that were never part of the empire were first included in the 1990s, and British students have never qualified.This year there will be 100, and \u201cwe\u2019d really like to see, certainly, 125,\u201d Mr. Conn said. For most of its existence, the trust relied solely on the initial gift from Rhodes, he said, but now that bequest pays for less than half the program\u2019s annual costs.Despite its modern record, the Rhodes trust is inescapably linked to Rhodes himself, an unabashed colonialist now widely seen as a leading European exploiter of African resources and people. The colony of Rhodesia was named after him, later becoming a nation ruled until 1979 by a minority white supremacist government, and ultimately renamed Zimbabwe.The Rhodes scholarships finance up to four years of postgraduate study at Oxford.

{"Headline": "Geothermal Energy Grows in Kenya", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHELL\u2019S GATE NATIONAL PARK, Kenya \u2014 Verdant hills stretch into the distance at Hell\u2019s Gate National Park, where zebras, buffalos, antelopes, baboons and other wildlife roam an idyllic landscape of forests, gorges and grassy volcanoes near the shores of Lake Naivasha.Snaking over the same landscape are pipes. Miles and miles of pipes \u2014 some high enough off the ground that trucks can pass underneath and giraffes won\u2019t hit their heads \u2014 carry steam from beneath this volcanic valley to big power plants inside the park.The valley\u2019s animal herders have long known the unusual properties of the ground under their feet. On chilly days, they warmed themselves near vents that emit plumes of hot steam. Now, Kenya is increasingly harnessing that steam to turn generators that can allow it to expand electrical service and power its rapidly growing economy.Kenya has pushed hard to harness its geothermal capabilities. It generated 45 megawatts of power with geothermal energy in 1985 and now generates about 630 megawatts; nearly 400 megawatts of that production has come online since 2014.\u201cNo matter how you cut it, that is a significant amount of generation in the geothermal world,\u201d said Gene Suemnicht, chief executive of EGS, a California-based geothermal consultancy that has worked in Kenya.Reliable energy is a vital driver of economic growth. At Oserian, one of Kenya\u2019s largest flower exporters based near Lake Naivasha, geothermal steam warms greenhouses and generates electricity at its two power plants.Geothermal heating allows the company to sell 380 million flower stems each year and also grow \u201cvarieties of roses that would not be economically viable without 24-hour heating,\u201d said Neil Hellings, managing director of Oserian. Savings from using geothermal energy versus conventional electricity lets Oserian pay its employees more than double that of many competitors, Mr. Hellings added.Another geothermal field already under development north of Hell\u2019s Gate was expected to bring power to 500,000 households and 300,000 small and medium-size businesses, according to the African Development Bank Group.Other countries have used geothermal power to drive their economies. In the 1970s, geothermal development helped propel Iceland from poverty to a wealthy island nation.Electrical transmission and distribution \u2014 and connecting customers who can pay for service \u2014 is crucial to a viable power business. In Kenya \u201cthe grid to transport the generated power to citizens also needs substantial investment,\u201d said Victoria Cuming, head of policy at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Big efforts to expand Kenya\u2019s grid are underway, with about 1,500 miles of new electrical lines under construction and 3,600 miles in the works by Kenya Electricity Transmission Company, or Ketraco. The main hurdle for grid expansion will be financing. \u201cKenya has typically relied on concessional investors or government funding,\u201d Ms. Cuming said.Sanjay Chandra, director of new energy development at ICF, a consultancy in the United States, noted that connecting homes or smaller businesses in the \u201clast mile is always challenging.\u201d This is especially so in poor areas where people may not be able to afford electricity or don\u2019t use much, therefore making it relatively expensive \u2014 and financially unviable \u2014 for companies to connect them.In western Kenya \u201cthe electrification rate is hovering around 5 percent even though 84 percent of unconnected households are within 200 meters of a connection point,\u201d Mr. Chandra said.Last year, Kenya\u2019s demand for electricity exceeded 1,600 megawatts for the first time. Under ideal circumstances, the country has the potential to generate more than 10,000 megawatts of geothermal energy, according to Kenya Electricity Generating Company, or KenGen, which generates the majority of the country\u2019s electricity.Across all of East Africa, there\u2019s potential for some 20,000 megawatts of geothermal energy, according to a report from agencies including the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa and the United Nations Environment Program.But Kenya and the surrounding region face many challenges to harnessing its full geothermal potential. Lack of funding and technical expertise, poor governance, and corruption often hobble big infrastructure projects in developing countries.And though geothermal is considered renewable energy, it does have pitfalls. While the Earth will most likely supply heat for millions of years, the underground water necessary to produce steam can be depleted if not recharged.Yet from a geological perspective, Kenya\u2019s geothermal conditions are ideal.\u201cThe amount of volcanism is amazing,\u201d Mr. Suemnicht said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the center of the action.\u201dThe East African Rift is one of the world\u2019s largest rift valleys, about 3,700 miles in length and 30 to 40 miles across. It is slowly splitting the African continent apart at the rate of several millimeters each year.\u201cRift settings have very high potential for geothermal,\u201d Mr. Suemnicht said. \u201cMost geothermal development occurs in tectonically active areas on Earth.\u201dKenya is by far Africa\u2019s geothermal leader, but nations such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Djibouti, Eritrea and Comoros have done preliminary exploration and Ethiopia generates about 7 megawatts of geothermal power.Tapping geothermal energy is a long and expensive process that requires special expertise. From start to finish, it can take years from site-scouting to construction to connection to actually generating electricity \u2014 and revenue.To find suitable spots for drilling steam wells, scientists do geological, geochemical and geophysical surveillance, a process that can take three months, said Xavier Musouye, a geologist with KenGen. When suitable spots are found and assessed, drilling begins using the kind of tall rigs commonly seen at oil wells. Except for periodic maintenance breaks, these drills pound into the earth 24 hours a day for nearly two months.At a new well site in Hell\u2019s Gate, the noise was deafening as gargantuan machinery pummeled the ground. The well will eventually reach a depth of almost two miles, joining the nearly 300 others already in place in the park.It can cost about $6 million for a single well, and even with all the planning and testing there is still a risk of drilling an empty well. Two geothermal wells were explored in neighboring Rwanda but were unsuccessful, noted Dr. Meseret Zemedkun, energy program manager for the United Nations Environment Program.Kenya, the first African country to tap geothermal power, began its programs in the late 1970s and early 1980s through funding primarily from the World Bank and guidance from the United Nations Development Program. But funders pulled out in the early 1990s amid government instability before returning toward the end of that decade.Although geothermal power has led to rapid expansion of electrical service here, there are environmental trade-offs. There is the conundrum of drilling in Hell\u2019s Gate, a 26-square-mile area that is one of the country\u2019s smaller parks but has been designated a Unesco world heritage site. Some environmentalists are critical of extracting geothermal energy here. They complain that pipes and power plants are environmentally disruptive and an eyesore.Elizabeth Mwangi-Gachau, chief environmental officer for KenGen, said the company conducts environmental assessments and tries to mitigate impact. It considers wildlife migration and behavior in its development plans. Ms. Mwangi-Gachau added that KenGen has refrained from drilling in parts of Hell\u2019s Gate that would compromise the flora and fauna, even where there is major geothermal potential.Ms. Zemedkun of U.N.E.P. pointed out that environmentally friendly geothermal projects have been developed around the world \u2014 even within national park areas, including in the United States, Italy, Iceland, New Zealand and Japan.On a sunny afternoon, groups of Kenyans basked in the spa\u2019s azure water. They weren\u2019t fazed by the sight of steel pipes at a nearby geothermal wellhead. Overhead, odorless white steam floated into the air to mingle with the clouds streaking the Kenyan sky.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "India Wants to Give Half a Billion People Free Health Care", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 India announced on Thursday a sweeping plan to give half a billion poor Indians free access to health care, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to address rising demands for greater economic and social protections before national elections next year.The move is sure to be popular in a country where most people have no health insurance and the per capita income is a few dollars a day. Although India\u2019s overall economy is growing, Mr. Modi and his governing Bharatiya Janata Party have been trying to find ways to court the population left behind.The health care plan, part of the government\u2019s 2018-19 budget presented on Thursday, would offer 100 million families up to 500,000 rupees, or about $7,860, of coverage each year. That sum, while small by Western standards, would be enough to cover the equivalent of five heart surgeries in India. Officials did not outline eligibility requirements, and many details of the program have yet to be finalized.India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said in a speech to Parliament that the plan would cover more people than any other government-funded health care program in the world. In addition to the direct health benefits, he said, the program would create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\u201cThis is huge. It\u2019s the biggest step the government has taken in 20 years in health care,\u201d said Dr. Ajay Bakshi, the former chief executive of Manipal Hospitals, a chain of 16 private hospitals based in the southern city of Bangalore.The average Indian\u2019s life expectancy is about 68 years, significantly lower than other large developing countries like China or Brazil. In large part, that\u2019s because of poor health care.\u201cThe biggest disease burden sits on the bottom 500 million people. They don\u2019t have access to diagnosis. If they get diagnosed, they don\u2019t have a way to get treatment,\u201d Dr. Bakshi said.\u201cWhat are the poor people dying from? Diarrhea, pneumonia, under-nutrition, malaria, tuberculosis,\u201d said Rama Baru, a professor at the Center of Social Medicine and Community Health at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. \u201cPrevention and curative services need to go together.\u201dThe government offered no details on how it would pay for the health care program. The Finance Ministry said it had allocated $314 million for the proposal, but the program could easily cost billions of dollars per year.A prior plan announced by the Modi government in 2016 to provide 100,000 rupees of health coverage per family was never funded. But Dr. Bakshi said funding was more likely this time because the economy is stronger \u2014 and, more important, elections are looming.\u201cThey will make sure this will be implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cIndian voters have favored governments that have given them wide-scale health coverage.\u201dAs part of the budget proposal, Mr. Jaitley said the government would levy a surtax that would raise about $1.7 billion a year specifically for health care programs.The government is also proposing a new tax on capital gains to capture some of the wealth being created as India\u2019s stock market rises to new highs.Investors in Indian medical stocks clearly expected a windfall from the insurance program: Shares rose in Thursday\u2019s trading.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oxfam Executive Quits as Furor Grows Over Misconduct", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Claims that aid workers with the British charity Oxfam hired prostitutes in Chad were raised more than a decade ago, but the official in charge there was allowed to remain with the charity and moved on to Haiti, where the pattern continued, the group acknowledged on Monday, as one of its top executives stepped down.The resignation of the charity\u2019s deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, was unlikely to quell growing outrage over revelations about the conduct of aid workers in desperately poor countries. Oxfam\u2019s leaders met on Monday with the British cabinet minister for international development, who has raised the prospect of cutting off its government funding.Oxfam is one of the private groups that the British government relies on most heavily to carry out humanitarian and economic development projects around the world. With more than $550 million in annual spending, 5,000 employees and 27,000 volunteers, it is one of the largest British charities.\u201cAs program director at the time, I am ashamed that this happened on my watch and I take full responsibility,\u201d she said.In 2011, Oxfam stated that it had found misconduct by some of its workers in Haiti, where the group was taking part in recovery efforts after a devastating earthquake, and that those people had left the organization. But Oxfam did not specify who was involved or what they had done wrong, and, as it now concedes, it did not inform the police in Haiti.Oxfam acknowledged on Friday that there had been sexual misconduct, and that Mr. van Hauwermeiren was among those who left over the matter, but it has not named the others.It said its investigation in Haiti, where prostitution is illegal and the legal age of consent is 18, was not able to prove or disprove allegations that some of the Haitians hired were under 18. There have been no claims that Oxfam workers demanded sex in return for aid, an allegation that has at times been made against other groups.The group has apologized repeatedly, and it said that the behavior of some of its staff members in Haiti had led years ago to tougher policies and safeguards, but it has also insisted that it did not engage in a cover-up.Oxfam has said that in 2011, it shared its findings with the Charity Commission, a British government agency, which took no action. But the commission\u2019s chief investigator said that it was not told the full extent of the misconduct, and that it would have acted differently if it had been.A breach with the government would be a serious blow to Oxfam, particularly if its private fund-raising also suffered because of the revelations. In its last fiscal year, the group received 10 percent of its revenue from the British government, 6 percent from other national governments and 16 percent from multinational organizations like the United Nations and the European Union.Advertisement"}

Apparently somebody has to pay them, and therefore this disturbs us greatly.\u201dMr. Alsheich has said that after he went public, some months ago, about what he described as \u201cpressures\u201d applied to the investigators by those collecting information on them, the activity stopped. Mr. Alsheich said on Wednesday that these were not \u201crumors or blah blah blah,\u201d but \u201cfacts.\u201dMr. Netanyahu excoriated Mr. Alsheich for \u201crepeating the delusional and mendacious insinuation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent private detectives against police officers investigating him.\u201dIn the interview broadcast on the respected magazine program \u201cUvda\u201d \u2014 an Israeli equivalent of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u2014 Mr. Alsheich also defended the leader of the police anticorruption unit, Roni Ritman, who has been accused of sexual harassment and recently stepped down.Mr. Netanyahu also struck back at this part of the conversation, although his name once again went unmentioned.He wrote of Mr. Alsheich, \u201cIt is shocking to discover that he is repeating to journalists the no less ludicrous and false insinuation of Ritman, as if the prime minister was involved in the complaint\u201d against the investigations unit chief. Mr. Netanyahu and his lawyer have called for a swift inquiry into the claims they said Mr. Alsheich had implied.The extraordinary clash came amid reports in Israel that the police were likely to present conclusions during the next week regarding the evidentiary basis for charges in two graft cases against Mr. Netanyahu.The police have been investigating Mr. Netanyahu on suspicion of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, according to the Israeli authorities.Mr. Netanyahu has already tried to prepare the public for the likelihood that the police will recommend charges, suggesting that such a move would be meaningless, since, he said, only about half of police recommendations resulted in formal charges.A final decision regarding any indictment of Mr. Netanyahu is likely to be months away and would lie with the attorney general, after consultations with the state prosecutor.\u201cThere will be recommendations, there will also be signs saying, \u2018Bibi is guilty until proven innocent,\u2019 and invalid pressures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am sure that at the end of the day the authorized legal bodies will come to the same conclusion, to the simple truth: There is nothing.\u201dMr. Netanyahu appointed Mr. Alsheich as police commissioner about two years ago, and praised him at the time as a \u201ccreative, original and determined commander who is not afraid to take the initiative.\u201dDavid Amsalem, the coalition chairman for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud Party, accused the police of attempting a coup.\u201cWhen people are being murdered in the streets,\u201d he said on Army Radio, \u201cit is more important than the prime minister having received a cigar.\u201dAvi Gabbay, leader of the center-left Labor Party, called Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s attack \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cillegitimate.\u201dAsked by the television interviewer, Ilana Dayan, a veteran investigative journalist, if the Israeli public would be surprised by the police findings, Mr. Alsheich replied, \u201cThere will be some people who will say, \u2018Wait a moment, this is not what we thought.\u2019\u201dAs for the idea that he could end up being remembered as the police chief who brought down a sitting prime minister, Mr. Alsheich said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but that\u2019s my job.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations.Citi\u2019s underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years.The message from Citi\u2019s board seems to be that, since the bank\u2019s performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbat\u2019s pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street.But on other yardsticks, the awards can seem highCiti may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bank\u2019s return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of America\u2019s was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan.And the makeup of the compensation mattersC.E.O.s\u2019 compensation is made up of different types of pay:\u2022 Cash salaries and cash bonuses\u2022 Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future.The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is.Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 The decision starts a maximum 75-day clock for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to decide whether to approve or oppose the deal, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Chinese investors have faced heightened scrutiny from Cfius.

Remember that Broadcom is seeking six of 11 board seats, down from its initial target of unseating all directors.\u2014 Michael de la MercedBritain\u2019s government is often criticized for not clearly communicating the type of deal it wants to strike with the European Union as it prepares to leave the bloc.The dilemma Britain faces.Post-Brexit, Britain\u2019s banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them to operate in any E.U. country with few restrictions. Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.Hence the new plan.The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems. It would allow both sides leeway to strike their own rules once they\u2019ve agreed on their main objectives.

{"Headline": "The Pull of Populism", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the striking features of Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office was the all-but-complete abandonment of the populist economic vision upon which he successfully campaigned. Candidate Trump stiff-armed Republican economic orthodoxy and won the Midwest by promising a flood of infrastructure spending, universal health care, protectionism, middle-class tax cuts \u2014 a right-wing Keynesianism for the common man. But as president he defaulted to Paul Ryan\u2019s agenda, chasing the Tea Party dream of Obamacare repeal, issuing a budget proposal thick with discretionary spending cuts, and pursuing a tax reform tilted heavily toward corporations.The best way to understand this turn was to recognize that personnel are policy, and since \u201cTrumpism\u201d was an unexpected irruption and Trump himself is not exactly the sort of guy who worries about having a policy brain trust, the people available to staff and guide his administration were inevitably more conventionally conservative than the half-sketched ideas of his campaign. Once Steve Bannon, the only inner-circle figure with an ideological vision, flamed out spectacularly as a Karl Rove-like eminence, a default to Ryanism was all-but-guaranteed, and with it the abandonment of Trump\u2019s promise to remake the G.O.P. as a \u201cworker\u2019s party.\u201dBut if that was the major policy story of year one, the drift of Republican policymaking since the failure of Obamacare repeal has been a little different, a little more populist, a little closer to the way that Trump campaigned. Even without a Bannon-like figure consciously shaping policy, Trumpism still exerts a gravitational pull on the Republican Party, because its broad outlines are actually popular in a way that the austerian elements of the overlapping Ryan and Tea Party agendas never really were.This pull exerted itself weakly but meaningfully on the tax bill, which was dominated by a corporate tax cut but also reshaped around the edges to cut more taxes for the middle class and families. It exerted itself a little more on Trump\u2019s decision to replace Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chairman with Jerome Powell, which amounted to a vote for a looser monetary policy rather than the hard-money approach that Republicans had consistently favored under Obama. And then on the budget that just passed Congress, Trumpism was more like a Death Star tractor beam, dragging the G.O.P. well away from all its professed Obama-era priorities: Gone was the sequester, gone was all the talk of cutting and capping and balancing, and instead we got a guns-and-butter budget that would have done Lyndon Johnson or George W. Bush proud.Combine this flood of spending with the Trump White House\u2019s attempt to get a skills-based and restrictionist immigration reform through Congress, throw in some smaller ideas under consideration, like the Marco Rubio-Ivanka Trump paid parental leave plan, and you have a Year 2 of the Trump era in which Trumpism actually seems meaningful again. Not as a completely coherent agenda, obviously, but as a tendency, a force pulling conservatism toward a nationalism-infused deficit-financed populism even when Ryan and Mick Mulvaney are theoretically setting the agenda.This populist pull makes hypocrites of many Republican legislators, as liberals are eager to point out, since it induces them to vote for budgets that they would have denounced as socialism under Barack Obama. But there is pathos to the hypocrisy as well as cynicism. Republicans denounce big spending while in opposition because opposition offers the luxury of principle, and then they accept spending once in power because the nature of governance make them feel like prisoners of the public\u2019s will \u2026 and then they look forward to defeat, at some level, because it liberates them to return the true faith, free of the corrupting responsibility to please a public bigger than their base.This reality was apparent to Trump, in his crude and demagogic way, as it was apparent to Bush before him. But it is not apparent to enough Republicans at the moment for the party to act on it effectively. So instead of a clear focus on the kind of populism that might advance conservative priorities \u2014 direct spending to support work and family and marriage, above all \u2014 we get doomed cavalry charges against popular programs followed by a shrugging acceptance of more funding for the welfare-state status quo.Trump is not the right man to break this cycle. But the recent drift back toward campaign-season Trumpism in defiance of the White House\u2019s official blueprints is a sign for those with eyes to see. The populist center-right is the only place where Republicans can stand and plausibly hope to govern. It would be nice if someday they tried to do so, not haphazardly and hypocritically and often stupidly, but intelligently and consistently and well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Banks Could Control Gun Sales if Washington Won\u2019t", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookFor the past year, chief executives have often talked about the new sense of moral responsibility that corporations have to help their communities and confront social challenges even when Washington won\u2019t.Here\u2019s an idea.What if the finance industry \u2014 credit card companies like Visa, Mastercard and American Express; credit card processors like First Data; and banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo \u2014 were to effectively set new rules for the sales of guns in America?Collectively, they have more leverage over the gun industry than any lawmaker. And it wouldn\u2019t be hard for them to take a stand.PayPal, Square, Stripe and Apple Pay announced years ago that they would not allow their services to be used for the sale of firearms.\u201cWe do not believe permitting the sale of firearms on our platform is consistent with our values or in the best interests of our customers,\u201d a spokesman for Square told me.The big financial firms don\u2019t even have to go that far.If Mastercard were to do the same, assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card system.To be clear: Those three banks won\u2019t let you use your credit card to buy Bitcoin, but they will happily let you use it to buy an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle \u2014 the same kind of gun used in mass shootings in Parkland; Newtown, Conn.; San Bernardino, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex.Visa spokesmen did not reply to several emails seeking comment. A spokesman for Mastercard sent a boilerplate statement that expressed \u201cdisgust with recent events, including last week in Florida.\u201d\u201cOur payments network is governed by standards that have been established over time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cChief among these is that we do not and will not permit merchants to engage in unlawful activity on our network.\u201d He said the company would continue to talk to customers and lawmakers about its policies.If Visa and Mastercard are unwilling to act on this issue, the credit card processors and banks that issue credit cards could try. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which issues credit cards and owns a payment processor, has talked about how he and his bank have \u201ca moral obligation but also a deeply vested interest\u201d in helping \u201csolve pressing societal challenges.\u201d This is your chance, Mr. Dimon.And here\u2019s a variation on the same theme: What if the payment processing industry\u2019s biggest customers \u2014 companies like McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Apple, Amazon, AT&T, CVS and others that regularly talk about \u201csocial responsibility\u201d \u2014 collectively pressured the industry to do it? There\u2019s a chance that some of the payment processors would stop handling gun sales. Perhaps their voices would help push one of the banks to step out and lead?Is all of this a pipe dream? Maybe, but I spent the last 72 hours calling and emailing a handful of chief executives to discuss these ideas. None wanted to speak on the record, because it\u2019s a hot-button topic. But all applauded the idea and some said they had already been thinking about it. A few, I discovered later, called their peers to begin a conversation.At least two executives said a reason that they haven\u2019t been more outspoken yet is that they fear reprisals from the N.R.A. and other gun supporters \u2014 not just in the form of boycotts that could affect their bottom line, but also actions that could imperil the safety of their employees.Perhaps the biggest stumbling block to an approach like this are companies like Walmart, which has huge sway over the financial industry. While Walmart stopped selling assault rifles in 2015, it might look askance at any policy by a bank issuer or credit card company to limit the kinds of products it sells.Critics of using the finance industry to influence gun sales might argue that such a move would be discriminatory against gun retailers. But gun sellers are not a protected class, like age, race, gender, religion or even political affiliation. This would be a strictly commercial decision.Another critique is that it is impossible to prevent every shooting, no matter how guns are restricted. And the banks\u2019 actions would affect millions of their own law-abiding customers, effectively dictating what they can and cannot buy.The most troubling aspect of having the finance industry try to restrict gun sales is that it would push the most dangerous guns into an untraceable world where sales would depend on cash. That\u2019s true. All things considered, though, it would make it considerably harder to even find such guns.There are other sectors of the finance industry that could step up. For example, Lloyd\u2019s of London is the favored insurance company for gun shows. It could pull out.None of this is a panacea. But it\u2019s a start. It takes leadership and courage \u2014 exactly what these executives say they have. If they don\u2019t want to back up their words with actions, the next time there\u2019s a school shooting that prompts a conversation about gun companies, it should also include the financial complex that supports them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Charm Offensive, Qatar Pushes for a Comeback in Washington", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With a mix of lobbying, potential investment and pledged support for the United States military, Qatar\u2019s charm offensive with the Trump administration appears to have paid off.Last week, top Qatari officials were feted at a lavish reception and august think tank in Washington. A Qatari investment team met with Boeing executives at the company\u2019s assembly plant in South Carolina. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson called Qatar \u201ca strong partner and longtime friend.\u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis noted Qatar\u2019s \u201clongstanding support of America\u2019s present and continuing commitment to regional security.\u201dAnalysts said the reality was more complicated. \u201cThe Qataris made a better grade on counterterrorism and the Saudis overplayed their hand,\u201d said Aaron David Miller of the Wilson Center, a former negotiator and Middle East analyst for the State Department. \u201cAnd the combination of those two things meant we have restored balance in our relationships in the Gulf.\u201dMr. Tillerson heads to the Middle East next week, where the growing American tilt toward Qatar is likely to be on stark display. At a meeting in Kuwait to solicit investments and donations for Iraq\u2019s reconstruction, the Qataris are expected to make a significant pledge of funds, according to a senior State Department official. But the Saudis, saddled with a costly war in Yemen, and Emiratis, long suspicious of Iraq\u2019s Shiite-led government, are not expected to make similar pledges, said diplomats in the region who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the funding assistance had not yet been announced.There are signs that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s view now holds sway in the White House.In his meetings last week, Defense Minister Khalid bin Mohammed al-Attiyah said Qatar would upgrade living quarters for United States military personnel stationed at al-Udeid Air Base, which hosts nearly 10,000 American troops. The base, southwest of Doha, is the overseas headquarters for United States Central Command.At the same time, Qatar has hired some of Washington\u2019s most influential deal makers and now pays 21 lobbyists in Washington.The Saudis and Emiratis have mobilized their own extensive lobbying network in Washington to push back against the Qataris, and a delegation of prominent American Jewish leaders is scheduled to fly soon to Abu Dhabi.Officials on Capitol Hill say they have been inundated by competing lobbying teams. And the Saudis and Emiratis remain formidable players in Washington\u2019s influence game, with the Emirati ambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, being one of the city\u2019s most popular hosts. Mr. Otaiba declined to comment.\u201cFoggy Bottom might be rolling out the red carpet, but I don\u2019t see any evidence the charm offensive is changing minds on Capitol Hill,\u201d said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which has aligned with the Saudi and Emirati view of the dispute.While the Trump administration has quietly suggested a summit meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Washington \u2014 which the State Department hopes will lead to ending the embargo against Qatar \u2014 the Saudis and Emiratis have expressed little interest.\u201cThe Emirati and Saudi view is, \u2018We will wait the Qataris out. We can live this way for a very long time,\u2019\u201d Jon B. Alterman, the director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a phone interview from Abu Dhabi.\u201cThe Qataris have been bad actors,\u201d he said.That view was not widely shared in the Trump administration while the Doha delegation was in Washington.Mr. Tillerson was the featured speaker at an elaborate reception that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce hosted for the Qatari officials; it was a rare evening social appearance for the secretary of state. Then, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s foreign minister, was given a respectful audience at the American Enterprise Institute, one of Washington\u2019s most prestigious conservative think tanks.But risks remain for Qatar, especially as it works with the Trump administration, which views Iran as the region\u2019s villain.\u201cThe administration\u2019s policy in the Middle East is moving from primarily an anti-ISIS approach to an anti-Iran one,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure how well Qatar fits into that.\u201dMargaret Coker contributed reporting from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and Helene Cooper from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On \u2018Tin Cup Day,\u2019 Mayor de Blasio Sees a Role Reversal of Sorts", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s annual pilgrimage to make New York City\u2019s financial case before skeptical state legislators in the Capitol usually follows a predictable pattern: He asks for money; Republican lawmakers scoff.But on Monday, Mr. de Blasio was the one rebuffing calls for increased spending, as he repeatedly rejected state officials\u2019 calls for the city to contribute more money to the deteriorating subway system.On what has become known as Tin Cup Day, Mr. de Blasio doubled down on the positions he has articulated many times in the past weeks and months. No, New York City would not pay for half of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s $800 million emergency plan to rehabilitate the subways. No, he would not support a proposal to create special tax districts around new subway developments. Yes, he still preferred a millionaires tax over congestion pricing.And over the course of three-and-a-half hours, state lawmakers interrogated him on those positions \u2014 sometimes gently, sometimes not.\u201cYou today have said several times that the city is not legally responsible for the capital costs of the M.T.A.,\u201d Senator Catharine Young, a Cattaraugus County Republican and chairwoman of the Finance Committee, said. \u201cI would say to you, Mr. Mayor, that those statements are not correct.\u201d\u201cWith deepest respect, I absolutely disagree with your legal interpretation,\u201d Mr. de Blasio replied.\u201cI\u2019m reading from the law, Mr. Mayor,\u201d Ms. Young interrupted.\u201cYou\u2019re going to need suggestions,\u201d Mr. Hannon said. \u201cThe millionaires tax \u2014 which probably isn\u2019t even alive on arrival, being dead at the beginning \u2014 we need many more suggestions than we\u2019ve heard.\u201dMr. de Blasio repeatedly pointed out that people who live or work in New York City contribute 70 percent of the agency\u2019s revenue, and that the city directly gives $10 billion each year. But Republican lawmakers pointed out that of the agency\u2019s $30 billion capital program, the state has agreed to fund about 30 percent, and the city less than 9.Indeed, many of the questions and answers revolved around a numbers game, with both the mayor and state legislators quoting the statistics that most supported their point that it was their side that bore the brunt of the subway\u2019s financial burden.At least two legislators asked for a straightforward breakdown of what portion of the agency\u2019s funding came from the state and what portion from the city. Both times, Mr. de Blasio did not answer directly, instead reciting the $10 billion statistic or warning in more general terms about the \u201csea change\u201d effect of shifting capital funding costs to the city.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about tens of billions of dollars in shifted expenses, which is an insupportable number,\u201d he said.On Monday morning, while Mr. de Blasio was testifying, the Senate\u2019s Independent Democratic Conference, a group of Democrats who collaborate with the Republicans, released a survey in which they said 75 percent of city subway riders supported the city paying for half of the subway action plan.And the city\u2019s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, testifying immediately after Mr. de Blasio, told the state legislators that he, too, favored more city contributions to the subways.\u201cWe are not looking for a handout,\u201d he said.Of the proposal to create special tax districts on developments near transit expansions, an idea known as value capture, Mr. de Blasio said such a move would \"blow a hole in the city\u2019s budget\u201d and allow the state to raid the city\u2019s property tax revenue, forcing him to cut back on vital services such as education or public safety.Dani Lever, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s press secretary, said the city could block the formation of any special tax district it did not want by vetoing the capital project associated with it.Mr. de Blasio also repeatedly insisted that he would not support any congestion pricing plan that did not include a \u201clockbox\u201d legal guarantee that any revenue generated would go only toward New York City\u2019s subways and buses.\u201cThat would be a situation that would be very damaging,\u201d he said, \u201cif we all agreed on a revenue vision and then woke up to find the money went elsewhere.\u201dLegislators also berated Mr. de Blasio for poor conditions in the city\u2019s public housing complexes and for his refusal to enact a property tax cap to which other municipalities statewide are subject. Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Staten Island Republican who ran against Mr. de Blasio in November, made a show of examining her own property tax records against Mr. de Blasio\u2019s, noting that she paid nearly $2,000 more in property taxes each year even though his home was worth nearly three times more.After the hearing, the mayor and the governor, who are famously at loggerheads, met privately for nearly an hour and a half. As he emerged from the governor\u2019s office, Mr. de Blasio said the meeting had been \u201cgood.\u201dStrained attempts at diplomacy were evident during the hearing, too. While Mr. de Blasio at times could not hide his frustration with the grilling, he tried \u2014 at least in his words if not in his tone of voice \u2014 to maintain a note of optimism.\u201cI don\u2019t buy the conventional wisdom of what is viable here in Albany and what\u2019s not,\u201d he said as he looked at the dozens of state legislators arrayed imposingly above him in the hearing room. \u201cI\u2019m going by what I think is the best outcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Was a Pioneer in Outsourcing Services. Now, the Model Is \u2018Broken.\u2019", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWIDNES, England \u2014 The residents of the Millbrow Care Home were already frail with old age and illness when they started losing weight at alarming speed.The reason: They were being neglected, an investigation revealed. For over a year, they had been deprived of food and drink for hours on end. They were not being given the medication they had been prescribed. There were outbreaks of vomiting and diarrhea, and outdated food in the kitchen. No one was in charge of preventing the spread of infections, and managers rarely made an appearance.Under Labour and Tory governments alike, Britain has been a pioneer in outsourcing public services to private contractors, seeing it as a way to reduce public expenditures, create more jobs in the private sector and, presumably, deliver services more efficiently.For years, outsourcing seemed to accomplish those goals by and large, making Britain the second-largest market for outsourcing in the world, after the United States.But recently, relying on private contractors to deliver public services has come under fire, not only from the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, but from parts of the British government itself.Nearly a decade of austerity budgets and declining funding for local governments, which pay for many outsourced services, has badly strained the system.Nowhere are the problems more glaring than in the care of the elderly and those with disabilities. A third of Britain\u2019s 5,500 care providers are at risk of failure, Mr. Hood said, a rate well above other sectors of the economy.Governments have become good enough at driving down the prices of contracts, he added, that companies struggle to make a profit. Carillion collapsed in part because it had underbid for contracts that became unsustainable when it ran into delays and cost overruns.That pattern seems to have played out at Millbrow, which has been taken over by the local council while the company restructures.Clients in the British system fall into two broad categories: those who are self-financed, and those whose care is paid by the local council. But providers and health care experts said that local governments typically fund little more than half the actual cost, forcing providers to charge higher rates to self-funded residents.Four Seasons, the provider, says it had trouble recruiting and retaining staff, forcing it to rely on temporary workers. \u201cThe home had not been financially sustainable and had been making a loss for some time,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cSo we were effectively paying to provide care.\u201dAs conditions deteriorated, both care givers and the relatives of residents said in interviews, a revolving door of managers led to frequent breakdowns in communication, to the point that no one was aware the home was nearing collapse.Staffing levels on a floor caring for residents with dementia were \u201chorrendous,\u201d said Lisa Riley, a 39-year-old care giver. At one point, she said, there were only four employees to look after 35 people. This meant some could not be supervised around the clock and would wander, sometimes tripping and falling. \u201cWe tried, that\u2019s all we can say,\u201d she said.Public inspectors found residents at risk of choking because they were not made to sit upright when they ate. Staff members were seen handling soiled laundry without wearing gloves, the inspectors added in the government report, and cushions and other material were \u201cheavily contaminated, and had a strong malodor.\u201dIn the last year, at least 13 nursing homes run by Four Seasons have either closed or, like Millbrow, been taken over by local councils.One home in South Hampshire that closed had to transfer its elderly residents. Within a month, five had died, according to a former employee.\u201cSome of these people should not be moved because they\u2019re not going to last,\u201d said the employee, Lynne Wells. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t. A lot of these people are in their 90s. It\u2019s just so sad really.\u201dSaddled with $700 million in debt, Four Seasons is in restructuring talks with an American hedge fund, H/2 Capital Partners, which holds most of the debt. Adult care experts worry about the ramifications if a major company like Four Seasons, which cares for about 17,000 elderly people, should collapse like Carillion.According to experts, care homes in Britain do not make close to the 15 percent returns that private-equity companies typically look for.The \u201cpernicious pincer movement on profits,\u201d said Mr. Hood, the insolvency specialist, has prompted some providers to end contracts with local governments or refuse services to publicly funded residents \u201cbecause it\u2019s cheaper to leave the beds empty.\u201dEventually, said Mr. Hood, \u201cthe government will have to take the care home market in some form of public partnership. It will have to.\u201dAt Millbrow, local officials say they are able to provide better care than Four Seasons had, even on the same budget, because they do not have to squeeze out a profit and be accountable to shareholders.On a recent visit, electricians were seen installing wiring for a new fire alarm system. Schedules for \u201cinfection control training\u201d and \u201cmoving and handling refreshers\u201d were posted on a whiteboard nearby. Staff were being trained how to deal with patients with dementia. In the back garden, builders were looking at fixing what had been open sewers.\u201cEverything revolves around money,\u201d said Ms. Riley, the care giver, as she gave a resident her noon meal. \u201cBut at the end of the day it\u2019s about vulnerable people. We need to take care of them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of debt held by Four Seasons. It is $700 million, not $700 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chief of Leading Investment Firm Steps Aside After Client Complaints", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Abraaj Group, one of the largest private equity firms specializing in emerging markets, said on Friday that its founder, Arif Naqvi, would no longer oversee the firm\u2019s asset management business.The World Bank and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were among the prominent investors that, over the past year, have been questioning the firm\u2019s governance practices.The investors\u2019 main fear was that Abraaj might have used cash allocated for investments in hospitals in Pakistan and Kenya for other, unauthorized purposes. Suspicions arose when investors learned that more than $200 million, which the firm had said it would use on investments in 2016, hadn\u2019t actually been deployed.The Abraaj Group previously said that the cash had not been invested because of regulatory holdups in countries where the fund was investing.But Abraaj clients weren\u2019t satisfied, and they demanded that an independent accountant be hired to determine how the funds were used over the past year.Mr. Naqvi hired KPMG, the auditing giant, to look into the matter. Earlier this month, KPMG said that the Abraaj Group had acted appropriately in its use of client funds.In Friday\u2019s statement, Abraaj said that two senior executives, Omar Lodhi and Selcuk Yorgancioglu, would become co-chief executives, replacing Mr. Naqvi as stewards for Abraaj funds.Mr. Naqvi, Abraaj said, would retain a nonexecutive role as a member of the firm\u2019s investment committee.The Abraaj Group also said it would hire independent consultants to scrutinize its governance standards and how the firm is organized.Until now, Mr. Naqvi had controlled every aspect of Abraaj, from the investments it made to the people it hired and, critically, how client money was deployedThrough the World Bank\u2019s private sector investment arm, the International Finance Corporation, the bank was among the larger clients of Abraaj, putting $300 million into the firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Haunting of Lindsey Jacobellis", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byENCINITAS, Calif. \u2014 The Olympics were months away, and Lindsey Jacobellis, the world\u2019s most dominant athlete in the short history of snowboard cross, wore shorts and a tank top and sipped from a water bottle on a warm day near the beach. She had arrived at the coffee shop from home on a skateboard. Two dogs slept at her feet. A starfish pendant dangled from her neck.Her body was nowhere near the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. But her mind was.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it just be nice if the media didn\u2019t harangue me for something that happened 12 years ago?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can go into everyone\u2019s past 12 years ago and pick out something that they coulda, shoulda, woulda done. It\u2019s just mine was on a world stage that people have a hard time forgetting, or they just think that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s happened or that it defined me as an athlete.\u201dThe day before, as she had done a time or two most weeks for most of a year, the 32-year-old Jacobellis spent an hour on FaceTime talking with Denise Shull, her mental coach \u2014 a \u201cperformance architect,\u201d in Shull\u2019s words. They spoke about how to handle the coming onslaught of uncomfortable questions from reporters bent on dredging up past failings \u2014 especially that one notorious fall \u2014 as if all of life can be reduced to a single, recycled story line.Working with a mental coach, or a psychologist, or a performance architect, is nothing new in sports. But two things made this pairing more interesting than most.She has been trying to overcome it since \u2014 not for herself, really, because she has moved on, quite spectacularly, if people would just pay attention more often than every four years. What she was trying to overcome was something ghostlier, something harder to catch and release, which is the nagging feeling that when huge numbers of people think of Lindsey Jacobellis, they see a blooper, not a champion.She knew the questions were coming because she faced them in 2010, when she fell short again, and in 2014, when it happened a third time. Certainly, her reward for remaining atop her sport as the 2018 Winter Games approached was to be asked them all again.The biggest difference this time, besides the experience and wisdom that come with four more years, is that Jacobellis has Shull. Their pairing was the idea of Peter Foley, the longtime United States snowboard cross head coach.\u201cShe\u2019s had a bad experience with the Olympics, and in a lot of ways she dreads the Olympics now,\u201d Foley said. \u201cIt would be nice if she could feel better about it.\u201dShull\u2019s purpose is to see if a new mind-set can make the difference between gold and disappointment. And as much as it frustrates Jacobellis to be reminded of it all, internally she has embraced Shull\u2019s unusual advice: Do not try to put 2006 out of your mind, because that is impossible. Even in the starting gate, even in a gold medal race, if the thoughts creep to the memory of a long-ago fall, not the gauzy vision of the medal stand, seize them.\u201cWhat you want athletes to do is say, \u2018I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 \u201d Shull said. \u201cBecause they all are. And if they say it, they can use it. If they try to set it aside, it\u2019s lurking around them, interrupting what they normally know how to do.\u201dIt is the opposite of what many sports psychologists and coaches preach, which is to clear the mind and think only positive thoughts. To Shull, to pretend that negativity does not exist is as ridiculous as children holding hands over their ears and shouting \u201cnuh-nuh-nuh-nuh\u201d to avoid hearing what is being said.The results have been promising. Jacobellis, a 10-time gold medalist in boardercross at the X Games (which discontinued the event in 2017), won her fifth world championship last March and the first two World Cup events this season. She has reasserted herself as the favorite heading into the Olympics.\u201cHopefully these are all small positive steps, moving forward, that could potentially have things line up for me right for this one,\u201d Jacobellis said.Jacobellis and Shull mostly talk from distant time zones. They have met in person only a few times. They may be the odd couple of the Olympics.Shull hails from the financial world, having made a living as a trader and trading desk manager. But a deep interest in psychology (her master\u2019s thesis at the University of Chicago was on the neurobiology of Freud\u2019s Repetition Compulsion Theory) had her thinking about mind games on Wall Street, where the general rule is to take emotion out of decision making.Clients, she said, told her that her unusual views on confronting emotion, not ignoring it, helped with out-of-work diversions, too, like golf. A trading desk manager in Asia, Shull said, raced cars as a hobby, and one particularly fear-inducing turn on a racetrack consistently ruined his time.\u201cI said, \u2018O.K., as you go into that turn, I want you screaming in that car that you are terrified,\u2019 \u201d Shull said. \u201cWhat do you think happened? Fastest time ever. Coaches might have a heart attack if they heard a racer say that \u2014 literally, \u2018I\u2019m terrified, I\u2019m terrified, I\u2019m terrified.\u2019 But the chances that they win have gone way up. That contracts the energy in a way it becomes fuel. It focuses the energy.\u201dA colleague had a connection to the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, and Shull espoused her theories to coaches at a meeting in 2016. Afterward, she was approached by Foley. I think I have a client for you, he said: Lindsey Jacobellis.\u201cI didn\u2019t know her,\u201d Shull said. \u201cSo I Googled her.\u201dShe learned that Jacobellis grew up in Connecticut and, as a teenager, was an up-and-coming racer in the burgeoning sport of boardercross, where a pack of riders leaves the gate at once and navigates a high-speed roller coaster of a course, racing to the bottom amid the occasional carnage of collisions and crash landings.Her rise was timed perfectly. She was 20 when snowboard cross, as the Olympics called it, made its Olympic debut in 2006. Jacobellis was anointed, predictably, as a made-for-television sweetheart in a must-see new event, a favorite with cascading ringlets of blond hair and a smile that masked her competitive muscle.Then, in a moment, she became better known for falling than she would have for winning, the butt of jokes and even the target of animosity. She never really understood it. She tried to smile it away, but strangers seemed more bothered by the fall than she did. Wherever she went, the episode and the questions \u2014 How? Why? \u2014 followed her like a plume of snow.\u201cI don\u2019t think it has to do with the Olympics,\u201d she said that day in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s just on a fluke of when things work out for me and when they don\u2019t.\u201dHer longtime teammate Faye Gulini was more exacting.\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how much pressure is put on her,\u201d she said four years ago. \u201cIt breaks my heart because I think it takes the fun out of it for her. Just this event. She loves the sport. She\u2019s a phenomenal snowboarder. But it\u2019s in her head.\u201dShull\u2019s first conversation with Jacobellis in 2016 focused on 2006. Shull was one of the first people who did not try to convince Jacobellis that she should just get over it but instead said she should examine it.\u201cI was like, wait a minute \u2014 you were doing what teenagers do,\u201d Shull said. \u201cYou were defining yourself. \u2018Everyone expects me to be this perfect little golden girl who wins this gold medal,\u2019 and what do we all do as teenagers? For normal people, you change your major in college, or you date the wrong girl. You do something that\u2019s different than what everyone is telling you and expecting you to do.\u201dIt was a distinct echo of what Jacobellis said at the coffee shop that warm day not long ago.\u201cBreaking it down, it was almost this rebellious act,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what 19-year-old\u201d \u2014 she was 20 \u2014 \u201cdoesn\u2019t flirt with a little rebellion when they\u2019re growing up as an individual?\u201dOne of the dogs, a terrier mix named Gidget, stirred at her feet. Jacobellis continued.\u201cI had always been so disciplined, and then you get to that moment where you have a choice, and you almost don\u2019t want to do something that someone is forcing you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a little bit easier to forgive myself because now you understand, maybe, why you did something when you didn\u2019t know the rhyme or reason for it. It wasn\u2019t an insult to the country. It was just me being a teenager and trying to express myself and having fun snowboarding and being lost in the moment.\u201dShe smiled.\u201cIt was just something that happened,\u201d she said, conclusively. Gidget barked, as if for punctuation, or maybe an amen.Before the 2006 Winter Olympics, Jacobellis starred in a commercial for Visa. A fictional coach tried to calm her nerves.\u201cImagine yourself on the medal stand,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one can touch you.\u201dIt is the same positive-thinking mantra athletes routinely hear. Shull does not buy it. It\u2019s O.K., even helpful, she said, to be nervous at the starting gate, to hate a certain part of the course, to have memories of falling as the next finish line approaches. Just talk about it.Foley admitted that Shull\u2019s advice to Jacobellis can make him uneasy.\u201cThe more she deals with it, in some ways, that\u2019s hard work \u2014 you\u2019re not allowing yourself to ignore all the feelings you have, and that\u2019s got to be difficult,\u201d Foley said. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth a try. We\u2019ve been there a lot of times, and it hasn\u2019t gone how we wanted for Lindsey, so why not work hard like this and see where we can get?\u201dFoley said Shull was not \u201ca miracle cure\u201d and nixed the idea of her attending the Olympics, preferring that Jacobellis keep a relatively normal competition routine. But Jacobellis and Shull met in California for a couple of days just before Jacobellis left for South Korea. They expected to continue their long-distance sessions leading to Thursday, the day of the women\u2019s snowboard cross competition.Back in Encinitas, in another time and place, Jacobellis allowed herself to daydream about the Olympics. She admitted to a \u201cvery strong love-hate relationship\u201d with them.\u201cI\u2019m hoping that through all the years that I\u2019ve been doing this, that these things will all come together and help keep me calm and focused, and hopefully I\u2019ll come through,\u201d Jacobellis said.Soon she was gone, on her skateboard trailed by two dogs, thinking she might spend the afternoon surfing. The Winter Olympics, past and future, felt far away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "About 25% of Trump\u2019s Re-election Spending Continues to Go to Lawyers", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign raised $15.2 million in the last three months of last year, and spent $1.2 million on legal fees \u2014 with much of the cash going to law firms responding to investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 according to campaign finance reports.The reports, filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday evening, indicate that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and two fund-raising committees it formed with the Republican National Committee \u2014 Trump Victory and Trump Make America Great Again \u2014 entered this year with $32.3 million in the bank.Mr. Trump and his team seem determined not to repeat that.A considerable portion of the money raised in the fourth quarter, more than $4 million, came from supporters who gave $200 or less.Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law and a senior adviser to his campaign, said in a statement that the campaign\u2019s election commission reports revealed that \u201cgrass-roots support for President Trump is stronger than ever.\u201d She added, \u201cNever has a president enjoyed so much support from small donors who continue to rally around him.\u201dCultivating small donors is not cheap. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign committees paid $1.1 million to a company owned by Brad Parscale, the digital director for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the architect of his online fund-raising program. Much of that money was likely spent on online and social media advertising.Legal fees were among the biggest expenses detailed in Wednesday\u2019s reports, accounting for about 25 percent of all the $4.7 million spent by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and its two joint committees with the Republican National Committee.The legal bills highlight the degree to which Mr. Trump\u2019s preparations for a re-election bid in 2020 have been shadowed by the investigations being pursued by congressional committees and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and connections between Russia, Mr. Trump and his associates.Election law permits campaigns to pay legal costs that stem from issues related to the relevant campaigns.It is not possible to determine definitively how much of the legal spending by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign went toward responding to the Russia inquiries.Some of the groups listed in the reports also handle other legal matters for the campaign. That includes Jones Day, the law firm that received the largest share of legal fees \u2014 $852,000 \u2014 in the reports. It represents the campaign in matters related to election and campaign finance law, as well as litigation stemming from the campaign.But Jones Day also represents the campaign in connection with the investigations, helping to respond to requests for tens of thousands of pages of documents and interviews with campaign officials.Mr. Cohen referred a question about the legal fees to the Trump campaign. Michael Glassner, the executive director of the Trump campaign, did not respond to an email asking whether the campaign was covering Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal costs.The Trump campaign also paid $29,000 for legal consulting to the Trump Corporation, among several payments to Trump companies.An additional $3,900 in rent went to Trump Plaza, presumably for office space, and another $11,000 in rent to Trump Restaurants, as well as more than $10,000 in travel costs to the Trump International Hotel here. The hotel has become a hot spot for donors and others seeking to rub elbows with Trump family members and insiders.The company\u2019s president, Robert W. Seiden, said he would have to check to see if he could reveal the purpose of the payment. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t be able to,\u201d he said, because of confidentiality agreements with its clients.Mr. Pence\u2019s PAC, Great America Committee, donated more than $200,000 to Republican candidates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pressure From Trump May Lead to Revision of Democratic Memo", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Under pressure from President Trump, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee plan to redact a memo defending the F.B.I.\u2019s surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide to resolve Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint that the document disclosed highly sensitive information, a Democrat on the committee said Saturday.But the Democrat, Jim Himes of Connecticut, accused Mr. Trump of hypocrisy in demanding changes to the document, echoing a grievance leveled by other Democrats on the committee. Mr. Himes noted that the president had declassified the contents of a rival Republican memo, based on the same underlying documents, that criticized the F.B.I.\u2019s behavior despite vigorous objections from both the bureau and the Justice Department.\u201cThere is just no way that man will allow the release of information that shows that the Nunes memo is just plain wrong,\u201d Mr. Himes said in an interview, referring to the Republican memo drafted by aides to Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the committee\u2019s chairman.Both memos address the F.B.I.\u2019s justification for seeking a secret court warrant in October 2016 to eavesdrop on the former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page, who was suspected of being an agent of Russia.Republicans claim that F.B.I. and Justice Department officials seriously misled the court by failing to disclose that they were partly relying on research that had been financed by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Democrats are seeking to rebut those charges by declassifying other information in the application for the 90-day warrant, which was approved and renewed by the court three times.In a letter to the White House on Friday, top Justice Department and F.B.I. officials said they had law enforcement or national security concerns about declassifying parts of the Democratic memo. While Mr. Trump \u201cis inclined to declassify\u201d the document, the White House counsel said in a letter to the House committee, \u201che is unable to do so\u201d until those passages are redacted.Although the committee had voted to release the memo, Democrats now have little choice but to revise it to overcome the president\u2019s objections, Mr. Himes said.In a Saturday morning tweet, Mr. Trump accused the Democrats of deliberately drafting a \u201cvery political and long\u201d document so that he would be forced to block its release. He said that it would \u201chave to be heavily redacted\u201d to protect \u201csources and methods (and more)\u201d and that he had instructed the Democrats to \u201cre-do and send back in proper form!\u201dThe ranking Democrat on the committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said that Mr. Trump was unwilling to declassify information that would present a fairer picture of why the law enforcement officials believed they had probable cause to spy on Mr. Page for about a year.\u201cMr. President, what you call \u2018political\u2019 are actually called facts, and your concern for sources and methods would be more convincing if you hadn\u2019t decided to release the GOP memo (\u201c100%\u201d) before reading it and over the objections of the FBI,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in a tweet.The demand that the Democratic document be redacted ensures that the battle over the competing memorandums \u2014 which began three weeks ago \u2014 will drag on. Once the 10-page memo is amended, the Intelligence Committee would presumably need to vote again to release it. The president would then have another opportunity to review it and decide whether to declassify it.Nicholas Fandos and Mark Landler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Latin America\u2019s Female Leadership Void", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 After President Michelle Bachelet of Chile leaves office in March, Latin America will have no female presidents.There was a time in 2014 when the region had four: Laura Chinchilla in Costa Rica, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in Argentina, Dilma Rousseff in Brazil and Ms. Bachelet. Now, Latin America is left with few prospects for female presidents in the near future.More than most regions, Latin America has used affirmative-action laws to close the gender gap in political leadership. But to hold these gains, and to help ensure that women continue to rise to top political positions, Latin America needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up.Quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics, but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead a country.Women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas. Argentina passed the world\u2019s first quota law for female candidates for Congress in 1991, requiring political parties to nominate women for at least 30 percent of the open positions. It was recently updated so that half of parties\u2019 congressional slates must be women. Today, all but two Latin American countries have a quota or parity law for legislative candidates.Women hold more than 35 percent of legislative seats in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Nicaragua. Bolivia has a majority-female legislature. In the United States, by comparison, women make up just 19 percent of the House of Representatives and 22 percent of the Senate.Many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates. Many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders.But while affirmative-action laws help women get ahead, they do not save them from political crises.Ms. Bachelet, Mrs. Kirchner, Ms. Rousseff and Ms. Chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president, in a region already accustomed to female leaders. The three presidents on the left \u2014 Ms. Bachelet, Mrs. Kirchner and Ms. Rousseff \u2014 also benefited from the \u201cpink tide,\u201d a wave of leftist leadership that swept Latin America from 1998 to 2016.In this period, the region was buoyed by a commodities boom. Flush with resources, countries expanded social protections for workers, the poor, indigenous peoples, L.G.B.T. people and women.Then the party ended: Economies declined and security concerns increased. Citizens became disillusioned, and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart. Voters decided to throw most incumbents out, men and women alike.But the women fell harder than the men, making clear that there is still a double standard for male and female leaders.More women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment. The glass ceiling remains.But ending the sexism and hostility that drives women from power requires changing cultural attitudes and ending impunity toward violence against women.Costa Rica has tackled traditional notions about who should lead by applying quotas to the civil-society sector. By law, nonprofit organizations must have gender parity in their top leadership positions. This includes charitable, humanitarian and social-service organizations, bringing men into positions from which they\u2019ve historically been absent.After all, if more women take power in politics and business, men will need something else to do.Jennifer M. Piscopo (@Jennpiscopo) is an assistant professor of politics at Occidental College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Executives, Addiction Recovery in the Lap of Luxury", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersTrey Laird knew his life looked good. After graduating from an elite prep school in Manhattan and then Dartmouth College, he began working in finance and climbed a well-worn path to professional success and financial comfort. He lived with his wife and two children in Darien, Conn., one of the wealthiest communities in the United States.He always liked to party: \u201cI was the guy playing beer pong in the basement at the fraternity,\u201d he said. But after having his appendix removed, he got hooked on prescription pain pills.Mr. Laird, who worked as an equity sales trader, found ways to function with his addiction. \u201cI knew taking OxyContin while I was brushing my teeth in the morning wasn\u2019t normal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I figured it would just be how it was. I wouldn\u2019t have a very long life and that would be it.\u201dBut when his wife found an empty, 500-count bottle of OxyContin, she forced him to go into treatment. Mr. Laird entered Silver Hill Hospital, a nationally known treatment center in New Canaan, Conn.As the opioid crisis tightens its grip on the nation, an industry has sprung up to offer treatment centers for executives like Mr. Laird who seek care in a discreet environment that allows them to continue working. Some programs even focus on specific professions.After treatment, a cottage industry of sober-living houses and coaches is available to keep executives on track. None of this is cheap \u2014 nor particularly accessible for those without the financial resources \u2014 but it aims to be the best care money can buy.After his stay at Silver Hill, Mr. Laird turned to the more traditional support network of recovering addicts. It was then that he got an idea to formalize the support he had been giving and receiving.\u201cI went to pick up these guys at Silver Hill, and the guy next to me, an accountant from the Midwest, said he was worried about going home,\u201d Mr. Laird said. \u201cThat was my signal to go start something with the protection of living in a house where everyone is sober.\u201dIn 2015, he opened the Lighthouse, a luxury sober-living home in Darien for executives. Last year, he opened a second branch in New Canaan. With rates of $10,500 to $17,500 a person a month that are not covered by insurance, these homes are not for people of modest means.The house in New Canaan is 8,000 square feet and valued at more than $4.5 million. It is decorated like a home in a design magazine; the basement contains a golf simulator.But Lighthouse homes are more than a comfortable living space; they provide support and accountability for residents who go to work during the day and come back at night. In addition to their counseling and treatment sessions, residents are required to use a Breathalyzer and attend a weekly house meeting.Other facilities are offering treatment programs aimed at executives.Silver Hill is starting an executive program in conjunction with the Yale School of Medicine next month. The fees will be a bit less for a private room at Silver Hill, which costs $70,000 to $80,000 a month, said Samuel A. Ball, a professor of psychiatry at Yale\u2019s medical school who will be the program\u2019s director.Caron Treatment Centers, which runs several recovery programs, has a property in Boca Raton, Fla., called Ocean Drive that bills itself as \u201ca discreet luxury rehab center for people of affluence and influence.\u201d It costs $75,000 for the first month and $65,000 a month after that.The company\u2019s center outside of Philadelphia has created more specific programs for medical professionals at $50,000 for an average stay of six weeks. For lawyers, the fees are $32,000 for a four-week program and $25,000 for additional months.Despite the intentions of the programs, their high fees and luxury accommodations have drawn criticism from treatment professionals, who say they walk a fine line between coddling and helping.\u201cThe challenge is if the term \u2018executive\u2019 is code for just rich people or someone with a high-powered job,\u201d said Arden O\u2019Connor, chief executive of the O\u2019Connor Professional Group, which consults on treatment plans for addiction and eating disorders.But she said it was helpful for people entering treatment programs to be around others of the same age and background. Being in the wrong group could make some older executives resistant to the program.\u201cYou send them into a facility with a bunch of 27-year-olds who dropped out of college for IV heroin use, they\u2019re going to say, \u2018I\u2019m not as bad as them\u2019 and leave,\u201d she said.Dr. Ball said the new executive program at Silver Hill would be as rigorous as other programs at the hospital, but with a greater emphasis on programs for individuals. The residents will be allowed to work as long as it did not affect their treatment.\u201cWe\u2019re building, in a structured way, the opportunity for people to continue their connection to their work, to the extent their company allows it,\u201d he said. \u201cThese may be executives in the middle of big deals, and they can\u2019t disappear for a month. They can maintain communications, and that differs from other programs.\u201dBradley F. Sorte, vice president for Florida operations at Caron, said the company\u2019s tailored programs for doctors and lawyers separated them further from general treatment programs. In the case of doctors, the level of care meets their medical knowledge.When recovering addicts finish their time at a rehab center, they often go to a sober-living house, where the goal is to be a bridge back to their old lives.Barry Goldberg, 62, an executive from West Hartford, Conn., said that when he finished his inpatient alcohol treatment at Mountainside in Canaan, Conn., last year, he was not ready to go back to his family and asked to stay at a sober-living house instead.\u201cThey had their own facility there, but it was very young and very opiate-focused,\u201d he said. \u201cIt involved having no car, working in a restaurant they owned, and them managing my money. That wasn\u2019t for me. They knew I was a professional.\u201dHe went to the Lighthouse\u2019s Darien location for several months. He said he was busy with meetings and work throughout the day and that helped him stay on track. At night, he ate dinner and shared stories with other residents who had done well in their careers. He finished the program in January.\u201cI have avoided relapsing,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said. \u201cI attribute that to building a very broad-stroke, diverse program that I stuck with.\u201dThere are certainly criticisms of this elite approach. By default as much as design, such executive-focused programs attract high-functioning addicts, the ones who were able to keep their professional lives together and amass the savings to pay the bill. They are people like Mr. Laird, who rose to the level of managing director at his firm while doing drugs before riding the train to work.\u201cIf you still have your job, you can pull the ripcord at anytime,\u201d said Ariel Eliaz, manager of NYC Sober Living in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, which charges $7,500 a month. \u201cThere is the financial freedom aspect of it. You feel like you can run off.\u201dMr. Eliaz, who also works as an actor, was destitute when he got sober at age 33 in 2012. He understood why executives needed a different environment, but he said for him, the fellowship of other addicts allowed him to enter into and stay in recovery.What these executive centers provide \u2014 somewhere between clinical rehab hospital and five-star resort \u2014 is the gray area that some professionals need to get well.\u201cYou\u2019re trying to get someone to put some external motivation on them until there is some internal motivation,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIf someone is making all the money in the world and they\u2019re at the pinnacle, and their wife is afraid to say no to them, short of the board of directors saying, \u2018You screwed up the last earnings call,\u2019 there is no one else to make that call.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steve Wynn Resigns From Company Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe casino mogul Stephen Wynn resigned Tuesday as chairman and chief executive of his company, Wynn Resorts, in response to sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades.In a statement, Mr. Wynn said he was stepping down because \u201can avalanche of negative publicity\u201d had created an environment \u201cin which a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts.\u201dAmong other things, he was accused of demanding that women masturbate him or massage him naked. A manicurist said that when she went to his office for an appointment in 2005, he pressured her to disrobe, lie on his massage table and have sex. The woman told co-workers about the episode at the time and filed a human resources report. Ultimately, Mr. Wynn paid her a $7.5 million settlement, according to The Journal.After Mr. Wynn announced his resignation on Tuesday, the commission said it would \u201cneed to assess the overall impact and implications of this significant development.\u201dMr. Wynn also stepped down as chairman of Wynn Macau, the arm of the company that focuses on Macau, the Chinese gambling enclave. Shares of Wynn Macau, which are traded in Hong Kong, had been halted pending the release of the announcement, but the company said it would seek to resume trading on Thursday. Wynn Resorts\u2019 stock price had already tumbled in response to the misconduct allegations, from $200.60 on Jan. 25 to $163.22 on Tuesday.In a statement, the company\u2019s board said it had accepted Mr. Wynn\u2019s resignation \u201creluctantly.\u201dMr. Wynn\u2019s mark on Las Vegas is indelible. From the Mirage, which he opened in 1989, to the Bellagio and the soaring Wynn Hotel and Encore towers, he introduced the idea that visitors to the Strip were not there just to gamble. He also offered them top-of-the-line staterooms, fine dining and Rodeo Drive-level shopping.He first arrived in Las Vegas as a young boy with his father, Mike Wynn, an East Coast bingo parlor operator. After his father died, Mr. Wynn and his wife at the time, Elaine Pascal, took over the business. He called out the numbers while she counted the cash.In 1967, he bought a small stake in the Frontier casino. More deals would follow, including the takeover of the publicly traded Golden Nugget, which operated a run-down casino in downtown Las Vegas. Mr. Wynn started an ambitious renovation and expansion project that would ultimately lead him back east to oversee the construction of the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City.But his rising stature in Las Vegas in the 1980s resulted in frequent regulatory inquiries and investigations into possible ties to organized crime. Mr. Wynn was always quick to point out that the various examinations found no wrongdoing.His relationship with his ex-wife, a force of her own in Las Vegas, has been tumultuous. Married when they were teenagers \u2014 she was 18 and he was 19 \u2014 they divorced, remarried and divorced again in 2010. Ms. Wynn sat on Wynn Resorts\u2019 board for years before she was removed in 2015.Since 2012, the two have been locked in a legal battle over control of Ms. Wynn\u2019s stake, valued recently at $1.6 billion, in Wynn Resorts. An agreement she signed with Mr. Wynn gives him the right to vote her stake in the company and limits her ability to sell her shares. A spokeswoman for Ms. Wynn declined to comment Tuesday evening.His resignation may help stanch the bleeding for Wynn Resorts, which has a number of ambitious projects in the works. Besides the huge resort set to open next year in Boston Harbor, it is clearing land behind its Wynn and Encore hotels in Las Vegas for \u201cParadise Park,\u201d a sandy waterfront around a 38-acre lagoon that is to include a casino, a hotel and restaurants. And in January, the company began laying out its vision for another 38-acre property it acquired late last year, a resort and casino called Wynn West.Matthew Goldstein and Tiffany Hsu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Staunch Characters\u2019 Battle Over Painting of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmong these trappings, the Beales\u2019 heirs say, was an oil painting of the former first lady as a teenager, bequeathed in lieu of a financial inheritance to the elder Ms. Beale by her brother, John Vernou Bouvier III, who was Mrs. Onassis\u2019 father and a well-to-do stockbroker known as Black Jack.The painting, lost to the Beale family for decades, is now at the center of a legal battle between them and an art gallery owner in East Hampton who bought the portrait years ago and who dismisses the Beale family\u2019s claim to ownership.Bouvier Beale Jr., a cousin of Mrs. Onassis, has filed a lawsuit against Terry Wallace, who has owned Wallace Gallery on Main Street in the heart of East Hampton for 25 years and has a clientele made up of rich and famous buyers.Mr. Beale\u2019s suit, which was filed in Federal District Court in Central Islip, calls the portrait \u201ca unique and irreplaceable work of art\u201d and a stolen heirloom that the family has long been seeking.As the plaintiff in the suit, Mr. Beale claims the painting was stolen from Grey Gardens. The estate became well known after it was featured in a 1975 documentary \u201cGrey Gardens,\u201d which depicted the two Edith Beales, a mother and daughter known respectively as Big Edie and Little Edie. The older woman was Mr. Beale\u2019s grandmother and the younger one was his aunt.Mr. Bouvier, who died in 1957, hired a society portrait artist, Irwin Hoffman, to paint his then 19-year-old daughter, Jacqueline Lee Bouvier.The portrait depicts Jackie \u2014 her head tightly framed and wearing a white embroidered blouse and a navy vest \u2014 on the eve of traveling to Paris to study at the Sorbonne several years before she would meet and marry her first husband, John F. Kennedy.The painting remains a link between the fallen socialites and their relative, Mrs. Onassis, who became one of the most celebrated women in the world. And the suit involves a fascinating part of Bouvier family history that helped make the documentary a cult classic and later led to a Broadway musical and a 2009 HBO movie starring Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore.Mr. Wallace has refused the Beale family\u2019s request to provide proof of its ownership or else hand over the painting and depicts the suit as an attempt to \u201csteal\u201d the painting rather than buy it.He called its provenance \u201cimpeccable\u201d and said he bought it legitimately in the late 1980s from \u201ca very reputable\u201d art and antiques dealer. He refused to name the dealer but said he was prepared to do so in court and give a full accounting of the painting\u2019s ownership history.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be part of my defense,\u201d he said.According to the lawsuit, the painting was probably stolen from Grey Gardens in the late 1960s. The two women never reported the theft because of a contentious relationship with local officials over the poor condition of their home, the lawsuit claims.Grey Gardens was eventually cleaned up and somewhat restored with the help of financing by Mrs. Onassis in 1972.\u201cFrom these letters, we learned that Jackie\u2019s father, \u2018Black Jack\u2019 Bouvier, had mishandled a family trust that would have provided Edie with financial security,\u201d Mr. Beale said in the statement. \u201cBefore his death, he gave his prized portrait of Jackie to Edie to make things right.\u201dAround 2004, Eva Beale happened to see the painting at Mr. Wallace\u2019s gallery \u201cand had a feeling about it,\u201d so she asked Mr. Wallace about its provenance, Mr. Beale said. He responded that he bought it from a dealer who was now dead but would not identify the dealer.That feeling that the painting came from Grey Gardens was confirmed in 2016 when Mr. Beale and his wife found in Little Edie\u2019s records a 1998 article from Hamptons magazine that showed the painting and described it as having \u201cdisappeared\u201d from Grey Gardens and bought by Mr. Wallace from a dealer.The article \u201cled us to realize that the missing painting was indeed the one at Wallace Gallery,\u201d Mr. Beale said.The painting \u201chas got a good story behind it,\u201d Mr. Wallace said, but is not very valuable. The painting has been appraised, he said, but he would not disclose that figure.The lawsuit claims that the painting \u201cwell exceeds the $75,000 threshold\u201d necessary to bring a federal suit. Ms. Noh would not give an estimate but noted that memorabilia associated with the Kennedys has historically brought \u201ca significant premium above its intrinsic value.\u201dMs. Noh said that under New York State law, an owner cannot gain what is legally recognized as \u201cgood title\u201d to a work of art if there has been a theft in its chain of custody.And with the Beales\u2019 \u201carguable claim\u201d on the painting, \u201cthe burden shifts to the current possessor to prove that the work was not stolen,\u201d she said.But Mr. Wallace called it \u201ca very strong possibility\u201d that the painting was never even given to Big Edie.\u201cThey\u2019re just assuming it must be part of their legacy \u2014 these people don\u2019t really know,\u201d said Mr. Wallace, 70, a blunt-spoken former Marine who served in the Vietnam War.\u201cI have a good clientele. Why would I risk my reputation for a painting?\u201d Mr. Wallace asked.Still, Ms. Noh said, \u201cIt is difficult to understand why Mr. Wallace refuses to disclose the provenance of the Jackie portrait.\u201dAs for the painting\u2019s provenance, which Mr. Wallace would be required to disclose for the case, if it is indeed impeccable, Ms. Noh said, \u201cIt is puzzling that he would choose to engage in that costly legal process, rather than voluntarily provide the information.\u201dMr. Wallace said he would \u201cgladly return the painting to the rightful owner, if it could be proven that the painting was stolen.\u201dOtherwise, he said, he would welcome an offer from the Beale estate to buy the painting, even while cautioning that the price might climb because \u201cI\u2019m getting more annoyed by the day.\u201d\u201cThey got a law firm to push me around, but I\u2019m not that pushable,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they didn\u2019t figure that into the equation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They stole the identities of American citizens. They organized political rallies in several states, and hired a Clinton impersonator for one event, in West Palm Beach, Fla.One sign of his connection to the trolls, according to the indictment: In what appeared to be something of an inside joke, people working for the Internet Research Agency paid an American to hold a sign outside the White House \u2014 \u201cHappy 55th Birthday, Dear Boss\u201d \u2014 to celebrate Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s birthday (June 1) in 2016.The troll farm soon drew notice in Russia: news outlets reported that it employed 250 people in 12-hour shifts to provide a round-the-clock flow of pro-Kremlin posts and comments, praising Mr. Putin and excoriating President Barack Obama and President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. Monthly salaries ranged from $1,100 for a junior analyst to $1,400 for a blogger to $4,200 a month for senior management.Mr. Bystrov, who is believed to be 59, has avoided reporters and declined interview requests.A young tech entrepreneur, Mr. Burchik, 31, joined the company in October 2013 and became its executive director, the No. 2 official, by March 2014, according to the indictment.According to online records, he registered a company in 2009 called Add1.ru that was behind a 2014 hoax. In that hoax, a young woman in aviator sunglasses calling herself Zoe Foreman spent hours spamming politicians and journalists about a horrific \u2014 and fictitious \u2014 chemical plant explosion in Louisiana.Throughout the troll farm\u2019s operations to interfere in American politics, including the election, \u201cBurchik was a manager involved in operational planning, infrastructure and personnel,\u201d according to the indictment.The business news website RBC reported on Friday that Mr. Burchik claimed not to know English well enough to understand what he had been accused of. \u201cIf a few hundred million Americans are so worried about the activities of a regular Russian small-business man from the IT-sphere doing website development, then it seems the situation in the country is completely grave,\u201d he said.Mr. Burchik told Komsomolskaya Pravda, a Russian tabloid, that he was not concerned about being detained while traveling abroad. \u201cI love my country. In Russia there are many beautiful places where you can go,\u201d he said.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.Mr. Burchik has worked on several small government projects in St. Petersburg. In 2015 he was awarded a contract worth about $20,000 to develop and publish a newspaper called Dvortsovy Ukrug, for the administration of one of St. Petersburg\u2019s municipal districts, according to government documents.That same year, another municipal district government awarded him a similar contract to prepare a film about its activities. And in 2012, he won a $4,500 contract for organizing a program for promoting \u201ctolerance and prevention of drug addiction\u201d for local schools.Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova obtained visas to visit the United States in 2014 \u201cunder false pretenses for the purposes of collecting intelligence to inform the organization\u2019s operatives,\u201d according to the indictment. They are said to have embarked on what amounted to a three-week reconnaissance tour, visiting California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Texas. Along the way, they bought SIM cards, cameras and drop phones and discussed \u201cevacuation scenarios\u201d and other security measures.According to the indictment, Ms. Bogacheva oversaw the data analysis group for the \u201ctranslator project.\u201d A woman with the same name was listed in 2013 on the website of ITMO, a prestigious science university in St. Petersburg, as a doctoral candidate. She worked there from 2011 to 2014, as an engineer in the eScience Research Institute, according to a university spokeswoman. Many of the school\u2019s graduates have gone on to work for the Russian government or for large tech companies.Ms. Krylova became the No. 3 person at the troll farm, according to the indictment. According to what appears to be her LinkedIn profile, she is a graduate of the Moscow State University of Printing Arts, where she studied with the faculty of advertising and public relations.She was the head of the Federal News Agency, which is believed to be Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s flagship media outlet. The agency is known for its exclusive coverage of Russian private armies on Syria\u2019s front line.Mr. Polozov ran the troll farm\u2019s I.T. department and oversaw the purchase of space on computer servers inside the United States to set up virtual private networks that masked the agency\u2019s Russian location, according to the indictment. After a co-conspirator traveled to Atlanta in November 2014, he gave Mr. Polozov a summary of his trip and expenses.According to business records and Mr. Polozov\u2019s page on the Russian social network Vkontakte, Mr. Polozov runs a software company called Morkov, which was registered in 2013, and began to recruit web developers and programmers in early 2014.\u201cIn need of people with knowledge of website promotion for full-time work,\u201d he wrote in a Vkontakte post on May 28, 2014. \u201cIf interested, send me a personal message.

The Russians are never as weak as you think they are. God forbid you expel the Russians or take something from them. The Russians always come back. The Russians will come back and take back what is theirs. But when the Russians return, they do not apply force proportionally.

{"Headline": "Netanyahu, Linked to $300,000 in Bribes, Says He Won\u2019t Quit", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe coalition is stable, and no one, me or anyone else, has plans to go to elections,\u201d he declared in Tel Aviv. \u201cWe will continue to work together with you for the citizens of the State of Israel, until the end of our term,\u201d in late 2019.Beloved by his base and respected even by his adversaries as a guardian of Israel\u2019s security, Mr. Netanyahu remains the dominant figure on the Israeli stage, his combined 12 years as prime minister closing in on the record of David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s principal founder.And he has defended that position in part by steadily chipping away at the institutions that balance the powers of his office in ways that seem to echo the aggressive tactics of President Trump, except that he was doing it before there was a President Trump.He and his governing coalition have campaigned to curb the activist Israeli judiciary, demonized the rambunctious press as a bastion of left-wing partisans, attacked the funding of nongovernmental organizations whose worldview they see as hostile and, as the police closed in, he has done his utmost to discredit them, too.Mr. Netanyahu rode to power in 2009, after his predecessor, Ehud Olmert, faced indictment on charges of taking tens of thousands of dollars in cash payoffs. Mr. Olmert, who was deeply unpopular after leading Israel into a humiliating Lebanon war, was politically doomed the moment Israelis heard the news, but Mr. Netanyahu also has a far more commanding hold on power.Mr. Olmert\u2019s coalition had depended on the support of potent rivals like Tzipi Livni and former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who pushed for Mr. Olmert to resign after his history of payoffs became known.But with no acknowledged successor of any stature waiting in line, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition is essentially a captive to him.Much as Republicans in the United States Congress see Mr. Trump as their best shot of retaining power, even if they do not like everything about him, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing and ultra-Orthodox allies prefer Mr. Netanyahu, whatever his faults, to being shut out by a left-of-center government.Mr. Olmert\u2019s political base was \u201cless tolerant to allegations of corruption than Netanyahu\u2019s,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, while \u201cthe more right-wing base is less open to any initiatives that may topple their leader.\u201dThere are other differences, including sheer shock value. News of Mr. Olmert\u2019s payoffs landed like a thunderbolt after surfacing in the unexpected testimony of his longtime benefactor in an open courtroom. But the outline and most of the details of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s alleged misdeeds have been dribbling out for more than a year through nearly daily leaks in the Israeli news media.Indeed, the biggest surprise contained in the recommendations the police released Tuesday night \u2014 saying there was evidence to prosecute Mr. Netanyahu on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges \u2014 was that a key witness against him was a rival for his job, Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party.Mr. Lapid, who has been gaining strength in the polls, told investigators that, while finance minister in a previous coalition, he had opposed an effort by Mr. Netanyahu to enhance a tax benefit that would have benefited an Israeli movie producer. The police said that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s tax effort was in exchange for lavish gifts from the producer Arnon Milchan.Mr. Netanyahu and his allies sought to impeach Mr. Lapid\u2019s testimony as nothing more than crass political self-interest.\u201cThis is the same Lapid who promised to bring me down at any price,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said.\u201cYou are a lousy snitch,\u201d the head of the governing coalition, David Amsalem, called Mr. Lapid. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201dHe added: \u201cYou cannot represent us in the world when every foreign leader that you meet knows you have been accused of serious offenses.\u201dThere were also demands for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s resignation in the opposition and across much of the news media, and a demonstration against him was called for Friday in downtown Tel Aviv.As a legal matter, the case now goes to state prosecutors and the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, a onetime Netanyahu aide. After closely supervising the investigation, Mr. Mandelblit will now decide whether to file formal charges. If he does, it will be a first against a sitting prime minister in Israel.Getting to that point, which would require a hearing at which Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers could argue against indictment, could take months.As a political matter, however, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-leaning governing coalition holds just 66 of 120 seats in Parliament, so any cracks in solidarity could quickly prove fatal.Within 24 hours, however, three crucial partners had indicated that they would stay by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s side for the moment. The finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, whose center-right Kulanu party holds 10 seats, signaled late Tuesday that he would not make any decisions before the attorney general\u2019s decision on an indictment.Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, whose Yisrael Beiteinu party has five seats, recalled how he was forced to resign as foreign minister after being indicted on corruption charges in 2012, but won acquittal and resumed his post a year later.\u201cThis is why until a prime minister is convicted at court, he can continue,\u201d Mr. Lieberman said.The education minister, Naftali Bennett, who leads the right-wing Jewish Home party, which has eight seats, said that replacing the government \u201cshould be done at the voting station.\u201dBut he allowed that the police recommendations were \u201charsh\u201d and called into question the prime minister\u2019s ability \u201cto be a leader and role model for the citizens of Israel.\u201d\u201cA prime minister is not meant to be perfect or live an over-modest lifestyle, but he needs to be someone people look at and say, \u2018This is how one should act,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTaking gifts in large sums over a long period of time is not living up to this standard.\u201dSpeaking in Tel Aviv, Mr. Netanyahu did not dispute that he had accepted gifts from Mr. Milchan, the Hollywood producer, and James Packer, an Australian billionaire, but he accused the police of inflating their value in order to reach what he called \u201ca magic number,\u201d the figure of one million shekels, or about $283,000.While the police portrayed his connection to the Israeli-born Mr. Milchan as \u201ca bribery relationship,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu insisted they were longtime friends. And he said investigators had ignored two instances, involving an automotive company and a television channel, in which his actions had been adverse to Mr. Milchan\u2019s business interests.\u201cHow could I on the one hand be acting in Milchan\u2019s favor and on the other against him?\u201d Mr. Netanyahu asked.\u201cWhen Ehud Olmert was forced to leave his post after an indictment was issued, that happened with full public confidence in the law enforcement agencies,\u201d the journalist Ben-Dror Yemini wrote in an op-ed article in Yedioth Ahronoth. \u201cIf Netanyahu is forced to leave his post in the coming number of months, that will happen amid an awful crisis of confidence among his supporters, who aren\u2019t exactly a negligible minority.\u201dIsabel Kershner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Student Loan Serenity Prayer", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusSeveral years ago, while driving around Los Angeles in a state of equal parts fury and despair, I called my cousin to tell her how sick of it all I was, that I was tired and couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Then I turned off my phone. I needed silence. When I turned it on again a few hours later, I was greeted with frantic voice-mail messages \u2014 back then, most people still checked those \u2014 including a good number from my mother. She was terrified of what I might have done.I immediately called her back and apologized in my most soothing Southern tone for causing concern. \u201cMa\u2019am, I had no intention of killing myself,\u201d I said. \u201cI would never do that to you, because you\u2019d still be on the hook for these loans.\u201dInspired by Recruiter Bae, I applied for as many scholarships as I could find and won 17 in a semester. But I needed additional money to cover the cost of Howard University in Washington.So I turned to Citibank. I took out about $10,000 for the first year, but it soon became clear that I\u2019d need much more to keep studying at Howard and living in Washington until graduation. After I received my diploma, I immediately owed almost $800 a month in private loans, with 12 years to pay it off. That\u2019s not counting the few hundred dollars I pay each month in federal loans. Fortunately, the government gives me more than twice the time to cough it up.This may be the part of my story where you question my judgment. Why did I choose a fancy school if I didn\u2019t have the money? How could I not have understood the financial commitment I was making? And if I\u2019m so far in debt now, why am I writing this and not pursuing a more lucrative career as a doctor or lawyer \u2014 or, as one relative put it bluntly, \u201cWhen are you going to work in a building?\u201dStill, I get it. I made the decision to take out loans. The voices in my head don\u2019t let me forget that.At my graduation, on a beautiful day in May 2007, my commencement speaker and our future president, Oprah Winfrey, spoke passionately on the toxicity of fear. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d she told us. \u201cAll you have to know is who you are. Because there is no such thing as failure.\u201d I felt invigorated by her remarks. As I told everyone at the time, just being in Oprah\u2019s presence probably raised my credit score.There\u2019s no relief for my wallet or my self-esteem. Every time I fork over another payment, I think about all of the other ways I could have financed my education. Why didn\u2019t I take more part-time jobs? I was in Washington \u2014 why didn\u2019t I try to date some closeted politician and be his well-compensated secret? Or spend more time at the campus gym and land a job stripping? I could have paid for classes in cash!And for so long, I took to heart the poisonous folklore about student-debt martyrs who selflessly scrape by to pay off their loans \u2014 those \u201cI only ate Spam and paid off my $160,000 debt in 96 hours\u201d stories. I blamed myself, thinking that if I had just worked harder and sacrificed more, I wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.I was trying to do the right thing for myself and my family. Despite the cost, going to college is still the only way high-achieving, lower-income students can hope to get a good job with a decent wage. It\u2019s not our fault that no one told us the system beyond higher education was set up for us to fail.I think of that slippery little phrase every time I field a nasty phone call from my student loan oppressors. If only I were a corporation or a bank, privy to loopholes, tax havens, lenient bankruptcy provisions and so many other measures that allow it to be treated far more humanely than actual human beings.Like so many others, I\u2019m muddling my way out of a trap. I\u2019ve come to accept that I\u2019m simply doing the best that I can with the choices I made in earnest.And I have to be good to myself. Not only is not enough attention paid to the circumstances in which our collective crisis has been created, but even less is paid to the everyday victories of people trapped in it: The days we manage to get out of our beds despite feeling completely weighed down. The times we decide to treat ourselves because we deserve it. The joy-inducing invention of that block button on the iPhone so that sometimes we can simply say, \u201cThey\u2019ll get that money when I got it.\u201dMichael Arceneaux is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cI Can\u2019t Date Jesus: Love, Sex, Family, Race, and Other Reasons I\u2019ve Put My Faith in Beyonc\u00e9.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leading Private Equity Firm Accused of Misusing Funds", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow some of those investors are claiming that the Abraaj Group and its founder, Arif Naqvi, misused funds, according to people who are familiar with the allegations but not authorized to speak publicly.The investors \u2014 including the World Bank and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 want to know why more than $200 million that they and others had provided was not spent. They fear that Abraaj may have used the money for its own purposes, according to the people briefed on the issue.Not all of the 24 investors in the fund have complained, people close to Abraaj said.In discussions with their investors, Abraaj and Mr. Naqvi have said that they did not misuse the money and that there was a misunderstanding about how the fund operates. They said delays in getting approval from regulators to build hospitals in Nigeria and Pakistan prevented Abraaj from deploying funds more rapidly.In the past, governments and foundations led the way, via direct loans and grants. But over the past year, Mr. Kim and Mr. Gates have argued that it is possible for large pools of capital \u2014 such as private equity funds, insurance companies and pension funds \u2014 to score big profits by, for example, investing in hospitals in Pakistan and Nigeria. Mr. Kim recently has singled out Abraaj and Mr. Naqvi for praise.Abraaj, which manages $13.6 billion, is the largest private equity firm dedicated to developing economies. Mr. Naqvi\u2019s fund-raising mantra is: If you want to do good and reap rich, private-equity style returns, invest in Abraaj funds.More than any of Abraaj\u2019s other offerings, the $1 billion health care fund embodies this ideal. Starting in late 2016, it drew down $545 million from investors to buy hospitals in Nigeria, Pakistan and India. The goal is to improve productivity at the hospitals, allowing them to see more patients \u2014 and make more money.At a meeting in London in September, the investors saw financial statements indicating that over $200 million in cash was sitting with the fund. They didn\u2019t know why the money had not been invested, and they asked the fund\u2019s manager, Khawar Mann, and Mr. Naqvi to see bank statements showing how the money was deployed. They claimed that Abraaj was required to return the money to investors in 60 days if it was not used during that time.Mr. Naqvi told the angry investors that he saw the company as a vehicle to buy hospitals around the world, and that was why the fund needed the cash on hand. He also cited the regulatory delays. But the investors were not convinced, and he sent more than $100 million back to investors in December.The investors asked that an auditor with no ties to Abraaj be hired to figure out what had happened. Separately, Abraaj hired KPMG to perform its own audit.Since September, the investors \u2014 which include Proparco, a French development institution, and the CDC Group, a similar body in Britain \u2014 have been requesting forensic proof that Abraaj did not use the money to fund its own operations.The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an arm of the United States government that provides incentives for American firms to invest in developing markets, is exposed to Abraaj via a $150 million loan to the group.Abraaj and its investors are restricted from publicly discussing matters related to the fund because of nondisclosure agreements signed by all parties.The World Bank has invested $300 million with Abraaj over the years, including $100 million in the health care fund. The investments were made through the World Bank\u2019s private-sector investing arm, the International Finance Corporation.The Gates Foundation has invested $100 million in the fund.When the allegations surfaced, the unit within the World Bank that looks into cases of corruption began an investigation, according to an email exchange between one of its investigators and an outside party that was reviewed by The New York Times. That review closed without finding evidence of wrongdoing, according a person briefed on the review.Mr. Kim, in his campaign to persuade the private sector to invest more in these types of markets, has often cited Mr. Naqvi and Abraaj as a model.Just as Abraaj\u2019s fight with investors was heating up in November, Mr. Kim held a video conference with prominent investors from the Middle East at World Bank headquarters. Mr. Naqvi tuned in from Dubai, and as Mr. Kim made his case that the private sector should step up, he repeatedly praised the Abraaj founder.\u201cArif has been saying this in so many settings \u2014 we are on the same side, screaming this stuff,\u201d Mr. Kim said.Mr. Naqvi responded in kind.\u201cJim, I applaud your leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been partners with the I.F.C. for 10 years, and we are proud that we are one of your larger relationships around the world.\u201dEven before this controversy, Abraaj\u2019s health care fund was struggling.The fund has invested about half of the $1 billion it raised from investors. Its largest bet was a $145 million purchase of CARE, a network of private hospitals in Hyderabad, India, and the investment has not met Abraaj\u2019s expectations, according to letters the firm sent to investors last year.The hospital has been struggling to adapt to an onslaught of regulations from the government. When Abraaj bought the company, it was earning $14 million a year, according to the letters. Now it earns $8 million before taxes and other items. Abraaj has not marked down its value to reflect the lower profits.The weak performance of the CARE deal has prompted pointed questions on Abraaj\u2019s quarterly conference calls with investors, according to people who have been briefed on the calls.A Pakistan native, Mr. Naqvi founded Abraaj in 2002, after striking it rich in a private equity deal involving a marketing company in the Middle East. With those profits, he went from being a small regional investor to one of the larger investors in the developing world. He has hired experts in Turkey, in Africa and throughout the Middle East and told them to hunt for deals.The firm grew rapidly, employing hundreds of people around the world, thanks largely to Mr. Naqvi\u2019s relentless salesmanship. He became a fixture at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and has said he spends 250 days a year on the road pitching pension funds, development institutions and others on his vision of buying companies that benefit society in the world\u2019s poorest countries.In his most ambitious fund-raising effort yet, he is currently trying to start a $6 billion Abraaj fund focusing on society-improving investments in 30 developing countries.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s \u201ctumor.\u201d\u201cCancer threw me into the center of my body\u2019s crisis,\u201d she says near the beginning of the play. \u201cThe Congo threw me into the crisis of the world, and these two experiences merged as I faced what I felt sure was the beginning of the end.\u201dThis is grim stuff, but you will recognize from earlier works Ms. Ensler\u2019s palliative strategies. With her Scarsdale honk and Louise Brooks bob, she still presents herself as your wacky activist bohemian aunt, the kind who tried to \u201cunionize all the unpopular girls\u201d in high school. She bubbles with psychological insight and empathy for anyone in distress.The result is a story that\u2019s less about connecting to people than to ideas, some of them fairly airy. Whether the play\u2019s intensely autobiographical self-focus will come off as liberating or oversharing depends, in part, on how open you are to the meanings of those connections. I was often troubled by them.To begin with, Ms. Ensler seems to blame herself (and her icy, narcissistic mother) for her cancer. She has lived much of her life, she says, preoccupied with a feeling of exile from her body and a frantic struggle to return to it through \u201cpromiscuity, anorexia, performance art.\u201d Never having given birth, she even wonders if the tumor now growing within her is a \u201ctrauma baby.\u201dBut what eventually turned a putative predisposition into the hard fact of cancer, she concludes, is the evil she bore witness to in Africa. In an earlier trip to Congo, she listened as a woman named Angelique told a tale of unimaginable horror. \u201cIt was here I walked out of the world,\u201d Ms. Ensler says. \u201cHere in the suspended somnolent zone where I told my body to die.\u201dBut aside from painting disease as a kind of moral rebuke \u2014 an idea that many people with cancer, and their loved ones, will find distasteful \u2014 \u201cIn the Body of the World\u201d seems to flow in the wrong direction. Rather than using Ms. Ensler\u2019s illness to illuminate the world\u2019s, it too often borrows from the world\u2019s suffering in an effort to legitimize her own.As a performer, she seems to know that. Whenever she returns from her spiritual, political and environmental disquisitions to the medical and personal heart of the story, the wet feeling of longing for significance that sometimes swamps the narrative dries right up. And Ms. Ensler is never more trenchant (or self-aware) than when butting against a bureaucracy. After a doctor suggests radiating her vagina to prevent recurrence, she says, in mock dudgeon but with real irony, \u201cDo you have any idea who I am?\u201dStill, I could do without the tribute to every nurse and friend and assistant who helped her through the ordeal; these namechecks make it sound as if she is giving an acceptance speech at an awards show for winning cancer. Seeing Ms. Ensler so obviously invigorated is happy ending enough.The play itself, though, still ails; like most one-person shows, it needed a second opinion.Follow Jesse Green on Twitter: @JesseKGreen.Advertisement"}

In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?)

{"Headline": "A Crazy Idea for Funding Local News: Charge People for It", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe plan, for any would-be entrepreneur brave enough to try it, goes like this: Hire some very good journalists; just one or two are O.K. to start. Turn them loose on a large metropolitan area \u2014 try San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston or any other city going through waves of change, and whose local press has been gutted by digital disruption.Have your reporters cover stuff that no one else is covering, and let them ignore stuff that everyone else is covering. Don\u2019t do movie reviews, stock market analysis, Super Bowl coverage or anything else that isn\u2019t local. Instead, emphasize coverage that\u2019s actionable, that residents deem necessary and valuable for short- and long-term planning \u2014 especially an obsessive focus on housing and development, transportation, education and local politics.Package it all in a form that commands daily attention \u2014 probably a morning email newsletter \u2014 and sprinkle it with a sense of community, like offline and online networking events for readers.How will you fund all of this? This is the most important part: Shun advertising. Instead, ask readers to pay for it with real money \u2014 $5 or $10 a month, or perhaps even more. It will take time, but if you build it right, you just might create the next great metropolitan news organization.This plan may sound simplistic, almost like a joke. Wait, Sherlock, your big idea is to create a really good product and charge people money for it? Haven\u2019t people tried this before?Less than you might think. The short history of digital media is lousy with advertising, which promotes all the wrong incentives for online news \u2014 volume over curation, aggregation over original coverage, speed over accuracy.Yet few entrepreneurs have jumped on the subscription bandwagon for local news. The reluctance makes sense; local markets are by definition small, and journalism is expensive.But after studying Ms. Lessin\u2019s and Mr. Thompson\u2019s methods, I suspect there\u2019s a market for subscription-based local coverage. Someone just has to build it.How? Consider Ms. Lessin\u2019s plan for The Information, the tech news service she started in 2013 after spending eight years at The Wall Street Journal. Back then, online subscriptions seemed antiquated; many companies had experimented with charging users, but most had failed to win large numbers of subscribers, and the big money in media was in ad-supported sites aiming for rapid expansion through viral traffic.\u201cPeople thought no one would pay for news, especially tech news,\u201d Ms. Lessin told me last month. \u201cThe problem was the news business hadn\u2019t been focused on a key question: How do I deliver a differentiated product that people would pay for?\u201dHer idea for differentiation was to charge a lot for The Information \u2014 a subscription is $399 a year, close to what The Wall Street Journal charges for print delivery \u2014 but she would offer readers quality instead of volume.The Information publishes just two or three stories a day, often scoops and analysis, including a handy daily roundup of the most important stories in tech that day.Mr. Thompson\u2019s overhead is low: He is the only writer of Stratechery, which has become required reading among tech executives and many others in the industry. He declined to divulge any subscriber numbers, other than to say he\u2019s doing very well.A high-priced subscription site may well have a natural audience ceiling. Ms. Lessin declined to divulge her subscriber base but said it was \u201csignificantly north of 10,000,\u201d which is lower than the audience for many ad-based digital publications.Sure, there are reasons to be skeptical that this model could work in local news. Many subscribers to The Information and Stratechery think of the publications as a business expense \u2014 they work in tech or finance, wealthy industries that will pay just about anything for business intelligence.Yet there are striking overlaps between what those publications do and what a subscription-based local news start-up would look like. For one thing, a lot of those wealthy people also live in undercovered urban and suburban areas; if they\u2019re paying for news about tech, wouldn\u2019t they also pay for in-depth investigations into their kids\u2019 school district, their city\u2019s mayoral race or the traffic clogging their commute?There\u2019s also the opportunity to pay for a sense of community. The Information \u2014 through the Slack chat service, conference calls and in-person meet-ups \u2014 constantly brings subscribers together to talk about the industry. A local news start-up could do the same, selling not just news but a sense of belonging.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the subscription news business, you\u2019re not selling articles,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Why do they pay?\u201cNews happens in tech every day, and I do the thinking for them,\u201d he said. A subscription-based local news business would offer the same value: \u201cYou\u2019re selling people a feeling of being informed, of being good citizens \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re selling.\u201dNow we just need someone to build it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senators Strike Bipartisan Deal on Immigration Despite Veto Threat", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A broad bipartisan group of senators reached agreement Wednesday on a narrow rewrite of the nation\u2019s immigration laws that would bolster border security and resolve the fate of the so-called Dreamers, even as President Trump suggested he would veto any plan that does not adhere to his harder-line approach.Their compromise legislation sets up a clash pitting the political center of the Senate against Mr. Trump and the Republican congressional leadership.Senators in both parties have been racing against a self-imposed end-of-the-week deadline to write legislation that could win wide support by increasing border security while at the same time offering a path to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.Members of the bipartisan group, which calls itself the Common Sense Coalition, said their deal does just that. They were working Wednesday evening to determine whether their bill could garner the 60 votes necessary to break a filibuster.\u201cThe president\u2019s going to have a vote on his concept. I don\u2019t think it will get 60 votes,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the group, adding: \u201cThe bottom line then is: What do you do next? You can do what we\u2019ve done for the last 35 years \u2014 blame each other. Or you can actually start fixing the broken immigration system. If you came out of this with strong border security \u2014 the president getting his wall and the Dream Act population being taken care of \u2014 most Americans would applaud.\u201dLawmakers are working to extend legal protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, but the discussion is complicated by other issues on the table.The bipartisan measure, sponsored by seven Democrats, eight Republicans and one independent, would appropriate $25 billion for border security, including construction of the president\u2019s proposed wall at the Mexican border, over a 10-year period \u2014 not immediately, as Mr. Trump demands.It would also offer an eventual path to citizenship, over 10 to 12 years, for 1.8 million of the young undocumented immigrants, but would preclude them from sponsoring their parents to become citizens. It would make no changes to the diversity visa lottery system, which Mr. Trump wants to end.\u201cI am asking all senators, in both parties, to support the Grassley bill and to oppose any legislation that fails to fulfill these four pillars,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the statement, referring to the chief sponsor of the measure, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.Mr. Grassley said that in offering the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, a chance to become citizens, Mr. Trump had been \u201cmuch more compassionate on a compromise than anybody thought.\u201dLimiting family-based immigration \u2014 which Democrats call \u201cfamily reunification\u201d \u2014 and ending the diversity visa lottery are anathema to Democrats. But it was unclear how many Democrats would sign on to the compromise as an alternative.Senate Democrats met in a closed-door session to talk about the coalition\u2019s plan, and lawmakers emerged saying that some of their colleagues, who favor improvements in border security but have been deeply opposed to building a wall, had reservations.\u201cI know that people want to get some certainty for these kids,\u201d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota. She said she would support the Common Sense measure, but added, \u201cWe\u2019re being asked to make some tough compromises.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not helpful at all,\u2019\u2019 said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. \u201cAll he does is create a crisis and can\u2019t help us solve it.\u201dIn the statement, Mr. Trump said that the \u201coverwhelming majority of American voters support a plan that fulfills the framework\u2019s four pillars, which move us towards the safe, modern and lawful immigration system our people deserve.\u201dHe added that he would oppose a short-term \u201cBand-Aid\u201d approach to immigration that some lawmakers have been discussing, which would protect Dreamers for a few years in exchange for a small increase in border security spending \u2014 essentially kicking the issue down the road.\u201cThe American people know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor. \u201cThey know this president not only created the problem, but seems to be against every solution that might pass because it isn\u2019t 100 percent of what he wants. If, at the end of the week, we are unable to find a bill that can pass \u2014 and I sincerely hope that\u2019s not the case due to the good efforts of so many people on both sides of the aisle \u2014 the responsibility will fall entirely on the president\u2019s shoulders and those in this body who went along with him.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s statement was a victory for conservatives in his administration, including Stephen Miller, his top domestic policy adviser, who have been pushing the president to demand an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration rules in exchange for his support of a permanent solution for the Dreamers.Several senior White House advisers told reporters on Wednesday that Mr. Trump would not relent in backing his hard-line immigration principles and said Dreamers should blame Democrats if legislation did not pass.One senior adviser, who requested anonymity to discuss legislative strategy, said the president had made \u201cdramatic concessions\u201d by agreeing to a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young immigrants. Another made it clear that Mr. Trump would not compromise any further.That bipartisan bill would call for more border security, but would not directly finance construction of a border wall that Mr. Trump has promised. The bill would offer a way for Dreamers to become legal; the homeland security statement described it as a \u201cmass legalization\u201d measure.\u201cThe McCain-Coons proposal would increase illegal immigration, surge chain migration, continue catch-and-release and give a pathway to citizenship to convicted alien felons,\u201d the statement said.The top Republicans in both the House and Senate praised the statements from the administration on Wednesday, describing them as a lift for the approach that many of their more conservative members support.\u201cThe president has made clear what principles must be addressed if we are going to make a law instead of merely making political points,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Wednesday morning.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin echoed that sentiment, saying that \u201cthe president did a very good job of putting a very sincere offer on the table. And that sincere offer that he put on the table should be the framework through which we come together to find a solution.\u201dAsked about Mr. Trump\u2019s veto threat, Mr. Graham said: \u201cWell, then, we won\u2019t go very far. Then you\u2019ll have three presidents who failed. You\u2019ll have Obama, Bush and Trump.\u201dEileen Sullivan and Ron Nixon contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Yet to Mr. Vagali, it beckons like a portal to another life, one that means moving out of his parents\u2019 apartment.Except the plant isn\u2019t hiring. \u201cYou either know somebody, or you don\u2019t get in,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here for me.\u201dAll of which helps explain why Mr. Vagali and much of the Italian electorate is either indifferent or contemptuous of the national election campaign that, on March 4, will determine who runs Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy.The country\u2019s bleak prospects have improved in recent years, but not enough to meaningfully lift its citizens\u2019 fortunes. Many companies are growing without hiring. What jobs have been created are largely temporary and part time.Nearly 30 percent of voters are undecided, according to polls. The unpredictability of the outcome amid economic unhappiness has enhanced the chances that the result could generate financial tumult in Italy and threaten a fresh shock for Europe.Anti-establishment parties are drawing support from the economically distressed \u2014 especially the populist Five Star movement, which is leading in many polls. Given that Five Star has previously called for Italy to ditch the euro currency, if it were to triumph it would present European leaders with a fresh challenge to the continent\u2019s cohesion.\u201cIt would increase uncertainty,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the London-based managing director for Europe at the risk consultancy Eurasia Group. \u201cThe markets could be spooked.\u201dStill, more than 32 percent of Italians under 25 remain unemployed, while the overall jobless rate is 11 percent. Even after three years of modest growth, the Italian economy remains slightly smaller than it was in early 2004, after accounting for rising prices.\u201cThe general perception is actually very gloomy,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss, a university in Rome. \u201cThe recession was particularly bad. A lot of people lost their jobs. A lot of people lost their savings.\u201dYoung Italians see the political class as having failed to refashion an ossified economy in which the elite maintain beach houses, fancy cars and extravagant wardrobes, while everyone else grapples with stagnation. They denounce the still-cozy world of banking in which insiders steer money to politically connected firms while would-be entrepreneurs struggle to secure capital.They also resent paying taxes to finance comfortable pensions, certain that such funds will be exhausted when they reach their senior years given Italy\u2019s monumental public debt.\u201cVoting is useless,\u201d Mr. Vagali said as he stood outside the gates of the steel mill. \u201cNothing changes.\u201dHere in the south of Italy, the hardship is especially intense, reflecting a decisive geographic divide.Northern Italy has Milan, with its financial center and high fashion, and industrial enclaves that make cars. The rugged beauty of the south, where vineyards and olive groves spread across verdant land, has seen scant material gains. Industry is minimal, and livelihoods are challenging.There has been some progress. Here in Puglia, the region that forms Italy\u2019s heel, fortunes have improved in recent years. The regional unemployment rate has dropped below 18 percent, from nearly 20 percent in 2016. Exports from Puglia grew nearly 9 percent last year, with pharmaceuticals, agricultural machinery and food leading the charge.The trouble for Italy \u2014 as for much of the world \u2014 is that rising company fortunes no longer produce many jobs.In a vast rectangular plant outside Bari, Puglia\u2019s capital, Francesco Divella, 70, presides over the pasta-making business that bears his family name.Started by his grandfather in 1895, the business today fills six plants, exporting roughly one-third of its wares to 120 countries, including Germany, the United States and Japan.Since the 1980s, the plant has roughly quadrupled its production, while its work force has less than doubled, reaching 320.\u201cWe are technology oriented,\u201d said Mr. Divella, the chief executive. \u201cWe are able to increase production without adding people.\u201dInside the factory, enormous machines clatter at high decibels, turning flour and water into sheets of pasta, slicing it into spaghetti, and carrying it into ovens for drying. Sensors looking for trouble along the line provide real-time alerts to computers tucked inside a control room.The control room was empty on a recent morning, the machinery running itself. Outside, a lone worker patrolled the cavernous plant.Only in the back of the operation, where pasta is packaged and hoisted into a warehouse, are humans found in numbers. Those tasks are the target for the next phase of automation. Divella just bought a German robotic system that will run self-driving forklifts in its warehouse at night.Even within its professional ranks, Italy is full of economic insecurity, undermining enthusiasm for the elections.Less than five years after she graduated from university, Emanuela Muolo, 28, has already given up her dreams of a career in the field she studied, financial law. She first worked an unpaid job at a local law firm, hoping to gain experience. She never secured a paid position, so she shifted her focus to banking, searching throughout Italy for a job while she worked as a restaurant hostess.Recently, she settled into a full-time position at a job center in Bari, helping unemployed people with their quests for a paycheck. She earns about 1,100 euros a month (about $1,360).She and her boyfriend have been together for five years. They contemplate marriage and starting a family, but they both live with their parents.The professional roadblocks she has encountered have left Ms. Muolo confused about the election. Her boyfriend plans to vote for Five Star. She plans to skip the polls.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel real,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, we feel far away from Rome.\u201dIn Taranto, Rome\u2019s influence is a visceral force as the Ilva steel mill \u2014 one of the largest in Europe \u2014 spews toxic dust that blackens the windows of surrounding neighborhoods.The plant began production in 1964 as a state-owned enterprise, its very existence the result of Rome\u2019s designs on developing the south to create jobs.In 2012, a local magistrate cited health issues in ordering the shutdown of major parts of the plant, by then in private hands. But the central government in Rome used an emergency decree to override that decision to preserve some 20,000 jobs.Meanwhile, the mill remains in operation.In the Tamburi neighborhood, a grid of crumbling concrete block apartments with laundry billowing from their balconies, residents have grown accustomed to watching young people move away.\u201cThere\u2019s no more jobs around here,\u201d said Ignazio D\u2019Andria, proprietor of a local cafe.Mr. D\u2019Andria does not plan to vote. \u201cI\u2019ve tried the left,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried the right. Our lives haven\u2019t changed.\u201dStanding next to the bar, Alessio Peretto grimaces at that attitude. He works at the Ilva plant, and he favors Five Star, given the party\u2019s talk of building a new economy centered on green energy.\u201cGive them a chance,\u201d he said.The rest of the crowd inside the cafe was not buying it. They have seen this stretch of southern Italy fester for decades before Rome constructed a catastrophe in the name of jobs. The land is poisoned, people are sick, and now even the jobs are imperiled. To them, the politicians seem like flies landing on a corpse.Two older men leaned against the wall, hoisting bottles of beer after a day spent cutting slabs of marble in a nearby graveyard.\u201cIn the cemetery, that\u2019s where we find work,\u201d said Antonio Caniello, 69. \u201cDeath is the only sure thing.\u201dGiulia Alagna contributed reporting from Bari, Italy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "South Africa\u2019s New President Names Allies and Rivals to Cabinet", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE TOWN \u2014 President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa announced the makeup of his first cabinet on Monday night, appointing well-respected officials to key positions but naming as his deputy a provincial power broker with a history of poor management.In forming his cabinet 11 days after being sworn in as president, Mr. Ramaphosa also retained some allies of his scandal-plagued predecessor, Jacob Zuma, apparently trying to balance the competing factions inside the African National Congress, the governing party. Mr. Ramaphosa has pledged to make clean government a priority.Although Mr. Ramaphosa succeeded in forcing Mr. Zuma to step down as president, the composition of his first cabinet underscored the enduring influence of Mr. Zuma and his supporters, experts said.\u201cIn recent weeks, a lot of people seem to have forgotten that there are many in the leadership that are not enthusiastic about the new direction taken by Ramaphosa,\u201d said Steven Friedman, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg. \u201cThere is a substantial number of people in the cabinet who supported Zuma, though, in the key ministries, Ramaphosa got the people he wanted to get in.\u201d\u201cIn making these changes, I have been conscious of the need to balance continuity and stability with the need for renewal, economic recovery and accelerated transformation,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said in a televised address.But Mr. Ramaphosa also reappointed a handful of familiar figures from Mr. Zuma\u2019s past cabinets, including some linked to cases of corruption and poor administration.In addition, Mr. Ramaphosa chose as the nation\u2019s deputy president \u2014 the post that he himself occupied under Mr. Zuma \u2014 the premier of Mpumalanga Province, David Mabuza. A longtime ally of Mr. Zuma, Mr. Mabuza switched sides in the A.N.C.\u2019s election in December, handing Mr. Ramaphosa a narrow victory.\u201cRamaphosa wouldn\u2019t have been elected without Mabuza,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.But Mr. Mabuza, he said, was known for ruling with \u201can iron fist\u201d and for \u201cconsistent allegations of corruption.\u201d His province was also for many years the \u201cepicenter of political killings,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.The appointment of Mr. Mabuza to the second-highest position in the government \u2014 one that has served as a springboard to the presidency in South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid history \u2014 could undermine Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s pledge to root out corruption, experts said.\u201cHow can Ramaphosa claim to be anti-corruption when he is standing next to such a morally compromised figure as David Mabuza?\u201d said Ralph Mathekga, a political analyst and author. \u201cWhen he talks about being anti-corruption, he\u2019ll just have to sing to the birds, because no one else will listen.\u201dEarlier this month, Mr. Ramaphosa pushed Mr. Zuma to resign as the nation\u2019s leader, though his term did not expire until mid-2019. Mr. Ramaphosa persuaded the party\u2019s top leaders that getting rid of the unpopular, scandal-plagued Mr. Zuma as soon as possible would help the party rebuild itself before national elections next year.In December, Mr. Ramaphosa, who had served as Mr. Zuma\u2019s deputy for nearly four years, was elected leader of the A.N.C., defeating Mr. Zuma\u2019s preferred candidate. In a country where the president is chosen by Parliament, the A.N.C.\u2019s top leaders effectively select the nation\u2019s leader.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Moves to Relax Rules on Cheaper Health Insurance", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration took another swipe at the Affordable Care Act on Tuesday, proposing new rules that would make it much easier for consumers to buy less expensive health insurance policies that do not comply with coverage requirements of the law.Under current rules, such \u201cshort-term, limited-duration insurance\u201d cannot last for more than three months. Under the proposal, the limit would be 364 days.The move carries out an executive order by President Trump, who said the change would benefit consumers because \u201cshort-term, limited-duration insurance is exempt from the onerous and expensive insurance mandates and regulations\u201d in the Affordable Care Act.Alex M. Azar II, the new secretary of health and human services, said the proposed rules would provide additional options to people who could not afford to pay current insurance premiums.\u201cAmericans need more choices in health insurance so they can find coverage that meets their needs,\u201d Mr. Azar said Tuesday. \u201cThe status quo is failing too many Americans who face skyrocketing costs and fewer and fewer choices.\u201dShort-term policies are intended for people who are between jobs or need temporary coverage for other reasons. They are generally cheaper than insurance that meets the law\u2019s requirements, but they offer significantly less protection to consumers.Insurers often deny short-term policies to people with pre-existing conditions and can charge higher premiums because of such conditions. Short-term policies do not have to provide the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that are required by the Affordable Care Act. They may, for example, omit coverage of maternity care, mental health care or addiction treatment. Short-term policies may impose limits on the amount the insurer will pay, but they do not have to cap the patient\u2019s out-of-pocket costs.In addition, people who buy short-term medical coverage are not eligible for the subsidies provided to low- and middle-income people who buy insurance through the marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act.Democrats denounced the proposal as another attempt by Mr. Trump to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. Republicans called it a potential lifeline for victims of the law who have been priced out of the market.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the Trump administration was promoting \u201cjunk insurance.\u201d The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said people buying these plans could be \u201cone diagnosis away from disaster, discovering they have been paying for coverage that may not cover basic care such as cancer treatment.\u201dSome health policy experts say that if large numbers of healthy people buy short-term coverage, it could drive up premiums for those who remain in Affordable Care Act plans.The Trump administration said these concerns were unfounded. But in a preamble to the proposed rules, it said, \u201cIndividuals who are likely to purchase short-term, limited-duration insurance are likely to be relatively young or healthy.\u201dAnd if those consumers develop chronic conditions, it said, they could \u201cface financial hardship\u201d until they enroll in more comprehensive plans that comply with the 2010 law.Some insurers worry that consumers will be confused and may see short-term policies as a substitute for major medical coverage.\u201cExpanded use of short-term policies could further fragment the individual market, which would lead to higher premiums for many consumers, particularly those with pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers.But Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, welcomed the announcement as an important step to \u201cexpand consumer choice, competition and access to health care.\u201dSeema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that \u201cwe don\u2019t think there\u2019s any validity\u201d to concerns that the proposed rules would destabilize insurance markets.Rather, she said, the short-term policies could appeal to healthy people who are \u201csitting on the sidelines without coverage.\u201dThe administration estimates that short-term plans may cost about one-third as much as unsubsidized comprehensive coverage.Under the proposed rules, short-term policies would have to carry a disclosure: \u201cThis coverage is not required to comply with federal requirements for health insurance, principally those contained in the Affordable Care Act. Be sure to check your policy carefully to make sure you understand what the policy does and doesn\u2019t cover.\u201dPeople will have until April 23 to comment on the proposal. Mr. Azar said he hoped to issue final rules by \u201cmid- to late spring.\u201dThe Trump administration predicted that issuers of short-term insurance would experience \u201can increase in premium revenues and profits\u201d because they could set prices to reflect the risk that an individual consumer would have high medical costs.Three cabinet departments \u2014 Treasury, labor and health and human services \u2014 drafted the proposed rules after Mr. Trump\u2019s order in October, when he said he was saving people from \u201cthe nightmare of Obamacare.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s action represents an important promise kept by the president,\u201d Mr. Azar said Tuesday.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said the short-term policies provided a useful alternative to costly major medical coverage that complied with the 2010 health law. Consumers, he said, need \u201cmore, not fewer, health insurance options.\u201dBut Mike Kreidler, the state insurance commissioner in Washington State, said short-term medical plans posed risks for consumers.\u201cIf you get sick,\u201d Mr. Kreidler said, \u201cyou may not be able to renew your coverage \u2014 there are no protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Maternity care and mental health benefits often are excluded.\u201dShort-term insurance had long been defined, by states and the federal government, as coverage lasting less than 12 months. But the Obama administration changed that in late 2016, after concluding that some insurers were abusing short-term plans and keeping healthier consumers out of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.Trump administration officials said that short-term insurance policies had become increasingly important because premiums more than doubled, on average, from 2013 to 2017 for health plans on the federal insurance exchange.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Guam, Soccer Powerbroker Is Accused of Wielding Influence Despite Ban", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA former senior soccer official from Asia who pleaded guilty to corruption charges in the United States tried to influence the election of his replacement despite receiving a lifetime ban from the sport, according to details of a complaint reviewed by The New York Times.Guam is an unincorporated United States territory in the Pacific. Lai, who once sat on FIFA\u2019s audit and compliance body, became the first person linked to Asian soccer to be prosecuted in the sprawling United States corruption case that burst into public view with a series of arrests in May 2015.Leonardo M. Rapadas, Lai\u2019s lawyer, said it was not in his client\u2019s interests to answer questions about the election accusations, at least until the conclusion of his case. A sentencing date for Lai has yet to be announced.The details underline the difficulty global soccer continues to face in policing officials who are resistant to relinquishing power, even in the aftermath of the sport\u2019s biggest corruption scandal.Though Guam is a tiny island without soccer pedigree, FIFA\u2019s political structure allows it to have as much weight in important decisions, including the choice of the president and the host of the World Cup, as powerhouse nations like Germany, Brazil and Argentina.Lai, a prominent businessman and political donor in Guam, in April 2017 pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges in New York, telling the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn he accepted almost $1 million from wealthy sports power brokers in the Persian Gulf who were seeking to buy his support and use him to recruit other Asian soccer officials prepared to take bribes. The American authorities overseeing the case allowed Lai to return to Guam while he awaits sentencing.After his guilty plea, Lai received a lifetime ban from soccer in November 2017. But that has not stopped him from meddling in local soccer, according to an affidavit provided to FIFA by Randall Cunliffe, one of the 13 voters in the election to fill Lai\u2019s former post in 2017.Cunliffe told FIFA, where he is a member of the soccer body\u2019s disciplinary panel, that Lai contacted him by telephone and urged him to pick the man who went on to win the race to be his successor, Valentino San Gil. San Gil, who had been the Guam federation\u2019s general secretary under Lai, beat his opponent, Robert Torres, a longtime former member of FIFA\u2019s ethics committee, by one vote.Torres, who served as Guam\u2019s chief justice until January 2017, said in a telephone interview that he was aware of the accusations about Lai\u2019s involvement in the election, which used handwritten paper ballots. He called for an investigation to determine whether the vote had been corrupted.San Gil did not reply to messages seeking comment. Lai\u2019s testimony in federal court forced Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah of Kuwait, a powerful power broker in soccer and the Olympic movement, to quit his soccer roles after allegations surfaced in Lai\u2019s guilty plea that he had bribed Asian officials, though he denies any wrongdoing.A FIFA spokesman said its disciplinary committee had received an anonymous complaint about Lai but no direct evidence. However, Cunliffe\u2019s affidavit shows he has been in contact with FIFA, including with Gautier Aubert, the organization\u2019s head of ethics. Cunliffe, a lawyer who serves on FIFA\u2019s appeals committee, did not respond to a request for comment.Guam, like all FIFA members, is entitled to a share of the largess FIFA dispenses. FIFA\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, has increased those sums four times, to $1.4 billion across each quadrennial World Cup cycle.In his affidavit, Cunliffe said Lai had told him in the past he had paid stipends of $10,000 to board members of Guam\u2019s federation \u201cin order to ameliorate them and continue to support his candidacy.\u201dCunliffe also told FIFA of at least three examples when soccer federation contracts were given to family members of board members, including some projects that would be directly financed through FIFA and Guam government funds. In one example, a firm run by the brother of San Gil, the new federation president, has received thousands of dollars in contracts dating back several years, according to documents reviewed by The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Shooting, Another Gun Debate. Will the Outcome Be the Same?", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis senator, Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, heard about the Florida shooting while he was on his way to the Senate floor and ripped up his speech to declare that through inaction, \u201cwe are responsible\u201d for a mass atrocity. Again.Within hours of the blood bath in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and adults were killed on Feb. 14, the machinery of the American gun debate began grinding into motion.By evening, one anti-gun group had mobilized and already sent out its first email: \u201cRESOURCES + EXPERTS AVAILABLE: Florida High School Shooting.\u201d Another group, Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and financed by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, activated the 1,500 members of its \u201csurvivors network,\u201d and soon paid $230,000 for an advertisement in The New York Times shaming pro-gun lawmakers.But this time, a few things are different: The gun control side has developed a well-financed infrastructure that did not exist when Mr. Barden\u2019s son Daniel and other schoolchildren were fatally shot at Sandy Hook. Within days of the Parkland shooting, one anti-gun group flooded Florida lawmakers with 2,500 calls and 1,700 emails opposing a bill allowing guns in schools.And perhaps most dramatically, the We-Call-B.S. teenagers of Florida have injected a passionate new energy into a stale debate, organizing demonstrations, flooding the Statehouse in Tallahassee, composing songs, creating protest signs, confronting politicians and taking to TV airwaves with an intensity and composure and power rarely seen in recent years.\u201cThe initial reaction was the same kind of sickened resignation \u2014 this is one of the worst ever, and this probably won\u2019t be enough either,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a founder of Third Way, a center-left advocacy group in Washington.\u201cWhat has changed since then is the kids and the extraordinary, galvanizing force they have become,\u201d he added, interrupting an interview to take a call from his 17-year-old son, whose class was leaving school to march to the White House. \u201cNo one knows when we are going to hit a tipping point on this issue. We may have hit it \u2014 we don\u2019t know. But if we did, it\u2019s because of them.\u201d\u201cWe have seen breakdowns in existing laws,\u201d Mr. Scalise said. \u201cBefore people talk about putting new laws on the books, when we find out that multiple laws on the books were not followed, that should be the first thing we figure out.\u201dThe rapid mobilization of the anti-gun movement is a phenomenon that has evolved with the emergence of lobbying groups filled with veteran political operatives and growing lists of supporters. By now they are used to it.But the response has been an outpouring of support. Moms Demand Action, the grass-roots arm of Everytown, has 100,000 volunteers in every state, with an email list of four million. Since the Parkland shooting, the group has added 75,000 members. In Georgia, 1,500 people turned up Wednesday at the State Capitol to lobby for gun laws, compared with 160 last year. In Minnesota, the group had 16 RSVPs before the shooting for a meeting on Tuesday; 300 people attended.\u201cWhen Sandy Hook happened, the gun lobby was ready for us. They had been preparing for 20 years to take down those parents,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, recalling that few Democratic lawmakers were willing to appear on television criticizing the N.R.A. \u201cThere was no anti-gun movement. It just didn\u2019t exist.\u201dNow, he said, \u201cthere is an increasingly mature political movement that can combine with the unique moral authority of the kids.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said each episode cracks the wall of resistance to new gun laws. \u201cEach time you do think it\u2019s a little different and people will move,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to believe it\u2019s cumulative and you win more support. You win a vote here and there.\u201dBy last weekend, gun control groups were sending out fund-raising appeals. In recent days, some groups have begun quietly helping the students organize future activities, including a march on Washington on March 24 with hopes of drawing 500,000 people.In the days after the shooting, Mr. Trump consulted advisers as well as Chris W. Cox, the N.R.A.\u2019s chief lobbyist. The president called Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip, who was traveling in the Middle East, to discuss his bill with Mr. Murphy requiring states and federal agencies to report more often to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System offenses that would bar gun purchases.\u201cThese kids, they\u2019re organizing, they want action,\u201d an aide told Mr. Trump.\u201cI want action, too,\u201d he replied, according to another aide. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ran for president.\u201dAt the request of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, Mr. Trump called a girl wounded in the attack, and afterward, the call seemed to remain on his mind, as he kept bringing it up with aides. Last Friday, he visited a Florida hospital and met victims, a visit still on his mind when he had dinner Saturday night at his Mar-a-Lago estate with his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, his daughter-in-law Lara and the Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera.The president noted that the injuries he saw were more grisly than those portrayed in the movies. \u201cHe was definitely horrified by the severity, the savagery of those wounds that the children suffered,\u201d Mr. Rivera recalled. \u201cAnd he kept saying, \u2018How do you recover from that?\u2019\u201dMr. Trump mentioned tightening background checks. \u201cHe brought up how absurd it is that someone can buy a gun even though they\u2019re on the no-fly list,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. Asked for his opinion, Mr. Rivera suggested raising the minimum age to buy an assault rifle to 21 from 18.Eric Trump, who like his brother is a big-game hunter, seemed to push back, noting that there are already more than 300 million guns in circulation in the United States, implying that new restrictions might be pointless.But the president, in defiance of the N.R.A., has since publicly embraced the age increase and ordered the Justice Department to develop regulations to ban bump stocks.By Thursday, Mr. Trump seemed to be following the lead of the N.R.A. again, talking enthusiastically of its proposal to arm highly trained teachers to fortify schools. Still, he has taken different views of gun laws before. In \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d published in 2000 when he briefly ran for the Reform Party presidential nomination, Mr. Trump called both major parties extreme.\u201cThe Republicans walk the N.R.A. line and refuse even limited restrictions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201dMr. Trump owns guns and has had a concealed weapon permit since 2010. When he set out to win the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, he was pressed by voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to support gun rights, an experience that aides said hardened his views. He dropped support for an assault rifle ban. \u201cI love the N.R.A.,\u201d he declared. \u201cI love the Second Amendment.\u201dWhether they change the outcome, the students have at least changed the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be traumatic for a long time,\u201d said Mr. Scalise, speaking from experience. \u201cThe fact that they want to get more engaged and find out what they can do to help to prevent this, I think, is courageous.\u201dFollow Peter Baker and Michael Shear on Twitter: @peterbakernyt @shearm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buffett\u2019s Annual Letter: Berkshire Records $29 Billion Gain From Tax Law", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s bottom line for 2017 got a big lift from the new tax law.In an annual letter to Berkshire\u2019s shareholders on Saturday, the company\u2019s chief executive, Warren Buffett, said the conglomerate recorded a more than $29 billion gain related to the tax overhaul that became law in December.He also said that a \u201cpurchasing frenzy\u201d had raised deal prices to a level that the company could not stomach. That was why, he said, that Berkshire had largely avoided big acquisitions last year.Here\u2019s a look at some of the highlights from the letter:Berkshire recorded a hefty windfall from the tax bill that Congress passed at the end of last year. The annual report said the tax overhaul produced a $29.6 billion gain that was offset slightly by $1.4 billion of tax payments on repatriated foreign earnings. The tax gain contributed nearly two-thirds of Berkshire\u2019s $44.9 billion in net earnings for 2017.Each year, Mr. Buffett highlights the change in Berkshire\u2019s book value, a measure of the company\u2019s net worth. The company\u2019s book value rose by $65.3 billion to $348 billion in 2017, a 23 percent gain from $282 billion at the end of 2016. The tax benefit made up a hefty 45 percent of the book value increase. In commenting on the contribution from lower taxes, Mr. Buffett said: \u201cThe $65 billion gain is nonetheless real \u2014 rest assured of that.\u201dOne of main ways that Berkshire has grown over the years is by spending large sums to acquire other companies.But the company hasn\u2019t done a big deal for some time. While that may make it harder for Berkshire to grow, Mr. Buffett said acquisitions have to have \u201ca sensible purchase price.\u201d That requirement, he said, \u201cproved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far from spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimistic purchasers.\u201dStill Mr. Buffett said he and Charles T. Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, were happy to sit on the sidelines:\u201cBoth of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don\u2019t need.\u201d\u201cDespite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will have opportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less the prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own.\u201dMr. Buffett has long set the goal of beating the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index and in 2017, Berkshire did just that.The company\u2019s book value rose 23 percent, while its stock price climbed 21.9 percent. The S.&P. 500 climbed 21.8 percent.For years, Berkshire\u2019s book value was Mr. Buffett\u2019s preferred measure for comparing Berkshire\u2019s performance to the S.&P. 500 and he highlighted the comparison on a table on the first page of the letter. But outperforming the S.&P. 500 has become more difficult as Berkshire has grown and shifted to buying whole companies. A few years ago, Mr. Buffett added Berkshire\u2019s annual stock price performance to the table.Warren Buffett has long railed against the fees that hedge funds and money managers collect from investors.A decade ago, he made a $1 million wager that an index fund that tracks the S.&P. 500 would outperform a basket of hedge funds over the next 10 years.The bet is now complete and Mr. Buffett won. The S.&P. 500 index fund that Mr. Buffett picked is up nearly 126 percent, easily outpacing the returns of five funds of hedge funds, which were up 2.8 to 87.7 percent.The big winner of the bet was Girls Inc. of Omaha. The charity received $2,222,279 last month rather than the planned $1 million.The reason? Mr. Buffett and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners had originally invested $318,250 each in United States Treasuries, with the expectation that the investment would appreciate to $1 million over the life of the bet. But in 2012, they sold the bonds and bought shares of Berkshire.That proved a wise move.Mr. Buffett\u2019s annual letter is combed over for its investment advice and folksy wisdom as well as a few corny jokes. Here are some the best lines from the latest one:An earlier version of this article misstated the book value for Berkshire Hathaway in 2017. The value rose to $348 billion, not $358 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When Athletes Do the Sportswriting?", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "FeatureThe Players\u2019 Tribune, a pet project of Derek Jeter\u2019s, allows the stars to tell their own stories. It\u2019s occasionally great \u2014 but is it journalism?Supported byBoston\u2019s callousness shocked people. ESPN broke news with details of back-room negotiations. The Boston Globe celebrated Thomas\u2019s bond to the city. FiveThirtyEight quantified the trade\u2019s impact on the Celtics\u2019 win-share probabilities. Barstool Sports posted a meme implying the Cavs\u2019 J.R. Smith \u2014 a man known to enjoy life \u2014 would be too high to notice his team had swapped starting guards. It was an onslaught of facts, justifications, adjusted advanced-analytics projections and bits. But no amount of coverage could ever fully account for such an unexpected transaction.Then, in early September, in a first-person essay for a website called The Players\u2019 Tribune, Thomas filled in the gaps: How he wanted to hang up on the Celtics general manager, Danny Ainge; how he broke the news to his two young sons; how, after some time, he forced himself to accept that his Boston ascendancy was done. Sports fans had long ago ceased to expect access to the intimate concerns of superstar players: They were too famous, too rich, too big. But here was access not just to the life of a star but also to the star\u2019s internal monologue. The Celtics front office had revealed that they saw Thomas as a mere asset \u2014 fungible, mobile, dispensable \u2014 and he responded by demonstrating his singularity. \u201cWhen I say this hurts, man, just know that it isn\u2019t because of anything anyone else did,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s only because of something I did. I fell in love with Boston.\u201d Reading it, I damn near cried.Thomas\u2019s article, more than any other in the site\u2019s history, underscored the elemental purpose of The Players\u2019 Tribune. Founded in October 2014 by the former Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter, along with the sports-marketing executive Jaymee Messler, the company\u2019s principle was that pro athletes were in dire need of an outlet in which to express themselves. Here, the athletes would be writing their own stories.The Players\u2019 Tribune originally gave athletes newsroom titles: David Ortiz, the jolly Red Sox slugger, was editor at large; Matt Harvey, the Mets hurler, was New York City bureau chief. On Twitter, jokes about Kobe Bryant \u2014 the editorial director! \u2014 flourished. Just imagine him screaming in the face of a middle reliever about a missing nut graf. For sports media, it was a way to grin in the face of the prickly existential fear they\u2019d lived with ever since social media forever changed their industry. Twitter and Instagram had already conditioned athletes to communicate with the public directly. Might they, the middlemen and middlewomen, one day be cut out altogether? Wouldn\u2019t athletes simply tell the same tales of humdrum perseverance that they do in Gatorade commercials? Didn\u2019t good writing still require good writers?Three years on, The Players\u2019 Tribune has become a regular source of breaking news: Kevin Durant announced his league-upheaving move to Golden State in July 2016 with an essayistic memo, which then become a recurring format. In November 2015, Kobe Bryant announced his retirement via 11 stanzas of spare, Japanese-style poetry, which, unfortunately, did not. And confessional pieces like Thomas\u2019s, written by N.H.L. also-rans and Brazilian soccer stars alike, have regularly gone viral.At its helm is Jeter, who spent 20 years in New York saying nothing to the press. He is an athlete famed, almost revered, for blankness. But the fact that he played in that Yankees spotlight for as long as he did and mostly avoided off-the-field notoriety suggests that Jeter might possess some hidden guile. After all, The Players\u2019 Tribune represents the first truly new wrinkle in sportswriting in a decade. But what is it, exactly? It\u2019s not fair to call it P.R. The access it provides is genuine. But you can\u2019t really get around one tricky fact: When you give the subject the final cut, you can\u2019t call it journalism either. Perhaps The Players\u2019 Tribune can be best understood as an effort by athletes to seize that most precious contemporary commodity \u2014 the narrative.But as meaningful access withered alongside print media, a new generation of sportswriters decided they would just stay in their living rooms and take their shots from there. The columnist Bill Simmons and the blog Deadspin pushed back against the hidebound conventions of sportswriting, the former with a hyperpersonal style defined by homerism, looseness and joy, the latter by happily pointing out all the ways we were being lied to. (I worked for Simmons at ESPN\u2019s Grantland for four years.) Take, for example, their coverage of Jeter. Simmons and the baseball writers at Grantland assailed this purportedly unassailable figure, running geeky statistical analysis to prove that, despite his five Gold Gloves, he was actually a miserable defensive player. Deadspin, originally a Gawker affiliate, delighted in unearthing Jeter\u2019s foibles. Once, it published a post suggesting he liked to watch his own highlights, in the nude, while shouting, over and over, \u201cYeah Jeets!\u201d That this was based on an unverified rumor sourced from Reddit didn\u2019t really matter. Deadspin was unconvinced that anyone, let alone a baseball player, should be uncomplicatedly revered. For millions of young fans, that mentality \u2014 that mainstream sports media presents a facile master narrative that is to be warred with at all times \u2014 became a defining principle.And then there\u2019s ESPN, which hovers above the whole system, Death Star-like, doing everything from dry game recaps to experiential multimedia packages to breaking-news pieces to talk shows that have come to define the way we shout about sports to websites like Grantland, which existed, to some extent, to question all of this. During his time at the network, the commentator Skip Bayless was well known for insisting that LeBron James was not, in fact, very good at basketball but was, rather, somewhat bad at basketball. And he never broke character. For the thinking sports fan, this was ESPN\u2019s great tragedy: The network wanted it all, every last nook, and so it coupled its ambitious, unparalleled coverage with shameless, soul-crushing shouting.For years, no one has dared to imagine a way to win back access. But The Players\u2019 Tribune did, by completely redefining it. The site gives its subjects final approval of their own coverage. Normally, this would be a journalistic sin, were it not for an elegant and cynical workaround: giving the subject the byline. The model has precedent in the form of the ghostwritten as-told-to sports memoir, which has bred some stone-cold classics: \u201cI Am Zlatan,\u201d the Swedish soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s prickly and strange 2011 autobiography, is one of the best things I\u2019ve ever read. (As a boy, Ibrahimovic celebrates personal milestones by stealing bicycles.) But being a bona fide literary achievement doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not brand management.Last fall, on the West Side of Manhattan, I visited the consummately start-up-like offices of The Players\u2019 Tribune, with its open-floor plan and glass-walled conference rooms, its espresso bar and its espresso bar\u2019s adjoining patio and its adjoining patio\u2019s stunning Hudson River views. Jeff Levick, The Players\u2019 Tribune chief executive, greeted me in his large, airy and spare office. Slim, small and slightly mod, Levick speaks quickly and while speaking quickly says things like \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201caspirations\u201d and \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cdisruption.\u201d He had come onboard just a few weeks earlier as the company\u2019s first C.E.O., and he was promising to turn a catchy idea with millions in financing from venture capitalists and athletes into a moneymaker. He was previously the chief revenue officer at Spotify, and, he explained, he saw the two companies as fundamentally alike. Both are \u201cplatforms,\u201d he told me: one for music, the other for what he calls \u201cA.G.C.\u201d \u2014 \u201cathlete-generated content.\u201dLevick was happy to tell me, in the classic manner of the disrupter, about how his company was about to upend an angry, worn-out industry. Sitting bolt upright, eyes locked onto mine, gesticulating with purpose, he pointed to the large flat-screen TV behind us: therein lay the enemy. \u201cI have ESPN on all day long, and I get where these athletes are coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys are the best in the world at what they do, and they can\u2019t catch a break! They\u2019re getting beaten up all day. Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t get beaten up like that.\u201d His point was this: All that unnecessary negativity that ESPN\u2019s TV shows churn out is ultimately a boon to the bottom line of The Players\u2019 Tribune because that negativity is persuading athletes to share their proprietary, much-desired content with The Players\u2019 Tribune.I suggested to Levick that there were still certain unique advantages that only traditional reporting can offer. \u201cWell, then, I guess the story of how the Isaiah Thomas trade went down would have happened somewhere else,\u201d he politely scoffed. \u201cThat, to me, was a piece of journalism that would never have been told through a sports reporter. They weren\u2019t going to get access to that story. And it\u2019s an amazing story.\u201dConboy had previously worked at Wired and Sports Illustrated and was brought in before The Players\u2019 Tribune concept had been publicly revealed, while athletes were still being recruited as investors. He remembers thinking, as it was explained to him in his first sit-down, that it could be interesting. \u201cOr,\u201d he recalled thinking, \u201cit could be terrible!\u201d Now he oversees a team of 10 out of an overall staff of nearly 80. They\u2019ve developed a few routine practices to attempt, as best as possible, to simulate an editor-writer relationship with the athlete. They push to get direct cell numbers and emails. They warn of the commitment to come. \u201cWe say off the bat, this is not a dashed off thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a transcript of an interview. You\u2019re signing up for a partnership. We wanna make a movie.\u201dSometimes, the athletes \u201ccome in hot\u201d with a draft or even just a long text message; other times, the athletes first want to talk through a difficult experience. When the former N.H.L. goalie Corey Hirsch wrote about the undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder that nearly pushed him to drive his car off a cliff, he spoke with Conboy five or six times. (Hockey has been the source of a number of The Players\u2019 Tribune\u2019s best stories, churning out compelling characters at a rate incommensurate with its place in the culture at large: The former Bruins enforcer Shawn Thornton once provided an anecdote about his Parkinson\u2019s-afflicted grandmother trying to talk him into letting her slug some booze out of the Stanley Cup.) Hirsch first revealed his story without being sure he would actually go through with publishing it. He was nervous about how his family would perceive it; and he nearly pulled it. That risk is part of the process at The Players\u2019 Tribune: Whether it\u2019s video or print, athletes have final cut and can kill a whole project. But Hirsch went through with it, and his article has been read more than a million times.Like Hirsch, the Miami Heat shooting guard Dion Waiters is not a player familiar to casual fans. But his April 2017 essay is perhaps the best thing the site has published. Waiters is a famously overconfident shooter \u2014 a chucker. In the article, through tales of violence, doubt, heartbreak and nausea, he doesn\u2019t bother defending himself. Instead, he doubles down. \u201cI see what people say about me,\u201d he writes. \u201cI see the GIFs and all that. They say, \u2018He never seen a shot he don\u2019t like.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s got irrational confidence.\u2019 \u2018He thinks he\u2019s the best player in the N.B.A.\u2019 Hell yeah I do.\u201d The essay was published during the N.B.A. playoffs, but the Heat\u2019s season was already over. The title of the piece: \u201cThe N.B.A. Is Lucky I\u2019m Home Doing Damn Articles.\u201dAfter Conboy finishes his ghostwriting, a lot of athletes can get judicious, carefully pruning or deleting moments of oversharing. \u201cWe want athletes that go in the Google Doc and just go to town,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s the best version of this.\u201d He recalled Isaiah Thomas\u2019s writing his first piece for the site. \u201cIt was 1 a.m. East Coast time, and he\u2019s texting about line edits,\u201d Conboy said. \u201c\u2009\u2018Move this around. What if this was said this way.\u2019\u2009\u201d Some players even act just like prima donna magazine writers and fight with their editors over every word. \u201cKobe writes his own drafts,\u201d Conboy said, smiling. \u201cLiterally, he writes his own drafts.\u201dBut most don\u2019t. In fact, the process, as Conboy described it to me, was oddly familiar. For the Waiters story, Conboy and his subject went out for cheese steaks in Philly, then later did a two-hour interview. \u201cProfile writing, it\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said, picking his words carefully. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting two hours anymore hardly anywhere.\u201d But Conboy could. Effectively, The Players\u2019 Tribune has found a way to simulate the access of olden times by putting control in the hands of the wealthy and attractive subjects. In a way, Conboy did profile Waiters. He just didn\u2019t receive the byline.Can this really be a going concern? That our obsessive sports media is missing heretofore untold, profound personal truths about our heroes? For all its peaks, on any given day reading The Players\u2019 Tribune, you might just run into a variation of \u201cHey [Insert City] \u2014 we\u2019re gonna give it our all this year.\u201d Neither the site itself nor its social media has become a real destination. According to comScore, the site gets a respectable 3.4 million unique views a month; its Twitter account has just over half a million followers. A lot of its content is, frankly, repetitive and predictable. The pieces that succeed effectively float away from The Players\u2019 Tribune and into the national conversation.In 2015 Katie Nolan, then the host of the scrappy, low-budget Fox Sports show \u201cGarbage Time,\u201d lodged a critique of The Players\u2019 Tribune model. \u201cIt isn\u2019t for us fans,\u201d she said in a segment on the show, which had a certain outsider credibility. (It has since been canceled.) \u201cIt\u2019s for the players who want to appear like an open book without the risk of getting themselves in trouble for being an open book. And maybe I\u2019m being cynical, but that sucks.\u201dI brought this up to Hoenig, the Players\u2019 Tribune editor. Hoenig has had a long, lucrative career. You get the sense that he\u2019s quite pleased to be at The Players\u2019 Tribune and that he\u2019s not all that worried about what happens next. Now, though, he let himself get worked up. \u201cIs it P.R. to say I\u2019m putting a face on somebody that you feel completely free to attack willy-nilly without knowing who they are?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s good strategy for an athlete to control his own \u2014 I don\u2019t even call it image \u2014 his own narrative. That\u2019d be a good strategy for you and me too.\u201dJeter spends most of his time in Miami, where he\u2019s the chief executive of the Marlins, and doesn\u2019t have his own full-time office here. We met later in a vacant office, under a wall of perfectly arrayed framed memories: photos from charity parties, past Jeter press coverage, Bryant\u2019s poem. In person, Jeter looked good \u2014 in his bluejeans and dark gray henley, the picture of casual bro chic. But there were moments that remind you that he has been around awhile. He rolled out a rotator cuff, slowly; he smashed a fist into a spike of pain on his lower thigh. His rookie season was 1996. He dated Mariah Carey! For the better part of the first half of his career, the worst-case scenario was a Page Six write-up on what Meatpacking District club he was at last night.I theorized that The Players\u2019 Tribune had been born as a retaliation to the gossip columnists who had poked and prodded him for so long. He shrugged it off. \u201cYou know how many phone calls I\u2019ve gotten from my mom through the years when I was younger asking me questions?\u201d he said. \u201cEventually you just try not to pay attention to it.\u201d He added: \u201cYou remember the Motorola two-way? When they came out? That was as good as it came. Then the color one came out. And all of a sudden. ...\u201d He trailed off. \u201cEverything you do is public knowledge.\u201dI asked him about Alex Rodriguez, his former teammate and frenemy, and a player famously, calamitously inept during his playing career at controlling his public image. (Just search for \u201cA-Rod kisses himself.\u201d) Did Jeter ever try to help him? \u201cI spoke with everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI would stress accountability to anyone that came to our organization.\u201dI asked whether, had today\u2019s athlete protests spread to the Yankees while Jeter was playing, would he have taken a knee. \u201cI\u2019m not in the clubhouse now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll say: Everyone has a right to peaceful protest.\u201dWhat did I know about Derek Jeter? Not much and certainly nothing new after this brief encounter. I left the interview feeling as though, intentionally or not, he\u2019d made a good case for access journalism\u2019s uselessness. We already live among the distorting effects of Twitter and Instagram, the uncanny and calculated sense of intimacy that social-media platforms provide. Now we have a model that simulates objective journalism, supposedly written by the people who were once subject to that journalism\u2019s scrutiny.Projecting The Players\u2019 Tribune model forward, we can imagine a world in which athletes simply don\u2019t need to talk to reporters, in an echo of what feels like the unstoppable atomization of all news and information. Politicians, TV showrunners, labor-union leaders: theoretically The Players\u2019 Tribune platform is replicable for any public professional. In the future, perhaps, every last person will get to broadcast his or her own particular worldview, free of objectivity, on a bespoke, partisan media organ, with slick photography and design. And it will be up to us to decide what version of the truth we want to believe.Amos Barshad is a writer based in New York.Advertisement"}

The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge. But that\u2019s OK \u2013 persuading customers to pay more arguably requires as much genius as getting people to adopt the technology in the first place.\u201dAmazonCritics cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:Amazon.com is going gangbusters. But some of the nearly $700 billion internet retailer\u2019s fastest-expanding \u2013 and most profitable \u2013 businesses could be ones that irritate users. Over time, that could sully the company\u2019s image.AlphabetCritics cornerJennifer Saba of Breakingviews:Alphabet is stuck at the letter G. The holding company of Google was created to safeguard against conventionality and let moonshot ideas, like self-driving cars, flourish. Almost three years in, it\u2019s basically still just Google. Which means, in turn, that the A in Alphabet stands mainly for advertising.It wouldn\u2019t hurt Alphabet to put more energy into revenue sources that don\u2019t start with a G.Why now\u2022 Walt Disney\u2019s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.Critics cornerTara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly:\u201cCBS isn\u2019t safe from the industry\u2019s broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom won\u2019t provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities. Those synergies may amount to some $500 million based on what past deals have yielded, according to Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. That could create quite a lift for CBS\u2019s earnings.\u201dBelinda Johnson is moving up. Laurence Tosi is moving out. And don\u2019t expect the company to go public this year.Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company\u2019s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis.Between the linesThe context The company lineHere\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson:\u201cShe takes critical functions that might be seen as constraints in other companies, and clears a path so they can become competitive advantages and facilitate the growth of the business.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies:\u201cHaving worked with Belinda over the years and at Airbnb, I have been consistently impressed by her ability to anticipate issues and leverage strategic opportunities.

The company\u2019s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe\u2019s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States\u2019, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.That\u2019s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin\u2019s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg.The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday.More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex.\u201cThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,\u201d said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. \u201cIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.\u201dThe digital money flyaroundDetails, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point.The contextWhile a potential joint venture between Alphabet and Aramco isn\u2019t necessarily connected to the latter company\u2019s IPO, if a deal is struck before the offering, advisers to the company could pitch the pact as a way for investors to bake in technology valuations.It isn\u2019t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company \u2014 and therefore command a higher multiple \u2014 but it\u2019d be interesting to see bankers make that argument.\u2014 Stephen GrocerFrom the release:\u201cI am excited to join NEA because they understand how to work with visionary entrepreneurs to build successful technology and health care enterprises,\u201d Immelt said. \u201cI have a passion for these sectors and I am eager to work with NEA and its partners to develop great businesses, nurture talented leaders and grow diverse teams.\u201dand:\u201cJeff is deeply knowledgeable about the complex global innovation landscape we\u2019re operating in today and he understands how businesses must evolve to compete and win in that environment, particularly across industrial and medical technologies,\u201d said Scott Sandell, Managing General Partner, NEA.(Worth noting: Mr. Immelt\u2019s successor at G.E. is struggling to turn that company around.

But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Today\u2019s a big day for tech earningsThe Treasury secretary argued that the cuts would eventually pay for themselves, but conceded that it wouldn\u2019t happen this year.The policy flyaroundAnalysts\u2019 takes:\u2022 Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch write, \u201cThis shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.\u201d\u2022 Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \u201cIn short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell\u2019s first press conference.\u201d\u2022 Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton said, \u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation.\u201dAnalysts over at Deutsche Bank think so.

{"Headline": "Vietnam Pulls Request for U.S. Help to Build a Coal-Fired Power Plant", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A Vietnamese company is no longer seeking American financial support to build a coal-fired power plant in Vietnam, bringing to an abrupt end a closely watched test of whether Washington would back international projects that could potentially contribute to climate change.The lender, also known as the Ex-Im Bank, takes on the financial risk for American companies exporting high-value equipment and merchandise as a way to help companies in the United States win valuable international business.In this case, a green light would have allowed PetroVietnam to purchase millions of dollars\u2019 worth of turbines and other equipment from General Electric, the American manufacturer.It isn\u2019t clear why PetroVietnam withdrew the application for American financial support for the Vietnamese coal plant, Long Phu 1. But the project, which is already under construction, faced intense criticism inside and outside the United States.The World Bank and other major institutions have increasingly avoided backing projects supported by developing countries that burn coal and other fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The United Kingdom\u2019s version of the Ex-Im Bank had declined to offer financial support for the Long Phu 1 project for similar reasons.The Ex-Im Bank said in a statement that it had not yet completed its due diligence review of Long Phu 1 when the application was withdrawn. It also did not specify a date for the withdrawal and referred further questions to PetroVietnam.Emails sent to two PetroVietnam officials on Sunday were not immediately returned.General Electric said in a statement on Saturday that it complies with Americans sanctions, including those announced by the Treasury Department in January. It added that it was committed to working with its \u201cpartners and customers in Vietnam to deliver world-class products and solutions for the power industry.\u201dThe project\u2019s Vietnamese backers face broader challenges. A Vietnamese court last month sentenced PetroVietnam\u2019s former chairman to prison as part of a broad anticorruption investigation.Vietnam\u2019s ruling Communist Party sees coal as central to national energy needs. Long Phu 1 would be the first element of a three-plant complex in a rural area about 150 miles southwest of the country\u2019s economic hub, Ho Chi Minh City.He added that it did not represent a retreat by the Trump administration, which has been generally more supportive of coal projects at home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican Fiscal Stimulus Could Be Bigger Than Obama\u2019s", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are pouring government stimulus into a steadily strengthening economy, adding economic fuel at a moment when unemployment is at a 16-year low and wages are beginning to rise, a combination that is stoking fears of higher inflation and ballooning budget deficits.The question is how much added fuel is good for the economy.The added stimulus is drawing some quiet cheers from liberal economists, who say a fiscal shot at a time of low unemployment could boost typical workers\u2019 wages in ways unseen for two decades. But it is raising alarms among fiscal hawks.\u201cThis is exactly the wrong fiscal policy at the wrong time,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cWe should be bringing down the debt and ensuring we have room for stimulus during downturns. Instead we are overheating the economy and selling out the future. It\u2019s shortsighted and foolhardy.\u201dThe threat of rate increases is a major reason some economists, including those at the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, project only a modest boost in economic growth from the tax law over the next decade.The tax cuts and spending increases could add up to more than $800 billion in additional federal deficits over the course of 2018 and 2019. Analysts project they will hasten the return of trillion-dollar annual budget deficits, and set the United States apart from other industrialized economies, which have reined in their fiscal expansions as growth picks up.\u201cIn a world of deficit discipline,\u201d Ethan S. Harris, the head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research note on Tuesday, \u201cthe U.S. stands out in terms of its deteriorating deficit.\u201dThe Republican tax law\u2019s $1.5 trillion deficit-financed price tag over the next decade is front-loaded. It will reduce federal revenue by $416 billion over this year and next, before accounting for additional economic growth, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. Many corporations are showing evidence of that in their quarterly earnings releases, as companies like JPMorgan Chase & Company and Verizon project billions of dollars in tax savings in 2018.Administration officials say the law will spark enough growth to pay for itself, a claim that no rigorous outside analysis supports. They also say the cuts will not stoke inflation, because they will increase the supply of capital in the economy and boost productivity.The likely spending increases include money for the military, domestic programs and disaster aid, along with a plan to shore up faltering multiemployer pension plans. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that those increases will cost more than $500 billion, and that congressional negotiators are mulling roughly $100 billion in revenue increases to offset them, yielding a deficit increase of $400 billion.Those figures do not include any potential deficit spending from an infrastructure bill, which the White House hopes to push Congress to approve this year.The 2009 stimulus package was passed when the unemployment rate was almost twice as high as it is today, and the national debt was half what it is now. At that time, Republicans called it a dangerous borrowing spree. \u201cThis bill sends us on a worldwide borrowing binge,\u201d Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, now the House speaker, said in a floor debate in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go out and borrow four times as much money this year than we ever have in the history of this country in a single year. This is not just a road to stagnation, it is a road to stagflation.\u201dFiscal hawks say that assessment is more applicable to the economy today.\u201cWe have a growing economy, the labor market\u2019s tight, we don\u2019t have a lot of idle resources,\u201d said Matthew Mitchell, the director of the Project for the Study of American Capitalism at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \u201cBasically, the very best argument for Keynesian economics doesn\u2019t apply now. So it really is the time to be austere.\u201dWhile divided government in the last six years of Mr. Obama\u2019s term produced constraints on spending, Mr. Mitchell noted, Republican control under Mr. Trump appears to be ripping them up. Democrats are helping to do that on the spending side. The spending agreements pending in Congress appear to be so large, in part, because Democrats have demanded domestic discretionary spending increases alongside large increases in military spending pushed by Republican defense hawks.Democrats largely denounce Republicans for playing down deficit concerns now, after years of warning that government borrowing was holding the economy back. \u201cThere was a far greater need for economic stimulus in 2011 than today,\u201d said Neera Tanden, a former Obama adviser who is the president and chief executive of the Center for American Progress think tank.But some liberals welcome the extra fiscal juice and its potential to help workers who struggled in the slow-growth years after the recession.Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was one of the Obama administration\u2019s stimulus architects in 2009, opposed the Trump tax bill but supports efforts to stimulate the economy when unemployment is low, in hopes of boosting wage growth.\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of recklessness of Team Trump that could kind of rebound to the benefit of people,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said in an interview, before alluding to the possibility that there are still workers outside the labor force who could be drawn back to work by a hotter economy.\u201cAs long as there is still slack in corners of the labor market,\u201d he said, \u201cthen this kind of fiscal stimulus of the economy near full employment is a kind of test I support.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Russia attacked the United States in 2016 by disrupting the presidential election.2. The origin of the attack is a matter of consensus among American intelligence agencies.3. The current president of the United States refuses to acknowledge the attack, refuses to respond to it and refuses to help protect the country against a likely follow-up attack.4. In the wake of the mass murder of 17 Americans in Florida, the president falsely claimed that the F.B.I. failed to prevent the massacre because it was too occupied with the Russia investigation. In doing so, he repeated his frequent lie that the Russian operation did not exist.There is no longer any doubt that President Trump is failing to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, as he solemnly swore to do.The new map is close to a best-case scenario for Democrats, political analysts agreed.

Harshbarger, the Republican delegate she is running to unseat, Mr. Shott cut in.\u201cMs. Lucas, we ask no personal comments be made,\u201d he said.She protested, arguing her comments weren\u2019t personal.\u201cIt is a personal comment and I\u2019m going to call you out of order if you\u2019re talking about individuals on the committee,\u201d Mr. Shott said. \u201cSo if you would address the bill.

{"Headline": "Arizona G.O.P. Tiptoes Between a Trump-Loving Base and a Leery Wider Electorate", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Representative Martha McSally of Arizona worked hard to carve out a moderate profile since her election in 2014 to a border district seat that had been held for decades by paragons of centrism from both political parties.\u201cI have a great relationship with the president \u2014 I talk to him like a fighter pilot,\u201d Ms. McSally, a retired colonel, said over a pint of beer here last month.Ms. McSally represents the evolution of the Republican establishment\u2019s handling of Mr. Trump, from wary detachment to warm embrace, and the delicate dance that Republican politicians face in 2018. Somehow, they must appeal to their Trump-besotted activist base without alienating the broader population of less partisan suburban voters and a growing minority population that has recoiled from the president\u2019s policies and divisive messaging.In that sense, Arizona has become something of a microcosm of the country\u2019s politics and could be ground zero in the fight for control of Congress in November. Hispanics make up a fast-growing 31 percent of the state\u2019s population, and moderate whites have turned greater Phoenix into what one local political veteran described as effectively the country\u2019s largest suburb.\u201cIt feels like the rest of the country is waking up to what we\u2019ve been experiencing over the last dozen years or so,\u201d said January Contreras, a Democratic candidate for state attorney general who is vying to be Arizona\u2019s first Latina elected statewide.With Mr. Flake retiring and Senator John McCain undergoing treatment for brain cancer, Republicans could be defending two Arizona Senate seats, enough to determine the majority in a chamber where they have just a single-seat advantage. A race between Ms. McSally and Representative Kyrsten Sinema, a well-funded Democrat who has the blessing of her national party, may be the marquee open-seat Senate election in the country.And there may be as many as three competitive House races across a mix of rural and urban terrain here that reflect the types of districts that Democrats will need to keep and pick up if they are to reclaim the House.Far from the caricature of being a sleepy, cactus-filled preserve of Midwestern snowbirds with a penchant for golf and dry heat, this booming and increasingly diverse state spotlights the opportunities and pitfalls both parties are grappling with nationally. As Republicans veer between a hard-line primary electorate and a very different one that will show up in November, Democrats have to hold down their losses in the rural areas and win over suburban centrists \u2014 who routinely supported Mr. McCain and a procession of Republican presidential nominees. That means offering some measure of support for immigration restrictions without depressing the state\u2019s Latinos.The roiling dispute over the border and illegal immigration in Arizona, is largely why Mr. Trump won here by less than four percentage points in 2016 and the hard-line county sheriff Joe Arpaio was ousted from his post the same year. A coalition of Hispanics and some right-leaning whites, including many of the state\u2019s Mormons, proved deeply uncomfortable with the incendiary language and scapegoating that is a rhetorical hallmark of both men.And that split seems baked in to the demography of Arizona, which has the widest so-called racial generation gap of any state in the country: Just 19 percent of the population over 65 is nonwhite; 60 percent of those under 18 are nonwhite.Those numbers \u2014 and the tension between the demands of Republican primary voters and those of the wider electorate \u2014 will eventually prove their party\u2019s undoing, some Republicans worry. There is a sharp divide between native-born white Arizonans, who grew up around Hispanics and hearing Spanish, and transplants to the Southwest from more heavily white states.\u201cThe Arizona Republican Party, they\u2019re just slitting their own throats,\u201d said John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa, which has a larger population than St. Louis. \u201cThey are pushing and doing everything they can to offend the Latino population.\u201dMr. Flake, like Mr. Giles, is a native-born Arizonan, and he shares the same alarm about both immigration and embracing Mr. Trump. He is worried that Ms. McSally is going overboard.\u201cI\u2019d be a lot more careful now in how much you cozy up,\u201d Mr. Flake said of his would-be successor, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a balance she\u2019s got to strike. I cringe a little \u2014 I think a lot of people do.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not seeking his political advice,\u201d she curtly added.The degree to which Mr. Flake and Mr. McCain have become pariahs among conservative activists was on display during a weekend of state party dinners and organizing events in which Gov. Doug Ducey avoided even mentioning their names. One party regular who showed up in Revolutionary War garb and offered only his first name, articulated the challenge for Trump-skeptic Republicans.\u201cThey don\u2019t support Trump, that\u2019s it, 100 percent,\u201d said Arthur, a transplant to Scottsdale, explaining his disdain for his senators. As for immigration, he had a blunt message for would-be migrants: \u201cFix your country. Don\u2019t come here and mess up mine.\u201dSo for now, Ms. McSally, who enjoys the quiet support of the state and national party establishment, is working to bolster her relationship with Mr. Trump.Ms. McSally is likely to benefit from the party\u2019s right wing being divided. But should the McCain seat come open, or should Mr. Arpaio, 85, not go through with his bid, she may face a more daunting one-on-one race with one of the anti-establishment candidates, both of whom sound Trumpian notes.Ms. McSally has been helped by an aggressive backstage effort from Republican officials in and out of the White House to keep the president from backing Mr. Arpaio or Ms. Ward. Before she entered the race, Ms. McSally won assurances from an intermediary that Mr. Trump would not endorse her rivals, according to a Republican directly familiar with the conversation, and she and her advisers met last week in the White House with the president\u2019s political team, an opportunity not afforded the other candidates.To further inoculate herself from the right, Ms. McSally is declining to say whether she would support a comprehensive measure that offers legal status to undocumented immigrants and is publicly showering Mr. Trump with praise, though she will not reveal whom she voted for in 2016 or any election.Is he a good man? \u201cI think he has done a lot of amazing things in his life,\u201d she said.Is he a role model? \u201cI think he is, yeah. I mean, look, everybody has got their strengths and weaknesses,\u201d she offered.Ms. McSally also said \u201csure, absolutely\u201d she would campaign with Mr. Trump in the general election, a step Mr. Flake said offered far more risk than reward.\u201cYou create ads that will be run,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd particularly if there happens to be two senatorial elections, you\u2019re going see just a wave of money.\u201dYet Ms. Sinema, who began her career in politics as a Ralph Nader supporter and has become a member of the centrist Blue Dog coalition, is stepping gingerly around Mr. Trump in ways that may irritate the left.In a brief phone interview, she declined to offer even the most gentle of criticism of a president who many in her party believe is a threat to American democracy.Ms. Sinema noted that she and Mr. Trump \u201cworked together very well\u201d on veterans\u2019 issues and sidestepped questions about his character.\u201cI mean, I\u2019m happy to work with anyone at any time,\u201d she said with a nervous laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t spend my time worrying about, you know, personality stuff. That\u2019s not my issue.\u201dAs for her own politics, Ms. Sinema would not say whether she was a progressive or a moderate. \u201cI would say I\u2019m an Arizonan,\u201d she said.It is a risk-averse approach that her allies believe could pay dividends in a state that still leans Republican, should Democrats enjoy a wave election year.But to some Arizona liberals, Ms. Sinema\u2019s pragmatism is bitterly disappointing.\u201cWe already know that we can\u2019t trust her,\u201d said Tomas Robles, who led protests at Ms. Sinema\u2019s office to push her to stand up for the so-called Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.The perennial challenge for Democrats here is that Hispanics do not vote anywhere near to the level of their population.Mr. Robles said his and other groups intended to register 200,000 new voters this year.\u201cShe\u2019s going to have to really work to earn those votes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re alienating the largest minority group in Arizona, you\u2019re going to have a tough time winning an election as a Democrat.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Otherwise, it seems impossible that they never compared the sudsy developments of their own lives to those of Meredith Grey and the doctor best known as McDreamy.At first, it seems that this will be a predictable, gratingly cute tale of heartache and betrayal. It doesn\u2019t help that said heartache is experienced by a cardiologist. Get it? She fixes broken hearts for a living!Zadie Fletcher has known her best friend, the trauma surgeon Emma Colley, for nearly 20 years. As the novel begins, both women are living in Charlotte, N.C., happily married working mothers. Both will see their careful lives threatened when a mysterious, handsome man from their past reappears.Chapters narrated by each woman alternate with sections in the voice of Zadie from back in 1999, their third year of medical school. While this structure takes a while to settle into a rhythm, the absence of Emma\u2019s voice in the past makes it immediately clear that she\u2019s the one harboring a secret. Someone died, and Emma still feels considerable guilt over what happened. (The novel relies on the kind of heavy foreshadowing that a writer like Liane Moriarty, in her \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d handles more nimbly.) Unraveling that secret, and exploring its effects on this seemingly solid friendship, will be the business of the novel.At first, Zadie\u2019s voice dominates. She\u2019s quite taken with her own sense of humor. When her children get the flu, we\u2019re told that her household \u201chad gone viral, and not in any kind of positive marketing way.\u201d Describing her husband, Zadie remarks that \u201chis finance career required slavish devotion \u2014 the sacrifice of one\u2019s firstborn, the swearing of blood oaths.\u201d Whenever Zadie complains affably about her husband, I sensed another novel in which some genuine bitterness, and a genuine exploration of how married people negotiate the power imbalances of parenthood and work, might have been given room to breathe.But as the story moves briskly forward, Emma\u2019s chapters begin to offer something more involving. Her torturous guilt \u2014 she is terrified not only that her secret will be discovered, but that her best friend will finally see her for who she truly is \u2014 starts to cast a shadow over the novel\u2019s sunny disposition.Even Emma\u2019s treatment of her career as a physician feels more fully realized than Zadie\u2019s, although Martin leverages her own background as a doctor to great effect throughout, writing vividly of accidentally sliced intestines and torrents of blood gushing from abdominal incisions.Martin is equally insightful about many aspects of long-term female friendships, especially the blind spots that they often contain by necessity, the subjects both parties are careful not to mention. \u201cOurs was a friendship forged when we were young,\u201d Emma observes. \u201cThe kind that endures no matter what because losing it would be like losing an aspect of your own personality: your sense of humor or your ability to empathize.\u201dMartin\u2019s portrayal of the guilt born of selfishness, of knowing that a past version of yourself was capable of truly monstrous behavior, is also sharp.

{"Headline": "Corruption Charges Suggested for Netanyahu", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli police recommended on Tuesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, casting a pall over the future of a tenacious leader who has become almost synonymous with his country. The announcement instantly raised doubts about his ability to stay in office.All told, the police accused Mr. Netanyahu of accepting nearly $300,000 in gifts over 10 years.Mr. Netanyahu, addressing the nation live on television shortly before the police released their findings around 9 p.m., made clear that he would not step down. \u201cI feel a deep obligation to continue to lead Israel in a way that will ensure our future,\u201d he said, before embarking on a 12-minute defense of his conduct.\u201cYou know I do everything with only one thing in mind \u2014 the good of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cNot for cigars from a friend, not for media coverage, not for anything. Only for the good of the state. Nothing has made me deviate, or will make me deviate, from this sacred mission.\u201dThe police recommendations must now be examined by state prosecutors and the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, a former military prosecutor and onetime Netanyahu aide.The final decision about whether to file formal charges lies with Mr. Mandelblit and is subject to a hearing beforehand with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers. Reaching that threshold alone could easily take months.According to the police, expensive cigars, jewelry and pink champagne flowed into the prime minister\u2019s official Jerusalem residence in quantities sufficient to stock a small cocktail lounge. The generous patrons included Arnon Milchan, the Israeli movie producer, and James Packer, an Australian billionaire.But it is the favors Mr. Netanyahu may have given his wealthy friends in return that could herald his downfall. A formal bribery charge would be by far the most serious outcome, and the most ominous for his political survival.Mr. Netanyahu, who has emerged as one of President Trump\u2019s most ardent allies, is serving his third consecutive term since his election in 2009, and his fourth overall since the 1990s. If he were to remain in the post through July 2019, it would set a record for total time in office, surpassing that of the state\u2019s founder, David Ben-Gurion.Mr. Netanyahu has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to fight on, saying that no police recommendation would prompt his resignation.His longevity attests to his political agility and to his perfection of a campaigning and governing style in which he casts his political foes and critics as enemies of the broader body politic. Though he has formed previous governing coalitions with those to his left, his current government is often described as the most right-wing and religious in Israel\u2019s history. And he has presided over an increasingly bitter relationship with the Palestinians in the territories Israel has occupied for more than a half-century, whose hopes of soon gaining a state of their own have dwindled as Israeli settlements expand.But while Mr. Netanyahu has prepared the public for this moment for months, and made strenuous efforts to discredit those investigating him, he has not prepared Israel or his government for the possibility that he may be unable to continue to lead. He has designated no successor, and no single member of his own coalition has emerged as ready to step into his shoes. Meanwhile, a centrist opposition, led by Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party, has been gaining strength.In a twist straight out of a political thriller, a key witness against Mr. Netanyahu, according to Israeli news reports Tuesday night, turned out to be Mr. Lapid himself, who had been Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s finance minister in a previous coalition.According to a police statement about their recommendations, Mr. Netanyahu promoted the extension of a 10-year tax exemption to expatriate Israelis returning to the country, \u201ca benefit that has great economic value for Milchan,\u201d who has long worked in Hollywood. But the Finance Ministry blocked this legislation, saying it was against the national interest and fiscally unsound.The Israeli law enforcement authorities have handled the cases with great caution, wary of the possibility of bringing down a prime minister who might then be proved not guilty in court, not least with Israel facing increasing security threats on its northern and southern frontiers.But Israel\u2019s constant state of alert has led some critics to argue all the more that a prime minister so focused on fighting his own legal battles cannot be entrusted with fateful decisions of peace and war.Opposition politicians pounced Tuesday night, demanding that Mr. Netanyahu step down, be ousted by his coalition or at least declare himself \u201cincapacitated,\u201d as former Prime Minister Ehud Barak urged on Twitter, calling the police findings \u201chair-raising.\u201d\u201cMost of you are honest people,\u201d Stav Shaffir, of the left-leaning Zionist Union party, wrote on Twitter, addressing Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. \u201cIf you have a drop of concern for the future, fulfill your obligation. Free Israel from this madness.\u201dBut some coalition members denounced both the investigation and Mr. Lapid\u2019s role in it. \u201cIn a democracy, a regime is changed in an election and not through the army or police,\u201d the coalition\u2019s chairman, Dudi Amsalem, told Walla News.And Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, whose center-right Kulanu party holds 10 seats in Parliament, giving it the power to sink Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government, signaled just before midnight that he was not prepared to leave the coalition, saying on Facebook that he would wait for the attorney general\u2019s decision on whether to indict Mr. Netanyahu.Projecting aplomb, Mr. Netanyahu announced that he would attend a conference of local authorities in Tel Aviv on Wednesday morning.Mr. Netanyahu long ago earned the nickname \u201cthe Magician\u201d for his uncanny knack for political endurance, and even his most ardent opponents have been hesitant to write him off.At what point he might be legally required to step down, short of a final conviction, is likely to be a matter of increasingly heated debate, though public opinion and political pressure could in the end play a decisive role.Israel\u2019s Supreme Court has ruled in the past that government ministers or deputy ministers, once indicted, may not remain in their posts. Whether that principle should also apply to the elected prime minister is an open question.Mr. Netanyahu would be something of a test case as Israel\u2019s first sitting prime minister to be formally charged.Pre-empting the police recommendations, Mr. Netanyahu told the public to expect them and did his best to minimize their importance.\u201cAny fair-minded person will ask themselves how people who say such delusional things about the prime minister can investigate him objectively and make recommendations in his case without bias,\u201d he wrote on a Facebook post last week, accusing the police commissioner, Roni Alsheich, of having an agenda.In December, Mr. Netanyahu told a gathering of his right-wing Likud Party supporters: \u201cThe vast majority of police recommendations end in nothing. Over 60 percent of the police recommendations are thrown in the trash. Over 60 percent of the police recommendations don\u2019t get to an indictment.\u201dExperts have disputed those figures, however, and the prime minister\u2019s opponents have begun quoting from an interview he gave in 2008, at the height of Mr. Olmert\u2019s legal troubles, to turn the tables on Mr. Netanyahu.Describing Mr. Olmert as \u201cup to his neck in investigations,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said of his political rival at the time: \u201cHe does not have a public or moral mandate to determine such fateful matters for the state of Israel when there is the fear, and I have to say it is real and not without basis, that he will make decisions based on his personal interest in political survival and not based on the national interest.\u201dIn some ways, though, Mr. Netanyahu has been here before.During his first term in office, in the late 1990s, the police recommended that he be charged with fraud and breach of trust in a complicated case in which Mr. Netanyahu was suspected of acting to appoint an attorney general who would be sympathetic to a minister under investigation for corruption, in return for that minister\u2019s political support. Ultimately, the attorney general closed that case, citing a lack of evidence.This time around, the police recruited a state\u2019s witness, Ari Harow, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s former chief of staff and once one of his closest confidants.Among those caught up in the shipping investigation are David Shimron, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s personal lawyer and second cousin, and Yitzhak Molcho, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lifelong friend and close adviser, whom he has sent on his most delicate diplomatic missions since the 1990s. Mr. Molcho and Mr. Shimron are partners in a law firm as well as brothers-in-law.Follow David M.

{"Headline": "Concussions Can Be Detected With New Blood Test Approved by F.D.A.", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe test, called the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator, is also expected to reduce the number of people exposed to radiation through CT scans, or computed tomography scans, that detect brain tissue damage or intracranial lesions. If the blood test is adopted widely, it could eliminate the need for CT scans in at least a third of those with suspected brain injuries, the agency predicted.Concussion-related brain damage has become a particularly worrisome public health issue in many sports, especially football, affecting the ranks of professional athletes on down to the young children in Pop Warner leagues. Those concerns have escalated so far that it has led to a decline in children participating in tackle sports.\u201cThis is going to change the testing paradigm for suspected cases of concussion,\u201d said Tara Rabin, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A. She noted that the agency had worked closely on the application with the Defense Department, which has wanted a diagnostic tool to evaluate wounded soldiers in combat zones. The Pentagon financed a 2,000-person clinical trial that led to the test\u2019s approval.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were about 2.8 million visits to emergency rooms for traumatic brain injury-related conditions in 2013, the most recent year for which the numbers were available. Of these, nearly 50,000 people died. Most patients with suspected traumatic brain injury are evaluated using a neurological exam, followed by a CT scan.One of the challenges of diagnosing concussions is that symptoms can occur at different times. In some people, they appear instantly, while in others they can show up hours or even days later. Symptoms also vary from person to person. Some experience sensitivity to noise, others lose their balance, and still others become sensitive to bright light.\u201cA blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the American public and for our service members abroad, who need access to quick and accurate tests,\u201d said Jeffrey Shuren, director of the F.D.A.\u2019s medical device division. The agency, often criticized for the pace of its approvals, noted that it had cleared this diagnostic device in less than six months.\u201cThis is something that has been a long time coming,\u201d said Colonel Dallas Hack, who was director of the Army\u2019s Combat Casualty Care Research Program from 2008 to 2014 and is now retired.\u201cThe concept originally was that we would have something that medical personnel in the field would be able to use to assess whether somebody who had received a head injury needed a higher level of care,\u201d Dr. Hack said.The test works by measuring the levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1, and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of the head injury. Levels of these blood proteins can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan, and which won\u2019t. In a statement announcing the approval, the F.D.A. said that the brain trauma indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time, and those who did not have such lesions 99.6 percent of the time.The possibility of testing an athlete on the sidelines could also be used in all sports, but particularly football, which includes high-speed collisions on every play. While professional and collegiate athletes have access to trainers and doctors, players on high school teams and in youth leagues often make do with a volunteer physician or an emergency medical technician, if at all.Far more athletes play football at younger ages. More than one million boys play football in high school, about the same as those who play baseball and basketball combined. Many more play football in youth leagues, including Pop Warner, one of the most established organizations.The F.D.A. approved the test for use in adults, but Henry Nordhoff, chief executive of Banyan Biomarkers, based in San Diego, the company that makes the device, said he thought it might also appeal to physicians evaluating children for concussions. While that would initially be an off-label use, the company plans to soon start a clinical trial evaluating injured children, Mr. Nordhoff said.There is also a smaller device for the blood test in the works, which Banyan is working on with the French company bioM\u00e9rieux, and a hand-held one they are developing with Abbott Laboratories. The tests could eventually be used in other countries besides the United States. Worldwide, about 10 million people a year are treated for concussion-related injuries, according to bioM\u00e9rieux.While a test to diagnose concussions quickly will be welcomed in the medical and sports worlds, it does not address the growing worries about the cumulative effect of repeated head hits. Head hits absorbed over many years of playing football and other sports have been linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease found in autopsies of former football players, other athletes and soldiers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$2.4 Billion Deal for Chelsea Market Enlarges Google\u2019s New York Footprint", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a tech takeover.Chelsea Market sits directly across Ninth Avenue from the company\u2019s headquarters at 111 Eighth Avenue, which is larger than the Empire State Building and covers the entire block between 15th and 16th Streets.But it is only the latest example of an internet behemoth, and even smaller tech companies, expanding rapidly in New York City.Amazon, Facebook, Salesforce, a cloud computing company, and Spotify, a music streaming service, are all enlarging their footprints here by hundreds of thousands of square feet. Employment at technology firms has grown three times faster in New York City than in the rest of the private sector, adding more than 50,000 jobs since the end of the recession in 2010, according to a report by the state comptroller.\u201cThe modern tech sector began on the West Coast when it was about developing new technology and programming,\u201d said Scott Rechler, chairman of RXR Realty, a Google landlord at Pier 57, a new mixed-use space on the Hudson River that is scheduled to open this year. \u201cIt\u2019s now about the implementation and application of technology. And that\u2019s presented an opportunity for New York, the business capital of the world. The talent pool is here.\u201dNeither side has made clear what Google\u2019s plans for the building are, and whether the popular food market will stay in place. But getting rid of tenants with leases would be a long-term process.At the end of 2017, tech firms accounted for 29.3 million, or 8 percent, of the 398 million square feet of office space in New York City, according to CBRE, a real estate company. In a snapshot of recent tech-sector activity, those companies have leased or renewed leases for 21 million square feet of office space in the last 10 years alone. If telecom companies are included, that number jumps to 26.8 million.Nine years ago, tech firms had only 17.6 million square feet of office space, or 5 percent of the office market.The tech firms generally prefer industrial spaces to the brass and glass towers of Midtown. Chelsea Market, where Google already leases 400,000 square feet of space, is a former factory building with expansive floors.Amazon has taken office space in what was once a warehouse at 450 West 33rd Street, although the owner, Brookfield, recently gave the building a face-lift and glass walls.Facebook has grown substantially at 770 Broadway, a landmark cast-iron building that was once a department store, on an entire block bounded by Eighth and Ninth Streets, between Broadway and Lafayette Street.But that trend may be changing, said Mary Ann Tighe, a broker and chief executive of CBRE in the New York region. When companies grow and need a more robust infrastructure, she said, some tech firms are migrating to traditional office towers.Salesforce, the cloud computing company based in San Francisco, moved its three Manhattan offices into a 41-story skyscraper at 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue. The Salesforce logo replaced the MetLife branding atop the building.And Spotify, the music streaming company, is moving from 620 Sixth Avenue and several other locations into nearly half-a-million square feet at the 4 World Trade Center skyscraper in Lower Manhattan.But it was Google that prompted real estate brokers, landlords, city officials and economists to sit up and take notice of the burgeoning tech sector a decade ago.In 2006, the company moved into 111 Eighth Avenue, a massive onetime shipping terminal, with tenants that included Verizon, Sprint, Web MD and BarnesandNoble.com. The building sat atop a high-powered fiber artery snaking along Manhattan\u2019s West Side. Employees used Razor scooters to navigate the blocklong corridors lined with work spaces, commissaries with free drinks and granola, and massage and game rooms.Google became a siren for other, smaller tech firms to move to the neighborhood, which was beginning to shrug off its industrial roots.In 2010, Google bought the building, also from Jamestown, for $1.8 billion, a breathtaking sum at the time. Not so long ago, blue-collar tenants had paid a very modest $6 per square foot for space there.But Google\u2019s need for space continues unabated. The company has been unable to dislodge the other tenants at 111 Eighth Avenue as quickly as it had hoped. The company has leased large blocks of space nearby, at Pier 57; at 85 10th Avenue, another former Nabisco cookie factory, between 15th and 16th Streets; and at Chelsea Market.Facebook has about 5,000 employees now in the Chelsea neighborhood, occupying a total of 900,000 square feet.Owning Chelsea Market would enable the company to create a campus akin to its headquarters in California, albeit one that is more vertical. Chelsea Market, like 111 Eighth, has been a front-runner in the evolution of the Chelsea neighborhood from an industrial zone to an area known for inexpensive space for food producers, restaurants and office tenants, and now as a tech-sector hub.An earlier version of a chart with this article misstated the number of tech workers in San Francisco in 2013. It was 79,000, not 7,900.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another of Obamacare\u2019s Unloved Provisions Is Gone", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen congressional Republicans were hoping to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act, they often railed against its least popular features as a sign of the structure\u2019s overall dysfunction.The idea behind the IPAB was that Congress often has little appetite for cost control. So, the thinking went, if Medicare spending took off, the board would develop a plan to get that spending back under control. If Congress hated the idea, it could pass an alternative that saved the same amount by a deadline \u2014 or ignore the cuts altogether if it could muster a supermajority vote to do so. But if it did nothing, the board\u2019s will would become law. But the idea was never particularly popular, even in the Congress that voted for it. The IPAB would have taken away Congress\u2019s power to make the cost-saving choices it wanted \u2014 or its choice to avoid them.As part of the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers could swallow it. And as part of a repeal package, it was a rallying cry. But on its own, it fell quietly.\u201cYou take the sour with the sweet in a big bill,\u201d said Rodney Whitlock, a vice president at ML Strategies, who remembers the development of the IPAB when he was a Republican health staffer for the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut then when somebody comes back and says, \u2018Did you enjoy this part of it?\u2019 you\u2019re forced to say, \u2018Not so much,\u2019 and take it out.\u201dThe loss of IPAB won\u2019t gut Obamacare in any major way, though it may stymie its cost containment agenda. But it\u2019s another sign that, now that big repeal-and-replace ambitions are on the shelf, the law will face instead a series of minor cuts.An earlier version of this article misstated the options available to Congress if it didn't like a decision by the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Congress could have passed an alternative to an IPAB proposal with a simple majority, so long as its proposal saved as much money. Congress was not limited to a supermajority vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save Money and Reset Your Financial Life With a Shopping Ban", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many of us, the beginning of the year involves cutting back: on Negronis, Nutella, Netflix, on whatever we previously overindulged in \u2014 which often includes unnecessary spending.But what about forgoing the act of shopping altogether?By 2013, Ms. Flanders had spent two austere years paying off nearly $23,000 of debt. But, rather than feeling free in the months that followed, she was dismayed by the increasing amount of money she was mindlessly spending.Determined to regain control of her finances, she eventually forbade herself to shop for an entire year. During the ban, she confronted bad habits; learned to borrow, make and mend; and found value in herself instead of the objects around her.Intrigued? Here are her tips for implementing your own shopping ban.Before you can change your habits, you must first identify them.\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand your consumption as a whole, it\u2019s hard to come up with shopping ban rules that make sense,\u201d Ms. Flanders said.\u201cFor me, if it\u2019s just numbers that are magically being updated online, I still don\u2019t understand how often I\u2019m spending money \u2014 it\u2019s just a category,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe more you write things down, the more you realize whether or not you\u2019re happy with the fact you\u2019ve spent that money.\u201dWalk around your home, determining what you have the most of \u2014 and, therefore, what you\u2019ve spent the most on. Maybe it\u2019s books. Maybe it\u2019s shoes. Maybe it\u2019s empty LaCroix cans.Then ask yourself: Do you really need more? If the answer is no (which it probably is, for everything but the LaCroix), put it on the ban list.Ms. Flanders allowed herself to shop for groceries and basic kitchen supplies, gas, cosmetics and toiletries (if she ran out), cleaning products and gifts. She also created an \u201capproved shopping list\u201d of items \u2014 like a pair of winter boots and a bed \u2014 she already knew she\u2019d need. She could still travel and occasionally eat at restaurants, and could replace anything that wore out or broke, as long as she tossed or donated the original.On the ban list? Takeout coffee, clothes, shoes, accessories, household items like d\u00e9cor and furniture, books, magazines, electronics and anything else not previously approved.While her shopping ban lasted an entire year, Ms. Flanders recommends choosing a length of time that feels \u201cmanageable\u201d to you, whether that\u2019s 30 days or six months. \u201cReally be honest with yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s rules will be completely different.\u201d\u201cThe times I thought about giving up, my best friend was great at getting me back in line,\u201d Ms. Flanders said. \u201cShe\u2019d say: \u2018You don\u2019t need to buy that \u2014 what are you working toward?\u2019\u201dMs. Flanders, for example, quickly discovered how many activities made her crave takeout coffee: firing up her computer, taking an afternoon break, running errands, going on road trips. To encourage change, she always left coffee supplies on her counter. Whenever she felt the urge to purchase a latte, she made one instead. \u201cWhen you figure out a better habit, make sure it\u2019s really accessible,\u201d she advised.When Ms. Flanders was a child, her parents did \u201calmost everything themselves.\u201d They gardened, cooked, canned and sewed. But as she grew older, she became accustomed to the speed and convenience of the era.We all can find ways to incorporate these ideas into our lives where we have the knowledge, time and access. Instead of buying a tent for your first camping trip, borrow one from a friend. Instead of hiring someone to repair your bike, watch a video and attempt to fix it yourself. You may stumble on a skill or talent you never knew you had, and bonus: You\u2019ll save money in the process.On Black Friday, Ms. Flanders succumbed to a discounted e-reader, then canceled the order a few minutes later. Rather than berating herself for \u201cfailing,\u201d which would\u2019ve given her an excuse to abandon the challenge completely, she accepted her purchase for what it was: a minuscule mistake.\u201cInstead of stressing so much about the one thing you purchased, ask yourself why it happened \u2014 what was going on in your life?\u201d Ms. Flanders said. \u201cIf the bigger goal is still something you want to work toward, learn from it and carry on. If you were successful for 364 days instead of 365, that\u2019s a huge win.\u201dThough Ms. Flanders saved almost $14,000 during her shopping ban \u2014 and even continued it for a second year \u2014 it\u2019s the life lessons she prizes most.\u201cI learned to be content with what I have,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I was always thinking some thing could improve my life.\u201d Now, she has an exact purpose for everything she buys, and it\u2019s never to fill a void.\u201cThat was the most important lesson,\u201d she said. \u201cI was finally happy enough with who I was. I realized I am this imperfect human being \u2014 as we all are \u2014 and no object was going to make me better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Donors are identified only if they have contributed more than 13,500 Australian dollars, or about $10,000, which means individuals and corporations can anonymously make multiple donations without the public knowing. At the same time, Australian politicians are not required to explain what they do with the money.\u2022 Suppression OrdersFor example, there is a major case of global interest working its way through the courts now. It\u2019s subject to a suppression order, and I cannot legally tell you about it.In other cases, courts have ordered that already published journalism be removed from Australian news sites, even though the information in them could be found elsewhere \u2014 undermining public trust in both journalism and the justice system.\u2022 Defamation Without any equivalent to the American First Amendment, freedom of speech in Australia is more negotiable and often subject to litigation.Suing for defamation is relatively easy in Australia, with presumptions favoring those who sue. Journalists, media organizations \u2014 and increasingly anyone who publishes on social media platforms \u2014 routinely lose in court or expect to lose and settle. The costs can be high, even prohibitive, stamping out some stories before they are ever written.Now, it may be that there are strong arguments for restricting information and limiting journalism \u2014 arguments that I, as a journalist, may have a harder time fully agreeing with.But regardless of whether you think our tribe is full of sensationalists to be protected against or heroes to be lauded, it\u2019s worth asking: Why are governments increasingly so insecure about letting us all see what they are up to?On that happy note, here are some examples of journalism worth fighting for, and smiling at, along with a weekly recommendation that crosses generational lines.____________It almost sounds like science fiction, but it\u2019s really just science: climate change.______Read it and then Tweet it out so the bots can see it.______What do love and cryptocurrency share?

{"Headline": "New Health Secretary Faces First Test as Idaho Skirts Federal Law", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Alex M. Azar II, the new secretary of health and human services, said Thursday that he would closely scrutinize a plan by Idaho to allow the sale of insurance that does not comply with the Affordable Care Act, an early test of how he will enforce a law he opposes.But he said it was too early to know what action he might take.\u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at that very carefully and measure it up against the standards of the law,\u201d Mr. Azar said at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee.Democrats in Congress, as well as the American Cancer Society and other groups representing patients, say the Idaho plan would allow insurers to discriminate against people with pre-existing medical conditions, in defiance of the federal law.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said Idaho would allow the sale of \u201cjunk insurance,\u201d and he asserted that the state was moving \u201cback to yesteryear, when insurers could beat the stuffing out of people with pre-existing conditions.\u201dThe plan presents Mr. Azar with a choice that he could face frequently in his new job: whether to try to shore up the health law or to \u201clet Obamacare fail,\u201d as President Trump has threatened to do. His decisions could have significant consequences both for consumers and for Republicans in the midterm elections.Mr. Azar said he had seen news reports of Idaho\u2019s plan, but did not know the details because the state had not asked the federal government for a waiver of requirements in the Affordable Care Act.But Mr. Wyden said that \u201cIdaho is breaking a federal law\u201d and was not seeking permission from the federal government.At a separate hearing on Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said the Trump administration was \u201csitting on the sidelines while Idaho clearly circumvents the law.\u201dMr. Azar described Idaho\u2019s plan as \u201ca cry for help\u201d by a state seeking more affordable coverage options for its residents. He said the Idaho program would be subject to \u201csearching review for compliance\u201d with federal law.\u201cWe have a duty to enforce the law as Congress has written it,\u201d Mr. Azar said. But he added that the federal government must proceed with \u201ca great deal of deliberation and caution and care\u201d in assessing the Idaho plan.At three congressional hearings in 36 hours this week, Mr. Azar also explained his portion of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, which seeks $1.1 trillion for the Department of Health and Human Services in the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1.Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, defended his state\u2019s plan to allow the sale of noncompliant coverage. Idaho\u2019s goal, he said, is \u201cto protect and expand the opportunities and access people have to insurance of their choice.\u201dIdaho residents will still be able to obtain coverage that complies with the Affordable Care Act on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Mr. Crapo said. But Idaho will allow other options, outside the exchange.The Republican governor of Idaho, C. L. Otter, known as Butch, issued an executive order last month to combat what he called \u201cthe overreaching, intrusive nature of Obamacare.\u201d And on Jan. 24, the state Insurance Department issued guidelines for the sale of insurance policies that do not meet coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act.Idaho\u2019s new \u201cstate-based health benefit plans\u201d will have to carry a disclaimer: \u201cThe policy is not fully compliant with federal health insurance requirements.\u201dInsurers in Idaho could, in some cases, charge different rates based on a person\u2019s health status or claims experience. In addition, insurers would not have to comply with provisions of the federal law limiting out-of-pocket costs, and they could impose caps on the dollar amount of benefits available to consumers.Dean L. Cameron, the director of the Idaho Department of Insurance, said in an interview on Thursday that insurers could start selling the new state-based health plans as early as April.\u201cWe are trying to salvage the market,\u201d Mr. Cameron said. \u201cThe young and healthy people of all ages have left the market. We are trying to bring them back. Our goal is to help Idaho families.\u201dBlue Cross of Idaho said this week that it would offer five such plans. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act marketplace has become unaffordable for Idaho\u2019s middle-class uninsured,\u201d the company said, and it told consumers that the new plans could cost \u201cup to 50 percent less\u201d than plans that comply with the federal law.Democrats were not impressed.\u201cNone of the policies go after the pharmaceutical industry, your former employer,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.Mr. Azar said Medicaid, the program for more than 70 million low-income people, was full of perverse incentives that tended to drive up drug costs. Under federal law, Medicaid is generally entitled to the best price given to other purchasers of brand-name prescription drugs, with a mandatory discount of at least 23 percent off the list price.Mr. Azar agreed with Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, who said these discounts led drug makers to raise prices for other customers.\u201cIf we underpay in Medicaid, it will increase costs elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Azar said.Members of both parties expressed concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to cut $48 billion over 10 years from projected federal payments to teaching hospitals for graduate medical education.Mr. Azar said the administration wanted to direct funds to geographic areas and medical specialties with the greatest need for more doctors.But Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said the proposed cut would \u201cseverely hurt a state like ours, a growth state, that desperately needs residency programs to keep our doctors.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Turnbull said on Thursday that Mr. Joyce \u2014 head of the National Party of Australia, the junior partner in his coalition government \u2014 had made \u201ca shocking error of judgment\u201d by having an affair with an aide, who is now pregnant.\u201cIn doing so, he has set off a world of woe\u201d for the women involved, Mr. Turnbull said, including Mr. Joyce\u2019s wife and daughters. The prime minister stopped short of asking Mr. Joyce to resign, but said he would take a leave.On Friday, Mr. Joyce rebuked Mr. Turnbull\u2019s criticism and said the prime minister\u2019s remarks had \u201ccaused further harm.\u201d\u201cThis was a personal issue, a personal issue that\u2019s been dragged into the public arena,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe people should be resigning in any job over personal issues.\u201dIn announcing the ban on sex between ministers and their subordinates, Mr. Turnbull said that ministers, whether married or single, must lead by example.\u201cMinisters must recognize that while they are entitled to privacy in personal matters, they occupy positions of great responsibility and public trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public have high expectations of them in terms of their personal conduct and decorum.\u201d\u201cWe must recognize that whatever may have been acceptable or to which a blind eye was turned in the past, today, in 2018, it is not acceptable for a minister to have a sexual relationship with somebody who works for them,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said. \u201cIt is a very bad workplace practice.\u201dMs. McGowan said on Thursday that although she welcomed the prime minister\u2019s announcement, the government should consider a code of conduct for all those who work in Parliament.Mr. Joyce, 50, on Tuesday acknowledged his relationship with Vikki Campion, his former media adviser. Though he has spent much of the past week offering remorse to his family, he has denied ministerial misconduct and refused to resign.If Mr. Joyce resigns, Mr. Turnbull\u2019s government will lose its one-seat parliamentary majority. Mr. Turnbull said on Thursday that it was up to Mr. Joyce whether to step down.Mr. Joyce will not serve as acting prime minister during Mr. Turnbull\u2019s White House visit next week, a decision that critics said suggested the prime minister had lost confidence in him. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, will step in instead.Mr. Joyce said on Friday that Mr. Turnbull\u2019s comments were \u201cin many instances inept\u201d and \u201ccompletely unnecessary, all that is going to do is basically once more pull off the scab for everyone to look at.\u201dHe also pushed back against what he called \u201cimplied comments about the leadership of the National Party,\u201d saying that \u201cwe make our own decisions.\u201d Mr. Turnbull said later on Friday that he was not seeking to interfere with the party\u2019s decision making.\u201cI understand it\u2019s a very stressful time,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said of his deputy\u2019s earlier comments.The Australian tabloid newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported the affair last week alongside a photograph of a pregnant Ms. Campion, fueling a fierce debate about privacy, sex and the news media.Sharri Markson, the national political editor at the newspaper, said she had been surprised by the initial pushback from other news outlets on whether the story was in the public interest.The debate has since grown to include questions about gender and abuse of power.\u201cThe Australian media in particular has protected politicians from this sort of exposure for many years,\u201d Ms. Markson said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Plan Puts Burden on State and Private Money", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnveiled on Monday, the infrastructure program that Mr. Trump has championed since the campaign is intended to attract a huge amount of additional money from states, localities and private investors. The goal is to generate a total pot of $1.5 trillion to upgrade the country\u2019s highways, airports and railroads.In this new competition for federal funds, a plan to, say, build a better access road for a luxury development \u2014 a project with the potential to bring in more dollars from private investors \u2014 could have a strong chance of getting the green light. By comparison, a critical tunnel overhaul that has trouble getting new money might not be approved.President Trump\u2019s long-awaited infrastructure plan proposes that the federal government put up $200 billion in incentives and investments, leaving local governments and private industry to come up with the rest.Proposals intended to serve more impoverished communities that require more state and local money, including improving drinking water in a place like Flint, Mich., could be given short shrift. Financial investors may not see a big profit in such a project.\u201cA private corporation has a fiduciary obligation to make a profit. The government is supposed to be providing a public service,\u201d Mr. Sclar said.The president\u2019s plan recasts the federal government as a minority stakeholder in the nation\u2019s new infrastructure projects. Half of the $200 billion promised over 10 years will be used for incentives to spur even greater contributions from states, localities and the private sector. Mr. Trump also wants to speed up the approval process.The White House budget, separately released on Monday, also gives federal agencies the authority to sell assets that would be better managed by state, local or private entities in cases where a sale would \u201coptimize taxpayer value.\u201d The budget suggests that Ronald Reagan Washington National and Dulles International Airports could be among the assets ripe for new owners.Coming up with the $200 billion in federal funding will not be easy. Republicans have already ballooned the deficit in last week\u2019s spending agreement and with their tax cuts. Democrats are unlikely to go along with cuts that would offset the cost of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan.With his infrastructure framework, the president is rethinking Washington\u2019s role.Public health, safety and national defense were added in the 20th century as core values, when the government developed the national highway system and passed the Clean Water Act.The math for the infrastructure plan also relies on a lot of unknowns.Along with private investors, cities and states are being counted on to put up significant funds. They have a need. States have been struggling for years to rejuvenate creaky roads, bridges and ports. And even if the plan appears to put much of the onus on them to finance projects, any additional federal funding is welcome.\u201cStates won\u2019t look down their nose at adding more money for infrastructure,\u201d said John Hicks, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. \u201cIt\u2019s seen primarily as a positive, because it continues to shine light on a shared need of infrastructure improvement.\u201dBut cities and states are not necessarily flush with cash for new infrastructure projects.Congress has thrown their finances into upheaval, with local lawmakers still trying to come to grips with the effects of the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that was passed last year. Many states have already expressed concern that it will be hard for them to increase state and local taxes, because deductions on them have been limited.Some are considering other ways, such as gasoline taxes, to raise funds, but it may not be enough to fund new infrastructure projects. A report released last month by Fitch, the ratings agency, found that many states could see their tax revenue fall from the changes to the individual and corporate taxation laws.David Damschen, Utah\u2019s treasurer, said his state faces many infrastructure challenges as it works to accommodate a growing population, expand its stock of affordable housing and improve the transportation system. He said Utah was already looking for new sources of tax revenue to fund projects because sales tax and gas tax revenue had been declining.But Mr. Damschen also noted that public-private partnerships do not tend to work well in his state. \u201cWhen things roll out, you\u2019ll find what the market will do with these ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes creative ideas don\u2019t always have the level of acceptance in the marketplace as you hoped.\u201dThe amount of federal funds \u2014 $20 billion a year \u2014 will be spread very thin when stretched across the entire country. It is also unclear how much new money, as opposed to repurposed funds, the federal government is actually supplying.One analysis by the Penn-Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania said that other pieces of the White House budget could end up reducing federal infrastructure spending by $55 billion over 10 years \u2014 despite the president\u2019s new plan.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the president of the conservative American Action Forum, complimented aspects of the president\u2019s initiative that dealt with streamlining regulations and using federal credit guarantees. But he doubted the promised total could be reached.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get the $200 billion to $1.5 trillion, if you do the arithmetic,\u201d he said.Beyond the math, the revamped selection standards, too, are untested. The new criteria likely stemmed from the administration\u2019s attempt to distinguish its program and try something new.The new plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t allocate money in terms of congestion, economic need or the public good,\u201d said Martin Klepper, the former executive director of the Transportation Department\u2019s Build America Bureau. \u201cIt does it mostly on the basis of the leverage issue.\u201dMr. Klepper, who spent decades in the private sector developing, financing and selling large infrastructure projects, was recruited to lead the bureau in the final weeks of the Obama administration. He said he decided to take the job even after the Democrats lost, because of the new administration\u2019s commitment to public-private partnership and Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of a major infrastructure plan.He resigned in November 2017.\u201cI left because I was pretty frustrated and disappointed with where the program was going,\u201d Mr. Klepper said. \u201cNo one has any idea to the extent with which states and localities will be able to come up with the money to match the federal government.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bringing a Personal Touch to Plus-Size Fashion", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurship\u201cI hadn\u2019t intended for retailing to be a career choice,\u201d Ms. Boujarwah said. \u201cBut when I was in business school, I realized that my formative experiences were shared with millions of women. It was a call to arms for me. This was a problem for many women that I could play a role in.\u201dThe scarcity of larger sizes stems from a deeply rooted stigma in the fashion industry \u2014 many designers either ignore or reject requests to offer their styles above a certain size. There are also manufacturing complications: Progressing from size 2 to 12 can be a simple matter of scale, but larger sizes often require a separate pattern to account for different proportions and entail more fabric, raising the production cost.\u201cWe\u2019re getting bigger, but the business hasn\u2019t gotten bigger,\u201d Marshal Cohen, a retail industry analyst at the NPD Group, said.\u201cWhile Walmart and Amazon could be formidable competitors, this customer wants a company that understands her, and isn\u2019t just selling to everyone,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\u201cWe became interested in apparel because of the size of the market and the need,\u201d Ms. Hunsicker said.In the Gwynnie Bee model, women who wear sizes 10 to 32 receive regular shipments of clothing. Once it\u2019s worn, no laundering is required; clients simply return the options to the company for a fresh selection. If the customer loves an item, she can buy it, Ms. Hunsicker said.In contrast, Eloquii is a reincarnation rather than a start-up. The company was originally a brick-and-mortar retailer owned by the Limited, which, despite protests from a loyal customer base, shut down the brand in 2013, Ms. Chase said.The founder and chairman, John Auerbach, who has held a number of e-commerce positions, bought Eloquii\u2019s assets from Sun Capital in 2013, including intellectual property and the customer list. Ms. Chase joined the same year. The company has already been through two rounds of venture capital financing, and now has backing of close to $40 million, Ms. Chase said.Most of these businesses are focused on online customers, but some are experimenting with physical stores. Eloquii has opened three, in Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; and Washington. Two of them are pop-ups.Most physical stores with plus-size apparel do not \u201coffer a great experience,\u201d Ms. Chase said, so Eloquii is focusing on fitting-room aesthetics and other amenitiesGwynnie Bee had a pop-up store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan that \u201cwent really well,\u201d Ms. Hunsicker said, adding that her company is trying to determine what role a store plays in its business model.A bigger challenge for the companies is finding inventory. Designers have become more accommodating, spurred both by an untapped market and the desire to appear inclusive. But entrepreneurs are not waiting for manufacturers to make the first move.New York Fashion Week, which officially began Thursday, offers an opportunity for these entrepreneurs to get noticed. Dia took out a full-page ad in The New York Times during New York Fashion Week last February, encouraging designers to look anew at the market with the line \u201cFashion she can\u2019t wear is becoming a bit unfashionable.\u201d The gamble paid off: Ms. Boujarwah said the ad had led to two new lines, one with Ms. Wilson, the actress, and the other with the designer Nanette Lepore.Entrepreneurs are learning to be more flexible, too. For instance, Gwynnie Bee will add smaller sizes to its lineup after determining that designers would be more willing to work with it if it offered a wider range. The site, Ms. Hunsicker said, will include only items that are available in all sizes.Yet fabrication remains a hurdle for some. As a result, founders like Ms. Boujarwah of Dia, which counts Sequoia Capital among its investors, are designing their own products. Similarly, Ms. Hunsicker said Gwynnie Bee had, \u201cfor a number of vendors, taken on a lot of pattern design,\u201d in addition to offering the site\u2019s private label clothing.\u201cIt\u2019s their aesthetic and vision, and we\u2019re helping to make it fit,\u201d she said.\u201cWe were adamant about building a luxury brand and bringing the best designers we could, including Michael Kors, Zac Posen, Badgley Mischka, Monique Lhuillier and Prabal Gurung,\u201d Ms. Retzer said.Most of the companies do not yet offer intimate apparel, although Eloquii plans to offer lingerie in the future. To reach that market, Deborah A. Christel, a co-author of the study on women\u2019s sizes, left her position as an assistant professor at Washington State University to start a company that would encompass all sizes for lingerie.Ms. Christel said her company, Kade & Vos, would begin selling next summer. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that one day, women\u2019s clothes will just be women\u2019s without referring to plus size,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

From 2008 through 2012, Tucker\u2019s companies extended approximately five million loans to customers across the country, while generating more than $2 billion in revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. Most of this money flowed through accounts that Tucker maintained at the Bank.USB employees responsible for servicing Tucker\u2019s ongoing account activity disregarded numerous red flags that Tucker was using the tribes to conceal his ownership of the accounts. For example, Tucker spent large sums of monies from accounts in the names of Tribal Companies on personal items, including tens of millions of dollars on a vacation home in Aspen and on Tucker\u2019s professional Ferrari racing team.U.S. Bancorp said on Thursday that it had put in place measure to improve its anti-money laundering controls.

The cause? Fears the economy was heating up, which would lead to a pickup in inflation and Federal Reserve raising rates faster than anticipated.But in the week since the S.&P. 500 has stage a comeback. The index is up 7.6 percent and on pace for best week since 2014, according to Bloomberg. In fact, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 2 percent the past two days despite the latest inflation data coming in much higher than expected.So what happened to those concerns about inflation? One explanation for why stock investors shrugged off the inflation data was a very weak report on retail sales. Investors seemed to take that as evidence the economy is not overheating and that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a very slow pace.Two weeks ago when the sell-off started, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow forecast for first-quarter G.D.P. fell to 3.25 percent from 5.4 percent two weeks ago.\u201cWhile it does appear that inflation is accelerating, it appears much less likely that the economy is really taking off and forcing the Fed into a more aggressive rate hiking cycle,\u201d write the strategists over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The bigger pictureA rising rate environment is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks. Jodie Gunzberg, the head of United States equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, points out that since 1971 the S&P 500:ProPublica\u2019s article centers on the bureau\u2019s handling of investigations into Wells Fargo. It reports that Mr. Mulvaney ordered restrictions on the accessing of personal data of Wells Fargo customers, a move that hampered the bureau\u2019s investigations. An exemption on the freeze was later granted to enforcement staff looking into Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance business. But ProPublica added:Mulvaney\u2019s order has had effects beyond enforcement, hampering the bureau\u2019s efforts to monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer protection rules and conduct research on financial products, according to several staffers. The freeze has even stymied state attorneys general, according to two C.F.P.B. staffers and one attorney for a state office.The tax overhaul requires funds to hold onto investments for three years to qualify for the lower rate. They\u2019ve been getting around it by creating single-member LLCs in Delaware to receive carried interest payouts.More from Miles Weiss of Bloomberg:Four LLCs have been created under the name of Elliott Management Corp., the hedge-fund giant run by Paul Singer. More than 70 have been established under the names of executives at Starwood Capital Group Management, the private-equity shop headed by Barry Sternlicht.The headline reason is his belief that Silicon Valley is too intolerant of conservatives and libertarians. But there\u2019s an interesting second reason in the article (emphasis added):The WSJ reports that Mr. Thiel will spend at least a bit more time working on a non-tech endeavor: a right-leaning media organization. He will still be involved in Founders Fund, the V.C. firm he co-founded, as well as stay on the boards of Facebook, the data consultancy Palantir and other tech companies.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cMy goal is to make it so the next generation grows up in a world where cancer is managed just like the common cold, and the body\u2019s natural regenerative engine remains empowered throughout our lives,\u201d said Dr. Hariri.Celgene, United Therapeutics, Sorrento Therapeutics, Human Longevity, the Dreyfus Family Office and Section 32 took part in the series-A funding.In other health care deal newsWhy? The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation report was higher than expected. But weaker retail sales tempered those fears \u2014 at least for equity investors.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeTo some, the bond market is a particularly prescient predictor of economic trends. So is it picking up on an inflationary surge that the Federal Reserve likely will take too long to recognize?But the overheating fears may be overdone. Yesterday\u2019s January inflation report was hardly conclusive. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that the January increase \u201cprobably overstates the underlying trend.\u201dStill, even though there are reasons to believe that while the U.S. economy is breaking out of its recent rut \u2014 thanks to big tax cuts and a revival of the global economy \u2014 it may not be as vibrant as it looks.The economic flyaroundNestl\u00e9 added that its future is likely to contain more deals in the several-hundred-million range of the Blue Bottle Coffee takeover. \u201cThe sweet spot is in small to mid-sized deals, but we don\u2019t want to rule out anything,\u201d its C.E.O., Mark Schneider, said.The deals flyaroundHe also offered this ambition: \u201cI want you to be able to take an Uber and get into the subway \u2014 if the trains are running on time, you\u2019ve got real-time data \u2014 get in the subway, get out and have an Uber waiting for you for right now. Or know that there\u2019s a bike right there for you that gets you where you\u2019re going in the fastest manner.\u201dWhether the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C. are the best venues for this type of regulation is something Congress will have to decide. Neither agency has experience in overseeing virtual currencies, so assigning responsibility to one (or both) will require increased appropriations to develop rules and effective oversight.\u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.

Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.\u2019s rule.The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: \u201cCourts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition\u2014tell the S.E.C.\u2014Congress imposed.\u201d By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers.One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don\u2019t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.\u2019s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation.\u2014 Peter J. HenningWhy?There didn\u2019t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish.Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday\u2019s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on.In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained.\u2014 Peter EavisBroadcom\u2019s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders. From the news release:Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS\u2019s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP\u2019s activist stockholders.Let\u2019s take a look at the math\u2022 Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price.\u2022 Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn\u2019t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year.The bet on the shareholder meetingBroadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm\u2019s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees.A Qualcomm representative didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe deals flyaroundLittle in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey\u2019s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cIf these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place.During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter.The tower would be the first major project under New York City\u2019s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area.Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software.Here\u2019s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor\u2019s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: \u201cWe are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.\u201dGlassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants.Skadden\u2019s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.The judge overseeing the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T\u2019s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not \u201cmade a credible showing\u201d that the White House had singled it out for retribution.The decision puts a crimp in AT&T\u2019s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal.AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list \u2014 but could call him during the trial if needed.The trial begins March 19.Symptom A: Albertsons buying Rite Aid to gain scale and enter the pharmacy businessSymptom B: Walmart\u2019s online sales growing just 23 percent in the fourth quarter, after it splashed out on Jet.com, Bonobos and more\u201cIt\u2019s the battle of the old generation versus the new generation,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. \u201cAnd right now the companies that are gaining share is the new generation.\u201dCritics\u2019 cornerElsewhere in Amazon newsFrom Peter Eavis:For the first time \u2014 and after much protest \u2014 public companies must report their employees\u2019 median pay and compare it with that of their C.E.O.s.

{"Headline": "When the Fashion Cycle Meets the Cycle of Life", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was, like most of his clothes, understated and chic and perfectly tailored. It was also about a foot long. It was a one-off, made for Ivy Carolyn, one of his 8-month-old twins.\u201cI have come to believe smaller is better,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez, 57, said. He wasn\u2019t really talking about clothes. He was talking about work/life balance. It\u2019s an unusual topic in fashion, where the choices between the professional and the personal have rarely been part of the industry conversation the way they have in other sectors, like finance and law. For an industry that prides itself on being on the vanguard of social change, it\u2019s another way in which fashion lags behind.But after two decades in the business \u2014 after a stint in the spotlight at Loewe as part of the first generation of designers to take over old houses and jazz them up; after seeing fashion move from being about silhouette and seam to being about entertainment; after rejecting the gilded cage of creative directorship and returning to New York and an independent business; after weathering Sept. 11 and the recession of 2008 \u2014 Mr. Rodriguez had decided to put the matter on the pattern-making table.\u201cI don\u2019t need a yacht,\u201d he said. \u201cI never aspired to that. I realized early on that being famous was not something I wanted to do. I aspired to have the freedom to do what I want.\u201dThat means making what he wants, an idea clearly on display in Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s retrospective capsule collection with Barneys New York, which debuted last week. One of the striking things about the effective tour through nine of his most well-known dresses, including those worn by Rachel Weisz and Sarah Jessica Parker and Jennifer Aniston (though not his most famous client, Michelle Obama), is the consistent commitment to the architecture of the body and a refusal to indulge in frou. Also, showing it as he wants, when he wants (that we\u2019ve heard before) \u2014 while still being able to have breakfast, bath time and bedtime with his children.Huh?\u201cI have been waiting decades for this conversation,\u201d said Donna Karan, who, when she was working at Anne Klein, famously got a call from work just after she gave birth to her daughter, Gabby, because Ms. Klein was sick. \u201cI said, \u2018Do you want to know if I had a boy or a girl?\u2019\u201d Ms. Karan said. \u201cAnd they said, \u2018Yeah, but can you come back?\u2019\u201dFamily has been, up until now, the missing piece in the fashion world\u2019s continuing conversation about the unsustainable pace of the collection system. There is much public talk about consumer product fatigue, the need for instant satisfaction and the impossibility of being genuinely creative every six weeks. Yet, despite the fact many designers have had families (Ralph Lauren, Miuccia Prada, Angela Missoni, to name a few), the human side of what is often characterized as an inhuman cycle has often not been addressed.\u201cBut it\u2019s not just about deliveries,\u201d Ms. Karan said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about families. It\u2019s all part of the bigger conversation.\u201dSteven Kolb, the chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a big conflict in our industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time commitment is enormous \u2014 it directly clashes with back to school, holidays \u2014 and that is driving big questions.\u201dPart of the problem, Mr. Rodriguez said, is this: \u201cFamilies are not cool.\u201dAt this point, however, social and cultural changes have significantly altered the landscape. And Mr. Rodriguez has become representative of a group of designers who are taking a different approach to the issue. They are not trying to be superpeople as much as real people. \u201cThis is a time when everyone is looking at the way they work, and changing it in different ways,\u201d he said.Christopher Bailey, the chief creative officer of Burberry, has two small daughters \u2014 Iris, 3\u00bd, and Nell, 2. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about all these things more openly \u2014 gender, sexuality \u2014 and it\u2019s about time the fashion culture changed,\u201d he said.Before he resigned, Mr. Bailey had already altered his routine. Instead of getting to the office at 6 or 7 a.m., he arrived two hours later; he was rigorous about going out only once a week and never spending a weekend away. Even so, he decided he wanted a bigger change. Similarly, Tom Ford has talked about how having a son has prompted him to reshape his working life.\u201cIt\u2019s about a business model,\u201d Mr. Kolb said. \u201cBut a big part of the motivation is also balance.\u201dWhen Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s children were born (Ivy\u2019s brother is Callum Thomas), he took three months off. This may not sound surprising, but when Phoebe Philo had her first child, in 2007, she was believed to be the first designer at the top of a major global brand (Chlo\u00e9) to take an official maternity leave since fashion became a global industry. (She was followed by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen.)It was a marked departure from the past, when, said Diane von Furstenberg, who raised two children at the same time as her namesake line, \u201cI used to joke the business was their third sibling.\u201dThen, when Mr. Rodriguez returned to work just in time for his show in September, he gave up his usual 8 p.m. Tuesday night slot and held small presentations during the workday instead. \u201cI realized what was important to me was having people here to see what we do up close, to focus on the nuance of material and cut, or what can\u2019t be seen on Instagram,\u201d he said.He has also scaled back his time in the office to three or at most four days a week. He and his husband, Thomas Tolan, live in their country house in Westchester County (they are expanding their New York apartment to make it more child-friendly) and commute to the city. They have a nanny who works four days a week, but she does not live with them.\u201cI have learned to edit,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said. \u201cTo be more precise with my fittings, delegate more to my team, and to be tougher with my own schedule.\u201d He thinks the discipline has made his collections better.To be fair, he has more ability to rethink his days than many other designers might: He is the sole owner of his business, and, thanks to a highly successful perfume license started 16 years ago, he has had a steady income no matter what is happening in the ready-to-wear market. It gives him a certain leeway in his decision making. To acknowledge, for example, that \u201cthings have changed.\u201d\u201cNot just for me,\u201d he said. \u201cShopping has changed. People are so much more conscious of having experiences and not being a slave to fashion. I felt the same way.\u201dIn his office, baby gifts now share space with stacks of art books and collections (cars, rocks) and walls full of black-and-white portraits of models and famous friends in his clothes. Two antique Russian children\u2019s thrones, given to him by Candy Pratts Price, a former editor at Vogue, are arrayed in front of a giant faux Warhol print of Elizabeth Taylor by Deborah Kass, one piled high with Baby Gap outfits. They are not accessories; they\u2019re equal clutter.\u201cToday fashion is so driven by celebrity and marketing,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said. \u201cThat\u2019s fine \u2014 it\u2019s how it has evolved. But that\u2019s never been the part that seduced me. For me, it has always been about the craft. Fashion hijacked my life a bit, but I have been here long enough, and made enough dresses, to know it does not replace, or even come close, to what I have at home.\u201d Entering his third decade in fashion, he has opted for a third way.\u201cThat shows other people it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Mr. Kolb said. \u201cYou\u2019re not proving your success by how many hours you spend in the office or how many events you are at. You prove it by what you make.\u201dWhen Mr. Rodriguez started his business, Ms. Vitale said, \u201che figured out that women want simplicity, femininity and maybe a little function without compromising who they are. He influenced so many designers.\u201d Now the question is whether he will do the same with his willingness to make his family part of the fashion equation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now It Can Be Told: Barbara Stevens Has 1,000 Victories to Her Name", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPLEASANTVILLE, N.Y. \u2014 The problem was with the entry pass, with the positioning in the paint, with the team\u2019s inability to get the ball to the biggest player in a spot where she could make the most advantageous use of her size and strength.All of this was painfully apparent to Coach Barbara Stevens on the Bentley University bench as Victoria Lux, her 6-foot-1-inch center, struggled in the first half with a swarming Pace University defense. Her team seemed vulnerable to an upset.Stevens \u2014 the matriarch of Bentley, a longtime Division II power and 2014 national champion \u2014 was already plotting her midgame modifications.\u201cThey fronted her and brought a tremendous amount of help,\u201d she said in reflecting on the game, which took place late last month. \u201cI thought we didn\u2019t have the correct angles, talked about it at halftime, made a few adjustments.\u201dSure enough, on Bentley\u2019s first second-half possession, Lux planted herself closer to the basket and the ball moved swiftly to the wing and then was lobbed to her over a smaller Pace defender. Improved angle, better result. Two points for Lux on her way to a dominant second half and a 72-66 road victory, the 1,002nd of Stevens\u2019s 41-year career, a run of sustained excellence that, on a level of national celebrity, has been a storied secret.Which is not necessarily a problem for her.\u201cI came to a point where I believed that I\u2019m better suited, perhaps, out of the limelight,\u201d Stevens said.From her first head-coaching days in 1977 at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., through a trying three years at the University of Massachusetts before settling in for a continuing 32-year run at Bentley in Waltham, a suburb of Boston, Stevens\u2019s life has often been one of strategic adjustments, as it was that night against Pace.It is an approach that has allowed her to identify the preferred position, the perfect place, and it has not been at the top of the coaching ladder.Decades before Stevens became the fifth women\u2019s college coach to win 1,000 career games, she was a star on the rise, in the middle of the budding movement to raise the profile of the game, to promote gender equity in sports.All are Division I lifers, except for Stevens, who is also the only Division II coach to have been president of the Women\u2019s Basketball Coaches Association (in 1984-85).She coached against McGraw while she was at Massachusetts and McGraw was at Lehigh. Her 1985-86 Massachusetts team surrendered a second-half lead to a Connecticut squad playing its seventh game of Auriemma\u2019s debut season.\u201cI don\u2019t remember much other than we both didn\u2019t have very good teams,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWho knew that he was going to go on to make that program into what he did?\u201dWho knew that Stevens, upon leaving Massachusetts and relocating to Bentley \u2014 a private university with a combined undergraduate/graduate enrollment of about 5,500 students and a highly respected business and finance curriculum \u2014 would establish a program that has, on occasion, been called the UConn of Division II?That would be in terms of consistency, longevity and fundamental quality, because Stevens has claimed only that one national title (with an unbeaten team) to Auriemma\u2019s 11. But over more than three decades at Bentley, she has a winning percentage over 80 percent, has been to 29 N.C.A.A. tournaments, has won 14 regional titles, has played in 10 semifinals and has had a dozen 30-win seasons.She was elected to the Women\u2019s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, entering in the same class \u2014 coincidently, but happily \u2014 as Auriemma.\u201cOne of my favorite people in the profession,\u201d Auriemma wrote in an email. \u201cThe way she runs her program is impressive, but the most impressive aspect of her program is how consistently they compete for and win championships. Regardless of what division we are talking about, she is one of the best coaches in the country.\u201dWhich, in a coaching culture of ambitious careerists, raises an obvious question: After so much success, why has Stevens remained at Bentley?She has been asked about this enough times, of course, though mostly from those who don\u2019t know her, or are late to her story, or outside her circle.It wasn\u2019t the Massachusetts years and her 34-49 record there that gave bigger schools pause, even after Stevens had moved on to Bentley and begun piling up victories.\u201cI was approached by a number of D-1 schools through the years,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to decide whether it was the opportunity to move again or the quality of life that I wanted, the niche I really found when I came here, a wonderful balance.\u201dCould she have had that at Big Budget U, where inherent pressures are greater and where the elite recruits increasingly mimic the men, convinced that they are, as players, the essence of their promotional highlight videos?\u201cUnfortunately, in some ways I see the high-level women\u2019s game traveling the same road the men have traveled,\u201d Stevens said.She is quick to point out that not every Division I program is Connecticut, or Notre Dame, where the gender-resources gap has been narrowed to little or nothing. At Connecticut, Chris Dailey, Auriemma\u2019s longtime associate head coach, has often cited that unfortunate reality as one of her motivations for not pursuing a program of her own.So Stevens stayed at Bentley because, as McGraw said of her friend, \u201cYou don\u2019t always have to have more when you already have everything you want.\u201dAt Bentley, she hasn\u2019t been alone in that regard. The men\u2019s basketball coach, Jay Lawson, is in his 27th year. Bob DeFelice, the baseball coach, has been coaching there for half a century. Dick Lipe, the sports information director, is in year 41.\u201cWe attract really good student-athletes here,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThey\u2019re smart, motivated and that\u2019s why I\u2019m still coaching.\u201dStevens\u2019s associate head coach, C White, played for her at the turn of the century. Christiana Bakolas, an assistant coach, was the point guard and captain of the 2014 title team.\u201cWe made it to the Final Four my sophomore year, Elite 8 my freshman year,\u201d Bakolas said. \u201cWe wanted it so much for her.\u201dMcGraw, meanwhile, recalled a conversation with Stevens soon after the 2014 title, which was achieved with a rally against West Texas A&M with less than six minutes to play. Stevens, said McGraw, insisted that the victory was something for every Bentley player she had ever coached to savor.Her reputation has become a recipe for success, her program a destination for quality high school players who may never have heard of Stevens before someone \u2014 a basketball-coaching uncle in Bakolas\u2019s case \u2014 mentioned this slender Massachusetts native with an easy smile and calm demeanor who has carved a place in women\u2019s basketball history right at home, out of the limelight.\u201cWe understand who we are, where we are, in the Boston area, not a lot of attention,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even get our Bentley community to pay attention sometimes. But I\u2019m an extremely passionate, competitive person, consumed by what I do. Our resources are different from D-1. Our staffs are smaller. But we recruit really hard.\u201dAs a Division II program, Bentley can offer scholarships, and it has not been uncommon for players to choose the leafy campus with quick access to Boston over Division I programs, given Bentley\u2019s academic offerings along with Stevens\u2019s record of steering teams deep into March.Becca Musgrove played three years at Brown before missing her senior season with an injury and applying to Bentley\u2019s graduate school and for a coaching internship. With one season of eligibility left, she has wound up a vital cog in Stevens\u2019s rotation, a 5-9 blur of aggression who scored 20 points in the win over Pace, No. 1,002.\u201cI never set out to win 1,000 games,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI only set out to win the next game.\u201dThe milestone night arrived on Jan. 17, at home against Adelphi, a Northeast-10 Conference rival, with the Bentley community out in full. In the final seconds of a 78-66 victory, the fans chanted Stevens\u2019s name, her players dumped a barrel of confetti on her and she soon stepped to a microphone to talk about sacrifice, about the gatherings with relatives she had to miss over the years to attend to her family of student-athletes.\u201cI apologized to them for that,\u201d she said, without promising to never be absent again.A single woman of 63, Stevens looked around and saw her aging mother, out on a frosty New England night, in her wheelchair. She saw reporters from various Massachusetts news media outlets there to finally pay attention. She saw her players, current and former, moved to tears, even a few who went back to her days at Clark and who were no younger than her.The countdown to 1,000, after all, had started when Stevens was barely out of college. It was a long road to the limelight, her deserved position and place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: How a Market Tumble Affects California", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.\u201cSell off!\u201d \u201cCrash!\u201d Investors bracing for \u201cuncertainty.\u201dIn an interview on Tuesday afternoon, Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, a professor of finance at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, put the market decline in context for the Golden State.Here are some things to keep in mind:The market\u2019s impact on capital gains \u2013 and the state budgetWhen the stock market goes down, the amount of money Californians who sell stock must pay in capital gains taxes also decreases. The state\u2019s tax code is very progressive, which, in this case, Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said, compounds the problem.California has one of the highest top tax brackets in the country, and the state relies heavily on those top earners to fill its coffers. (In 2014, the top 1 percent of earners paid 48 percent of all state income taxes in California, according to a 2016 article in the Economist.)\u201cSince the top 1 percent of Californians own a lot of stocks, a stock market decline that results in lower capital gains could have a disproportionately large impact on California \u2013 and its state budget,\u201d Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said.We have a lot of tech companies in California \u2013 and their stocks tend to feel the impact of market movement more acutelyTech companies like, say, Apple, tend to sell products known as \u201cconsumer durables\u201d \u2013 products like an iPhone that do not have to be bought frequently because they last for a long time. When people are feeling strapped, they tend to cut back on buying those types of products.Those companies tend to be \u201chigh beta,\u201d Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said, meaning that tech stocks move more than \u201cone for one\u201d with the stock market. Companies like Apple, she said, have a beta above one, meaning that a 10 percent drop in the market tends to be associated with a larger than 10 percent drop in their stock prices.\u201cThe industry composition of our businesses matters because some industries like tech are more affected by the underlying economic drivers of the stock market decline,\u201d Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said.The big pictureAll that said, Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen urged people to keep things in perspective.\u201cThe stock market has declined, but it\u2019s a pretty modest decline compared to how much the run up has been,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s now basically flat for this year, but it still went up a huge amount last year.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The year was 1968, and California-born Peggy Fleming took to the ice at the Stade de Glace in Grenoble, France \u2014 a 19-year-old with a shot at Olympic gold.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Works by Day, but It Loves the Night", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe daytime is for losers. Overnight is when the big money is made in the stock market \u2014 not by trading but by getting a good night\u2019s sleep.That\u2019s because of a gap between daytime and overnight returns in the American stock market. The real profits for investors have come when the market is closed for regular trading, according to a new stock market analysis by Bespoke Investment Group.The Bespoke data builds on the findings of academic researchers, who have documented the existence of the gap, without being able to entirely explain its cause.Simply put, the gap may be defined as the difference between stock returns during the hours the market is open, and the returns after regular daytime trading ends. How the gap is calculated may not be intuitively obvious, though.One set of returns is straightforward: It is based on prices at the start of trading in New York at 9:30 a.m. to the market close at 4 p.m. The second set is, essentially, the reverse: It is price returns from the 4 p.m. close to the market opening at 9:30 a.m. the following day.Because stock prices at the market open tend to be higher than the price at the previous day\u2019s close, you don\u2019t actually have to stay up all night and trade on an electronic network to rack up overnight gains. Simply holding shares while you sleep will do it. So for buy-and-hold investors, these findings are particularly encouraging: Get your rest, ignore the temptation to trade and you can do just fine.The SPY\u2019s overall price gain from its inception through January has been stupendous: 541 percent cumulatively, not counting dividends, Bespoke says.But look more closely, as Bespoke did, and a remarkable fact emerges.Separate the daytime and the after-hour returns and calculate them cumulatively, as Bespoke has done, and it turns out that all of that price gain since 1993 has come outside regular trading hours.If you had bought the SPY at the last second of trading on each business day since 1993 and sold at the market open the next day \u2014 capturing all of the net after-hour gains \u2014 your cumulative price gain would be 571 percent.On the other hand, if you had done the reverse, buying the E.T.F. at the first second of regular trading every morning at 9:30 a.m. and selling at the 4 p.m. close, you would be down 4.4 percent since 1993.One implication is immediate. \u201cForget about the news and the market ups and downs during the day,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. \u201cThey are nowhere close to what they are cracked up to be.\u201d In fact, he said, most people are better off if they just sit tight.Buying and holding the overall market \u2014 using an E.T.F. like the SPY, or a traditional index mutual fund, or a very diversified portfolio of stocks \u2014 has been an extremely profitable strategy if you stuck to it for the last 25 years. On the other hand, buying and selling during the day has generally been a money-losing strategy \u2014 one that would have been far more painful if you had traded frequently, incurring steep costs, which would have compounded your losses.That said, there are plenty of exceptions to these general statements.Many individuals and institutions have made tons of money through short-term trading during regular trading hours, even if investors over all have not. Furthermore, the steadily rising stock market in the 12 months through January has been better in the daytime than it has been historically \u2014 posting gains in the SPY during regular trading hours of 9.2 percent. Still, the overnight gains have been much better: 13.4 percent over the same period. The gap in returns has endured.One possibility, he said, is that frequent traders laboring under the \u201cillusion of control\u201d believe that they can respond easily to information and events during the day but can\u2019t do so as easily after hours, when there are far fewer market participants and less money, or \u201cliquidity,\u201d involved in trading. \u201cPeople may be inclined to sell at the market close so they can feel in control of their money overnight,\u201d he said.There is some evidence that smaller traders are prey to this tendency and tend to sell late in the day \u2014 and that some big institutional traders, who are well aware of the day-night gap, tend instead to buy at the close and sell at the open.Because relatively few people actually trade after the market closes, orders tend to build up overnight, and in a rising market, that will produce an upward price surge when the market opens. But during extended declines, overnight sell orders may cause prices to plummet when the market opens.If there were no trading costs \u2014 possible in a thought experiment but not in the real world \u2014 an excellent strategy over the last few decades would have been buying shares at the last possible moment during regular trading hours and selling them methodically at the opening bell every day, Professor Gulen of Purdue said.While transaction costs make that strategy uneconomical, he said, the concept may still have a certain value. \u201cIf you do know that you are going to make a trade on a given day, and you have the ability to choose when you do it, you might be able to take advantage of this pattern \u2014 buying late in the day and selling early.\u201d Of course, the pattern doesn\u2019t hold every single day, and you could easily be disappointed.His data shows that during the bear market year of 2008, the overall market, as represented by the SPY E.T.F., declined 36.8 percent. But most of the damage occurred during the day, with losses of 26.7 percent, compared with only 13.8 percent overnight.But further study needs to be done before the mystery of the day-night gap is unraveled, he said.In the meantime, Mr. Hickey said, \u201cIf you are tempted to day trade, this is another argument for not doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd trading after hours is in some ways, even riskier, because with fewer people in the market, prices can be erratic.\u201dSlow and steady investing generally avoids these problems. And over long periods, it has paid off. Frequent trading generally has not, either night or day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tools of Trump\u2019s Fixer: Payouts, Intimidation and the Tabloids", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs accounts of past sexual indiscretions threatened to surface during Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, the job of stifling potentially damaging stories fell to his longtime lawyer and all-around fixer, Michael D. Cohen.To protect his boss at critical junctures in his improbable political rise, the lawyer relied on intimidation tactics, hush money and the nation\u2019s leading tabloid news business, American Media Inc., whose top executives include close Trump allies.Mr. Cohen\u2019s role has come under scrutiny amid recent revelations that he facilitated a payment to silence a porn star, but his aggressive behind-the-scenes efforts stretch back years, according to interviews, emails and other records.They intensified as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign began in the summer of 2015, when a former hedge-fund manager told Mr. Cohen that he had obtained photographs of Mr. Trump with a bare-breasted woman. The man said Mr. Cohen first blew up at him, then steered him to David J. Pecker, chairman of the tabloid company, which sometimes bought, then buried, embarrassing material about his high-profile friends and allies.In August of that year, Mr. Cohen learned details of a deal that American Media had struck with a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, that prevented her from going public about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen was not representing anyone in the confidential agreement, but he was apprised of it by Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer, and earlier had been made aware of her attempt to tell her story by the media company, according to interviews and an email reviewed by The New York Times.Mr. Cohen, who is still described as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer although he is no longer on the Trump Organization payroll, has denied any wrongdoing and insists the arrangement was legal. In an interview, he disputed details of some of his other activities that were described to The Times. But he has never shied away from his role as Mr. Trump\u2019s loyal defender. \u201cIt is not like I just work for Mr. Trump,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in an interview in 2016. \u201cI am his friend, and I would do just about anything for him and also his family.\u201dAn examination of the efforts to shield Mr. Trump from aspects of his own past shows how Mr. Cohen maneuvered in the pay-to-play gossip world \u2014 populated by porn stars and centerfold models, tabloid editors and lawyers with B- and C-list entertainment clients \u2014 that came to unusual prominence in an American presidential election.Mr. Cohen exploited mutual-self interest. By heading off trouble involving Mr. Trump\u2019s history with women, he accrued loyalty points, the ultimate currency with Mr. Trump. He dealt with lawyers who could win fat cuts of any settlements women might reach with American Media or with Mr. Trump.At least two women got money and, in Ms. McDougal\u2019s case, a promise of favorable attention in American Media publications, which include The National Enquirer, Star, Us Weekly and Radar. Mr. Trump, of course, benefited the most: avoiding more scrutiny as he struggled to dismiss multiple allegations of groping and unwanted advances that arose during the campaign.One American Media executive, in a 2016 interview, said that the priority was that nothing embarrassing come out. But in the gossip economy, secrets last only as long as the incentives to keep them do.It was July 2015 when Mr. Cohen received a phone call from Jeremy Frommer, a hedge-fund manager turned digital entrepreneur, who had obtained photos of Mr. Trump appearing to autograph the breasts of a topless woman from the estate of Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse magazine. Mr. Cohen was not pleased.\u201cHe was in a rage,\u201d Mr. Frommer said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018If you show those photos, I\u2019m gonna take you down.\u2019\u201dIt was the rough talk of a Long Island native who started his career juggling work as a personal injury lawyer and taxi fleet manager and met Mr. Trump after acquiring units in Trump buildings.In talking with Mr. Cohen, Mr. Frommer mentioned Mr. Pecker. Years earlier, Mr. Frommer had sold American Media the exclusive rights to a suggestive photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2014 which it did not publish \u2014 and he knew the company\u2019s chief executive.Mr. Frommer recalled Mr. Cohen\u2019s saying, \u201cYeah, I know Pecker.\u201d Mr. Frommer added, \u201cThat\u2019s where the conversation calmed down.\u201dMr. Pecker and Mr. Trump, a staple of the American gossip media since the 1980s, have a friendship that goes back decades. The relationship benefited Mr. Trump throughout the campaign as The Enquirer lionized him and hammered rivals like Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and, finally, Hillary Clinton.Mr. Cohen formed his own bond with Mr. Pecker, keeping in touch with him and Dylan Howard, a top executive, throughout the campaign.American Media acknowledged those ties, saying in a statement, \u201cMichael Cohen and President Trump have been personal friends of Mr. Pecker\u2019s for decades.\u201d But, it said, neither of them \u201cnor any other individual has attempted to, or ever, influenced (or will ever influence) coverage at A.M.I.\u2019s publications. Period.\u201dAfter the initial blowup, Mr. Frommer said, he and Mr. Cohen quickly agreed that Mr. Frommer would take the Trump photos to Mr. Pecker. The men soon began discussing potential business deals, including an interview with Mr. Trump as part of a joint project between American Media and Mr. Frommer\u2019s company, Jerrick Media, according to text messages and emails reviewed by The Times.\u201cSpoke to Cohen we are set. Well done!\u201d Mr. Pecker told Mr. Frommer in a July 2015 text exchange.Two months later, when Mr. Frommer expressed doubt that the Trump interview would take place, Mr. Cohen responded in an Oct. 5 email: \u201cNo no \u2026 relax. I am on it and will make it happen.\u201dMr. Frommer said he had assured Mr. Cohen at the time that he wouldn\u2019t make the photos public \u2014 \u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to publish them\u2019\u201d \u2014 but that the decision had nothing to do with the business talks.In the end, American Media concluded that the photos were of little value. The interview and the deals never materialized for Mr. Frommer, who went on to publish one of the Trump photos on his own website.American Media said in a statement that it had no interest in suppressing the photographs. But in early 2016, an American Media executive, speaking only on condition of anonymity in discussing internal company thinking, said that when the negotiations between A.M.I. and Mr. Frommer began, they were intended to suppress the photos, part of broader efforts by American Media to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d information that would damage Mr. Trump.In an interview Friday, Mr. Cohen acknowledged directing Mr. Frommer to A.M.I., but said he did so not because of photographs of Mr. Trump but for other photos of \u201canother notable individual that I had no interest in seeing or wanting.\u201dBack then, however, Mr. Cohen acknowledged that he had been eager to keep the photos hidden. \u201cMr. Trump has a family,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I had to protect his family.\u201dFor Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, American Media was more than a company they could rely on for friendly coverage. It was also where people looking to sell potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump were likely to turn.In the summer of 2016, American Media came to Mr. Cohen with a story involving Ms. McDougal, the former Playboy Playmate. She claimed to have had a consensual affair with Mr. Trump in the mid-2000s, early in his marriage to Melania Trump. Mr. Trump denies an affair.Ms. McDougal had retained Keith Davidson, a Hollywood lawyer, who reached out to contacts at American Media. After negotiating on and off for a couple of months, A.M.I. agreed to give Ms. McDougal $150,000 for the exclusive rights to her story, along with promises of publicity and marketing opportunities through its fitness magazines. The contract did not identify Mr. Trump, but required her to keep quiet about any relationship with a married man.A.M.I. had shared her allegations with Mr. Cohen, though it said it did so only as it worked to corroborate her claims, which it said it ultimately could not do. But that was not the only heads-up Mr. Cohen received.Soon after Ms. McDougal signed the confidential agreement on Aug. 5, 2016, Mr. Davidson emailed Mr. Cohen, \u201cMichael, please give me a call at your convenience.\u201d Mr. Davidson followed up by explaining to Mr. Cohen over the phone that the McDougal transaction had been completed, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Mr. Cohen said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall those communications.\u201dMr. Davidson acknowledged the public\u2019s interest in Ms. Clifford\u2019s and Ms. McDougal\u2019s stories, but said that he was \u201cnot at liberty to discuss private client information.\u201dIn the months after Ms. McDougal\u2019s agreement with A.M.I., Mr. Trump\u2019s relationships with women drew more scrutiny on the campaign trail. The release of an audio recording that captured the candidate bragging about grabbing women\u2019s genitals inspired numerous women to step forward with allegations that he had groped or kissed them against their will.Mr. Davidson\u2019s client list had included the professional athletes Jalen Rose and Manny Pacquiao, as well as gossip-page regulars who placed him in the middle of the sex-tape cases of the \u201cAustin Powers\u201d actor Verne Troyer, the wrestler Hulk Hogan and the onetime Playboy model and MTV host Tila Tequila. He was a natural choice for Ms. Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, when she sought to sell her own Trump story.She was alleging that she had had a consensual sexual relationship with Mr. Trump after they met at a celebrity golf tournament about 10 years earlier (Mr. Trump denies her claims).Just two months after Ms. McDougal\u2019s story was effectively muted by her contract with American Media, Mr. Davidson set about brokering the silence of the adult film actress. This time, the negotiator on the other end of the transaction was Mr. Cohen.The other outlet, The Dirty, took down a brief story after Mr. Davidson threatened legal action just a day after his client had provided information to the website, according to Nik Richie, The Dirty\u2019s founder, and a letter seen by The Times.After the deal between Ms. McDougal and A.M.I. was completed, Mr. Davidson regularly exchanged emails, text messages and calls with Mr. Cohen, according to people familiar with the contacts, including last week, when Mr. Davidson publicly bolstered Mr. Cohen\u2019s statement that he had paid Ms. Clifford himself.Murray Waas contributed reporting, and Jaclyn Peiser contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Republicans Release Secret Memo Accusing Russia Investigators of Bias", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe three-and-a-half-page memo, written by Republican congressional aides, criticized information used by law enforcement officials in their application for a warrant to wiretap the former campaign adviser, Carter Page, and named the senior F.B.I. and Justice Department officials who approved the highly classified application.But it fell well short of making the case promised by some Republicans: that the evidence it contained would cast doubt on the origins of the Russia investigation and possibly undermine the inquiry, which has been taken over by a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The Page warrant is just one aspect of the broader investigation.The memo was outlined in news reports in recent days as Republicans pushed for its release. Several details show that it reflects a line of attack circulating for weeks in conservative news media outlets, which have been amplifying a narrative that the Russia investigation is the illegitimate handiwork of a cabal of senior Justice Department and F.B.I. officials who were biased against Mr. Trump and set out to sabotage him.A previously secret memo released on Friday claims that F.B.I. officials abused their authority and favored Democrats in the early stages of the Russia investigation. Read our reporters\u2019 annotations.Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, portrayed the memo as recounting an \u201calarming series of events\u201d in which intelligence and law enforcement agencies were \u201cexploited to target one group on behalf of another.\u201dOne of its chief accusations centers on the inclusion in the warrant application of material from a former British spy, Christopher Steele. Mr. Steele was researching possible connections between Russia\u2019s election interference and Trump associates, but the application to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge did not explain that he was partly financed by the Democratic National Committee and lawyers for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the memo says.\u201cNeither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the D.N.C., Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele\u2019s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior D.O.J. and F.B.I. officials,\u201d said the memo, which was written by committee staff members.But a 10-page Democratic memo written to rebut the Republican document says that the F.B.I. was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than the Republicans say. The F.B.I. told the court that the information it received from Mr. Steele was politically motivated, though the agency did not say it was financed by Democrats, according to two people familiar with the Democratic memo.Notably, the Republican memo does not assert that Mr. Steele\u2019s information was the fountainhead of the broader Russia investigation as many Republicans and conservative media commentators have insinuated.By a party-line vote, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted to release their memo this week and rejected Democrats\u2019 appeal to make public their own still-classified memo at the same time. Democrats have accused Republicans of suppressing evidence that would correct what they say are mischaracterizations.\u201cThe sole purpose of the Republican document is to circle the wagons around the White House and insulate the president,\u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said on Friday.The Republican memo does not provide the full scope of evidence the F.B.I. and Justice Department used to obtain the warrant to surveil Mr. Page, and it is not clear to what extent the application hinges on the material provided by Mr. Steele. In December 2017, the Republican memo said, Andrew G. McCabe, then the deputy director of the F.B.I., told the House Intelligence Committee that no surveillance would have been sought without Mr. Steele\u2019s information.But the people familiar with the Democratic memo said that Republicans had distorted what Mr. McCabe told the Intelligence Committee about the importance of the information from Mr. Steele. Mr. McCabe presented the material as part of a constellation of compelling evidence that raised serious suspicions about Mr. Page, the two people said. The evidence included contacts Mr. Page had in 2013 with a Russian intelligence operative.Mr. Page\u2019s contacts with the Russian operative led to an investigation of Mr. Page that year, including a wiretap on him, another person familiar with the matter said.Mr. McCabe told the committee that the decision to seek a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, was also prompted by Russia\u2019s attempts to target Mr. Papadopoulos, by a trip Mr. Page took to Moscow in July 2016 and by the Russian hacking of Democratic emails that appeared to be aimed at harming the Clinton campaign, the two people familiar with the Democratic memo said.Among the handful of other details in the memo was that the application also cited a September 2016 article published by Yahoo News. It cited unnamed sources saying that government investigators were scrutinizing Mr. Page\u2019s links to Russia.Most of the news about Russia falls into one of three categories, which we break down.Mr. Steele was later revealed to be a source for the article, and the memo suggests that law enforcement officials\u2019 inclusion of it in their warrant application means they were using the same source twice but presenting him as separate sources.\u201cThis article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News,\u201d the memo said, underlining the assertion.Mr. Schiff deemed this claim to be one of several serious mischaracterizations, saying the article was not used to corroborate Mr. Steele\u2019s material.It was more likely to have been included \u201cto show that the investigation had become public, and that the target therefore might take steps to destroy evidence or cover his tracks,\u201d said David Kris, a FISA expert and former head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division in the first term of the Obama administration.The Republican memo said the initial FISA warrant for surveillance of Mr. Page was approved by James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, and Sally Q. Yates, then the deputy attorney general, both of whom Mr. Trump later fired.The warrant was renewed three times, which was required every 90 days, meaning Mr. Page was under surveillance for about a year. At various points in the renewals, other law enforcement officials who signed off included Dana J. Boente, now the general counsel of the F.B.I.; Mr. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director who resigned under pressure this week; and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller as special counsel and has been a target of the president\u2019s displeasure over the Russia inquiry.Under Justice Department regulations, Mr. Rosenstein oversees Mr. Mueller and is the only person who can fire him \u2014 and only if he finds that the special counsel has committed misconduct. Mr. Rosenstein has repeatedly said he would refuse any order to fire the special counsel without such a finding, and that he has seen no sign of misconduct.Asked at the White House on Friday whether he would fire Mr. Rosenstein in light of the Republican memo \u2014 a move that would enable him to put someone else in charge of Mr. Mueller \u2014 Mr. Trump cocked his head suggestively and said, \u201cYou figure that one out.\u201dPressed on whether he had confidence in Mr. Rosenstein, the president would not answer.The Republican memo also highlights Bruce Ohr, then an associate deputy attorney general, who has been attacked in conservative news media outlets in recent weeks because his wife, Nellie Ohr, worked as a contractor with FusionGPS, the opposition research firm that hired Mr. Steele. Mr. Ohr also met with Mr. Steele himself. The memo says the Ohrs\u2019 relationship with them \u201cwas inexplicably concealed\u201d from the intelligence court.The memo does not mention that Mr. Ohr worked on counternarcotics, not counterintelligence. It does not allege that he played any role in the Russia investigation or the wiretap application.The document also notes that the FISA application mentions Mr. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with people connected to the Russian government. The memo said there is no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos conspired with Mr. Page.But Mr. Schiff said that the Justice Department was instead providing the court \u201cwith a comprehensive explanation of Russia\u2019s election interference, including evidence that Russian agents courted another Trump campaign finance adviser\u201d as \u201cthe context in which to evaluate Russian approaches to Page.\u201dAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement on Friday that he would evaluate the Republicans\u2019 criticism of the Justice Department.\u201cI am determined that we will fully and fairly ascertain the truth,\u201d he said.In a message to F.B.I. employees on Friday, Christopher A. Wray, the bureau\u2019s director, said he stood behind the agency\u2019s employees.\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot in the past nine months, and I know it\u2019s often been unsettling, to say the least,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the past few days haven\u2019t done much to calm those waters.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis, Eileen Sullivan and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Spite of Executive Order, Cuomo Takes Campaign Money From State Appointees", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn late November, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo flew to Buffalo for a fund-raising trip, a quick two-stop jaunt that brought in more than $200,000 in donations for his re-election campaign.The events, one at an Embassy Suites hotel and the other a more intimate gathering at a private residence, were hosted by two men familiar to Mr. Cuomo \u2014 and to state government.One host, Steven J. Weiss, had been appointed by Mr. Cuomo to the New York State Housing Finance Agency in 2011 and the state board of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in 2016. Government records show that Mr. Weiss has donated $53,000 to the governor\u2019s campaign since being picked for the housing agency.The other, Kenneth A. Manning, had been named by lawmakers to the same cancer research institute board, and had been appointed by Mr. Cuomo to a state judicial screening committee in 2011. Records show that Mr. Manning has donated $50,500 since his 2011 appointment.That type of arrangement \u2014 appointments go out, campaign cash comes back in \u2014 has vexed government reformers in Albany for generations. Things were supposed to change in 2007, when Eliot L. Spitzer, then the newly elected governor, issued an executive order barring most appointees from donating to or soliciting donations for the governor who made the appointment. Mr. Cuomo renewed the order on his first day in office.But a New York Times investigation found that the Cuomo administration has quietly reinterpreted the directive, enabling him to collect about $890,000 from two dozen of his appointees. Some gave within days of being appointed.The governor also has accepted $1.3 million from the spouses, children and businesses of appointees, state records show.In some cases, a husband and wife each won state appointments and then kept contributing. In others, the appointees stopped donating after receiving state posts, but their families continued writing checks. One appointee and his wife donated 11 times while he was serving. Another has given Mr. Cuomo, personally and through companies tied to him, more than $500,000.The executive order explicitly forbids appointees from soliciting donations for the governor. Yet multiple appointees have done so, like Mr. Weiss and Mr. Manning last fall, raising a considerable additional amount for Mr. Cuomo.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s donor-appointees span the state\u2019s vast network of boards and authorities. They have served as trustees of both the city and state university systems, on the panel overseeing economic development and on the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York City\u2019s subways and buses. Most positions are unpaid, but they hold great power and prestige: Board members can approve multibillion-dollar contracts and multimillion-dollar grants, oversee the distribution of tax breaks, and have broad influence over everything from the state\u2019s highways to local arts projects.In response to questions about the donations from appointees, Cuomo administration officials said they believed that the order only applied to appointees who could be fired at any time by the governor, not those serving set terms. Under that interpretation, donations by board members of many of the state\u2019s most powerful authorities would be allowed.\u201cThe purpose of the order is to prohibit employees and board members who serve at the pleasure of the governor from making political contributions,\u201d said Alphonso B. David, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s counsel. \u201cIt does not apply to every single person who serves in government, to individuals who volunteer for government, or to individuals who were appointed by the Senate and cannot be removed by the executive. A different reading simply divorces the purpose of the order from its language.\u201dThe Cuomo interpretation differs from what some public authorities say in their own internal ethics rules, from the interpretation of independent government watchdogs and from what Mr. Spitzer himself said he intended when he crafted the order.\u201cThe executive order was intended, and did, in fact, apply to all gubernatorial appointees, regardless of the need for Senate confirmation, or any term applicable to their service,\u201d Mr. Spitzer said in an interview.The order does not differentiate between types of authority appointees. It simply says that \u201cno member of a public authority appointed by the governor\u201d can donate or solicit donations.Richard L. Brodsky, a former 14-term member of the State Assembly and longtime watchdog of state authorities, questioned the Cuomo reading. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to claim somehow the language does not include all his authority appointees. It does,\u201d he said.The prohibition on appointee giving is hidden in plain sight, incorporated in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s own campaign website.\u201cNo state agency officer or employee who serves at the pleasure of the governor or their appointing authority or members of state public authority or other boards appointed by the governor may contribute to and/or fund-raise for Andrew Cuomo 2018,\u201d the website says. Similar language has been included on invitations to fund-raisers for the governor going back to 2011.The order originated on Mr. Spitzer\u2019s first day in office, part of a set of sweeping mandates under the banner of \u201celiminating politics from government decision-making.\u201d (Even under Mr. Spitzer, records show that a few appointees still contributed to his campaign.) Gov. David A. Paterson signed a revised version of the order when he took office.Mr. Cuomo, who fashioned himself as a political reformer from the day he launched his 2010 bid for governor in front of Tweed Courthouse, included his renewal of the order as part of an ethics package adopted on his first day in office.After seven years, watchdogs say Mr. Cuomo\u2019s ethics record, despite some new measures, has been mostly a disappointment, from his disbanding of the Moreland Commission on public corruption to his aggressive use of campaign-finance loopholes.To tally the donations that Mr. Cuomo has received from his appointees, The Times compared a New York State Authorities Budget Office database of hundreds of the governor\u2019s nominations and appointments against the state\u2019s campaign finance database. Both databases are public.Reporters then vetted the matches, searched for others and excluded authorities not covered by the executive order, like the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, an interstate agency. Appointees named to their posts by previous governors and not reappointed by Mr. Cuomo also were excluded.The total also does not include donations raised at fund-raisers hosted by appointees, since they are difficult to track.The analysis identified about $890,000 in donations from 26 appointees. An additional roughly $830,000 came from family members, and $490,000 from firms owned or controlled by appointees.All told, 37 of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s appointees have donated $2.2 million either directly or indirectly to the governor\u2019s campaign since 2011. And those people had donated another $2.2 million before being appointed to their state posts.Dani Lever, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s press secretary, said donors were only a fraction of his appointees. \u201cClearly, most board members are not campaign contributors, and most campaign contributors are not board members,\u201d she said.Aby J. Rosen, a colorful real estate developer and art collector, is a major donor whom Mr. Cuomo installed as chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts less than six months into his governorship. It is an enviable posting at New York\u2019s cultural epicenter, a position responsible for overseeing tens of millions of dollars in arts grants across the state.The money kept flowing afterward \u2014 more than $40,000 since from Mr. Rosen, and $50,000 from his real estate holding company, RFR Holding, according to government records.While on the arts council, Mr. Rosen also appears to have provided private aircraft for Mr. Cuomo. In December 2011, Mr. Rosen\u2019s firm contributed $3,272.20 in \u201ctravel\u201d expenses to Mr. Cuomo on the same day the governor\u2019s schedule shows him taking a private aircraft from Albany to New York City for a fund-raiser. Mr. Rosen made another $2,903.23 in-kind donation to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign in December 2013; that day the schedule again shows the governor taking a private aircraft to a fund-raiser. Mr. Rosen did not return requests for comment.To replace Mr. Rosen as chair, Mr. Cuomo promoted another major campaign donor already on the arts council, Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, an author and longtime arts advocate.Ms. Diamonstein-Spielvogel has donated $27,500 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign since he reappointed her to the council in 2013. Her husband, Carl Spielvogel, was reappointed by Mr. Cuomo to the board of the State University of New York in 2015. He has given $20,000 since then.The Spielvogels could not be reached for comment. But a woman who answered the phone at their home and identified herself as the assistant to Ms. Spielvogel, who is 86, said that Ms. Spielvogel \u201cnever contributed unless she was asked,\u201d and that she recently refrained from making a contribution to Mr. Cuomo because she had heard about the executive order for the first time.\u201cShe looked up the law herself,\u201d said the woman, who declined to give her name. \u201cShe is very particular about obeying whatever the letter and spirit of the law is.\u201dCouncil member Laura Aswad has contributed $25,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign since he appointed her, and Jaynne Keyes has contributed $10,000 since her appointment.Ms. Keyes is married to Michael J. Del Giudice, a former top aide to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Ms. Aswad is married to Joseph W. Belluck, who has served for years on the State Commission on Judicial Conduct and the board of the State University of New York. He was reappointed by Mr. Cuomo to the judicial conduct commission in 2012 and has given $56,000 since then.Mr. Belluck said he was unaware of the executive order until several months ago, when he was told that he could not donate because he was on the State University of New York board.Ms. Lever, the governor\u2019s press secretary, said the administration believes that arts council board members are allowed to donate to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe language of the order with respect to agency boards bans contributions from board members who serve at the pleasure of the governor,\u201d she said. The arts council \u201cis an agency board whose members do not serve at the pleasure of the governor, as they are Senate-confirmed and serve in fixed terms of years \u2014 therefore are not covered by the order.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s counsel called the order \u201cextremely vague\u201d but said that \u201cwe believe our interpretation is the most consistent with the purpose of the order.\u201dContrary to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s interpretation, ethics handbooks of some state boards still bar donations by board members. \u201cNo board member, pursuant to executive order, may make or offer to make any monetary contribution to the campaign of the governor,\u201d according to the ethics code for M.T.A. board members.Because an executive order does not have the force of law, it is not clear if violating it would prompt any repercussions. The order itself says \u201cpenalties\u201d could include \u201cdismissal or other appropriate sanction,\u201d but the person who would enforce that would be Mr. Cuomo.\u201cAll of this shows why you don\u2019t do ethics by executive order,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice of the New York University School of Law. \u201cThis kind of thing helps to drive cynicism about Albany.\u201dPerhaps nowhere are the connections of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s appointees more apparent than on the board of the Battery Park City Authority, a public benefit corporation created to own and manage 92 acres of land in Lower Manhattan.The authority has power over a valuable sliver of New York: Battery Park City includes the Brookfield Place development, the global headquarters of Goldman Sachs and luxury hotels and restaurants, in addition to homes for about 10,000 residents. The authority controls development and maintains the public spaces in the area, and can impose de facto taxes on residents. None of the seven board members live there; some have a history of large political donations.Take the chairman, Dennis Mehiel, for example. He built a fortune in the shipping container industry and was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2002. He donated $92,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns before being appointed to the authority in June 2012, government records show.Less than a month after he was confirmed to the job, his wife, Karen, gave $20,000 to the governor\u2019s campaign account. She has given $105,000 more in the years since, while Mr. Mehiel himself has contributed $10,000, and companies associated with him have kicked in an additional $35,000.Another board member, Lester Petracca, the president of a construction firm, has given $85,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns since being confirmed in June 2013, records show. His wife, Tracy, contributed $105,000.In all, four men have been on the Battery Park City board at least a year; three have donated personally or through their companies during their tenures.A spokesman for the Battery Park City Authority declined to comment. Mr. Mehiel and Mr. Petracca did not return requests for comment.Residents called the donations problematic. Anthony Notaro Jr., the chairman of Manhattan Community Board 1, said the authority board was too powerful to be filled with \u201cthe governor\u2019s close friends and fund-raisers.\u201dSimilar stories are scattered across state government.At the New York Thruway Authority, Mr. Cuomo has placed his longtime Republican ally Joanne M. Mahoney, the Onondaga County executive. Since her 2015 appointment, she has given $10,000 to his campaign through her political committee, finance records show. Ms. Mahoney did not respond to messages seeking comment.At the City University of New York, Mr. Cuomo installed as trustees the prominent lawyer Brian D. Obergfell in 2012 and the construction firm founder Sandra Wilkin and the public relations executive Ken Sunshine in 2016. Since their appointments, they have contributed $45,000, $37,500 and $5,000, respectively, records show. A university spokesman said, \u201cThe order does not apply to the CUNY board of trustees.\u201dAt the M.T.A., Mr. Cuomo in June appointed one of his biggest donors, the real estate developer Scott Rechler; a company tied to Mr. Rechler donated $65,000 to the governor in December. Including donations before the appointment, Mr. Rechler, his family and his companies have given Mr. Cuomo more than $500,000. Mr. Rechler declined to comment.At the New York Convention Center Operating Corporation, which oversees the Javits Center, there are a half-dozen major Cuomo donors.Among them is George J. Tsunis, a hotel magnate who, along with his wife, Olga, has contributed more than $180,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign, who named him to the board in June 2016. Within a month of being appointed, Ms. Tsunis donated $15,000 and made a $5,100 in-kind donation for \u201cevent costs,\u201d presumably for a fund-raiser, government records show. In June 2017, George and Olga Tsunis hosted a Cuomo \u201csummer barbecue\u201d fund-raiser at their Long Island home, according to an invitation obtained by The Times.Mr. Tsunis\u2019s name was in boldface type at the top. The small print included the disclaimer that state appointees were not allowed to \u201ccontribute to and/or fund-raise for Andrew Cuomo 2018.\u201dWithin two weeks of the barbecue, Mr. Tsunis got a second posting \u2014 to the Battery Park City Authority.Mr. Tsunis did not respond to messages seeking comment.At the Empire State Development Corporation, the powerful authority that runs the state\u2019s economic development programs, Mr. Cuomo nominated Howard Zemsky as president and chief executive in 2015. About three years earlier, Mr. Cuomo had made Mr. Zemsky chairman of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority. Mr. Zemsky and his wife, Leslie, have combined to donate $125,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign. All of Mr. Zemsky\u2019s donations came before he was appointed in 2012; all $95,000 of his wife\u2019s donations came afterward.In July 2015, Ms. Zemsky donated $25,000 on the same day that the governor\u2019s calendar shows he was meeting with Mr. Zemsky, along with officials from Uber.Mr. Zemsky said in a statement: \u201cI have not contributed to the governor since my appointment. My wife contributed in 2015 because she strongly supports the governor\u2019s vision for New York State.\u201dIn Buffalo last November, Mr. Weiss, a lawyer with a specialty in affordable housing who had spent five years as one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s appointees on the New York State Housing Finance Agency, served as host for the governor.The arc of their political relationship is not uncommon.Mr. Weiss gave his first $25,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign three weeks after joining Mr. Cuomo\u2019s transition team in 2010. By May 2011, Mr. Cuomo had forwarded Mr. Weiss\u2019s name to the State Senate as his nominee for a spot on the state\u2019s housing finance agency, according to emails obtained by The Times. (Mr. Cuomo did not immediately publicly announce Mr. Weiss\u2019s nomination at the time.)On June 1, 2011, Mr. Weiss contributed another $25,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign, according to government records. Six days later, Mr. Weiss was confirmed to the housing agency, where he served until the summer of 2017. He has been on the Roswell Park Cancer Institute board since 2016. Mr. Weiss did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Mr. Manning, the other appointee who hosted a fund-raiser that night.Last month, Mr. Cuomo reported having $30.5 million in his campaign war chest. It is the largest pile of contributions of any Democratic politician in the country.An earlier version of this article misstated the circumstances of Kenneth A. Manning\u2019s appointment to a state position by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The governor appointed Mr. Manning to a state judicial screening committee, not the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Mr. Manning was appointed to the cancer institute by the State Assembly leader.An earlier version of this article also misstated the timing of Howard Zemsky\u2019s donations and appointments. Mr. Zemsky was appointed as chairman of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority in 2012; all of his donations came before then, not before 2015, and all of his wife\u2019s donations came after 2012, not 2015.Follow Shane Goldmacher on Twitter: @ShaneGoldmacher.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "In 2015, Egypt began work on a project that would boost the country\u2019s power output by 50 percent. Constructing this energy megaproject would require transporting 24 H-Class gas turbines, each weighing more than an Airbus 380, from Berlin to Egypt, and one million tons of materials, enough to build 24 cruise ships. The result? By early 2017, when its first stage was complete, the project had beaten its own target, bringing 4.8 gigawatts of power online in a record-breaking 18 months.But the technological achievements were only part of the story. Underpinning the megaproject was the no less sprawling issue of securing finance, a task that involved governments, export credit agencies and 17 leading banks. Against the backdrop of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, meeting the world\u2019s biggest infrastructure challenges is prompting ever-more sophisticated combinations of technology, finance \u2014 and the expertise to make it all happen.In both developed and emerging countries, economic growth and expanding populations have placed infrastructure under unprecedented strain. While governments and banks would once have been expected to plug this gap, both are increasingly limited in their capacity to take on complex infrastructural risk. At the same time, cities and manufacturers \u2014 both key actors in developing the urban and economic landscape \u2014 are having to wrestle with the transformative, but hugely expensive, implications of digital technology.In this environment, collaboration between the public and private sectors has become essential, as has the ability to forge new business models around digital technology. These changes are already evident across industry and infrastructure, which is increasingly reliant on applications ranging from remotely controlled electric networks to collecting, interpreting and acting on the mountains of data those operations generate.investment gapinvestment gapinvestment gapinvestment gapglobal investment by 2040that stand to benefit most from smart financingPerhaps no single undertaking more clearly displays the new realities of major infrastructure than the Egypt megaproject. Here, the role of German conglomerate Siemens was pivotal, from the provision of everything from internet-linked sensors to the financing that made it all possible.\u201cOne of the reasons we were able to manage the Egypt project was the way that Siemens\u2019 industrial and financing units collaborated,\u201d says Tobias Behringer, head of project and export finance, power and gas at Siemens Financial Services (SFS), Siemens\u2019 financing arm. \u201cSFS\u2019s insurance unit dealt with insurance and our trade finance team arranged for local banks to provide contractual guarantees, while we on the advisory side met the challenge of structuring a high volume of financing.\u201dIn Egypt, as in all Siemens\u2019 projects, risk management is key. Faced with an interdependent global economy and the growing diversity of investors, key actors in projects are increasingly adopting a \u201clife cycle\u201d approach, which uses vast tranches of data to consider risk across a project: from its outset, through its construction and on to the full lifespan of returns to investors.\u201cOne of the reasons we were able to manage the Egypt project was the way that Siemens\u2019 industrial and financing units collaborated.\u201dCentral to this holistic approach is an acknowledgement that some risks should be passed on to bodies better equipped to cope with them. Just as homeowners wouldn\u2019t ordinarily assume the full financial risk of earthquake damage, neither would the builders of a toll bridge. In both cases, a crucial part of the equation is insurance.As CEO of insurance at SFS, Alexander Mahnke has been at the forefront of efforts to customize coverage to very specific needs. \u201cOne of our main roles is about providing insurance solutions that support the marketing and sales of products and new business models,\u201d he says. One such solution, for the Rhine-Ruhr Express in Germany, included tailored coverage for the train operator: an insurance package against train damages of all sorts helping to provide for budget security.Illustrating the intricate relationships between innovation and financial models, this graphic shows three hypothetical technology projects and the potential combination of finance instruments needed to fund them.Most large-scale development or modernization projects require a highly tailored financing solution.Here are three highly diverse projects and the potential combinations of financing instruments that can get them off the ground.A national government is looking to build a major energy project, of a scale that promises to transform the life and economic prospects of the city it will serve. The project will involve building entirely new facilities on a previously unused \u2014 or \u201cgreenfield\u201d \u2014 site, and the facilities themselves will be costly and complex to build.As a result, though the country is stable, the project itself is risky, time-consuming and expensive.Faced with intensifying competition, a manufacturer wants to implement sweeping digital changes to its business. The new technology promises to bring major costs savings through the efficient use of energy, while improved forecasting will enable more intensive use of the machinery.Additionally, product testing will be possible using virtual models, saving huge amounts of time and resources. Unfortunately, this shiny new technology is both complex and subject to rapid change. And it doesn\u2019t come cheap, either.A city government is looking to add a new line to its metro system, helping ease the pressure on what is one of the region\u2019s busiest transportation networks. The new development stands both to improve the daily commute for millions of passengers and to unlock further investment in the surrounding areas.However, building the line presents major technical and logistical challenges that require a wide array of suppliers to deliver according to a very specific timeline. The failure of any to stick to their schedule could result in severe bottlenecks and delays \u2014 and spiraling costs.Most large-scale development or modernization projects require a highly tailored financing solution.Here are three highly diverse projects and the potential combinations of financing instruments that can get them off the ground.Usually the earliest investors and the key to bringing other investors on board, equity \u201csponsors\u201d require high levels of specialist knowledge in the project. The government itself will likely be an equity investor in the energy project, as will the construction company.Another source of capital could be debt financing, ranging from bonds to hybrid (or mezzanine) finance. The most likely debt instrument for our energy project is syndicated loans, in which several banks join forces to issue a big loan, making it less risky for each of them.As the government or the construction company building the power plant can\u2019t control for the vagaries of nature, this risk can be passed on to insurers who would cover losses caused by, for instance, fires or earthquakes.Rather than paying up front, the manufacturer can access the technology through an arrangement that spreads payments across time, broadly in line with the benefits the equipment will generate. Key examples of this are tech-refresh arrangements or retrofit packages, which allow regular upgrades to next-generation equipment to accommodate shortening replacement cycles.Backed by rigorous, precision data, the manufacturer can be certain it will make major savings once the new technology has been in place for a while. Consequently, companies like Siemens can, in place of up-front fees, agree to take payments only once those savings are realized.Should the equipment be too expensive for the manufacturer to buy outright, SFS could retain ownership of the technology (or part of it) and lease it \u201coff balance sheet\u201d to the manufacturer. This option allows the manufacturer\u2019s cash flows to be preserved, with flexible options available at the end of the contract.Designed specifically to cover such risks, business interruption insurance can cover losses that might arise should the new line not operate as intended, for reasons such as physical damage or disruptions to the supply chain leading to a shortage of raw materials.To deal with the highly specific time demands of the metro project, SFS can offer tailored financing, ranging from delayed credit lines to flexibility around when and how credit is repaid. With delayed credit lines, funds for the project are released as they are needed, thereby incurring smaller interest payments than a single lump-sum loan would.But insurance is just one of the ingredients SFS uses in structuring deals tailored to the needs and risk profile of projects worldwide. In the Dominican Republic, to finance the design and construction of new lines in the capital\u2019s metro system, SFS devised a multisource financing package, backed by export credit agencies, that essentially guaranteed payments for all suppliers\u2019 parts. In Bangladesh, where only about 50 percent of the population has stable access to electricity, SFS provided construction loans totaling almost $80 million as the \u201clead arranger\u201d to the Sirajganj III combined cycle power plant. In both cases, the work of SFS\u2019s in-house ratings experts was crucial.\u201cTo deliver a fair assessment, our ratings analysts need to have in-depth knowledge not just of the industry but of the technology involved and the potential competitive position of the project.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to be an expert in your financial field,\u201d says Mahnke. \u201cYou need to bring the right mindset. You have to be willing to stretch the boundaries of what is possible and rethink the status quo every day.During the planning stage \u2013 which can last more than two years \u2013 suppliers can go bust, governments can fall and technology can become obsolete. In this stage, risks are high that the whole project will fizzle out before a single foundation has been laid.Apart from challenges with suppliers, existing infrastructure and other human factors, the construction phase can face delays through weather, fire and other natural accidents. These delays also push up the financial risk, as do the huge outlays required throughout construction.Will the project work as advertised? And even if it does, will those painstaking demand forecasts prove to be far too optimistic? Throughout this phase, these operational and financial risks will present the central challenges to the project\u2019s success.As the initial operation phase ends, cashflows should become steadier, meaning investors should see returns or be repaid. However, as the customer assumes operational control of the project, they have to learn the day-to-day challenges, meaning that operational risk stays high.At this stage, often years down the line, lenders have recouped their outlay and equity holders have made returns on their investment. In the case of governments, those returns can include a more dynamic economy, a more contented populace, and a cleaner environment.With many trillions of funding required to achieve the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, industrial giants have become central players in addressing some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges.Take climate change. As buildings now account for some 40 percent of energy use worldwide, making factories, offices and homes more energy efficient is crucial in tackling carbon emissions. Siemens has been involved in numerous such initiatives across the world, frequently providing high-tech solutions \u2014 and helping overcome the prohibitive initial costs \u2014 through financing innovations such as energy performance contracting.In Leipzig, Germany, this meant that the Gewandhaus concert hall could undertake a complex \u201csmart tech\u201d upgrade \u2014 which would greatly improve its energy efficiency \u2014 and face none of the estimated one million euro costs up front. Instead, payments would be made through guaranteed future energy cost savings.Though infrastructure development has never been so urgent or daunting, the endeavors of companies like Siemens are showing that new tools and technology provide real grounds for optimism that the U.N. sustainability goals can be reached. And as the Egypt megaproject so clearly shows, \u201cIf you\u2019re not in the business to improve society,\u201d as Siemens\u2019 CEO Joe Kaeser says, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be in business.\u201dThe 2015 Paris climate accord committed its signatories to keeping temperature rises this century to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. That same year, the U.N. issued 17 development goals addressing global issues ranging from social justice to climate change.But there is a contradiction at the heart of these two initiatives. How do we curb carbon emissions while generating power for a vast share of the global population? There are no easy answers.

{"Headline": "Hard-Line Supporter of Israel Offers to Pay for U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe total price tag to build the new embassy to replace the current one in Tel Aviv is estimated at around $500 million, according to one former State Department official. While private donors have previously paid for renovations to American ambassadors\u2019 overseas residences, Mr. Adelson\u2019s contribution would be likely to far surpass those gifts \u2014 and could further strain American diplomacy in the Middle East.Before the embassy is built, the Trump administration plans to open a temporary one in Jerusalem. On Friday, it said that it was accelerating the projected opening in time to mark the 70th anniversary of the creation of the State of Israel on May 14.Even some of Mr. Adelson\u2019s allies expressed concern that if the administration accepts his offer for the permanent embassy, it could be seen as a well-heeled financial contributor effectively privatizing \u2014 and politicizing \u2014 American foreign policy.Mr. Adelson, who has been a vocal supporter of the contentious plan to move the embassy, is not merely a philanthropist; he is one of the most prominent players in Israeli-American relations. He is a conservative force in American politics, a donor to President Trump, a longtime patron of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the owner of Israel\u2019s largest-circulation daily newspaper.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that people will think that this is being done because of a group of people \u2014 evangelicals and Jews \u2014 who care about it and not because it\u2019s the U.S. government that cares about it,\u201d said Morton A. Klein, who runs the Zionist Organization of America, a nonprofit group that is funded partly by Mr. Adelson. \u201cIt should be crystal-clear that this is the U.S. government making the decision to move it.\u201dThrough a representative, Mr. Adelson declined to comment on Friday. His offer of a donation was first reported by The Associated Press.Steve Goldstein, the under secretary for public diplomacy, said State Department lawyers began looking several weeks ago at whether it was legal to accept a private donation to build an embassy, a process that continues. He said the department was not currently negotiating with any private citizen for a donation, and that a new embassy building would take seven to 10 years to construct.It was not clear whether private donors had ever helped with the financial costs to build an American embassy. Patrick Kennedy, who last year retired from the State Department, where he served as under secretary for management, said donors in the past had contributed millions of dollars to refurbish the palatial United States ambassadors\u2019 residences in London, Paris, Rome and Tokyo.In a speech on Friday to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Trump drew enthusiastic applause when he said he had defied \u201cincredible\u201d pressure to move the embassy \u2014 what he considered the right thing to do.\u201cYou know, every president campaigned on, \u2018We\u2019re going to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\u2019 everybody, for many presidents, you\u2019ve been reading it, and then they never pulled it off, and I now know why,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his fiery speech to conservatives.\u201cI was hit by more countries and more pressure and more people calling, begging me, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it.\u2019 I said, \u2018We have to do it, it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u2019\u201d the president said.The Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment on Friday. But a member of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition welcomed the plan on the temporary embassy.Already furious over Mr. Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, Palestinian leaders have declared that they will no longer accept an American monopoly on brokering a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.The timing of the embassy move may only amplify Palestinian outrage. For the Palestinians, Israel\u2019s 70th anniversary also marks 70 years of the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes and became refugees during the hostilities leading up to, and the war surrounding, Israel\u2019s creation in 1948.\u201cThe decision of the U.S. administration to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to choose the anniversary of the Nakba of the Palestinian people for carrying out this step expresses a flagrant violation of the law,\u201d Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and a veteran Palestinian negotiator, said in a statement on Friday.Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political scientist at Birzeit University in the West Bank, said he did not believe that the accelerated move would have dramatic consequences. But, he added, \u201cthis will increase the negative feelings toward the United States and the notion that it is too biased toward Israel.\u201dBut Mr. Goldstein said the move was now scheduled to happen in mid-May, when Ambassador David M. Friedman will relocate to an American consular office in Jerusalem\u2019s Arnona neighborhood that will temporarily serve as the United States\u2019 main diplomatic post in Israel.Mr. Adelson is a longtime patron of Mr. Netanyahu. He has financed the newspaper Israel Hayom in an apparent attempt to help Mr. Netanyahu come to power and remain there.Israel Hayom began publishing in 2007, when Mr. Netanyahu was still the leader of the opposition, and has deeply cut into the advertising base and readership of its main competitor, Yedioth Ahronoth, which has often been sharply critical of Mr. Netanyahu.Mr. Adelson\u2019s offer to help fund a new embassy may have more to do with his staunchly pro-Israel stance and his relationship with Mr. Trump than his ties with Mr. Netanyahu. Those relations may have cooled as a result of the Israeli police\u2019s corruption investigations into Mr. Netanyahu, one of which directly involves his actions in the newspaper rivalry.Mr. Netanyahu was recorded in meetings negotiating mutual benefits with an old foe, Arnon Mozes, who is the publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth. The prime minister is accused of offering to help Yedioth Ahronoth financially in return for more positive coverage \u2014 including by curtailing the circulation of Israel Hayom, and limiting its weekend supplement.Mr. Adelson has been questioned at least once by the Israeli authorities in connection with the case. The police have recommended charging Mr. Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.While Israelis warmly welcomed the Trump administration\u2019s recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, analysts said the embassy move in May was unlikely to improve Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fortunes in the long term. In interviews, many Israelis said they had not even realized that the Americans did not consider Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital.Mr. Klein, of the Zionist Organization of America, described Mr. Adelson as \u201cvery excited\u201d when he was first told by Mr. Trump that the embassy would be moved to Jerusalem.\u201cIt is a critically important issue to Sheldon Adelson,\u201d Mr. Klein said in an interview on Friday.The Arnona building where the temporary American Embassy will be housed, and the land adjacent to it, roughly straddles the seam between West Jerusalem, where mostly Israelis live, and East Jerusalem, which is a largely Arab community. That would make it ideal for serving both Israeli and Palestinian populations, Mr. Kennedy said.The United States has an option to purchase land adjacent to the Arnona building, a parcel that is big enough to handle an embassy, Mr. Kennedy said. Leases now in effect are likely to delay the transfer of the property until at least 2020, he said.Embassies can cost anywhere from $150 million to nearly $1 billion to build. The one in Jerusalem is likely to cost somewhere in the middle of that range \u2014 about $500 million \u2014 because it does not need the housing, warehouse or security functions of some of the most expensive buildings, such as those in Baghdad and Kabul, Mr. Kennedy said.Some staff members at the American Embassy could remain in Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s business center.Gardiner Harris reported from Washington, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem. Peter Baker and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. May Seek to Put Pakistan on Terrorism-Finance List", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 The United States has indicated that it will seek to place Pakistan on a watch list of countries that are not doing enough to counter terrorism financing, threatening Islamabad with global isolation, according to a senior Pakistani official.Pakistan was on the list from 2012 to 2015, and officials worry that being added again could hinder the country\u2019s access to international markets as it prepares to repay roughly $3 billion in debt this summer.\u201cWe\u2019re talking to the U.S. and trying to get them not to take any action against Pakistan,\u201d Mr. Ismail said by telephone. \u201cI think they\u2019re listening to us and I\u2019m more than hopeful we won\u2019t be gray-listed.\u201dBut his optimistic tone faded as he recalled a meeting with United States Treasury officials this month. The Pakistani delegation walked away with the impression that \u201cthey are still going to put us on the gray list,\u201d he said, calling the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy inconsistent.That would undermine moderates in the country, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ll have egg on our faces,\u201d Mr. Ismail added. \u201cWe pushed for these reforms, although many thought we wouldn\u2019t be successful changing Washington\u2019s behavior.\u201dA State Department spokesman said that the United States welcomed Pakistan\u2019s efforts against the groups tied to Lashkar-e-Taiba, but that it sought additional information on what \u201cconcrete steps\u201d were being taken to deprive them of financing. The spokesman said the Paris meeting would determine the next steps on Pakistan, but refused to elaborate.The Treasury Department said it would not comment on the sanctions list before the meetings in Paris next week or private meetings expected to be held with Pakistani officials.President Trump\u2019s increasingly hawkish stance on Pakistan has left officials in the South Asian country worried that it could become politically isolated. Previous administrations have tried to force Islamabad to cut off support for extremist organizations that operate in Pakistan and cross the border into Afghanistan, where they launch attacks on United States-led forces.The military denies that it supports groups like the Haqqani network, which has been designated a terrorist organization in the United States. It and others are responsible for some of the largest attacks on the United States-led military coalition in Afghanistan, and on the Afghan government.But with $3 billion in debt coming due, Pakistani officials worry that the United States could put pressure on global institutions like the International Monetary Fund to block future loans. As the meeting in Paris this week inched closer, Pakistan decided to move swiftly against extremist groups.\u201cF.A.T.F. is supposed to be a technical forum. It\u2019s not supposed to be a political forum,\u201d Mr. Ismail said, referring to the Financial Action Task Force. He cited concerns that Washington planned to use the Paris meeting to exert further pressure on Pakistan, after receiving an underwhelming response to the January aid cut.Islamabad reacted coolly when Washington announced that it would cut assistance, pointing out that American aid had declined for years and was too meager to support Pakistan\u2019s economy. But American officials insist the suspension will hurt Pakistan\u2019s ability to service its mostly American-made military hardware, a major blow to a country that has frequent border skirmishes with India, its main rival, and that is struggling to quell a violent insurgency at home.Publicly, Pakistan denies supporting insurgent groups in Afghanistan, saying that the United States is trying to blame it for the Pentagon\u2019s failure to achieve victory after 17 years in Afghanistan.\u201cThere are large swaths of Afghanistan outside the control of the Afghan government, and that\u2019s where the opposition is,\u201d Pakistan\u2019s defense minister, Khurram Dastgir Khan, said in an interview last week in Islamabad. \u201cAny war of words with the U.S. takes our eye off the prize: a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan.\u201d\u201cHas Trump\u2019s onslaught of hostile words increased Afghanistan\u2019s prosperity and democracy?\u201d he continued. \u201cHas it seen Kabul take charge of more of Afghanistan\u2019s territory? No.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note rose above 2.9 percent on Wednesday, well above the 2.4 percent at which it finished last year.Indeed, the index overshot expectations because two items \u2014 clothing and medical services \u2014 had very strong increases, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. Clothing was due for a big rebound because it seemed to lag a lot in recent months, Pantheon asserted.

{"Headline": "A Supreme Court Showdown Could Shrink Unions\u2019 Power", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHESTER, Ill. \u2014 Randy Clover is something of an anomaly \u2014 the president of a union local here that represents Illinois state employees, and a Republican precinct leader who voted for President Trump. But he has no doubt about what will be at stake next week at the Supreme Court: the financial and political clout of one of organized labor\u2019s last strongholds.The court will hear arguments on Monday about whether the government employees represented by Mr. Clover\u2019s union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, must pay the union a fee for representing them in collective bargaining. Conservative groups, supported by the Trump administration, say the First Amendment bars forcing government workers from having to pay anything, and the court has sent strong signals that it agrees with that argument.If it does, unions like Mr. Clover\u2019s stand to lose fees not only from workers who object to the positions they take in negotiations but also from anyone who chooses not to join a union but benefits from its efforts. To hear Mr. Clover tell it, the case is the culmination of a decades-long assault against the labor movement.\u201cThe case was started by the governor to destroy unions,\u201d Mr. Clover said, referring to Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican who has been at war with Illinois\u2019s public-sector unions. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to diminish the protections that unions have for their members.\u201dA ruling against public unions is unlikely to have a direct impact on unionized employees of private businesses, because the First Amendment restricts government action and not private conduct. But unions now represent only 6.5 percent of private sector employees, down from the upper teens in the early 1980s, and most of the labor movement\u2019s strength these days is in the public sector.Mr. Janus\u2019s lawyers said the case is about freedom of speech and association. The activities of public unions are akin to lobbying, they said, and so are by their nature political. Forcing unwilling workers to pay for such activities violates the First Amendment, they added, by compelling them to support messages with which they disagree.Mr. Clover and Mr. Janus are both represented by Council 31 of the union. But Mr. Janus, who works at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services in Springfield, objects to paying what the union calls \u201cfair share fees\u201d and others call \u201cagency fees.\u201d\u201cI was forced to pay these fees,\u201d Mr. Janus said. \u201cNobody asked me.\u201dHe added that he disagrees with stances taken by the union. \u201cThey use that money in these agency fees to support their different causes and views,\u201d he said.Two of the biggest employers here in Chester are run by the state, and together they employ about 1,400 union workers. Mr. Clover, a blunt and burly 54-year-old who works at a state mental health facility, represents more than 400 of them. Another thousand or so work at a state prison.If the Supreme Court rules against his union, Mr. Clover said, its finances would suffer and its influence would drop. In time, he said, his members\u2019 incomes would fall, and local businesses would suffer.\u201cIt probably would devastate this place right here,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the buffet line at Reids\u2019 Harvest House, a homey restaurant that serves filling meals.Mr. Clover, a Republican precinct committeeman in nearby Kinkaid Township, voted for Mr. Trump and said he was puzzled by the administration\u2019s position in the case, which he believes is aimed at undermining his union\u2019s effectiveness. \u201cThe union\u2019s leadership tries to better the workplace for men and women trying to do their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, unfortunately, I\u2019ve seen the attack of the richer people trying to control everything.\u201d\u201cTo compel employees financially to support their collective-bargaining representative has an impact upon their First Amendment interests,\u201d Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the majority. But, he wrote, \u201csuch interference as exists is constitutionally justified\u201d to ensure \u201clabor peace\u201d and to thwart \u201cfree riders.\u201dIn more recent decisions, the Supreme Court has twice suggested that the line drawn in the Abood decision is flawed and that the First Amendment bars the compelled payments for any activity by public unions.Mr. Clover said his union had done invaluable work, notably in ensuring workers\u2019 safety. He gave an example from his workplace, a maximum-security facility that houses mentally ill people caught up in the criminal justice system.\u201cThe only thing we have is our hands to protect ourselves,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have handcuffs we can put on an individual if they are so out of control you cannot control them without somebody facing injury.\u201dWhen the state tried to ban the use of handcuffs to transport patients, Mr. Clover said, \u201cthe union went to battle for us.\u201d The handcuffs stayed.Mr. Janus\u2019s lawyers said that those kinds of negotiations amount to lobbying on questions of public policy and that unwilling workers should not be made to subsidize it.\u201cMark Janus and at least five million people in 22 states like him are forced to pay union fees out of every paycheck as a condition of their employment,\u201d Mr. Huebert said. \u201cThat\u2019s a violation of their First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Times Asks Court to Unseal Documents on Surveillance of Carter Page", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe motion is unusual. No such wiretapping application materials apparently have become public since Congress first enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978. That law regulates electronic spying on domestic soil \u2014 the interception of phone calls and emails \u2014 undertaken in the name of monitoring suspected spies and terrorists, as opposed to wiretapping for investigating ordinary criminal suspects.Normally, even the existence of such material is a closely guarded secret. While applications for criminal wiretaps often eventually become public, the government has refused to disclose the contents of applications for intelligence wiretaps \u2014 even to defendants who are later prosecuted on the basis of information derived from them.The Republican memo acknowledged that the intelligence court had approved surveillance targeting Mr. Page in October 2016 and later approved three applications for 90-day extensions, meaning he was observed for at least a year under the warrant. The memo named the officials who signed off on the applications and described purported claims and purported omissions in those materials.The central claim of the Republican memo, which was drafted under the direction of Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, is that law enforcement officials running the early stages of the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and possible links to the Trump campaign abused their surveillance authorities and misled the court.The memo contends that the application used material gathered by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, without disclosing to the court that the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign financed his work as opposition research. The implication is that judges who approved the wiretapping did not know it might be biased and were thus misled about its credibility.But the credibility of the accusations in the memo are themselves the subject of intense dispute. Democrats who have seen the underlying materials say the Republican memo contains serious material inaccuracies and omissions, such as failing to include unrelated evidence about Mr. Page and Russia that the court also saw and mischaracterizing other facts.For example, Democrats say that the FISA judges were, in fact, told that the financing of Mr. Steele\u2019s research was politically motivated, even if the funders were not identified by name.They have produced their own, still-classified rebuttal memo, but the Republican majority on the House Intelligence Committee voted against making it public at the same time as their own memo.\u201cGiven the overwhelming public interest in assessing the accuracy of the Nunes memorandum and knowing the actual basis for the Page surveillance orders,\u201d The Times\u2019s motion says, the court should direct the publication of its orders and the application materials \"with only such limited redactions as may be essential to preserve information that remains properly classified notwithstanding the declassification and dissemination of the Nunes memorandum.\"The Times sent the motion and related documents to the Justice Department on Monday to commence the action. It also submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Justice Department on Friday asking the executive branch to disclose, following a declassification review, the same materials about the wiretapping of Mr. Page, who had left the Trump campaign a month before the government applied to wiretap him.In the motion asking the intelligence court to unseal the Page materials, The Times is being represented in part by the Yale Law School Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Anbang Takeover, China\u2019s Deal Money, Already Ebbing, Could Slow Further", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina\u2019s global deal making was already slowing down. Beijing\u2019s takeover of one of the country\u2019s biggest spenders threatens to bring it to a near stop.\u201cIf it can happen to Anbang, it can happen to any number of Chinese firms looking to gain a share of our critical industries, infrastructure and technologies,\u201d said Robert Pittenger, a Republican representative from North Carolina.That scrutiny could test what has long been a ready source of money for companies in the United States and elsewhere.For years, China was an enthusiastic and big buyer of hotels and real estate, entertainment companies and logistics companies in the United States, rewarding those who put the deals together. But those warm business ties between China and the United States are cooling.The Trump administration has expressed concerns about investments by Chinese companies in United States firms in areas where Beijing wants to be dominant, like artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. The Anbang takeover will most likely add to that trepidation.\u201cRegulators will naturally be somewhat concerned by the reality that often there is an asymmetry of information about the Chinese firms operating internationally,\u201d said Jeremy Stevens, an economist for Standard Bank Group in Beijing. \u201cThis event further underlines this truth,\u201d he added.Anbang has said it will carry on business as usual. \u201cWe remain fully committed to our overseas subsidiaries, business and investments,\u201d it said in a statement on Friday.But already, Chinese companies aren\u2019t buying \u2014 or sealing deals \u2014 like they once were.Newly announced Chinese acquisitions in the United States in 2017 fell to $8.7 billion, one-tenth the transaction value of acquisitions in 2016. It marks the lowest level in six years, according to data from Rhodium Group, which tracks Chinese investments abroad.Some of the drop in deals last year had to do with China\u2019s skepticism of its large private conglomerates and its crackdown on what it called irrational spending overseas on trophy assets like the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, which Anbang bought in late 2014 for nearly $2 billion. High-flying giants like Anbang and its peers Dalian Wanda and HNA Group, which have large amounts of debt, have started shedding assets overseas.Some of the slowdown comes from American concerns as well.Just as the Chinese government announced its plans to take over Anbang last week, the American semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corporation announced that its $580 million sale to Hubei Xinyan, an investment fund backed by the Chinese state, had been blocked by American officials. It was the latest high-tech China deal blocked by Washington amid concerns that China could gain access to cutting-edge technology.The Committee on Foreign Investment, the government committee that reviews foreign purchases of American companies in the United States, could become an even tougher hurdle.Mr. Pittenger, the congressman, is co-sponsoring a bill that would broaden the scope of the committee, known as Cfius. While the panel reviews deals for national security issues, Mr. Pittenger and others want it to consider economic and other factors in deciding whether to approve deals.\u201cThis cannot go unnoticed by those tasked to uphold our national security through Cfius and export controls,\u201d Mr. Pittenger said, referring to China\u2019s takeover of Anbang last week.With the government takeover, Anbang could be under pressure to begin to sell its many holdings overseas. These include hotels across the United States, a large stake in a South Korean bank, a Dutch insurance company and a South Korean insurance company.\u201cInvestors in companies outside China in which Anbang, Wanda or HNA own a stake of less than 100 percent should expect that the stake held by the Chinese investor will be put on the market over 2018,\u201d said Gordon Orr, the former Asia chairman at global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. These could \u201cbe pushed through very rapidly,\u201d Mr. Orr added.Dutch regulators are reviewing the potential impact on Vivat, a Dutch insurance company that Anbang bought in 2015. On Friday Vivat said that the takeover would not affect Vivat or its clients. But it also added that it is an independent entity and subject to Dutch laws and regulations and was being monitored by Dutch supervisory authorities.De Nederlandsche Bank and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets, the two authorities that monitor Vivat, did not respond to a request for comment.The Canadian government \u201chas exclusive jurisdiction for matters of international trade and approved the purchase by Anbang in spite of significant concerns in B.C.,\u201d said Adrian Dix, the health minister in British Columbia, in an emailed statement. \u201cWe believe that communication with patients, families and the general public on these types of matters should be done more transparently.\u201dGovernment officials are concerned that Anbang, under government control, will be forced to sell the homes in a way that could put retirees at risk.\u201cThe care and well-being of patients must be at the center of our efforts and not the operator,\u201d Mr. Dix said in the statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Elder Statesman of Latin American Literature \u2014 and a Writer of Our Moment", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "FeatureMario Vargas Llosa isn\u2019t a household name among American readers. But at 81, he remains a literary and political colossus across the Spanish-speaking world, and his novels have never felt more relevant.Supported byPreysler, who was born in the Philippines but has lived in Spain since she was 16, built the home with her third husband, Spain\u2019s former Minister of Economy and Finance Miguel Boyer, who died in 2014. Paparazzi often loiter around its gates; Preysler, 67, has been an object of fascination for Spanish-language tabloids ever since she married her first husband, the pop star Julio Iglesias, in 1971. (Her second husband was a Spanish marquis.) And it was something of a scandal that Vargas Llosa now had a desk with tidy piles of books and a bust of Honor\u00e9 de Balzac in a little corner of her library amid Boyer\u2019s old science and math books. He used to live in a floor-through apartment in the heart of historic Madrid, steps away from the Royal Theater, where the streets are as narrow as trenches. But in 2015, he left his wife of 50 years for Preysler. As I followed him out onto the terrace, I wondered briefly if part of Preysler\u2019s appeal had been her ability to wrap him in such luxury.We took seats under a white awning on a pair of white couches facing an aquamarine pool. My coffee arrived in a delicate pink china cup. As we talked, the sun slid behind a narrow forest of closely planted trees, which hid the street, the high stone walls and the long gravel driveway, giving the garden the illusion of a park. We talked for more than two hours in Spanish, about the Mississippi modernist William Faulkner and the Spanish superagent Carmen Balcells, about the TV shows \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cVikings.\u201d For most of our conversation, Vargas Llosa was strikingly self-contained. He barely touched his glass of water and rarely moved his hands, though he said almost everything with a smile and ended many sentences with a laugh. He was like the home itself: a fortress camouflaged in the warmth of social grace. \u201cHe can strike one as being a very formal person, and he has cultivated that to some degree,\u201d said Marie Arana, a Peruvian-American writer and former editor of The Washington Post\u2019s books section. \u201cPeople who are enormously attractive compensate by trying to be formal, to look serious.\u201dIn March, Vargas Llosa will turn 82. He once looked like a dark-eyed John Travolta: full lips, strong chin, thick black hair. The hair is now white, but the serene manners and the prodigious self-discipline remain. He has written almost every morning of his life, publishing 59 books in 55 years, among them some of the greatest novels of the past half century: \u201cThe Time of the Hero,\u201d \u201cConversation in the Cathedral,\u201d \u201cAunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,\u201d \u201cThe Feast of the Goat.\u201d \u201cIf I didn\u2019t write,\u201d he told The Paris Review in 1990, \u201cI would blow my brains out, without a shadow of a doubt.\u201d This week Vargas Llosa has three books coming out \u2014 English translations of a novel (\u201cThe Neighborhood\u201d) and of a collection of political essays (\u201cSabers and Utopias\u201d), as well as a new volume in Spain, \u201cThe Call of the Tribe,\u201d which is not yet available in English. It\u2019s a condensed history of three centuries of classical liberal thought, from Adam Smith to Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Revel, that doubles as a kind of intellectual autobiography.For Vargas Llosa, writing has always been a weapon against both despair and despotism, and \u201cThe Call of the Tribe\u201d feels like his attempt to beat back the waves of nationalism and populism now flooding our world. He is a defender of individual liberty and democracy in Latin America. His attacks on authoritarians have made him enemies among both socialists and conservatives. What he most respects in a person, he told me, is integrity: \u201cConsistency in what you believe, what you say and what you do.\u201d And while his insistence on saying and doing exactly what he himself believes has left a scorched path in his personal life, it has also been the making of his career.\u201cWhen I went to live with my father, and I was feeling alone, feeling completely isolated, separated from the people whom I felt were my family, reading saved me,\u201d Vargas Llosa told me. He buried himself in novels by Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Charles Dickens and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, dreaming of a life filled with adventure. \u201cIt was a marvelous way of not living the horrible life that I had.\u201d\u201cWhen [my father] beat me,\u201d Vargas Llosa writes in his 1993 memoir, \u201cA Fish in the Water,\u201d \u201cI went off the deep end, and terror many times made me humble myself before him and beg his pardon with my hands joined. But that didn\u2019t calm him down. And he went on hitting me, screaming and threatening to put me in the army as a private as soon as I was old enough to be a recruit so that I\u2019d be set on the right path. When the whole scene was over and done with, and he could lock me in my room, it was not the blows, but rage and disgust with myself for having been so afraid of him and having humbled myself before him in that way, that made me spend a sleepless night, weeping in silence.\u201dFiction and poetry were Mario\u2019s refuge from Ernesto\u2019s domestic despotism. They were also his defiance. \u201cMy father saw literature as something extremely dangerous,\u201d Vargas Llosa said in the garden, brushing aside his old traumas with a laugh. \u201cHe thought that literature was a passport to failure in life, that it was a way of starving to death.\u201d Novels, Ernesto also believed, were the work of drunk bohemians and homosexuals. Bent on turning Mario into a real man, Ernesto enrolled his son in Leoncio Prado Military Academy when he was 14. \u201cI went to Leoncio Prado because my father thought that the military was the best cure for literature and for those activities that he understood as very marginalized.\u201d Vargas Llosa chuckled at the paradox. \u201cOn the contrary, he gave me the subject of my first novel!\u201dEven now, \u201cThe Time of the Hero\u201d (1963) still has the power to shock with its scenes of bullying and dissipation among cadets. Highlights include: the gang rape of a chicken, blow jobs endured for liquor, officers\u2019 kicking students and the killing of a boy nicknamed \u201cSlave,\u201d who marks himself for special humiliation when he makes the mistake of pleading for mercy with clasped hands. Incensed by the expos\u00e9, administrators at Leoncio Prado Military Academy rounded up 1,000 copies and set the books aflame in an official ceremony. But a judge for Spain\u2019s prestigious Premio Biblioteca Breve Prize declared it \u201cthe best novel in the Spanish language in the past 30 years.\u201d \u201cThe Time of the Hero\u201d was among the first sensations of a transformative age of Latin American literature known as the Boom. (All its other major writers \u2014 Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Carlos Fuentes, Jos\u00e9 Donoso, Juan Rulfo, Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias and Guillermo Cabrera Infante \u2014 have died.)Vargas Llosa\u2019s masterwork is \u201cConversation in the Cathedral\u201d (1969). It\u2019s Faulkner cross-pollinated with Balzac, modernist techniques used to paint a sweeping historical panorama. The structure of the novel spirals out from a single point: an unexpected meeting in 1960s Lima between Santiago Zavala, a 30-year-old reporter estranged from his upper-crust family, and Ambrosio, his family\u2019s former chauffeur. The two run into each other at a pound, where Ambrosio slaughters dogs for money. Together, the men get drunk at a dive bar called the Cathedral, and from their conversation rises a blistering vision of the whole of Peru under Gen. Manuel Odr\u00eda\u2019s eight-year military dictatorship in the 1950s. Vargas Llosa implicates everyone in the moral catastrophe, from the bickering student dissidents to the cowardly media to the rich women drowning themselves in alcohol and gossip.Why has Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s magical realism cemented its place on American bookshelves and syllabuses while Vargas Llosa\u2019s gritty masterpieces are neglected? Vargas Llosa\u2019s best books are harder to read than Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s. He\u2019s less sentimental, dirtier, raunchier, angrier. \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude\u201d looks like a Hallmark card next to \u201cConversation in the Cathedral.\u201d You might be fired for assigning Vargas Llosa in high school English. And Vargas Llosa has published so many novels \u2014 18 in all \u2014 that the tours de force can get lost among the mediocrities. His buttoned-up public demeanor hasn\u2019t helped. \u201cGabo\u201d was not only a tremendous writer; he was an expert showman who once worked in advertising and cannily played up his Caribbean exoticism for foreign audiences. When the two fell out in the 1970s, many intellectuals leaned left toward Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, while Vargas Llosa was shunned.Yet Vargas Llosa is the more daring, more democratic writer. While Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez cozied up to Fidel Castro and refined a distinctive style, Vargas Llosa reinvented his over and over again while defending free markets and reproductive freedom, gay rights and open elections. His political tracts underscore the value of diversity, of stellar public education, of equal opportunities for the poor. And his novels, whether they are kaleidoscopic histories, political thrillers, generational sagas or slapstick comedies, are remarkable for their ability to inhabit a host of perspectives. He\u2019s especially good at the psychology of collaborators \u2014 the people who surround authoritarians and make their administrations function. Such characters were not popular among readers in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s, who preferred Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s romantic heroes, but they might feel especially relevant to Americans today.The sacrifice was provoked by the debut of another book in Spanish. This volume, \u201cConversaci\u00f3n en Princeton,\u201d provides a view into a seminar that Vargas Llosa gave in 2015 with Rub\u00e9n Gallo, a professor of language and literature at Princeton University. For months, Vargas Llosa, Gallo and his students discussed five of Vargas Llosa\u2019s most famous books, including \u201cConversation in the Cathedral.\u201d The whole project, Gallo explained, was inspired by his desire to do a careful, point-by-point questioning of \u201cthe Goethe of our own time\u201d in a utopian space \u201cfree of any political pressure, and of any other pressures, save the pleasure of reading itself.\u201dPolitics, however, were inescapable that week in Madrid. The leaders of Catalonia, the semiautonomous region that is home to Barcelona, were threatening to hold a referendum on the question of whether Catalans ought to secede from Spain. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had already declared such a referendum illegal, and Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court had also ruled it unconstitutional. But Catalonia\u2019s regional president, Carles Puigdemont, looked determined to proceed.\u201cHow do you see what\u2019s happening in Catalonia?\u201d asked the first reporter during the event\u2019s question-and-answer session. \u201cI think we should focus on the book,\u201d Vargas Llosa responded affably. Then he segued into a four-minute answer in which he recalled that Catalan nationalists were regarded as \u201clittle old reactionaries\u201d during the 1970s; opined that the current referendum was \u201can absurd blunder, an anachronism that has nothing to do with the realities of our time\u201d; and suggested that Catalan nationalism was a kind of \u201cillness.\u201d \u201cMy hope,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the government will have the energy necessary to impede a coup \u2014 that is really what\u2019s gestating \u2014 from taking place and to give it the appropriate sanctions.\u201d Within hours, these pronouncements had made headline news in Spain, Venezuela and Peru.It\u2019s almost impossible to imagine the same reaction happening here if, say, Toni Morrison or Philip Roth voiced a political opinion. But Vargas Llosa looms as a political figure in his own right: He almost became the president of Peru in 1990, and he is still admired and loathed as one of Latin America\u2019s most influential champions of limited government, free enterprise, democracy and rule of law. For the past 25 years, he has penned an op-ed column called \u201cTouchstone\u201d for the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds that is devoured by politicos in Spain and Peru. When Casa de America held an event to celebrate Vargas Llosa\u2019s 80th birthday in 2016, attendees included the president of Chile (Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era), a former president of Uruguay (Luis Alberto Lacalle), two former presidents of Colombia (\u00c1lvaro Uribe and Andr\u00e9s Pastrana) and two former prime ministers of Spain (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar and Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez). The event was kicked off with a speech from Prime Minister Rajoy.\u201cWords are acts,\u201d Vargas Llosa said while we sat on Preysler\u2019s terrace, emphasizing each word as if pointing at the sentence hovering in the air. This phrase by Jean-Paul Sartre, he told me, crystallized his understanding of the novelist\u2019s political role in the 1950s. Back then, he was a Marxist. The scenes of Communist resistance in \u201cConversation in the Cathedral\u201d were inspired by his own activities at the University of San Marcos in 1953.In 1959, Vargas Llosa enthusiastically supported Fidel Castro\u2019s socialist revolution in Cuba. At one point, he even housed Che Guevara\u2019s mother in his apartment. But as Castro\u2019s regime developed, Vargas Llosa grew uneasy. During a trip to Havana, he learned that gay Cubans were being imprisoned with counterrevolutionaries and common criminals in forced-labor camps. \u201cSome of them had that totally idealistic idea that the revolution was not only going to bring socialism, but it was also going to change customs, that there would be a homosexual liberation,\u201d he said. He told me he sent a private letter to Castro, expressing his confusion and surprise.By 1971, however, such private protest felt insufficient. When the poet Heberto Padilla was subjected to a Stalinist show trial, Vargas Llosa gathered several friends at his home in Barcelona to draft a public denunciation of Castro. This famous \u201cPadilla letter\u201d appeared in the French newspaper Le Monde and was reprinted all over Latin America, signed by Susan Sontag, Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, among others. The fallout from its publication was atrocious, including accusations that Vargas Llosa worked for the C.I.A., as well as the beginning of the disintegration of his close friendship with Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\u201cBut at the same time I felt a great freedom, you know?\u201d Vargas Llosa told me. \u201cBecause until then \u2018you can\u2019t give weapons to the enemy.\u2019 So you had to swallow all kinds of frogs and snakes\u201d \u2014 the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the labor camps in Cuba \u2014 \u201cbut after the Padilla affair, I never again swallowed a frog or snake.\u201dVargas Llosa\u2019s break with Castro precipitated a fundamental reconstruction of his political beliefs. By 1982 he was having dinner with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the classical liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin at the home of the historian Hugh Thomas in London. This political conversion had an impact on his literary reputation. Gerald Martin, who wrote the definitive biography of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and is now working on another about Vargas Llosa, believes it was the most important factor keeping him from a Nobel win. \u201cIt was generally believed before with Lundkvist\u201d \u2014 Artur Lundkvist, an influential member of the Swedish Academy \u2014 \u201cthat he preferred the Socialist, Marxist, Communist, radical, progressive writers,\u201d Martin told me. Vargas Llosa received the prize for literature only after the Nobel committee had changed by the early 2000s.It didn\u2019t help that Vargas Llosa\u2019s beliefs were often subject to gross distortion. Carlos Gran\u00e9s, the editor who assembled \u201cSabers and Utopias,\u201d told me that he once heard the Peruvian author Dante Castro Arrasco declare that if Vargas Llosa had become president of Peru, he would have replaced the national coat of arms with a swastika. In truth, Vargas Llosa\u2019s politics are closer to libertarian, and he has denounced every Latin American authoritarian of his lifetime. \u201cSabers and Utopias\u201d shows him inveighing against not only leftists like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela but also Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile and the Peronist military dictatorship in Argentina.\u201cMario Vargas Llosa has been a central figure \u2014 central, central, central \u2014 for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director of Human Rights Watch, told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m exaggerating. He\u2019s some sort of father of the current Peruvian democracy.\u201dThe mobs were not always so friendly when Vargas Llosa campaigned for president of Peru in the 1990 election. His house received bomb threats. His van was attacked. Members of his political party, the Freedom Movement, were murdered. His candidacy had emerged unexpectedly in 1987, after he penned a vitriolic op-ed against President Alan Garc\u00eda\u2019s plan to nationalize Peru\u2019s banks. Soon after, Vargas Llosa stopped writing fiction to create the Freedom Movement. His eldest son, \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa, then 23, became the campaign spokesman.Vargas Llosa\u2019s platform attracted new people to Peruvian politics, including the corporate executive Beatriz Merino, who later served as prime minister of Peru. But most Peruvians were fed up with political parties. During the 1980s, the incompetence of Peru\u2019s political class had turned the country into a nightmare. Terrorist groups killed some 17,000 people and controlled large swaths of the sierras. Hyperinflation hit 7,650 percent in 1990. At least one-third of the country\u2019s population lived in poverty. Vargas Llosa\u2019s call to reduce state subsidies terrified many of these citizens, as did his connections to the rich, white elite that dominated Peru like an oligarchy. Nevertheless, for much of the campaign, polls predicted a Vargas Llosa win. Then, in the final laps of the campaign, an unknown agricultural engineer named Alberto Fujimori started closing in.Fujimori mocked and attacked Vargas Llosa relentlessly, drawing attention to his agnosticism, his international connections, his earnest intellectualism and his racy novels. A son of cotton pickers from Japan, he presented himself as an outsider who would defend Peru\u2019s poor and working class from a foreign neoliberal \u201ceconomic shock.\u201d Fujimori himself sometimes appeared on a tractor. He had a gift for vague, emotionally resonant statements. But Fujimori won only because Peru\u2019s leftists and centrists swung behind him for the sole purpose of sinking Vargas Llosa. Then almost immediately after he took office, Fujimori pivoted right and implemented a version of the \u201ceconomic shock\u201d that Vargas Llosa had recommended. This reversal depended on the collaboration of the same economists, lawyers and business owners who had rallied around the Freedom Movement. But by 1992 \u2014 after Fujimori used tanks to shut down Peru\u2019s Congress because it resisted his reforms \u2014 it became obvious that many of Vargas Llosa\u2019s former supporters did not feel as strongly about freedom as he did.Fujimori foreshadowed a new wave of authoritarians in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia. The political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way have coined a term for this kind of regime: \u201ccompetitive authoritarianism.\u201d On paper, it looks a lot like democracy. In practice, it operates more like autocracy. Yet Fujimori\u2019s popularity remained high for much of the 1990s. As Vargas Llosa predicted, economic reforms finished hyperinflation. And in 1992, Peruvian police officers captured the leader of the most grotesquely violent guerrilla group in Latin American history, the Shining Path, allowing them to dismantle it. These two triumphs are why some Peruvians claim that Fujimori \u201csaved\u201d Peru, even though his government formed military death squads, suspended habeas corpus, crushed the free press, mishandled a cholera epidemic, sterilized thousands of indigenous women, blackmailed opponents and fomented widespread corruption.Sitting over a glass of tomato juice at the Four Seasons, Vargas Llosa emphasized that he never worked against Fujimori until he brought out the tanks. \u201cNot only did I respect the election, I was one of the first to congratulate Fujimori, to wish him luck,\u201d Vargas Llosa said. \u201cAnd during the two years that he governed legally as president, I did not make the most minimal opposition.\u201d But when Fujimori shut down Congress, Vargas Llosa became his enemy. He asked the international community to cut off aid to Fujimori and noted (correctly) that Latin American militaries often favor coups d\u2019\u00e9tat. In response, Fujimori\u2019s head of the armed forces, Nicol\u00e1s de Bari Hermoza, suggested that Vargas Llosa was deliberately harming Peruvians. \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa told me that they learned of a plan to strip the entire Vargas Llosa family of its Peruvian citizenship. Mario appealed to Spain, and in 1993 it granted him citizenship. In Peru, this event was widely perceived as the petulant betrayal of a sore loser.If you have never read Vargas Llosa before, this is the place to start. Gorgeous and harrowing, \u201cThe Feast of the Goat\u201d is also the most accessible of his great political fictions. Here his taste for baroque narrative multiplicity has been simplified to just a handful of perspectives, and Edith Grossman\u2019s translation is superb. Trujillo, Vargas Llosa writes, is an \u201castute exploiter of men\u2019s vanity, greed and stupidity.\u201d Almost every character collaborates with him as long as they believe that he can help them gain power or money. Even the man who organizes Trujillo\u2019s assassination first guards the dictator\u2019s life. Trujillo nevertheless murders his brother and destroys his reputation. Trujillo had killed him in stages, the man reflects later, \u201ctaking away his decency, his honor, his self-respect, his joy in living, his hopes and desires, turning him into a sack of bones tormented by a guilty conscience that had been destroying him gradually for so many years.\u201dFujimori\u2019s regime came apart the same year that \u201cThe Feast of the Goat\u201d was published in Spanish. On Sept. 14, 2000, the media aired footage of Fujimori\u2019s head of secret intelligence, Vladimiro Montesinos, paying a congressman $15,000 to switch to Fujimori\u2019s party. Two months after the tape surfaced, Fujimori made an unscheduled trip to Japan and faxed his resignation from a Tokyo hotel room. By then more than $50 million had been located in foreign bank accounts in Montesinos\u2019s name. Five years later, Fujimori was arrested in Chile, and he was eventually extradited to Peru. In 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for, among other atrocities, his role in creating a death squad that murdered an 8-year-old boy.\u00c1lvaro moved back to Lima during the final year of Fujimori\u2019s regime to join the democratic resistance, and after Fujimori\u2019s collapse, Vargas Llosa\u2019s influence in Peru soared. In 2011, father and son used their new political capital to derail the presidential hopes of Fujimori\u2019s daughter, Keiko. To defeat her, Keiko\u2019s opponents rallied behind Ollanta Humala, a man Hugo Ch\u00e1vez endorsed in Peru\u2019s 2006 election. After interviewing Humala in Vargas Llosa\u2019s office, \u00c1lvaro helped arrange a public meeting at which Humala swore a democratic oath. Vargas Llosa sent a video endorsement that played at the event. \u201cIf Vargas Llosa had not supported Ollanta Humala against Keiko Fujimori, Ollanta Humala would not have won,\u201d the Peruvian political scientist Alberto Vergara told me. \u201cThey moderated Humala so that he could win the runoff.\u201d\u201cHalf the country hated us, obviously,\u201d \u00c1lvaro said. \u201cAnd until this day they won\u2019t forgive us. But in the end I think that what they won\u2019t forgive us is that we were right.\u201d Humala did not become an authoritarian. When his term in office ended, he stepped down. He is now in jail awaiting trial for corruption.As the cocktail hour dragged on, Vargas Llosa became restless. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous to sit or to walk,\u201d he said, \u201cbut standing around is horrible.\u201d He is a man who likes to be doing, not waiting, and I got the sense that for him and Preysler all their charming, pre-awards chitchat was a kind of necessary work. Finally the bells chimed for dinner. Vargas Llosa escorted Preysler to the meal on his arm.In our conversations, Vargas Llosa declined to discuss his romantic entanglements. When I asked him what had fractured his marriage to Patricia Llosa, which produced three children, he dropped all his smiles and chuckles. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthat topic has to do with love. Love is probably the most enriching experience that a human being can have. Nothing transforms a person\u2019s life as much as love. At the same time, love is a private experience. If it\u2019s made public, it becomes cheap, shoddy, full of commonplaces. This is why it\u2019s so hard to write about love in literature. You have to find the most clever ways so that it doesn\u2019t lose its authenticity and become commonplace. So I think that a person shouldn\u2019t talk about love precisely if love is so important in his life.\u201dYou\u2019re a romantic, I said.\u201cI think we all are. I think that romanticism has marked our lives very much, that it\u2019s very difficult not to be romantic in some way, although many of us don\u2019t realize it. You live it or you reject it. You vaccinate yourself against it. Let\u2019s say that I haven\u2019t rejected it. When it\u2019s happened, I\u2019ve lived it.\u201dThe first time he lived it was in 1955, when he eloped with his aunt\u2019s sister, Julia Urquidi Illanes. At the time, Vargas Llosa was a 19-year-old university student, and Urquidi was a 29-year-old divorc\u00e9e. Ernesto Vargas was so enraged by their marriage that he threatened to kill Mario. But the couple refused to divorce. The day Ernesto accepted the marriage, Vargas Llosa writes in his memoir, marked his \u201cdefinitive emancipation\u201d from his father. But nine years later, they divorced, and a year after, in 1965, he married his first cousin Patricia Llosa Urquidi, Julia\u2019s niece. In her memoir, \u201cWhat Varguitas Didn\u2019t Say,\u201d Julia suggests the cousins began their romance when Patricia visited them in Paris in 1960, when Mario was 24 and Patricia was 15.Forty-five years into their marriage, Vargas Llosa declared in his Nobel lecture that Patricia \u201cdoes everything and does everything well. She solves problems, manages the economy, imposes order on chaos, keeps journalists and intrusive people at bay, defends my time, decides appointments and trips, packs and unpacks suitcases and is so generous that even when she thinks she is rebuking me, she pays me the highest compliment: \u2018Mario, the only thing you\u2019re good for is writing.\u2019\u2009\u201d The year she turned 70, however, he left her for Preysler.\u201cWhat you have to understand about him is that he\u2019s a person who gives himself with absolute passion to what he believes in, even when he is wrong,\u201d \u00c1lvaro told me. Of all Vargas Llosa\u2019s children, \u00c1lvaro has been the most accepting of his father\u2019s new relationship, perhaps because their ties go far beyond the familial. Vargas Llosa\u2019s daughter, Morgana, a photographer and documentary filmmaker who lives in Peru, told me that she was shocked when Vargas Llosa appeared with Preysler in the Spanish-language celebrity weekly \u00a1Hola! just days after the entire family had gathered to celebrate Patricia and Mario\u2019s 50th anniversary. Now she takes the situation more stoically. \u201cSeeing how marriages fall apart after two, three, five or 10 years, I think it\u2019s an absolute success to have shared a life together for 50 years,\u201d she said.But Vargas Llosa\u2019s younger son, Gonzalo, who works with the United Nations in Britain, still reels from the way Mario handled the divorce. \u201cWe had a very special and very close relationship, and I love him greatly,\u201d he told me. But he was enormously disappointed when Mario told \u00a1Hola! that his first year with Preysler had been the happiest year of his life. \u201cIf the year in which you leave your wife of 50 years and you don\u2019t speak to your son is the happiest year of your life, well, that doesn\u2019t say a great deal about whatever he may have really felt,\u201d Gonzalo told me. \u201cSo this is fine to think, but why say it publicly? This what I find distasteful but also hurtful.\u201dDivorce, and its painful aftermath, can happen in any family. But what galls many people, including Gonzalo, is that Preysler embodies the celebrity entertainment culture that Vargas Llosa long claimed to abhor. A woman of feline poise and beauty, she has shrewdly parlayed tabloid attention into a kind of proto-Kardashian career: hosting television shows, promoting luxury goods like Rabat jewelry and Porcelanosa tiles. Their social life is now extensively documented by \u00a1Hola!, where Preysler herself once worked, as well as by many less savory gossip sheets. A quick online search turns up images of the couple sailing on the Costa Azul, watching bullfighting in Seville and attending parties at Dumfries House with Prince Charles.\u201cThere are hundreds of publications, radio and television programs, that feed a kind of morbid curiosity that consists of basically revealing the private lives of people,\u201d Vargas Llosa told me in Madrid. \u201cMany people are delighted. On the contrary, it\u2019s a real profession to show your privacy. It\u2019s a kind of striptease, no, of a life, especially sexual, erotic. And it\u2019s a world that literally produces horror in me.\u201dThis \u201cprofession\u201d is Preysler\u2019s, however, and as long as they are together it will be, in some way, Vargas Llosa\u2019s profession as well. In December the Spanish edition of Harper\u2019s Bazaar magazine published a soft-focus video of the couple embracing and talking about their life together \u2014 precisely the sort of thing that, to listen to Vargas Llosa, \u201cliterally produces horror\u201d in him. This sudden, major gap between what Vargas Llosa says and what he does reminds me of a conversation we had about his puckish character Fonchito, a boy with the face of an angel and a taste for Egon Schiele. In \u201cThe Discreet Hero\u201d (2013), Fonchito develops an interest in religion and asks his father, Don Rigoberto, \u201cCould you tell me what this Sodom and Gomorrah is, Papa?\u201dSometimes I wonder if Fonchito is your alter-ego, I said to Vargas Llosa.\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cHe\u2019s a character who disturbs me a bit because I don\u2019t really understand him very well.\u201d A moment later he added, \u201cI can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s really so innocent or if he\u2019s concealing something or if it\u2019s a way of behaving that\u2019s clever, no?\u201dFonchito first appeared in Vargas Llosa\u2019s erotic comedies \u201cIn Praise of the Stepmother\u201d (1988) and \u201cThe Notebooks of Don Rigoberto\u201d (1997). Most critics ignore these libertine novels when they discuss Vargas Llosa\u2019s work. His own fans tend to regard them with either distaste or hilarity. But the skittishness about sex has kept readers and critics from appreciating how erotics pervade all of Vargas Llosa\u2019s fiction. Even the novels that are best known for their political dissections are filled with a kind of transgressive sexual realism: scenes in brothels, secret homosexual affairs, rapes. \u201cPeople don\u2019t tend to think of him as an erotic writer, but his literary project is so interesting in part because of the way it connects sexuality with politics,\u201d Gallo told me. \u201cI think there is an idea, and he\u2019s said as much, that a dictatorship affects all the levels of citizens\u2019 lives, including the sexual sphere.\u201dNowhere has this connection been as explicit, or as graphic, as in Vargas Llosa\u2019s latest novel, \u201cThe Neighborhood.\u201d The story opens with best friends Marisa and Chabela in bed. A few pages in we find the words \u201cperspire,\u201d \u201cclitoris,\u201d \u201cscratching\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d \u2014 their platonic evening has transformed into a lesbian affair. In Vargas Llosa\u2019s opinion, this scene, and the novel\u2019s many other triple-X plot twists, realistically capture the bedroom adventures that occurred during the darkest part of the Fujimori years. Lima\u2019s authoritarian curfew, which forbade residents to travel through the city at night, turned many dinners and parties into spontaneous sleepovers, he told me, with some inevitably kinky consequences.\u201cIn those periods of tension, of terrible aggravation, eroticism often springs up as a compensation, no?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of distracting oneself, of losing oneself. It\u2019s like the idea of the end of the world. The world is ending: All sins are allowed.\u201d\u201cCommunism has destroyed itself by its total incapacity to fulfill all the expectations that were put into this system to bring prosperity, justice, happiness, culture to a society,\u201d he said in English. \u201cBut populism is much more difficult to fight because it\u2019s not an ideology, not a system with principles, with ideas that we can refute rationally.\u201dAs recently as three years ago, it seemed as if Vargas Llosa\u2019s political values had conquered the world. Almost everywhere in Latin America, the totalitarian regimes that he opposed had collapsed \u2014 while free markets, democracy and sexual liberation found favor. But in 2016, the tide seemed to change. During our conversations, he recalled feeling astonished during a visit to England shortly before the vote on Brexit. For Vargas Llosa, London had long been a model of how polyglot pluralism, democracy and free markets should work together. Yet there was Boris Johnson on his hotel television, shamelessly declaring that Britain\u2019s payments to the European Union subsidized bullfights in Spain.\u201cTo lie so brazenly, so cynically,\u201d Vargas Llosa told me. \u201cWell, I was amazed.\u201d He never imagined that such retrograde tactics could work in Britain. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s been proved that no country is really vaccinated against demagogy or populism.\u201d In Europe, it\u2019s easy to name major political figures, like Angela Merkel in Germany, who embrace the principles of liberal economics while also defending a liberal society. That\u2019s rare in Latin America. \u201cThe attraction to a caudillo is a characteristic that many Latin American countries share,\u201d the Peruvian journalist Diego Salazar told me. \u201cAnd not just Latin Americans. In fact, President Trump is the first Latin American president of the United States in that respect.\u201dIn 2016, Keiko Fujimori lost the presidency by only 0.2 percent of the vote, and her party, Popular Force, gained a majority in Congress that she has used, in true competitive-authoritarian fashion, to attack her strongest opponents. In late December, Popular Force nearly deposed President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in a legislative coup. Kuczynski was saved only by the intercession of Alberto Fujimori and his son, Kenji, who persuaded nine congressmen to sit out the key vote. Soon after, Kuczynski granted Alberto a Christmas Eve pardon. It\u2019s widely believed that the abstentions were quid pro quo for this release.\u201cWe have always had to choose between the lesser of two evils,\u201d Gustavo Gorriti, editor of the investigative-news outlet IDL-Reporteros, said about Peruvians. \u201cAnd we have had substandard democratic candidates, which we chose to elect just in order to avoid the return to the Fujimori dictatorship.\u201d But the Fujimoris are now essentially in power \u2014 Kuczynski\u2019s political survival depends upon their favor \u2014 and Peru\u2019s loose coalition of democratically minded forces may not pull off another win in the 2021 elections.Vargas Llosa\u2019s own role in these battles is diminishing. The pain and friction of his unexpected divorce have estranged him from Peru and strained many of his old friendships. He does not travel to Lima as often or stay long when he goes. The apartment where \u00c1lvaro met with Humala now belongs solely to Patricia Llosa, who has dismantled Vargas Llosa\u2019s office and is turning it into a TV room. His political opinions will always matter in Lima, but now that he has opted to join Preysler\u2019s jet set, they will carry less weight. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa predicted this shift at the start of his father\u2019s affair. \u201cHe was a god for me not just because I loved him as a father,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut because I thought he was the most brilliant and important and inspiring intellectual that I had ever come across or read about. And when I see a Nobel Prize winner giving interviews to \u00a1Hola!, I feel sad that he has allowed himself to become part of a world which is intellectually so absolutely poor.\u201dNothing may transform a life as much as love, but Vargas Llosa has always been hard to comprehend. He\u2019s a modernist and a comedian, a politician and an aesthete, an intellectual and a libertine. Writing was not simply a refuge from or a rebellion against Ernesto, he told me in Preysler\u2019s garden; it was \u201ca way of revealing myself to be different from what he wanted me to be.\u201d His whole life has been a series of these startling revelations. Perhaps we all contain multitudes, but Vargas Llosa has put his contradictions into action, in his life and on the page.Advertisement"}

But if his rubbing shoulders with Davos elite last week weren\u2019t enough to dispel any hopes of him delivering on his populist posturing, the emerging details of that infrastructure plan surely is.The budget of the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association, which advances the bank\u2019s development priorities in the lowest-income countries, recently added $2.5 billion to provide corporations with risk insurance, guarantees, loans and equity investments.As Puerto Rico\u2019s dire situation proves, the United States, like much of the rest of the world, has critical infrastructure problems to fix. But the privatization solution promoted by the Trump administration and popular among global elite is not the answer. Already, the toll that privatization takes has provoked resistance from Pittsburgh to Lagos.Lawmakers at every level must take a stand by refusing a privatization agenda, whether from the Trump administration or the World Bank, and calling for renewed and expanded public funding. We need a plan that increases public investment, especially federal funding, not one that yields control to profit-maximizing and unaccountable corporations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Albany Really Works: Cuomo Loyalist Exposes Pay-to-Play Culture", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs he unveiled the charges against one of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s top lieutenants, Preet Bharara hoped aloud for a jury trial \u201cso that all New Yorkers can see, in gory detail, what their state government has been up to.\u201dMr. Bharara, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, has gotten his wish.For the last two weeks, Todd R. Howe, a confessed felon and former lobbyist who has flipped to tell all about his co-conspirators, has taken the witness stand in a corruption scandal that has rocked Albany.The story that Mr. Howe has unfurled has included tales of six-figure campaign contributions to Mr. Cuomo, made from a company with business before the state, that were purposefully divided up to hide their origin. There were private plane trips, courtesy of Mr. Howe\u2019s clients, for Mr. Cuomo days before his first election \u2014 not to mention a deep-sea fishing expedition for his campaign manager.Mr. Howe said he raised \u201ca considerable amount\u201d of money for Mr. Cuomo in 2010 and then volunteered in the 2014 campaign headquarters while raising still more money \u2014 all as he tried to secure state actions benefiting his clients.And those are just the activities deemed legal.Technically, it is Joseph Percoco, formerly one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s most-trusted aides, who is on trial, along with three co-conspirators in two bribery and corruption schemes. Mr. Cuomo has not been accused of any wrongdoing. The courtroom drama has nonetheless served as a stinging indictment of Albany, a city of back-room dealings and back-scratching, fund-raisers and favors, where money talks and Cuomo administration officials have listened.\u201cIt has peeled back the curtain, and the public is getting to see the seedier side of Albany,\u201d said Blair Horner, the longtime executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.Mr. Percoco was once a uniquely powerful figure, the governor\u2019s right-hand man and enforcer. He is charged with accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes \u2014 described in repeated emails with Mr. Howe as \u201cziti,\u201d a code word lifted from the Mafia drama \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d \u2014 from two companies in exchange for helping them extract action from Albany.Mr. Cuomo has so far declined to comment on the ongoing trial, citing his \u201cgreat deal of respect for the legal process.\u201dMany of the revelations about how Albany works have emerged as passing asides, such as the fact that Mr. Howe did not initially register as a lobbyist, following the suggestion, he said, of a senior Cuomo official.Or that Mr. Percoco continued to use his office in the governor\u2019s official suite while running Mr. Cuomo\u2019s 2014 campaign \u2014 despite a prohibition on using state resources for politics. Or that Mr. Percoco did not appear on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s official calendar despite often being in that office at the same time. Or that those calendars do not necessarily include all meeting attendees. (\u201cNo,\u201d testified Linda Lacewell, currently Mr. Cuomo\u2019s chief of staff, \u201cit\u2019s not an exact science.\u201d)The trial has exposed widespread use of private email addresses, and other means, in the Cuomo administration, presumably in an effort to shield communications from public disclosure laws. The administration has previously denied such practices. At one point, Mr. Percoco\u2019s attorney went through a list of officials, name by name, that Mr. Howe communicated with and was cut off after a couple minutes.\u201cI think it is pretty clear that he communicated to a lot of people via their personal email accounts,\u201d Judge Valerie E. Caproni said.The broader story being painted in the federal courthouse is the enduring pay-to-play culture in New York, where money and friends buy access and power. \u201cIn Albany, the biggest scandal is what\u2019s legal, not what\u2019s illegal,\u201d Mr. Horner said.Mimi Rocah, who worked from 2001 to 2017 as an assistant United States attorney in New York, including on some Albany corruption cases, said there is a \u201csystemic problem where minimal transparency is required and back-room deals are allowed to thrive. In that atmosphere, with huge sums of money at stake, greedy private individuals will find greedy politicians to corrupt.\u201dFor decades, Mr. Howe\u2019s fortunes have been interconnected with the Cuomo family. He worked for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in the 1980s and then for Andrew Cuomo in the 1990s at the federal housing department. Eventually, he became a lobbyist.Mr. Howe seemed to be living a high-flying life. He earned up to $750,000 per year. He had his choice of company-paid cars, either a Mercedes or a Porsche SUV. He indulged in worldly vacations: St. Lucia, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the Virgin Islands.By 2010, though, Mr. Howe had been compulsively overspending and was drowning in debt. He stiffed his son\u2019s tutor, dog walkers, mortgage lenders. In April 2010, he was arrested and charged with a felony of falsifying a check.\u201cI was living way above my means, and I had dug myself into a deep hole,\u201d Mr. Howe testified.A month later, a lifeline of sorts arrived via an email from Mr. Percoco, then Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign manager. It was time, Mr. Percoco told Mr. Howe, to \u201cactivate the brotherhood\u201d of the Cuomo clan.Mr. Howe quickly signed on. \u201cI knew Andrew Cuomo, he was running for governor, and I was in a position to help raise money,\u201d he said.He also admitted that he kept lying. And embezzling. And doctoring emails to inflate his standing.Mr. Howe introduced one of his clients, who needed state government approval for a power plant, to Mr. Percoco on that deep-sea fishing trip. The client, Peter G. Kelly, an executive with the power company, would later hire Mr. Percoco\u2019s wife in what prosecutors say was a bribe.Mr. Howe also said he got Mr. Kelly\u2019s firm to lend Mr. Cuomo a plane, at Mr. Percoco\u2019s request, in the closing days of the 2010 campaign. In the governor\u2019s first month, Mr. Kelly was invited to a private fund-raising dinner with Mr. Cuomo, emails show.On election night 2010, another opportunity presented itself for Mr. Howe because of his Cuomo connections. An old friend, he testified, \u201cgrabbed me and said, \u2018Hey, look, now that Andrew has become governor, I\u2019d like you to come up to Syracuse and meet with a construction firm that I have known and had a great relationship with, because I think you can help them.\u2019\u201dThat firm, COR Development, is at the center of the second bribery scheme. Mr. Howe said he advised them about, among other things, how to donate money in Albany \u2014 \u201ca strategy of how to maximize your investment,\u201d as Mr. Howe put it. He testified that he advised: \u201cThe stronger the relationship or a relationship you can build with the governor through campaign contributions is helpful.\u201dThe company would donate, on Mr. Howe\u2019s advice, through limited liability companies with different names to make the money harder to track.Mr. Howe\u2019s credibility is one of the central questions for the jury. Emails, records and receipts corroborate many of his stories. But the defense lawyers have relentlessly hammered Mr. Howe as a \u201cmaestro of evasion\u201d for his years of crimes and lies \u2014 including inducing him to admit to apparently attempting to defraud his credit card company for a stay at the Waldorf Astoria hotel after he struck a cooperation agreement with government prosecutors.Mr. Howe, who had been out on bail, was promptly arrested that night, and has since been jailed. It is unclear if his bail revocation threatens his cooperation agreement, or his current job as a groundskeeper on an Idaho golf course. \u201cI believe,\u201d he said the day he returned, \u201cI\u2019m in a boatload of trouble.\u201dHe\u2019s not the only one.As Mr. Percoco exited the courtroom one day, the former Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, entered moments later.Mr. Silver was convicted on corruption charges in 2015 only to have the verdict overturned after the Supreme Court narrowed what constitutes corruption. The conviction of the former Senate leader, Dean G. Skelos, was similarly overturned. Both face retrials this year.Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Silver and Mr. Skelos were once the three most powerful elected officials in Albany.\u201cThere\u2019s a new trial every month,\u201d said Mr. Camarda, who is pushing for tighter ethics and disclosure rules. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t bring about change, you have to wonder what will.\u201dJesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany.Follow Shane Goldmacher on Twitter: @ShaneGoldmacherAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Experts Doubt Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Plan Will Boost Economy", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe budget model\u2019s forecasts draw on a wide range of economic literature that finds federal grant programs, similar to the ones Mr. Trump proposes to employ for infrastructure, often do little to encourage states and localities to spend more than they would have otherwise in the intended area. Instead, states often claim federal money to fund existing plans, and then free up state funds for other, unrelated spending, said Kent Smetters, an economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and now directs the budget model.\u201cWhen we reviewed the literature,\u201d he said, \u201cthere just really is no set of studies that support that massive multiplier effect, where you can get $1.5 trillion.\u201dThe administration disagrees and says that the $200 billion in federal spending, combined with quicker permitting that allow projects to get started fast, will incentivize a wave of projects. Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of transportation, said this month that a goal of the administration\u2019s plan is \u201cto use federal dollars as seed money to encourage infrastructure investment by the states, localities and the private sector.\u201d\u201cWe all want better infrastructure,\u201d she said at a White House news briefing.\u201cBut unfortunately, there\u2019s just not enough money in the world to pay for all the infrastructure, which is why\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s plan also puts an emphasis on the private sector, Ms. Chao said.The White House has indicated it is open to some type of dedicated funding stream, such as user fees like tolls or a new type of tax, such as a gas tax, to help finance projects, though it has yet to officially propose such a plan.The Economic Report of the President, which was released Wednesday, said that \u201cadditional resources can be secured for infrastructure investment, turning to some combination of user charges, specific taxes or general tax revenues.\u201dDemocrats have criticized the administration\u2019s proposal for the size of its federal investment and its lack of a dedicated funding stream, such as a tax increase, to support it. They have warned that the reliance on private spending could lead to high user fees, such as tolls, on new projects.On Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that \u201cIf we ever needed proof that Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan is made out of thin air and would create Trump tolls, Trump tolls and more Trump tolls across the country, this independent study is it.\u201dThe administration has consistently been more optimistic than outside analysts in forecasting the economic effects of his proposals. The Council of Economic Advisers projected this week that the $1.5 trillion tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law last year would boost the economy by 2 percent to 4 percent, a much higher rate of growth than independent analyses have found. Top administration officials said this fall that faster growth from Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies, including the infrastructure plan and tax cuts, would generate enough additional tax revenue to more than offset any increase to the federal budget deficit from the tax cuts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Prominent Republican Donor Issues Ultimatum on Assault Weapons", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA prominent Republican political donor demanded on Saturday that the party pass legislation to restrict access to guns, and vowed not to contribute to any candidates or electioneering groups that did not support a ban on the sale of military-style firearms to civilians.Al Hoffman Jr., a Florida-based real estate developer who was a leading fund-raiser for George W. Bush\u2019s campaigns, said he would seek to marshal support among other Republican political donors for a renewed assault weapons ban.\u201cFor how many years now have we been doing this \u2014 having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings \u2014 and how many years has it been that nothing\u2019s been done?\u201d Mr. Hoffman said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the road for me.\u201dMr. Hoffman announced his ultimatum in an email to half a dozen Republican leaders, including Jeb Bush and Gov. Rick Scott of Florida. He wrote in the email that he would not give money to Mr. Scott, who is considering a campaign for the Senate in 2018, or other Florida Republicans he has backed in the past, including Representative Brian Mast, if they did not support new gun legislation.\u201cI will not write another check unless they all support a ban on assault weapons,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEnough is enough!\u201dMr. Hoffman, a former ambassador to Portugal, has donated millions to Republican candidates and causes over the years, including more than $1 million to Right to Rise, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that supported Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016.A critic of President Trump, Mr. Hoffman has continued to donate heavily to other Republicans.Alluding to past mass killings, Mr. Hoffman argued in his email that future gun massacres were inevitable without government intervention: \u201cIf we go from Orlando to Las Vegas, and now Parkland, you just have to know that there are others around the country just dreaming about staging another mass murder.\u201dA previous federal assault weapons ban, enacted in 1994 under a Democratic president and Congress, lapsed in 2004 while Republicans had full control of Washington.One of the recipients of Mr. Hoffman\u2019s Saturday message, Mel Sembler, another former ambassador and ally of the Bush family, suggested he did not intend to join the proposed donation boycott. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on getting into this debate,\u201d Mr. Sembler, who also lives in Florida, said in a brief email.Peter S. Rummell, a Jacksonville-based donor who gave $125,000 to Jeb Bush\u2019s \u201csuper PAC\u201d in 2016, said he was on board with Mr. Hoffman\u2019s plan and would only contribute to candidates supportive of banning assault weapons. He said the Parkland shooting was a turning point: \u201cIt has to start somewhere,\u201d Mr. Rummell said, of controlling guns.Even on its own, Mr. Hoffman\u2019s money will be missed: He contributed heavily to Republican congressional candidates in 2016 and gave $25,000 last spring to the Senate Leadership Fund, a group backed by Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, that is focused on defending Republicans\u2019 Senate majority.He said he would close his checkbook to that group and others like it, and would encourage others to do the same in the absence of action on guns. Mr. Hoffman said he would also be open to backing fiscally conservative Democrats who favor certain gun restrictions.\u201cI\u2019m going to email every single donor I know in the Republican Party and try to get them on board,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to start a little movement here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of students killed in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

{"Headline": "The Era of Easy Money Is Ending, and the World Is Bracing for Shocks", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe worst that could happen, the money masters averred, was that investors would be lulled into reckless investments, taking on too much risk in the belief that the dangers of the marketplace had been tamed.As it turns out, the dangers were already at work. A decade-long era of easy access to money engineered by central banks in Asia, Europe and the United States was ending, opening a new chapter in which corporations would have to pay more to borrow and ordinary people would have to pay more to finance homes, cars and other purchases.To digest the wild swings in stocks and bonds from New York to London to Tokyo is to absorb this uncomfortable realization taking hold.Investors concluded that interest rates would rise faster than they had anticipated, almost certainly in the United States, and perhaps eventually in Europe and Asia, too. They yanked their treasure out of stocks and entrusted it to safer repositories of wealth like bonds and cash.No degree in finance was required to divine the lesson of the moment: Markets go down as well as up, a reality often drowned out by the euphoric celebrations to greet one record or another being shattered.While trading in the United States was clearly the initial source of alarm, the concerns spread to everywhere that money changes hands. The American economy had swapped the frivolity of a stock market party for the grim trappings of a bedside vigil. The result was gloom and anxiety in every reach of the financial sphere.\u201cThe United States is by some distance the largest market on earth,\u201d said Gaurav Saroliya, director of global macro strategy at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cGrowth in the United States has a huge bearing on economies everywhere. If the largest market is selling off, that has a very powerful effect on investment sentiment. It makes people risk averse.\u201dThe fear that seized the United States was the spawn of good times. As the feeling sank in that stock trading was governed by a surplus of exuberance, the odds increased that the Federal Reserve would dampen the festivities by lifting interest rates faster than policymakers had previously telegraphed.Not for nothing, central banks are seen by investors as crucial yet fun-averse grown-ups charged with solemnly watching for trouble. When crises emerge, they make money available to spur commerce while keeping terror at bay. The global economic expansion underway now is in large part a product of the Fed\u2019s swiftly unleashing an overwhelming surge of credit after the start of the financial crisis in 2008, combined with the slower yet, eventually, effective torrent of cash delivered by the European Central Bank.But when the party gets raging \u2014 when economies accelerate and stock prices ascend to levels out of whack with fundamentals \u2014 central bankers play killjoy, lifting interest rates to snuff out attendant dangers.Higher rates diminish speculation that can end badly by making credit more expensive. They slow economic growth while making stocks less appealing, because corporations must pay more to keep up with their debts. Investors can make more just by keeping their holdings in cash or bonds, rather than by accepting the higher risk of stocks.Then, last Friday, the latest monthly snapshot of the American labor market revealed that wages had climbed 2.9 percent in January compared with a year earlier. The tight job market was forcing employers to pay more.This appeared to presage a strengthening of American consumer power. If more working people take home more money, they will presumably be more inclined to buy houses and cars, generating jobs in construction and at auto plants from Michigan to South Carolina. They will fill restaurants, necessitating more truck drivers to ferry the food, and more mechanics to keep the trucks running.This same so-called virtuous cycle appeared to be amplifying global growth. More cars made in the United States would require more brake linings made in Mexico and more circuitry forged in China, using copper mined in Chile. More construction would require equipment from Germany and Japan, and more iron ore from Brazil to make steel.This interconnectivity has been central to the anticipation that a strengthening economy in the United States would lift fortunes around the world.But the increase in wages for American workers meant something else. It was a flashing warning to investors about potential inflation, or rising prices, which have crippled many economies. The Fed, always vigilant, wields a standard tool for snuffing out inflation if necessary: higher interest rates.This is how a positive jobs report, presumably a sign of a strengthening American economy, wound up as the impetus for the dumping of stocks from Taipei to Toronto. It enhanced the likelihood that the Fed would raise rates faster. It prompted investors to wonder how long the European Central Bank could maintain its own ultralow rates.In the past year, Europe has shaken off perpetual worries of a grinding decline to emerge as one of the faster-growing major economies on earth. Inflation remains weak in Europe, undergirding expectations that the central bank will be slow to take back its free money.But if the Fed were to lift rates faster, that could prompt Europe and perhaps even Japan to follow suit. Otherwise, the United States would be in a position to capture an outsize share of global investment, as rates presumably rise on American government bonds.Mario Draghi, the Italian who heads the European Central Bank, is scheduled to complete his eight-year term late next year. At the Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s term as governor expires in April, and there is uncertainty over whether he will be reappointed.Some economists think that the dour talk is overblown and that the stock markets are running on emotion untethered from economic reality, a narrative that gained force as markets in New York snapped back from the depths on Tuesday.The fundamentals of the United States expansion remain intact. Rising wages should indeed give people money to spend without resorting to some newfangled credit bubble that ends tragically.Whatever the interest rates, central banks retain trillions of dollars on their balance sheets earmarked for buying up financial assets, making credit available. And the return to higher interest rates is inevitable, a healthy turn for a world economy that can finally close the books on the global financial crisis that began a decade ago.\u201cWe have gotten used to this low interest rate environment,\u201d said Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at SEB, a global investment bank based in Stockholm. \u201cThis is not the normal situation.\u201dThe global economic expansion has occasioned hopeful talk that the world now has multiple engines of growth, inoculating it against trouble in any single region. But the events of recent days have challenged that notion, given that a sudden deterioration of stock prices on Wall Street quickly burst into a global rout.Sentiments are clearly a viral phenomenon. Yet the distress in global markets also underscores the fact that real economic fortunes are fused.If General Electric, Ford and other multinational companies see their share prices brought down as borrowing costs climb, they could limit plans for expansion. The trend would be felt in diminished orders for computer chips made in Taiwan, flat-panel displays forged in South Korea and auto parts built in the Czech Republic. It could cool demand for raw materials harvested from Argentina to India to South Africa.\u201cBusiness cycles across different markets are more correlated than they have ever been,\u201d said Mr. Saroliya, of Oxford Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s the global supply chain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Banks Urged to Take On Payday Lenders With Small, Lower-Cost Loans", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserThose who find themselves pinched for cash often turn to high-cost payday lenders. But traditional banks and credit unions could serve that role for borrowers and do it at much lower rates, according to a new proposal from the Pew Charitable Trusts.\u201cBorrowers need a better option,\u201d Alex Horowitz, senior research officer with Pew\u2019s consumer finance project, said in a call this week with reporters. Pew has done extensive research on \u201cunderbanked\u201d consumers, who often turn to payday lenders.Such borrowers, who often have poor credit, can be kept in the \u201cfinancial mainstream,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said, if traditional banks and credit unions would offer small installment loans with safeguards that would protect both the banks and the borrower. Payday borrowers typically have checking accounts \u2014 they must show regular deposits as collateral for the loans \u2014 and many say they would prefer to borrow from their own bank if they could qualify, Mr. Horowitz said. (Some banks do offer small personal loans already, but generally to borrowers with good credit.)The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a regulation last fall that allows banks and credit unions to issue such loans. Whether banks will actually propose to offer them remains to be seen. But Mr. Horowitz said that regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, now appear to be more receptive to the idea.Under Pew\u2019s guidelines, small bank loans should have payments of no more than 5 percent of a borrower\u2019s paycheck, payments should not be allowed to cause overdraft fees, and annual percentage rates should be no more than \u201ctwo digits\u201d \u2014 not the triple-digit rates offered by payday lenders. \u201cA.P.R.s with three digits are unnecessary for profitability,\u201d Mr. Horowitz said.To make such loans workable for borrowers and profitable for banks, underwriting \u2014 the review that borrowers undergo to determine if they qualify for a loan \u2014 should be automated, the report said. That means banks would mainly make the loans through online and mobile banking applications, and may need to factor in criteria other than traditional credit scores. For instance, banks might consider the length of the customer\u2019s relationship with the bank and the frequency of the customer\u2019s deposits.Speed is crucial, Mr. Horowitz said, because unless the loans are available quickly and easily, borrowers will go elsewhere, since they typically seek payday loans when they are in distress. \u201cBorrowers will choose payday loans,\u201d he said, \u201cif banks aren\u2019t fast.\u201dBanks are in a good position to offer such loans, if regulators approve, Pew suggested. The average payday loan customer borrows $375 over five months and pays $520 in fees, while banks and credit unions could profitably offer the same amount over the same period for less than $100.Pew said certain components of its proposal, including the 5 percent payment cap, had been supported in the past in public comments by several banking groups.\u201cMany people want and rely on small-dollar credit, and banks are eager to expand their offerings of trusted and responsible services to these borrowers,\u201d said Virginia O\u2019Neill, senior vice president of the American Bankers Association\u2019s center for regulatory compliance.Alexander Monterrubio, director of regulatory affairs for the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, said his organization supported more options for its membership base, \u201cincluding responsible small-dollar lending options.\u201dA spokesman for one large bank, Fifth Third, said in an email that \u201cwe believe banks need to be able to meet their customers\u2019 short-term, small-dollar\u201d needs.Here are some questions and answers about small installment loans:Didn\u2019t banks try something like this before?Some banks offered \u201cdeposit advances\u201d before regulators halted them in 2013. The advances were due in a lump sum on the borrower\u2019s next payday, often at a fee of 10 percent per pay period, or an annual percentage rate of 260 percent. Pew said it opposed allowing banks to offer such \u201cunaffordable\u201d advances again.What sort of fees might banks charge for small installment loans?According to Pew, 70 percent of Americans said they would look favorably on their bank or credit union if it offered a $400, three-month loan for $60, and 80 percent said they believed such a loan would be fair.Where can I get a small loan now if my credit isn\u2019t great but I don\u2019t want to use a payday lender?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cancer Researcher Takes Cancer Personally", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving With CancerOngoing breakthroughs in cancer care involve personalized medicine, we are often informed. Because every malignancy is unique in terms of its genetics and genomics, one size (or protocol) cannot fit all.As a cancer patient whose life has been extended by an experimental drug, I was curious about Dr. Blau\u2019s approach. By what methods can medical practices be tailor-made? And how do scientists find the ways and means to extend analyses of individual cases to a significant aggregate of patients?Whereas patients conventionally receive treatment options from an oncologist, Dr. Blau\u2019s strategy is to help patients learn about treatment decisions and consequences from other patients and from a number of experts whose ideas could then be explored with an oncologist.Let\u2019s begin Dr. Blau\u2019s story with a romantic encounter over a pencil. In 2000, Dr. Blau, who goes by Tony, met a woman named Sibel (who had trained in Istanbul and then in Cleveland) at Seattle\u2019s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, specifically on the stem cell transplant ward. He was an attending physician; she a senior fellow. His pencil rolled under one patient\u2019s closed door; a few seconds later it rolled back out: Sibel and Tony fell in love. She became an oncologist, he a cancer researcher, and they lived so happily ever after that eventually they joined forces to investigate one of the most recalcitrant types of breast cancer.With some dismay, Dr. Blau had observed that he was better equipped to analyze the condition of his lab mice than his wife was to comprehend the state of her patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer, an incurable condition.In the lab, he had the time and expertise to analyze the data of every mouse\u2019s cancer and compare it to that of all the other mice he has studied. With human subjects, most oncologists don\u2019t have data on the evolving tumors of each individual patient and of a cohort group. Dr. Blau wanted a way to characterize the effect of various treatments on malignancies in humans at a molecular level.It brought together clinicians and researchers with nurses, geneticists, specialists in information technology, computational biologists and statisticians, not only at one hospital but globally. Each breast cancer patient would be closely monitored. There would be multiple biopsies of tumors from multiple sites on each patient \u2014 many enrolled as a last-ditch effort to help themselves and future patients \u2014 as well as DNA and RNA sequencing to produce huge databases. Hypotheses about treatment were put on the cloud; experts around the world could provide input and feedback. Dr. Blau said he discovered that most scientists appreciated the opportunity to offer their arcane knowledge to aid people in dire straits.After Dr. Blau\u2019s myeloma was diagnosed in 2015, he decided to apply this approach to himself. \u201cI had 22 biopsies of the tumor in my left pelvis, as well as bone marrow biopsies,\u201d he said, \u201cand we compared the genomic profile of the myeloma cells in my pelvic tumor with that of myeloma cells in my bone marrow.\u201d In the process, he learned about a molecular feature that kicked him out of the most favorable prognostic category.Because he still had a tiny percentage of myeloma cells in his bone marrow after an arduous autologous stem cell transplant, which uses the patient\u2019s own cells, he rejected the advice of specialists and underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, using cells from a genetically matched person. His donor, a brother and a Methodist minister, believes that he infused Dr. Blau with the Holy Spirit.Personalized medicine depends upon information technology and knowledge sharing. Since every cancer contains a singular collection of mutations that can vary significantly across patients or over time within a single patient, computational analysts map how mutations interact within a specific individual, Dr. Blau explains. When a physician reviews data about a faraway patient, that doctor may draw upon her experience \u2014 for example, with the synergy of combining three drugs in a similar case \u2014 to propose an alternative approach.Such global networking has the capacity to break down geographic and institutional barriers to communication. It also enables patients to report outcomes immediately so that protocols with deleterious side effects can be quickly changed. Patients can compare their treatment with those of others; researchers can broadcast breakthroughs. The growing database should help predict which regimens might be most effective for a particular person.Of course maintaining and extending the platform could be expensive. When I asked Dr. Blau how his for-profit company was financed, he said that the initial investment came from a house he and his wife sold three years ago. He hopes that future revenue might come from pharmaceutical companies. All4Cure could accelerate the approval of investigational drugs and provide feedback on approved drugs.Dr. Blau\u2019s enthusiasm sparks my realization that the sort of networking available to myeloma patients through All4Cure would transform the lives of the women in my gynecological cancer support group. Most of us feel only tenuously connected to an oncologist who often does not specialize in ovarian or uterine disease.It is paradoxical that personalized medicine involves crowdsourcing. You need not understand all that Dr. Blau knows about cancer to revel in his survival and to thrill at the promise of the maxim underscoring the work it makes possible: \u201cAll for one and one for all.\u201dSusan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.Advertisement"}

That was \u201cOklahoma!\u201d \u2014 in high school. Now she\u2019s playing Eliza Doolittle in \u201cMy Fair Lady.\u201dSupported byWhen the actress Lauren Ambrose arrives in the lobby at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it takes a minute to recognize that she is indeed Lauren Ambrose. A wide-brimmed hat hides her flaring hair. A wool overcoat hides the rest of her. A girlish, clean-scrubbed face peeks out in between.That half-hidden face will soon be more visible and a lot dirtier when \u201cMy Fair Lady,\u201d the 1956 Lerner and Loewe musical, begins previews on March 15 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. Ms. Ambrose, who has been peripheral to the public eye for a few years now, will play Eliza Doolittle, the pert cockney flower seller who transforms her life through sheer force of will and correct vowel placement.\u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d is not exactly antique, but it hasn\u2019t had a Broadway revival in 25 years, and when the director Bartlett Sher cast Ms. Ambrose as his Eliza the choice surprised many. To begin with, Eliza is one of the great parts for an ing\u00e9nue. And Ms. Ambrose, 40, is not exactly an ing\u00e9nue.That\u2019s all true. This is also true: Ms. Ambrose has one previous musical theater credit, as Ado Annie in \u201cOklahoma!\u201d In high school.If you\u2019re wondering why Ms. Ambrose, older and differently credentialed than a typical Eliza, should vault ahead, Mr. Sher put it simply. \u201cThere is no better actress working in New York right now,\u201d he said.Still that lack of experience could be a worry. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to start listing worries it\u2019s going to be a long list.\u201dThen she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m actually not worried. I\u2019m super excited. It\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201dMs. Ambrose never meant to make us wait. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve been threatening to be in a musical for hundreds of years at this point,\u201d she said. She started performing early, singing in the choir of her Catholic church in New Haven.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was about me,\u201d Ms. Ambrose said. That\u2019s mostly true. As Mr. Sher said, speaking by telephone, in a season already packed with revivals, the investors \u201ccouldn\u2019t really pull together the amount of money they needed.\u201dWould a flashier name have made a difference in the financing? \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Sher said. \u201cYou need to have a big, giant star to carry those things in that environment.\u201d But he didn\u2019t want a big, giant star. He wanted Ms. Ambrose. \u201cShe could sing it, she could act it. She had all the heart you need,\u201d he said.Why isn\u2019t Ms. Ambrose a giant? Back on \u201cStar Search,\u201d when Ed McMahon stoops down and asks her to introduce herself, she gives a heart-cracking smile and says, \u201cI hope to someday be a great actress and a wonderful performer.\u201dIt happened. The great actress part. The wonderful performer part. But Ms. Ambrose, who long ago traded Hollywood for a semirural cottage, has always skirted celebrity.Early on there were a few attempts to mold her into a starlet, \u201cnarcissism boot camp,\u201d she called it. But she never really went along with it; years ago an agent snapped at her about \u201cnot playing the game,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always just been more of an actor,\u201d she said.Other actors build brands and shore up celebrity with glossy magazine shoots, social media posts, sponsorships. She doesn\u2019t. Not that she judges anyone who does. \u201cFor real. You might be seeing me on Instagram, holding a mayonnaise jar, in like 10 minutes,\u201d she said.She rarely gives interviews. But after hiring some personal publicists \u201cto curate how it\u2019s done in a way that feels O.K. to me,\u201d she agreed to this conversation \u201cbecause I\u2019m proud of this opportunity and excited and I have to do a bunch of stuff anyway for Lincoln Center.\u201d Still, she apologized a couple of times for giving me \u201cnothing to write about.\u201d Once, she unconsciously pushed the recorders away.You can plot Ms. Ambrose\u2019s ambivalence on a map. When \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d ended in 2005, \u201csomebody with a brain might\u2019ve continued on in California to further one\u2019s career,\u201d she said. But she moved to New York to do theater. And then a few years after that she moved to what she calls \u201cthe woods.\u201d The Berkshires? \u201cThe woods,\u201d she repeated. \u201cCould be any woods.\u201dShe lives there with her husband, the filmmaker Sam Handel, a son, 11, and a daughter, 5. She and Mr. Handel met \u201cat a wrap party for a film neither of us had worked on\u201d and they married a year later, when Ms. Ambrose was 23. They have matching tattoos, undulating scripts of \u201cNot Alone\u201d inked inside their wrists.He has been a stabilizing force while Ms. Ambrose has tried to make a life in acting, \u201cthis difficult, impossible, groundless, shifting thing,\u201d she said. The woods offer more stability, though \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d has meant temporarily resettlement on the Upper West Side. \u201cBasically we\u2019re counting it as a big family adventure,\u201d she said.Last fall, Mr. Sher invited her into the city to audition for Eliza after he already considered \u201clots and lots and lots and lots of people,\u201d he said, many of them prominent musical comedy stars. (No, he didn\u2019t name names.)The day that she came in \u201cwas kind of a runoff. A little bit of its own reality show in the making,\u201d he said. Ms. Ambrose won. \u201cI don\u2019t want to create expectations that are too out of control,\u201d he said. But then he called her funny and glamorous and furious and wild.Eliza is described in the script as \u201cperhaps eighteen, perhaps twenty, hardly older,\u201d but as Ms. Ambrose said, \u201c I think that the story of a woman who is coming into her powers can really happen at any age.\u201d (Besides, Mrs. Patrick Campbell, for whom Shaw created the role, was nearly 50 when she played it. So there.)In the months before rehearsals started, Ms. Ambrose threw herself into research \u2014 about Shaw, about Lerner and Loewe, about the flower girls of Tottenham Court Road, putting their pictures on her phone, a swipe away from that chicken.\u201cThat should actually be our goal while we\u2019re here,\u201d she said, eating a granola bar she\u2019d filched from her kids.The Renoir, painted in 1914 when the artist was so infirm that he had to strap his brushes to his hand, wasn\u2019t going to change anyone\u2019s life, but that didn\u2019t really matter. Though Ms. Ambrose is rigorous in her research, to prepare for her roles she mostly looks inward. Acting has elements of magic for her, of ritual. She thinks that every job \u201cthat the universe places in my hands\u201d has something to teach her and so she gives over her dream life to it, most of her waking life, too.On \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d she and Claire learned how to be artists together. \u201cShe never had a false note,\u201d Alan Ball, the show\u2019s creator said. When she played Juliet, her baby son fired her love for Romeo and the play became a way \u201cto channel all of the possibly overwhelming emotions of new motherhood,\u201d she said.Not that Ms. Ambrose works by simple substitution. This isn\u2019t algebra. Oskar Eustis, who directed her in \u201cHamlet,\u201d described her work as \u201calways harrowing. She will happily scare you and scare herself.\u201dAt the museum that morning, at dinner a week later, she was still discovering what the role would teach her, what kind of Eliza she would be. She wasn\u2019t alone. Mr. Sher said that he is still working out the central relationships. Even the poster for the show has Eliza\u2019s face a blank.\u201cI\u2019m fighting for the dignity of the character,\u201d she said. She sees the Eliza as \u201ca powerful person and an actualized person,\u201d a hero.On a rainy Saturday morning, she and Mr. Hadden-Paton were rehearsing the scene where Eliza arrives at Higgins\u2019s home and demands lessons while Higgins insults her. Script in hand, tie-dyed skirt swishing, Ms. Ambrose\u2019s shrieking Eliza wasn\u2019t yet actualized. She was angry and scared and crushingly brave. A woman determined to change her life.The role could change Ms. Ambrose\u2019s life, though it\u2019s too soon to know just how. Maybe it will give her the kind of celebrity she\u2019s never entirely wanted. Maybe it will make her a Broadway regular. Maybe it will send her back to the woods more in command of her chickens and her powers. The universe hasn\u2019t told her yet. \u201cThe best is when it\u2019s a real surprise,\u201d Ms. Ambrose said.An earlier version of this article misidentified Lauren Ambrose\u2019s Broadway debut. It was her 2006 performance in Clifford Odets\u2019s \u201cAwake and Sing!\u201d at the Belasco Theater, not her 2009 performance in in Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco\u2019s \u201cExit the King\u201d at the Ethel Barrymore Theater.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korean Court Sentences Ex-President\u2019s Confidante to 20 Years", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a ruling on Tuesday, a three-judge panel at Seoul Central District Court convicted her on all of those charges, although it said that the bribes totaled $21 million, less than prosecutors claimed.\u201cHer extensive meddling in state affairs created chaos and eventually led to the unprecedented impeachment of the president,\u201d the panel said of Ms. Choi in its verdict.Mr. Lee was released from prison this month, after an appeals court convicted him on bribery charges but suspended his prison sentence. Many South Koreans saw that decision as the latest example of the judiciary\u2019s soft-glove treatment of tycoons found guilty of serious crimes.After Mr. Park\u2019s assassination in 1979, Ms. Choi became an adviser and friend to Ms. Park, who had begun living a life of seclusion. Few South Koreans had heard of Ms. Choi until after Ms. Park was elected in 2012, but as the corruption scandal grew, rumors spread that Ms. Choi was an occult figure who held the president in thrall. Prosecutors never accused her of engaging in occult practices, but they said she manipulated government affairs from behind the scenes and for personal gain.The scandal began in 2016, when students at a prestigious Seoul university alleged that Ms. Choi had used her influence with Ms. Park to force the school to admit her daughter, despite a lack of qualifications. (It would later emerge that some of the money Ms. Choi secured from South Korean businesses went to finance her daughter\u2019s equestrian career.)The scandal rekindled longstanding public anger over the extensive ties between government and corporations in South Korea. Ms. Park tearfully apologized to the public, cutting ties with Ms. Choi and insisting that she was not aware of her activities.Ms. Choi has remained loyal to Ms. Park, insisting that both were innocent. Both have also argued that they were victims of a politically motivated investigation. But prosecutors called them criminal conspirators, an argument that the court endorsed on Tuesday.\u201cWe are speechless,\u201d Lee Kyung-jae, Ms. Choi\u2019s lawyer, said, adding that she would appeal.Ms. Park, who has been in custody since March, is being tried separately on 18 criminal charges, including bribery, coercion and abuse of office. She still has loyal followers, who rally in central Seoul calling for her release. On her 66th birthday this month, they placed a large cake in front of the prison where she is being held.The judges handling Ms. Choi\u2019s case on Tuesday, however, said that Mr. Lee had indeed paid $6.7 million in bribes. That information is likely to come before the Supreme Court, which now has Mr. Lee\u2019s case.Mr. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and the third-generation scion of the family that runs the Samsung conglomerate, has denied the charges against him, saying that Samsung was coerced into contributing to support Ms. Choi\u2019s foundations and her daughter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Literary Road Trip Into the Heart of Russia", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "FeatureIn the land of Tolstoy, Turgenev and now Putin, what are the stories Russians are telling themselves?Supported byRussia is still an enigmatic country to me. Every day there is news from Russia \u2014 we hear about Putin, about his imprisoned dissidents, about his meddling in the elections of his rivals \u2014 all of it serving the notion that \u201cRussia\u201d is a singular, comprehensible, clear-cut entity. But what do the people who live inside of that entity think? What is \u201cRussia\u201d to them, what are the stories they tell themselves? A hundred years after the revolution, 25 years after the fall of Communism?For years, I have wanted to see Russia with my own eyes, to meet some of the people who live inside of that entity, to find out what they think it means to be Russian. That is why, early one morning in October, I found myself driving from Moscow to Ivan Turgenev\u2019s estate, accompanied by a photographer and a translator. If I wanted to see what life in Russia was like, unfiltered by news stories, I couldn\u2019t think of any better place to start than Turgenev\u2019s world, the countryside that formed the setting for his first book, \u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches.\u201dPublished in 1852, \u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d is a collection of simple stories about a hunter\u2019s encounters as he wanders around the woods. There is nothing here of Dostoyevsky\u2019s psychological and emotional savagery and depth, nor of Tolstoy\u2019s epic complexity or his ability to encapsulate an entire society with a few strokes; these stories are in all ways modest, aimless even. A man strolls through the forest with a shotgun over his shoulder, he exchanges a few words with someone he happens to meet, possibly shoots a bird or two, possibly spends the night in a barn on the way home \u2014 and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the whole story. And yet the book numbers among the greatest works of world literature, largely because Turgenev gets so close to the world he is describing, the Russian society of the 1840s. His characters and descriptions do not lead to anything beyond themselves, they are not in themselves part of a greater sequence of events, they stand apart from everything \u2014 except the specific time and the place. And it is from there that we experience the world.The landscape we drove through was flat and monotonous, the sky a pale gray. Sometimes we would pass a rundown gas station, sometimes a small town would come into view, sometimes the forest would open up into fields. Then, among all the trees, a little park suddenly turned up on the right. I saw a black wall and a flame burning.\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I said.\u201cIt\u2019s just a war memorial,\u201d the translator said. Her name was Oksana Brown; she was a young Russian news producer who sometimes worked as a fixer.\u201cOh, no, this is perfect. I want to see it,\u201d I said.\u201cThere are monuments like this in just about every town in Russia,\u201d she said, not seeming to understand why I wanted to stop here of all places.The photographer, Lynsey Addario, walked around the little park taking photos on her own while Brown and I stood in front of the black marble wall and watched the flame fluttering in the breeze. To our right, another wall, etched with portraits of soldiers, stood next to a green-painted cannon, its barrel pointing at the gray sky.\u201cWhat does the inscription say?\u201d I asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Your name is unknown, but your heroic deed is immortal,\u2019\u2009\u201d Brown said. \u201c\u2009\u2018Eternal honor to the heroes who lost their lives in the fight for the freedom and independence of our homeland during the Great Patriotic War.\u2019\u2009\u201dOnly Westerners, she explained, referred to it as the Second World War.As we pulled out onto the road again, I thought about how affecting the simple flame of the memorial had been. It had rendered the forest ancient, and on the dead soldiers it had conferred a sort of immortality, drawing them into the eternal ranks of the fallen. In reality, death was small and dirty, nothing to aspire to, nothing to celebrate. But with the aid of this memorial, death had been elevated from the real world into the ideal. The flame was the agent of this elevation; it was bound to grimy materiality but reached up into the pure ether; it moved as if alive, but it was dead.So Turgenev hadn\u2019t exaggerated the beauties of his childhood world, I thought. Because this was definitely his world that we had come to, this was the countryside that he had ridden through as a young man and later described in \u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d \u2014 and it was only half an hour later that we turned off the highway and drove along a bumpy country road that brought us first to a village, then to a large enclosed estate with a parking lot and various small office buildings.There was no one around, and it was very quiet. The clouds hung low in the sky; the air was heavy with moisture and seemed to stop all sound in midflight. In one corner stood a stone chapel, the feet of its walls thick with mildew, and about a hundred yards farther on lay what had to be the main house. I was expecting something grand and monumental, something like an English stately home, because the Turgenevs were a noble family, but this was a low, wooden house, painted violet and covered in intricate carvings.It aroused no feelings, no breath of history.I tried to picture Turgenev coming through the door and striding across to where we stood, but it was impossible to associate him with us, then with now.We followed a young, bearded and bespectacled guide who explained that most of the original buildings had been destroyed: These were exact replicas. Some objects from the writer\u2019s home, though, were exhibited in the rooms of the house next door to the main building. There were tables and chairs, pictures and knickknacks, shelves lined with books. But even though these things were authentic, they did not speak; they simply sat there mutely, presenting the past.The only items that held any real interest were the gun, powder pouch and game bag that Turgenev used on his hunting trips. They made me think of Ernest Hemingway, who was inspired by Turgenev\u2019s hunting sketches when writing \u201cThe Nick Adams Stories,\u201d of how he strove to achieve that same effortless intensity, and may even have done so, but never quite matched Turgenev\u2019s receptiveness to the world, because he himself stood in the way of it. And there was a sofa that Tolstoy had sat on; not only were these two great writers contemporaries, they lived only hours away from each other. At first they were great friends, but Tolstoy gradually grew to hate Turgenev and even went so far as to challenge him to a duel. Turgenev observed the peasants but did not become as directly involved in their lives as Tolstoy, who delved deeper and deeper into his search for the essence of the Russian soul, not only practicing the principles of simplicity and poverty but also holding them up as the ideal for all.We walked into the great park outside, where rows of trees ran straight and long until they met the disorderly forest. There was no one there but us. The damp, chill air hung motionless between the tree trunks.\u201cAre there always so few people here?\u201d I asked the guide.He shook his head vigorously.\u201cNo, not at all. It\u2019s usually swarming with schoolchildren, they come here from all over Russia. And next year is the bicentennial of Turgenev\u2019s birth. That\u2019s why we\u2019re renovating the place. We\u2019ll have lots of visitors then. But today\u2019s Monday, and it\u2019s October. ...\u201dHe stopped beside a tall tree with a low fence around it.\u201cThis oak tree was planted by Turgenev himself,\u201d he said.To the right of the tree stood what looked like gravestones.\u201cWhat are those?\u201d I asked, pointing to them.\u201cThose are the graves of soldiers,\u201d the guide told me.\u201cHere?\u201d\u201cYes. They were fighting the Germans during the war, and they fell here.\u201dWhen we drove away shortly afterward, it was the image of those graves that stayed with me, maybe because the violence they represented had seemed so unexpected there, in the isolated world of the museum. That and the two horses we saw lying in the grass, a mare and her foal, black and glossily beautiful in the moist air.These depictions of the Russian peasantry in the 19th century as backward and primitive are not untrue, but they are viewed from a very great distance and are extremely generalized. Distance, of course, is necessary; it is the historian\u2019s aid to understanding and explaining social development, just as it is the politician\u2019s aid to dealing with social problems. But a similar distance is what allowed the Bolsheviks to destroy the structure of their society without a thought for the hundreds of thousands and, eventually, millions who died in the process, because these were not real people, only \u201cpeasants,\u201d viewed from so high above that all individuality was erased. And if the overall statistics improved \u2014 well, then it had all been worth it.\u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d shows the culture Trotsky and Figes describe, but from the inside, with no distance. One of the best stories in the book is about a man returning from the hunt who loses his way and then, in the darkness, spies two fires burning in a field far below him. It turns out that a group of boys are camped out, minding the horses. They lie around the fires, telling stories to pass the time, most of them tales of supernatural occurrences. Turgenev brings these boys to life, each with his own distinct appearance and personality, and there is something deeply moving about the way he portrays them; he takes them so seriously, according them dignity, and the stories they tell one another, there in the night, are in themselves incandescent. This is not the superstitious, reactionary peasant class of the revolutionaries and the historians; these are five boys, each with a life of his own, woven from the threads of their language, their culture and the camaraderie of their campfire.\u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d was by no means a political statement, yet it had great political impact in Russia in the 1850s, possibly precisely because, lacking a political or literary agenda, it showed life for what it was and not for what it symbolized.At that time, serfdom still prevailed in Russia, which is to say that the nobility not only owned the villages on their land, they also owned the peasants who lived in them. It was, in other words, a form of slavery. Turgenev\u2019s book did much to stoke the fast-growing criticism of serfdom, which was abolished nine years later, in 1861, by the progressive Czar Alexander II. He was assassinated 20 years later, his death witnessed by his son and grandson, who would become the next two czars, Alexander III and Nicholas II. It is not unreasonable to imagine that his assassination was instrumental in turning both of them into reactionary, anti-liberal autocrats, so opposed to any sort of reform and so intent on gagging all opposition that eventually revolution became inevitable.\u201cWould you like to speak to her?\u201d Addario asked from the back seat.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said.\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to take some shots of her anyway,\u201d she said.Brown and Addario got out and stepped over to the fence. Brown said something in Russian; the woman replied. Suddenly I realized that I had to speak to her, that the museum, the trees and the old books, the things I had been focusing on so far, represented nothing but my own ideas about the country I was visiting.What on earth was I getting myself into?My whole view of Russia was based on myths and romantic imagery. What kind of hubris made me believe that I would be capable of saying something about the real Russia after a nine-day trip through one tiny corner of this vast country?It was like describing a bucket of water in order to say something about the ocean.I went out and joined them by the fence.\u201cShe says she doesn\u2019t want her picture taken,\u201d Brown said.\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cShe says she\u2019s just gathering some corn for her chickens,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t her field.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d I said.It was no great crime, though \u2014 the corn had already been harvested \u2014 and after a bit of back and forth, the woman agreed to tell us about her life.\u201cAsk her where she lives,\u201d Addario said, snapping away. \u201cAsk her what she does. Ask her if she has any family.\u201dIt appeared that the woman had been born in a small village just down the road. She had moved to Moscow when she was 15 and lived there until just a few years ago when she returned to the village to take care of her mother after her father died.\u201cWhen I was a girl, there were lots of people here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a thriving, bustling community, there must have been 15 or 20 families living there,\u201d she said, pointing to the unpainted cottages farther down the road. \u201cNow they\u2019ve all moved away.\u201d\u201cHave you read Turgenev?\u201d I said.\u201cI\u2019ve read \u2018A Sportsman\u2019s Sketches.\u2019 It\u2019s set in this area.\u201d\u201cDid you like it?\u201dShe smiled for the first time.\u201cI read it to my grandchildren now.\u201d\u201cIs it different here now from the way it was when Turgenev wrote about it?\u201d\u201cThe area is the same. But life here is different. It\u2019s very different.\u201dShe then pointed us in the direction of the meadow, and we walked on. The trees lining the hill beyond it seemed to soak up the darkness. They stood there in inky silhouette against the still palely gleaming sky. There was utter silence, our footsteps the only sound.Then the cry of a bird in the distance.The past was in us, I thought, not in the world.The book, \u201cLenin the Dictator: An Intimate Portrait,\u201d by Victor Sebestyen, was intriguing. Lenin\u2019s favorite writer was always Turgenev. I found that strange, because Lenin was one of the most strong-willed men who ever lived; he was at once zealously one-sided and emotionally evasive, but nevertheless, throughout his exile, no matter where he happened to be, in Zurich, London or Paris, he made sure to have Turgenev\u2019s collected works with him.I was reading about Lenin because the places we were going to for the next seven days had been set up in part with him in mind: In just a few weeks it would be exactly 100 years since the 1917 October Revolution, when he almost single-handedly seized power in Russia. We were going to Kazan, where Lenin studied law and where he was radicalized, and then we were going to Yekaterinburg, where Czar Nicholas II and his family were executed in a cellar on Lenin\u2019s order in 1918. That act, in its ruthless brutality, marked the end of Russia\u2019s old world and the beginning of its new one. Everything in the old world would be eradicated to make way for the new; no price was too high and there would be no way back.I desperately wanted a cigarette. Brown said it was against the law to smoke on the train, but if we just bought something from the crew, a candy bar or some tea, she was sure they would be able to suggest something.After we finished our tea, I followed Brown through the carriage. Just then the conductor emerged from her little cubicle. Her face was set and solemn, grim almost. She opened the door leading to the narrow passageway between the carriages.\u201cSmoke here,\u201d she said.I stepped out onto the juddering, swaying metal platform, one side of which was open all the way down to the rails underneath, so the sound of the thundering wheels filled the tiny space. She shut the door, and I bent to light a cigarette.When I got back, we walked through to the adjoining carriage. This one was third class: completely open, with bunk beds on both sides, and it was packed with people. The feet and heads of those sleeping in the top bunks were only inches away from my face as I went by, and the fact that they lay completely uncovered made me feel that I was intruding on something private. But none of the passengers seemed to think anything of it; they acted as if they were at home in their own living rooms.Not since the 19th century could any Scandinavian railway carriage have been as crowded, I thought.We stopped in front of three women sitting chatting by a window who could have been in their late 50s. I asked Brown if she could introduce us. She did, and the three women eyed me attentively and expectantly.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked them.\u201cTo Izhevsk,\u201d one woman said. \u201cWhere they make the Kalashnikovs.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been in Moscow?\u201dThey nodded.\u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201dThey exchanged glances.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret,\u201d she said, smiling. The other two laughed.Behind me someone said something, and when I turned I saw an old man, probably in his late 70s, grab Addario\u2019s hand and kiss it.Everyone around us laughed, including Addario.The woman said something to Brown who smiled.\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\u201cShe said you\u2019re very handsome.\u201d\u201cOh, no,\u201d I said.\u201cAre you going to write that down?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d I said. \u201cBut would you ask them if we can come back later and speak to them again?\u201dThe woman who did most of the talking earlier must have given some thought to what she should say, because she started telling us about herself before I had even asked a question. Her name was Natalya. Her two friends were Olga and Zinaida. She told us that she was brought up in an orphanage, that she could not remember her parents, but that she had a sister from whom she had been separated and whom she never saw again. She had been searching for her sister all her life but still didn\u2019t know where she was.\u201cIn those days, it was standard practice to split up siblings when they were taken into care,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t do that anymore, but that was the system back then. She was sent to another home. When I grew up, I went back and got a job in the same home, I thought I might be able to steal her file and find out where she was. But I didn\u2019t find anything. So now I\u2019ve written to the producers of a state television program, which helps to reunite people with lost family members, and I\u2019m waiting to hear from them. I\u2019m hopeful!\u201d\u201cWhen did you write to them?\u201d\u201cTwo years ago.\u201dIt must have occurred to her as she said this that it didn\u2019t actually sound very hopeful, because she looked at me and added: \u201cIt can be difficult to trace people, even for their reporters. Sometimes it can take as many as five years.\u201dThe steady, rhythmic rumble of the train wheels over the railroad ties reverberated through the carriage. Now and again the walls were buffeted by a shift in the air pressure outside, and each time the door next to us was opened, all the sounds of the train would suddenly rise to an infernal cacophony of rattling and banging and hissing as the air from the gap between the carriages swept in.Natalya started to talk about her Christian faith. She had visited Israel the previous year to see the spot where Jesus was crucified.\u201cI once prayed for another woman to have a baby,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd she did. For myself I prayed for a husband. And then I met this wonderful man!\u201dThe others laughed.As the stream of Russian flowed easily, almost dreamily back and forth in the sleep-drenched compartment, I caught the word \u201cPutin.\u201d\u201cDid she say something about Putin?\u201d I asked Brown.\u201cYes, yes. She says her mother is a great fan of Putin. They\u2019re all fans of Putin.\u201d\u201cWe love our homeland,\u201d Natalya said. \u201cAnd for the first time we have a Christian president, an Orthodox president.\u201dShe flipped over a magazine that was on the table to show us the cover. All the photos on it were of Putin. In one of them, he was stripped to the waist.\u201cDo you see that? Could Trump show off his body like that? He\u2019s old. His body is just a lump of lard!\u201dAll three laughed loudly.\u201cIt\u2019s now a hundred years since the revolution. What does that mean to you?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t care about it,\u201d Natalya said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hundred godless years. They tore down all the churches. They\u2019re being rebuilt now, and we can go there without being afraid. Here in this city, there\u2019s an icon of the Virgin Mary. It\u2019s very, very old. When it was found, it was completely black. Now it\u2019s gradually getting lighter. With every year that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer.\u201dWhen the interview was over, I headed down the corridor to the tiny space between the carriages for a smoke. As I opened the door I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked around. It was the young, grim-faced conductor.\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said wagging her finger at me. \u201cNo smoking anymore.\u201dWhat the hell?I returned to our compartment and sat down by the window. In the bunks across from me, Addario and Brown had turned in for the night. About an hour later, the train stopped, and I peeped out of the window. It was pitch-black out there, no station to be seen. I got up and went to investigate. I opened the door onto the space between the carriages, and there was the conductor, puffing on a cigarette.\u201cAha!\u201d I felt like saying. \u201cGotcha!\u201dInstead, I locked eyes with her for a second, just long enough to let her know that I knew, then I closed the door and went back to my compartment.What sort of city was Kazan?The neighborhood in which I found myself was modern and well maintained. The magnificent mosque, which I had seen from my hotel window when I woke, was brand new. When I went out for a walk, even the old wooden kiosk I stood and stared at, which was octagonal with a green metal dome and a little spire on the top, looked freshly renovated, more like a reconstruction of the past than a symbol of it.Kazan, the capital of Tatarstan, is also the city where Lenin studied law and was expelled from the university. His father was an official in the czarist Civil Service, and the young Lenin\u2019s life revolved around school, literature and chess, which he played at a high level. Then two things happened that changed everything. First, his father, only 54, died suddenly from a stroke. And second, his brother Alexander, whom he idolized, was executed for conspiring to kill the czar.Alexander was studying natural sciences at Petersburg University when he became involved with a revolutionary student cell. To help finance the plot, he sold a gold medal he had been awarded for his academic work. Lenin had known nothing about his brother\u2019s revolutionary activities, and until then he had been totally uninterested in politics. His brother\u2019s execution changed all that. Not only did he immediately join a revolutionary cell at the university in Kazan but, as Sebestyen describes it in his Lenin biography, his whole personality was transformed. The happiness and high spirits of his early teens vanished, leaving behind a determined, withdrawn, highly disciplined, single-minded young man. It seems as though, from the moment he was expelled, Lenin never looked back: He spent the rest of his life working for the revolution, a revolution that he could not be sure would ever actually happen.And when it did finally come, he forced it to follow his line. The Bolsheviks were atheists, and religion was expunged from the whole of the new Russian state. For three generations, religion was repressed, until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, when it returned with a vengeance. That was very visible in Kazan. There are nearly 200 national and ethnic minorities in Russia. The largest of these are the Tatars, who make up roughly 4 percent of the population. Most of them practice Islam, and Kazan had, therefore, one of the largest Muslim communities of any city in Russia.That evening I parked our rental car by the curb across the road from the National Museum of the Republic of Tatarstan. It was 6 o\u2019clock, and we were there to pick up a young woman named Dina Khabibullina, a Tatar and a practicing Muslim. We had met her earlier that day and talked about what it was like to belong to a religious and cultural minority in Russia, and she invited us to her apartment for dinner.Dina was 29, we learned, and a postdoc at the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Tatarstan. She also worked at the museum and organized tours to local Tatar attractions. She was six months pregnant.She was brought up as a non-Muslim, in a home in which the Tatar culture was scarcely detectable and where they mainly spoke Russian. When she was 19, she had a sudden awakening. She converted to Islam and taught herself Tatar. So did many of her friends.Had religion always been there, buried deep in the society, merely biding its time? Did it fulfill such a powerful need in people that it was simply indestructible?\u201cWhat made you turn to the faith?\u201d I asked her.\u201cI was 19, and my father had died,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question arose as to whether he should be buried according to proper Muslim practice. At that moment I understood that there is an explanation for everything. I asked myself what I could do for him after his death. And in the teachings of Islam, it is clearly written: You must give alms to the poor, perform the hajj and slaughter a he-goat.\u201dDina\u2019s apartment complex appeared to date from the 1950s. The brick buildings, along narrow roads and surrounded by tall trees, were old and weathered but beautiful nonetheless, as buildings from bygone eras often are.She led us up the stairs to the third floor, where her son, Gizzat, who was 7, was waiting along with her husband and her mother. The boy\u2019s father, her first husband, was dead, I eventually gathered.The apartment was small, consisting of one room in which the adults and the child all slept, a tiny bathroom and a narrow kitchen. But it was warm inside, and Dina no longer seemed wary, as she had earlier that day; she was cheerful and relaxed. After saying goodbye to her mother, who was not staying for dinner, she went into the kitchen to make dinner while her husband, Damir Dolotkazin, spread a prayer mat on the living-room floor and the boy sat on the sofa bed and watched him.Damir looked as if he was in his late 20s; he was skinny, with short, dark hair and intense but gentle eyes. Barefoot, he stood in the corner of the living room and began to sing. The music, foreign to my ears, filled the room, and I was struck by the way in which it changed the whole apartment. Suddenly the mood grew solemn, but with the everyday routine \u2014 Dina cooking, her son on the sofa with his feet dangling, the toy helicopter on top of the bookcase \u2014 still present and alive.Damir knelt and bowed down. As he got to his feet again he whispered an almost silent prayer. Then he rolled up the mat, and the air of solemnity was gone as abruptly as it had come.From the kitchen, Dina called us in. She ladled a clear soup with pearls of fat, vegetables and chunks of dark meat into our bowls.The intensity I had initially seen in Damir\u2019s eyes proved to be, or turned to, enthusiasm. He ate heartily and willingly answered all my questions.\u201cHave you always been a Muslim?\u201d I asked him.\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in the army here in Kazan. I was with a security division that escorted supply troops. I was 18 at the time and a Christian.\u201d One of his army friends was a Muslim, Damir went on, and \u201che taught me what it was about. I thought it was a very strong religion. Everything is explained in its teachings, including what to do, how to act.\u201dThere was silence.\u201cThis is very good,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat sort of meat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s horse meat,\u201d Damir said.Oh, no.Oh, no, oh no.There was no choice but to carry on eating; we were their guests, and it would have been rude not to eat the food they served us.Damir must have sensed the air of misgiving that suddenly emanated from his guests, because he said:\u201cBut it was a nice horse!\u201dWe laughed.\u201cWhat do people in the West think about Russians?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs it just stereotypes?\u201d\u201cThere are some stereotypes, yes,\u201d I said, biting into a large chunk of meat while carefully avoiding breathing through my nose, a trick that had got me through many childhood meals that I found hard to swallow, like smoked haddock or smoked cod.\u201cPeople think we\u2019re barbarians. It\u2019s very sad. What the politicians say and do doesn\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with those of us who live here. There are a lot of good people here, kind souls, and bad people too, of course. When it comes to politics, nothing has really changed. The elections are a joke.\u201dAfter dinner, a large tray of Tatar cakes was placed on the table. Damir told us that he used to be a great soccer fan. But then he corrected himself.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really like the soccer. I liked the fighting.\u201d\u201cYou were a soccer hooligan?\u201d\u201cYes. I spent three years traveling to soccer matches and fighting. I had some trouble with the law back then. But I no longer have any contact with that scene. Now I read instead. I try to read 20 books a year.\u201dOnce we had eaten and felt that we couldn\u2019t take up any more of their time, we said our goodbyes and were putting on our coats in the tiny hall when he came up to me.\u201cMy sister was killed in a plane crash in 2013,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d I said, not knowing what to do with the information.He simply nodded, and we shook hands. I felt a great warmth toward him; he had told me about his life and this, one of the most important events, couldn\u2019t be left out, even if it didn\u2019t fit the rest of the conversation. The last thing I saw before the door closed behind us was the chair in the living room, over which hung a little boy\u2019s suit, a white shirt and a tie.It was beautiful, and wild too, although most of the land was cultivated. Maybe the air of wildness came from the scale, I thought, the very sense of earthly grandeur aroused as we drove along in our tiny car.After a while we stopped at a roadside diner lying out in the middle of a steppe. We all ordered soup at the counter and sat down at one of the tables. The four women working there, all white-clad, with red, hot cheeks, went back and forth between the counter and the kitchen beyond.Once we had eaten, we asked one of the waitresses if we could talk to her. She nodded uncertainly and dried her hands on her apron. She was young, in her late 20s, and she told us that this was just a temporary job; the restaurant was part of a chain, and she came in to help out when someone was sick. There was something reserved and guarded about her, and when I started asking her about Russia, she shot a glance at the others before answering.\u201cThings are better in Russia now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economy is improving, our lives are getting better and better.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d said a man over at the cash register, looking at us. \u201cThings are worse in Russia! It\u2019s all going downhill! Worse and worse!\u201dHe was big and powerfully built, with close-cropped hair and a pale, flat face.But he was smiling when he said it.\u201cNo progress,\u201d he boomed and went to sit down at a table in the center of the room. I thanked the reserved young woman, who fled into the kitchen, clearly relieved, as I walked somewhat hesitantly over to the truck driver.He looked up at me, with his spoon in his hand.\u201cWhy are you writing about Russia?\u201d he said.\u201cIn America, the image of Russia has so much to do with Putin and politics. So we\u2019ve come here to see what life outside of that is like.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you!\u201d he said. \u201cSit down!\u201dHis name was Sergei. He was 44, and he drove a truck carrying cars from a Lada factory to dealers in Kazan.\u201cI have to work 16 hours a day to make ends meet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to live, you have to work. In 2004 I slept four hours a day and worked the rest. Then I had a boss to answer to. Now I work for myself, so at least I can choose my own routes.\u201dHe looked straight at me as he spoke, always with a glint in his eye. A joke was never far away.\u201cIt\u2019s the chance of a lifetime, meeting someone like you,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI got robbed once, would you like to hear about that?\u201dOne evening, 15 years earlier, he had parked his truck outside Moscow and was making tea in the cab. The doors were locked. Suddenly the passenger window was smashed and two men were forcing their way in.\u201cLuckily only one of them had a knife,\u201d Sergei said. \u201cThe first one opened the door, the other climbed in and put a cord around my neck. I held him off with one arm, started the truck and drove it out onto the road to block it and get help that way. The guy who was trying to choke me was in the way of the guy with the knife. That\u2019s what saved me. I managed to open the other door and jump out. Then the guy with the knife stabbed me in the back. I still have the scar.\u201d\u201cAnd they took off with the truck?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I just wanted to save myself. I walked along the road, but no one stopped to help. It was hardly surprising, I was half naked and covered in blood. There was no one at the police station. Eventually I came to a house where there was a party, I ran in, grabbed some clothes and ran off again. They found the truck later, abandoned and broken down, minus the load. And I was arrested for stealing the clothes!\u201dHe laughed. His face was constantly in motion, his expression changing in counterpoint to every twist and turn. It was a trait I recognized: He was a storyteller.He said his grandfather once claimed that he was a Romanov.\u201cA Romanov?\u201d I said. \u201cAs in the imperial family?\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I asked my mother about it, but I have never been able to find out for sure.\u201dThat was pretty good luck, I thought. Running into a possible descendant of the czars in a roadside diner in the middle of Russia.He started to talk about his grandfather.\u201cHe was very strong,\u201d he said, bringing his fist down between us on the table. It was giant.\u201cHis fist was like two of mine. One time he was going to water a calf. It was a hot day, and the air was still. The calf was being bothered by a fly, it kept trying to shake it off.\u201d He raised his head, tossing it about the way the calf had done. \u201cIts head hit Grandfather. He got mad and punched the calf and it dropped down dead. One punch. Dead.\u201dHe paused for a moment to let this story sink in, then he laughed.\u201cI believe that dreams are real,\u201d he said.\u201cSo do I,\u201d I said.\u201cYou do?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIn that case I\u2019ll tell you about a dream I had. I added an extra year to my grandfather\u2019s life in that dream. I had left my father and was living with my grandfather. I loved him very much. One night I dreamed that three men in black hats and black clothes \u2014 very mysterious, they looked a little like Georgians \u2014 came into our house. They walked right past me and up to my grandfather. They grabbed hold of him, and he didn\u2019t put up a fight, he just went with them. I hung on to him and was dragged along with him, out into the darkness. I couldn\u2019t save him, even though I\u2019m strong, too. It was hopeless. I started shouting and screaming. One of the men in black asked, \u2018Who\u2019s that shouting and screaming?\u2019 He spotted me, and then he asked: \u2018How long has he got?\u2019 \u2018One year,\u2019 said one of the others, \u2018for a few good deeds.\u2019 And then they disappeared.\u201dThe truck driver looked at me.\u201cOne week later Grandfather was taken into intensive care, he was in a coma. I said we didn\u2019t need to spend money on doctors, that he would get better. Five days later he woke up. He lived for exactly one more year.\u201dAfterward we stood outside and watched Sergei walk across the forecourt to his long semitrailer in the sunshine. He turned and waved, clambered in, started the grumbling engine, put the truck into gear and drove off.The village seemed deserted except for a solitary old lady, bent over double working in a vegetable plot. Brown talked with her, and it appeared that there was a woman living in the village who was 102 years old.\u201cCan we meet her?\u201d I said.Brown asked the woman, who nodded and pointed out the direction.We walked over to a bright, blue house with a woman in a head scarf moving around outside it. In her arms she held a large white hen that was struggling to get free.While Brown talked to her, a young rooster sped by with another in hot pursuit. The chase ended in a ball of feathers a little farther off.\u201cWe\u2019ve been invited in,\u201d Brown said.I stepped over the high threshold and into the hallway. It smelled slightly sour and musty inside, but it was pleasant and warm. There were rugs everywhere, both on the floors and on the walls. It felt like entering a cave.In the middle of the living room stood a very old woman. As we entered, she turned her head slowly and looked at us.The woman who had followed us in bustled past, led the old lady over to a bed that was pushed up against the wall, sat her down, removed her head scarf and put on a fresh one, then slipped a pair of leather slippers onto her feet.It was almost as if she were dressing a doll. But the old woman didn\u2019t seem to mind. She sat perfectly still with her hands in her lap, watching us.She wore a black dress patterned with roses. The white head scarf was big; it not only covered her head but also fell all the way down her back. Her name was Minizaitunya Ibyatullina.I walked over to her and gently shook her hand. It was dry and warm. She said something as she looked up at me.\u201cShe\u2019s speaking Tatar,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying.\u201dMinizaitunya slowly turned her head toward the camera as Addario started taking photographs of her. Her son, Kasym, stood in the doorway, smiling and looking on. His wife, whose name was Alfiya, produced a large laminated photograph from a drawer and handed it to the old woman. It was of a soldier, and she held it up in front of herself.This was a photograph of Minizaitunya\u2019s husband, who died in the war in 1943, in Ukraine. He was a very beautiful man. How odd it must be for her, I thought, to look at that picture of him, 70 years later, with him so young and handsome and her now 102.She didn\u2019t appear to think anything of it. She looked proud, sitting there holding his picture.It must have been odd for her son too. He was 80, more than twice as old as his father was when he died.Kasym had lived in the village all his life. It had been a collective farm under the Soviet Union. He had worked as a carpenter, he told us. His mother had also worked all her life.She said something in a soft voice, and her son bent down to her.\u201cShe says she\u2019s too old to work now,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the strength for it.\u201d\u201cWhat sort of work did she do?\u201d\u201cShe worked on the collective farm. Milking the cows and other chores.\u201dAlfiya came into the living room and invited us to come to the table. She had been baking while we were there: On the table was a platter holding a warm flat loaf and several sorts of jam. There were only two chairs, and there could be no talk of either of them sitting down. The wife poured tea, the husband presented a large bag of hard candy and when I made no move to help myself, he took out three pieces and laid them next to my plate.From the living room came the sound of soft, slow footsteps.\u201cThe babushka\u2019s coming!\u201d Alfiya said. Seconds later Minizaitunya appeared in the doorway. Her son escorted her over to another bed, where she sat and watched us while we ate.She was born in 1915. Russia was still a monarchy then, and Nicholas II still ruled. So she had seen the old czardom, the revolution, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union and, now, the new Russia.Alfiya put some fresh bread in a bag for us, Kasym gave us some bags of candy, and each of us was also presented with a small embroidered cloth to take with us. Even Minizaitunya had gifts for us: a bar of soap for Brown, scarves for Addario and me.\u201cAll of the people I grew up with are dead,\u201d she said from her seat on the bed when we were on our feet and about to leave. \u201cThere\u2019s no one left.\u201dI never look anyone straight in the eye for more than a few seconds at a time. I don\u2019t want to intrude on anyone, and maybe I don\u2019t want them to intrude on me. But once I had shaken everyone\u2019s hand in farewell that afternoon and was standing there looking at her and she looked back at me, I thought that I ought to hold her gaze, that I should look into her eyes. Those eyes that had seen the world during the time of the czars and seen the world for a hundred years after that.We looked at each other for a long time. At first she seemed surprised, as if she were wondering what I was up to, but then, slowly, she began to smile, and it was so wonderful, that smile, that there were tears in my eyes a moment later when we walked out the door and left the house.A set of headlights flickered farther in among the trees. I followed them with my eyes as they drew closer. When the lights lit up the car I was leaning against, they slowed down. A faint unease welled up inside me. I had heard stories about violent robberies in the towns nearby. But then whoever it was sped past. I stepped on my cigarette, got into our car and drove back onto the main road. It was probably just some bored teenagers out for a ride, I thought. And you could understand why, out here where there was nothing but trees and water.\u201cWhat are they protesting?\u201d Addario asked.\u201cThere are demonstrations all over the country today,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn support of the imprisoned opposition leader Aleksei Navalny. It\u2019s Putin\u2019s birthday today.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d I said, but a moment later I had forgotten the demonstration, because we were approaching the Church on the Blood, which sat on the actual spot where the legendary czar\u2019s story ended. It also housed something that, to me, was just as much the stuff of legend \u2014 an authentic Orthodox church service, which, thanks to all the Russian novels I had read, not least the works of Dostoyevsky, was bathed in a special light. This was the selfless light of mercy, associated not only with the highest and richest but also with the lowest and poorest. In Dostoyevsky\u2019s books, there is something morbid about this light, a frenzied, exhausting quality, which I have always regarded as typically Russian. I\u2019ve certainly never observed it anywhere else.We got out of the car and stood in the rain, looking up at the church.I knew right away that I would not be realizing any kind of Dostoyevskian vision. The church had been built in the traditional style, with multiple shining domes, but it was clearly brand new. Looking at it gave me the same strange feeling I had once in Warsaw Old Town, where the buildings destroyed in World War II, many of which were centuries old, had been replaced with pristine replicas. It was like flickering through a glitch in time. The old was not old, the new was not new. So where were we?On the night of July 16, 1918, as the story goes, the czar\u2019s family was awoken and told that they were being taken to a safer location. They came down from their rooms and were asked to wait in the cellar. They had no idea what was about to happen until the guns were raised against them. The revolutionaries who made up the firing squad were amateurs; some of them were drunk. The shots hit the family at random, the floor ran with blood, the air was thick with smoke, there must have been screaming and banging and confusion, several members of the family lay bleeding, but alive, on the floor, until they were finally killed with shots directly to the head. The bodies were then driven out of the town, and attempts were made to render their faces unrecognizable with acid before they were thrown down a mine shaft. Some days later, they were brought up again, transported to a nearby forest and buried there.The house was gone, the cellar was gone, the blood and the bodies were gone. But the Romanovs weren\u2019t gone. In the Church on the Blood, they had returned, as symbols. Those crazed and bloody minutes, and all that they represented, had now been subsumed into reliquary forms that promised the opposite: foresight, structure, harmony, balance.At the entrance to the church stood a sculpture of the whole Romanov family, made in the same heroic-realist style that Soviet artists used to depict the workers of the 1920s and 1930s. Inside the church hung icons in which Nicholas II was portrayed in the manner of the Middle Ages. Almost everything in the church involved a distortion of time. The ritual and repetition of the services abolished time entirely, linking the time within that chamber to divine time, which was eternal, unaffected by life or death, which was always there, which lasted forever. The czar and his family were lifted into this room, and the story with which they were associated disappeared, traceless. And yet Lenin existed in a similar space. Lying embalmed in his mausoleum on Red Square, his body was real and bound to the moment, but there was nothing about the body that connected him to the time when he held sway; he, too, was simultaneously inside and outside time.History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake, Joyce wrote. Nowhere was that truer than Russia.My first thought was that I should have been there, that this was the place where it was all happening, that this was what I should have gone to see in order to present the best possible picture of modern Russia.Then I thought: no.Stories have always held Russia together, and what makes them different from most other countries\u2019 nation-building stories, perhaps, is the authoritarian nature of the stories themselves: One story has been paramount while all that deviate from it have been forbidden. So it was under the czars, who censored books and newspapers; so it was under Lenin. And so it still is today \u2014 reporters in Russia are regularly imprisoned and sometimes simply murdered.And yet the alternative stories, the ones the authorities did not want to see gaining a foothold, the ones that told of abuse of power and oppression, of living in a dictatorship where all hope for the future was gone \u2014 these too had become standardized.The demonstration was what the international newspapers reported about Russia the day before, and their stories confirmed and reinforced the larger story about a downtrodden people in a totalitarian state. But behind this reality there was another reality as well. The three lively women on the train; Dina and Damir, the young couple in Kazan with a baby on the way; Sergei the truck driver; the old, old woman in the village and the elderly couple who cared for her \u2014 which story about Russia could contain all of them without, at the same time, drastically reducing what was unique to each of them?Turgenev\u2019s stories could. The characters in them do not lead to anything beyond themselves. But the world as it is can\u2019t exist without its twin, the world as we want it to be. Lenin, the oppressor, read Turgenev all through his life, and Vladimir Putin revealed his love for \u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d in an interview from 2011, when he said: \u201cThe main character, in a simple but picturesque and very sympathetic way, tells stories about people he met while hunting, and their lives. They are a sort of sketches on Russia\u2019s heartland of the mid-19th century that provide food for thought and allow us to see our country, its traditions and national psychology in a new light.\u201d\u201cI was born into a classic Soviet family,\u201d he said once we had taken our seats at a table near a window looking out onto the street. \u201cBoth my parents were geologists; they were members of the Soviet intelligentsia.\u201dHe was short and stocky, with a stubbly beard, and there was something indomitable about him that made me think about an animal that won\u2019t let go of something when it gets its teeth into it. Lebedev\u2019s books dealt with history \u2014 it lay like a shadow over everything he wrote \u2014 and the fact that its presence was so powerful suggested that the conflicts and tensions inherent in it were still unresolved, still had a bearing on Russian society in obscure yet palpable ways.Lebedev told me that everything in his childhood was designed to keep parts of the past hidden from him. His great-grandfather had, for example, been an officer in the czar\u2019s army before he switched sides and joined the Red Army. But in the family\u2019s version of events, he had always worn the Red Army\u2019s cape with its red star, as if he had been born in 1917 and there had been nothing before that.\u201cFor me that was normal,\u201d he said. \u201cTo live in an incomplete world. To live in a world full of holes. With all these questions that could never be asked.\u201dThe street outside was lit by the rays of the low October sun and busy with people strolling through the town on this Sunday afternoon. Many of them must have had stories similar to Lebedev\u2019s, I thought. There is a mechanism in people that stops us from talking about bad experiences and makes us reluctant to stir up the past. But secrets foster a specific version of reality in which the individual pieces have to be arranged in a particular way, fitting so neatly together that if just one were to change position, the whole picture would fall apart. Our identity is shaped by stories, about our own history, about our family\u2019s history, about the history of our people or our country. What happens when one of these identity-shaping stories doesn\u2019t fit? Suddenly you are not who you thought you were. And then who are you?I asked him what the narrative in Russia was like now.\u201cIt\u2019s very strange,\u201d he replied. \u201cFirst of all, it is important to understand that the authorities have no single, coherent ideology. They use elements from all sorts of different fields: If it works, they\u2019ll take it. They need a smoke screen to hide the fact that they\u2019re nothing but a bunch of kleptocrats. Take, for example, the name of the United Russia party. Those words, a \u2018united Russia,\u2019 were a slogan of the counterrevolutionaries, coined in reaction to Lenin and the Bolsheviks, who wished to establish new, self-governing republics. The current administration is building a state founded on Soviet nostalgia, but they have no qualms about appropriating an opposition slogan. And it\u2019s not the slightest bit controversial.\u201dLebedev led the way past the Bolshoi Theater, pointing and explaining as we walked along. The square in front of the theater\u2019s magnificent neoclassical facade was dominated by several parked police buses and the police officers and police dogs standing near them.\u201cRiot police,\u201d Lebedev said. \u201cThere were demonstrations here yesterday, so they\u2019re worried and want to make sure nothing happens.\u201dDense crowds of people milled around the stalls and the profusion of food and drink. The mood was light, people were smiling and laughing, children running around the feet of the adults, the sun shining on faces, and behind us, stark against the deep blue sky, reared the towers of the Kremlin.\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of the harvest,\u201d Lebedev said. \u201cIt\u2019s so typical of Putin and the government. They invest in nonpolitical events and public meeting places like this. Here it\u2019s all about pumpkins! They\u2019re trying to invent new traditions, and this is meant as a display of Russia\u2019s riches.\u201dWe continued walking, to Revolution Square, which under the czars was called Resurrection Square. \u201cAs you can see, there\u2019s no trace of the revolution here,\u201d Lebedev said. \u201cThe centenary is hardly being celebrated at all; certainly there\u2019s no discussion of the violence, the atrocities. But if you are to understand what happened in this country in the \u201920s and \u201930s, you cannot ignore the violence and the horrors of the five years from 1917 to 1921. You cannot understand why people were so willing to slaughter one another. There has been a sort of a war fought over memories in Russia, over what should be remembered and what should be forgotten. History today is all about symbols, not about notions of mutual forgiveness and reconciliation.\u201cBut wait till you see this, in here,\u201d he said, pointing to the entrance to a metro station. The escalator we stepped onto was steep and long, and in the underworld to which it carried us, time seemed to have stood still.Placed on a series of platforms along the walls were huge, heroic bronze statues of human figures. The first of them bore rifles and cartridge belts; these were the revolutionaries. But then came the ordinary people, men and women, young and old, peasants, fishermen, factory workers \u2014 the whole exquisite, mesmerizing series ending with a child held aloft, a symbol of the future.Oh, it was so full of hope and faith that the knowledge that it was propaganda no longer mattered, because this was a vision of a life, of a land, of a future, and it was not untrue, just beautiful.This, too, was the revolution, the dream of a better life for all. All the art from that time shares this same energy, an almost wild optimism, a sense that this is where it begins. Women are as much in the vanguard as men, not sexualized or objectivized, but there in their own right. The artists are experimenting; this is the age of Mayakovsky, Eisenstein, Kandinsky. As well as killing, violence, ruthlessness, hunger, want, misery and, in due course, a system that became ossified, closed to the world, trapped by its own truths. The underground station was the most beautiful place I saw during my days in Russia, but the beauty could not be used for anything, bound up as it was with concepts of reality that no one believed in anymore and that could never, therefore, be realized.And yet neither did that make it a lie. The statue of the czar outside the Church on the Blood was a lie, because it changed the past. These statues were meant to change the future. The fact that this future was never realized, that it never came to pass, did not make this subterranean vision untrue; it just made it vain and beautiful. Few things are more beautiful than vain hope.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Tax Cuts Hurt This Manufacturer. It Kept On Lobbying.", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLATHAM, N.Y. \u2014 By noon on Wednesday, the snow was ankle-deep in the parking lot and the workers had abandoned the factory floor at Plug Power to escape the storm. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells meant for forklifts in Amazon or Walmart warehouses sat half-finished in steel casings.The empty plant was a weather fluke, but to the 300 employees in this town outside Albany, it might have been an omen of the company\u2019s fate, which was resting in the hands of Washington lawmakers.The $1.5 trillion tax bill President Trump signed into law last year failed to extend a crucial tax credit for fuel-cell makers such as Plug Power, putting the company\u2019s domestic future in jeopardy. As workers drove home that afternoon to ride out the storm, a flurry of hope was swirling as Congress hashed out a bipartisan budget deal that company leaders hoped would reinstate the fuel-cell tax credit.An extension of the credit would allow Plug Power\u2019s executives to continue their recent expansion in the United States. Without it, the 20-year old company would shift resources to China and Germany, potentially leaving the workers here out in the cold.The giant tax bill ushered in the most significant changes to the tax code in decades, with the aim of helping businesses grow and flourish. But Washington has a long history of picking winners and losers through the tax code \u2014 even in bills meant to simplify it \u2014 and Plug Power\u2019s experience demonstrates just how much power Congress wields over companies who build businesses based in part on policy decisions.For more than two years, Plug Power\u2019s president and chief executive, Andy Marsh, had spent a chunk of his working hours advocating a long-term extension of the credit. The company spent more than $750,000 during that period to lobby Congress. Early in the day on Wednesday, Mr. Marsh said he was 65 percent certain the tax credit would make it into the budget deal. Around lunchtime, he put the odds at 35 percent.While Mr. Marsh prepared to follow his workers out the door, his chief operating officer, Keith Schmid, took a visitor on a last walk across the now-silent plant.\u201cI\u2019m a little spooked by how quiet it is today,\u201d he said.An hour later, his reprieve arrived. Congress cut a deal to extend the credit.For years, Washington has set tax policy in fits and starts, creating targeted tax breaks for particular industries and often setting them to expire, to minimize the projected loss to federal revenues. Yet those credits are routinely extended on a temporary basis, creating a maddening dance for companies who struggle to plan and invest for the long term.Economists generally agree that the process is detrimental to companies and the economy. Expiring tax breaks give companies an incentive to plow money into lobbying to retain those preferences, rather than putting that money toward research and development, worker training or other investments that might improve their productivity. Free-market purists also contend that targeted tax breaks distort markets, propping up firms that otherwise might fail, just because they have government connections.But try as they might, policymakers in Washington cannot quit the short-term credit game.In 2005, President George W. Bush signed a law that created a 30 percent credit for investing in fuel cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen to create an electric current. Congress extended the credit twice after that. But it eventually set the credit, along with similar incentives for solar, wind and other clean energy sources, to expire at the end of 2016.Industry lobbyists worked hard to prevent the expiration, and in 2015, lawmakers extended some solar and wind credits but allowed the fuel cell credit to die as scheduled.The industries whose credits expired never stopped working to get them back. Some members of Congress took up their cause, such as Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York, who drafted a bill to reinstate \u2014 and gradually phase out \u2014 the energy credits that had been \u201corphaned\u201d by the 2015 bill.Mr. Reed nearly succeeded in getting those extensions attached to the sprawling tax bill that Republicans sped through Congress last fall. But his provision was dropped from the bill as it moved through the Senate, and thus never made it to Mr. Trump for his signature.The disappearance of the credit threatened the domestic expansion of Plug Power, a company founded in the late 1990s in the midst of the tech boom, whose stock briefly topped $1,000 a share. The bubble popped, the firm\u2019s shares sunk to single digits and the company burned through money, seeking a marketable use for its fuel cells, which cost more than conventional competitors but emit nothing but water as a byproduct. Mr. Marsh took over in 2008 and finally steered the firm into what has become a profitable niche: replacing the large batteries that power forklifts in warehouses.Forklifts that run on fuel cells do not need to swap out batteries every shift, like those that run on lead-acid batteries. They plug into a fuel station that looks like a gasoline pump, connect a few hoses and quickly fill up with hydrogen. Plug Power has found a growing market in selling or leasing those fuel cells to Amazon, Walmart, Kroger and B.M.W., among others, and it has begun piloting fuel-cell powered delivery trucks in China and around Albany.When the credit expired, Mr. Marsh said, the price of buying one of the company\u2019s fuel cells immediately jumped 30 percent for customers. Some of those customers, he added, have budgets set aside for alternative energy spending \u2014 and in those cases, solar and wind projects, which still were backed by credits, were suddenly more attractive.The recent tax law compounded the problem, because it made it more expensive for Plug Power to get financing. When the law was signed in December, Mr. Marsh said one of his lenders called and told him his borrowing costs were going up.\u201cWe just want a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Marsh said on Wednesday. He occasionally checked his phone for updates from his lobbying team in Washington. He loves the Albany region and hopes to expand here, he said, but he noted that China and Germany loomed as attractive markets, and said the company would more aggressively explore expansion there \u2014 and perhaps resource relocation \u2014 if the tax credit did not return.\u201cWe have a business plan if it goes one way, and a business plan if it goes the other way, and we\u2019ll execute what makes sense,\u201d Mr. Marsh said. \u201cI don\u2019t get paid to be nervous.\u201dIn Washington, the lobbying team had little ability left to sway the outcome. Trade groups representing Plug Power and other energy companies had pressed for two years to extend the credit, as had the lobbyists on contract for the company. They had lined up powerful allies for the measure, including Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the minority leader. The lobbyists spent Wednesday mostly trying to scare up news from the closed-door negotiations in the Capitol to see if their work had paid off.At midday, Mr. Marsh was told that the fuel cell credit was not yet in the bill, but discussions were ongoing. Around that time, executives decided to send Plug Power workers home to escape the snow.Word finally arrived from Washington later that day about the deal: The credit was in the budget deal, retroactive to 2017 and phased down through 2022. The industry had gotten exactly what it wanted \u2014 at least for now. Mr. Marsh, in an email, said that he was excited and thankful: \u201cIt is time for our sales team to let our customers know that our products are now available with the tax credit, and go push sales and growth in the U.S.\u201dMany conservative groups protested the inclusion. Several groups in the powerful Koch network sent a letter to congressional leaders, saying the budget deal had \u201copened the floodgates to massive increases in government spending and corporate welfare for powerful and well-connected special interests.\u201dSome of those interests fared better than others: Most of the 48 \u201ctax extenders\u201d tucked into the budget deal \u2014 including special tax treatment for race horse owners and timber companies \u2014 were one-year extensions retroactive for 2017 only. Congress will presumably take them up again in future negotiations.The deal passed the Senate and House early on Friday morning, after a brief but contentious debate. Mr. Marsh was off to Argentina for vacation, but he reported that the roads had been cleared around Albany, and the factory floor was humming again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In City Council, Power Shifts Away From Progressives", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe shift of alignment among Democrats in this one-party town could spell trouble for Mr. de Blasio, who may have to govern with less Council support than he is accustomed to. It also runs counter to the broader national narrative of the Democratic Party, whose energized left wing has put the establishment on its heels.Four years ago, the party leaders in New York \u2014 Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens being the most influential among them \u2014 were stung when Mr. de Blasio and the Progressive Caucus outmaneuvered them to install a mayoral ally, Melissa Mark-Viverito, as speaker.But things were different this time around. Mr. Johnson, of Manhattan, had worked diligently to win the support of Mr. Crowley and Assemblyman Marcos A. Crespo, chairman of the Bronx Democratic Party.When word emerged in December that Mr. Johnson had clinched the support of the county leaders and would become the new speaker, the mayor was out of the picture \u2014 he was on his way back from Iowa, where he had given a speech to a group of progressive Democrats.And when Mr. Johnson was formally elected speaker at a Council session in early January, Mr. Crowley sat in the front row of the balcony, leaning over the brass railing with a wide smile.In recent weeks, the degree to which progressives lost and the party establishment won has become increasingly clear through the way that Mr. Johnson \u2014 in consultation with county leaders \u2014 handed out assignments within the Council, starting with the powerful committees on land use and finance.\u201cI\u2019m a county guy,\u201d said Councilman Rafael Salamanca of the Bronx, who was picked to lead the powerful land use committee, which oversees real estate projects and rezonings. \u201cI\u2019m not shy to say it.\u201dMr. Salamanca, who describes himself as liberal, rose through the ranks of the Bronx party with the help of county officials and won a special election to the Council in 2016.\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve always treasured is my independence,\u201d Mr. Dromm said. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh he\u2019s a county guy.\u2019 Well, I sort of am.\u201d Mr. Dromm was first elected in 2009 when he ran as a reformer against a county-backed incumbent. He went on to help elect Ms. Mark-Viverito. But then he left the group and mended fences with the party establishment, enough so that Mr. Crowley supported him as finance chair.The other Council member who broke with the Progressive Caucus is Ritchie Torres, who left the group in December in a dispute over his sponsorship of a police reform bill that Police Department critics considered too weak. Mr. Johnson gave Mr. Torres, of the Bronx, another plum assignment, as chairman of an investigations committee with a broad mandate.One factor at play is term limits; the majority of the Council\u2019s current members are serving their last term. Many of them are looking ahead to what offices they may seek four years from now and realize that they may benefit from the support of the county organizations, which help with the nuts and bolts of getting on the ballot.Meanwhile, the roles of some progressive stalwarts were diminished when committee assignments were handed out.Brad Lander, of Brooklyn, one of the caucus\u2019 founders, lost his post as chairman of the rules committee, although he retained his title as deputy leader for policy. Jumaane D. Williams, of Brooklyn, an outspoken Progressive Caucus member who snubbed Mr. Johnson by not attending his election as speaker, was also left without a committee to chair, as was another member, Bill Perkins, of Manhattan.Of the 18 Democrats joining Mr. Johnson on the powerful budget negotiating team, only six are caucus members; under Ms. Mark-Viverito, three-quarters of the team were caucus members.In contrast, some more conservative Council members fared well. Fernando Cabrera of the Bronx, a former Republican, was named majority whip. Robert E. Cornegy Jr., an ally of Representative Hakeem Jeffries, who has exerted growing influence over the party in Brooklyn, was made chairman of the Democratic Conference. Mark Treyger, another Jeffries ally, was appointed chairman of the education committee. Both Mr. Cornegy and Mr. Treyger are seen as more moderate than many of their peers.For all that, the Council, which is dominated by Democrats over Republicans, 48 to 3, remains a liberal bastion, and whatever practical effect the shifting balance of power will have on policy is an open question.\u201cThe speaker is a progressive, and there\u2019s no doubt that this will be as progressive a City Council as the last one,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, a Queens caucus member who was the majority leader under Ms. Mark-Viverito. \u201cBut in terms of the caucus having helped make a speaker and where it was in terms of influence, there\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s been a sea change.\u201dThe clearest impact is that Ms. Mark-Viverito owed her election as speaker to the support of the caucus and Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Johnson does not have the same debt to the mayor and is strengthened by his county support, which allows him to set a course that is more independent of the mayor.\u201cI am a progressive, that is no secret,\u201d Mr. Johnson said during a breakfast speech Tuesday before the Association for a Better New York, a civic group that includes business and real estate leaders. \u201cBut we need to do more than just talk about it. I am here, as the next speaker, to get things done.\u201dMr. Lander, who helped start the Progressive Caucus in 2010, acknowledged that the group had lost some important committee assignments, but he stressed that its membership grew this term to 21 members, from 17.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sweeping War on Obesity, Chile Slays Tony the Tiger", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "New regulations, which corporate interests delayed for almost a decade, require explicit labeling and limit the marketing of sugary foods to children.Supported bySANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 They killed Tony the Tiger. They did away with Cheetos\u2019 Chester Cheetah. They banned Kinder Surprise, the chocolate eggs with a hidden toy.The Chilean government, facing skyrocketing rates of obesity, is waging war on unhealthy foods with a phalanx of marketing restrictions, mandatory packaging redesigns and labeling rules aimed at transforming the eating habits of 18 million people.Nutrition experts say the measures are the world\u2019s most ambitious attempt to remake a country\u2019s food culture, and could be a model for how to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic that researchers say contributes to four million premature deaths a year.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how significant Chile\u2019s actions are \u2014 or how hard it has been to get there in the face of the usual pressures,\u201d said Stephen Simpson, director of the Charles Perkins Centre, an organization of scholars focused on nutrition and obesity science and policy. The multibillion dollar food and soda industries have exerted those pressures to successfully stave off regulation in many other countries.Since the food law was enacted two years ago, it has forced multinational behemoths like Kellogg to remove iconic cartoon characters from sugary cereal boxes and banned the sale of candy like Kinder Surprise that use trinkets to lure young consumers. The law prohibits the sale of junk food like ice cream, chocolate and potato chips in Chilean schools and proscribes such products from being advertised during television programs or on websites aimed at young audiences.Beginning next year, such ads will be scrubbed entirely from TV, radio and movie theaters between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. In an effort to encourage breast-feeding, a ban on marketing infant formula kicks in this spring.Still craving Coca-Cola? In Chile, beverages high in sugar include an 18 percent tax, which is among the steepest soda taxes in the world.The linchpin of the initiative is a new labeling system that requires packaged food companies to prominently display black warning logos in the shape of a stop sign on items high in sugar, salt, calories or saturated fat.PepsiCo, the maker of Cheetos, and Kellogg\u2019s, producer of Frosted Flakes, have gone to court, arguing that the regulations infringe on their intellectual property. The case is pending.Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Echeverria, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, said the company was fully compliant with the law, and had no interest in overturning it, but was only trying to protect its ability to use a locally registered trademark.Kellogg declined to comment.Soaring obesity rates are forcing governments around the world to confront one of the more serious threats to public health in a generation.Until the late 1980s, malnutrition was widespread among poor Chileans, especially children. Today, three-quarters of adults are overweight or obese, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Officials have been particularly alarmed by childhood obesity rates that are among the world\u2019s highest, with over half of 6-year-old children overweight or obese.In 2016, the medical costs of obesity reached $800 million, or 2.4 percent of all health care spending, a figure that analysts say will reach nearly 4 percent in 2030.Such sobering statistics helped rally a coalition of elected officials, scientists and public health advocates who overcame fierce opposition from food companies and their allies in government.\u201cIt was a hard-fought guerrilla war,\u201d said Senator Guido Girardi, vice president of the Chilean senate and a doctor who first proposed the regulations in 2007. \u201cPeople have a right to know what these food companies are putting in this trash, and with this legislation, I think Chile has made a huge contribution to humanity.\u201dFrom India to Colombia to the United States, countries rich and poor have been struggling to combat rising obesity \u2014 and encountering ferocious resistance from food companies eager to protect their profits.In Chile, corporate interests delayed passage of the law for almost a decade, and on two occasions there were so many lobbyists crowding Congressional hearings for the bill that the Senate president was forced to suspend the sessions and clear the room.But the industry rarely faces opponents like Senator Girardi. A trained surgeon with a flair for the theatrical, he is a key figure in the governing coalition of President Michelle Bachelet. During the long fight over the food law, Senator Girardi, 56, publicly assailed big food companies as \u201c21st century pedophiles\u201d and before Ms. Bachelet took office, spent weeks protesting outside the presidential palace with placards that accused her predecessor, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, of destroying the nation\u2019s health by vetoing an earlier version of the legislation.\u201cSugar kills more people than terrorism and car accidents combined,\u201d he said in an interview as he shook a box of Trix cereal for effect. \u201cIt\u2019s the poison of our time.\u201dThere were other factors that made the legislation possible, including a legislature determined to address the rising economic costs of obesity and support from Ms. Bachelet, a socialist who also happens to be trained as a pediatrician.In the end, industry pressure succeeded in easing some measures in the original legislation, including loosening the advertising restrictions and quashing a proposed ban on junk food sales near schools.Strolling through a Chilean supermarket can be visually jarring. Boxes of Nesquik chocolate powder no longer include Nestle\u2019s hyperkinetic bunny. Gone, too, are the dancing candies that enliven packages of M&Ms the world over.Then there are the warning signs that appear on the front of countless items.Cereal bars, yogurts and juice boxes, products long advertised as \u201chealthy,\u201d \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cfortified with vitamins and minerals,\u201d now carry one or more of the black warning labels. A bottle of Great Value brand light ranch dressing displays all four warning logos \u2014 marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat.\u201cI never really paid attention to labels,\u201d Patricia S\u00e1nchez, 32, an accountant and mother of two, said as she filled her shopping cart at a Santiago supermarket, with occasional help from her 7-year-old daughter. \u201cBut now they kind of force you to pay attention. And if I don\u2019t notice, my kids do.\u201dObesity rates in Chile have yet to fall, and experts say it could take years to significantly modify the way people eat. But by focusing on the packaging and advertising of unhealthy foods that appeal to children, the Chilean government is hoping to reprogram the next generation of consumers.\u201cYou have to change the entire food system and you can\u2019t do that overnight,\u201d said Dr. Cecilia Castillo Lancellotti, former head of nutrition at the country\u2019s Health Ministry and an early proponent of the legislation.The new regulations, however, have prompted an unexpected payoff already: Food companies have been voluntarily modifying their products to avoid the dreaded black logos.According to AB Chile, a food industry association, more than 1,500 items, or 20 percent of all products sold in Chile, have been reformulated in response to the law. Nestl\u00e9 reduced the sugar in its Milo chocolate powder drink, McDonald\u2019s is offering fruit pur\u00e9e, yogurt and cherry tomatoes in its Happy Meals, and local companies have been introducing new products like nuts, rice cakes and dried fruit to sell in schools.Ben Sheidler, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said the company had created 32 new beverages in the last 18 months, and that 65 percent of its drinks portfolio in Chile could now be described as having low or reduced sugar.A spokesman for PepsiCo said two-thirds of its beverage brands in Chile also qualified as low or sugar-free and that more than 90 percent of its snack offerings were now low in both sodium and saturated fat.The association killed their ad criticizing the new regulations.The job of implementing the rules falls to a group of technical advisers who gather weekly at the Ministry of Health and provide guidance on whether a snack company should remove the dancing cat logo from cookie packages or whether an adult\u2018s voice should replace the small, childlike one hawking corn chips on a radio spot.\u201cSometimes it\u2019s easy, like if a dog is wearing glasses and talking like a person, but sometimes it\u2019s not,\u201d said Dr. Lorena Rodriguez, the ministry\u2019s head of nutrition. \u201cWe fight and fight and fight until we have consensus.\u201dDr. Jaime Burrows Oyarz\u00fan, the vice minister of public health, is confident the government will prevail in court. As chief arbiter of the new regulations, he often bears the brunt of industry ire. After the banning of Kinder Surprise, a company executive from Italy and the Italian ambassador to Chile accused him of waging \u201cfood terrorism\u201d during a visit to his office, he recalled in an interview.Mauro Russo, managing director at Ferrero, the maker of the Kinder Surprise, said the law had been erroneously applied to their product because the toy is an intrinsic part of the treat, not a \u201cpromotional gadget,\u201d as described by the legislation, that seeks to stimulate sales. He also disputed the notion that the product is unhealthy, noting that each egg contains 110 calories and that few consumers purchase more than one or two a year. \u201cKinder Surprise\u2019s impact on obesity is very marginal,\u201d he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t need more taxes,\u201d she said in an interview.A spokesman for Mr. Pi\u00f1era said he would likely take a second look at the law and explore ways \u201cto improve it\u201d after he takes office.In the meantime, other countries in Latin America, among them Ecuador and Brazil, are seeking to borrow elements of Chile\u2019s initiative. Dr. Carlos A. Monteiro, a professor of nutrition and public health at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, said leaders throughout the region could no longer ignore the rising medical costs of diet-related diseases like diabetes and hypertension.\u201cThe epidemic of obesity is so clear and harmful to the whole population, including the political elite, and no country is succeeding to control it without regulation of the food environment,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing nothing is no longer an option.\u201dMatt Richtel contributed reporting from New York, and Pascale Bonnefoy from Santiago.Advertisement"}

Since it was a test flight, Mr. Musk put the Tesla on board, instead of heavy and boring concrete, and sent it on an elliptical orbit around the sun that would extend beyond Mars\u2019s orbit.The light in the sky was the final engine burn that pushed the car away from Earth and onto its interplanetary journey.This was of course not the first time Mr. Musk\u2019s company has freaked out Californians.In December, a night launch of a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base left a surrealistic glowing trail in its wake above Los Angeles.

Its commanders regularly show up at the front lines to lead battles. Iran has built and continues to back powerful militias with thousands of fighters it has trained in Syria. And it has brought in new technologies, like drones, to spy on enemies and perhaps to attack them from the sky.Both Israeli officials and Israel\u2019s enemies say that any new conflict between Israel and Iran, or any of its allies, could mobilize Iran\u2019s expanding network of militant proxies in multiple countries, what Iran refers to as \u201cthe axis of resistance.\u201d\u201cIf there is a war, it will be regional,\u201d said Kamel Wazne, the founder of the Center for American Strategic Studies, in Beirut, who studies the policies of the United States and Iran in the Middle East. \u201cAny confrontation will be with the whole resistance front against Israel and its backers.\u201dIran and its allies first intervened in Syria to defend the rule of President Bashar al-Assad against Syrian rebels after the civil war broke out in 2011, and later helped his forces against the jihadists of the Islamic State.\u201cThe ultimate goal is, in the case of another war, to make Syria a new front between Israel, Hezbollah and Iran,\u201d said Amir Toumaj, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who studies Iran. \u201cThey are making that not just a goal, but a reality.\u201dIranian leaders speak openly of their work to build this axis of resistance against Israeli and American influence. A key to Iran\u2019s strategy, analysts and officials say, is to rely not on conventional military hardware or control of territory, which Israel can easily bomb, but on building ties with local forces who share its goals and benefit from its financing and expertise.That approach has enabled Iran to amplify its power in the Arab world while decreasing the threat to its own forces and homeland. It has also created a problem for countries including the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia, who fear Iran\u2019s growing influence but have struggled to come up with ways to stop it.Some people in Israel have started referring to a potential \u201cFirst Northern War,\u201d meaning that Israel will have to fight across both the Lebanese and Syrian frontiers. And many Israelis say the danger is not just from the new Iranian-backed militias, but also from the Iranian efforts to give advanced, high-precision weapons capable of hitting sensitive infrastructure to Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s most powerful and experienced external force.Israeli officials have said that Iran and its allies are seeking to establish a land corridor from Iran to the Mediterranean, via Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, to ease the transportation of such weapons and to build underground factories to manufacture them in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has been bombing convoys in Syria that are believed to be carrying advanced arms to Hezbollah, but the group\u2019s covert nature makes it hard to determine which arms have slipped through and whether its arms factories are functioning.Such arms, coupled with heavy barrages from the more than 100,000 rockets and missiles without high-precision targeting capability that Israel says Hezbollah already has, could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses.\u201cIsrael will face not only quantity, but the threat to vulnerable strategic sites,\u201d said Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and now a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies. Referring to the combination of more precise weapons and a new front, he added: \u201cEach one is problematic; together, they are devastating.\u201dIran\u2019s moves in the region have alarmed the United States. \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly concerning is that this network of proxies is becoming more and more capable as Iran seeds more and more\u201d of its \u201cdestructive weapons into these networks,\u201d Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said at a security conference in Munich on Saturday. \u201cSo the time is now, we think, to act against Iran,\u201d General McMaster added.The war in Syria gave Iran a new opportunity to advance that project by linking its allies across the Levant together.Fighters from Hezbollah routed Syrian rebels near the Lebanese border and Iran sent advisers to help Mr. Assad\u2019s beleaguered forces during the early years of the war.But by 2013, Mr. Assad\u2019s forces were on the verge of collapse, and Iran intervened more forcefully, undertaking an extensive regional operation to train, arm and transport thousands of Shiite militiamen from abroad to Syria to fight the rebels and the jihadists of the Islamic State.Estimates of the number of Iranian military personnel in Syria today range from the high hundreds to the low thousands. While some directly participate in combat, most are trainers, commanders or experts who advise the Syrian military and oversee militias. It is these militias, which could have as many as 20,000 fighters, that give Iran its true muscle.Those fighters include about 6,000 from Hezbollah. Most of the rest of the militia members \u2014 who come from Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan and elsewhere \u2014 have been enticed to fight in Syria with money and appeals to their Shiite faith. Indeed, most see the war in Syria in religious terms, as a jihad against enemies of their religion.Ali Alfoneh, a researcher at the Atlantic Council who tracks reports of foreign militia fighters killed in Syria, said the number of deaths reported had decreased substantially as those fighting for Mr. Assad have gotten the upper hand in the war. But instead of leaving the country, he said, the militias appeared to be shifting their sights toward Israel.\u201cIran has realized that it is actually possible to maintain a front against Israel where there is no war but also no peace,\u201d Mr. Alfoneh said.In his research, Mr. Alfoneh said he had identified three main Iranian bases that oversee operations in large parts of Syria \u2014 one near Aleppo in the north and two south of the capital, Damascus \u2014 as well as seven smaller tactical bases near active front lines where Iran and its proxies have a presence.The idea of a permanent Iranian presence in Syria worries Israel, which fears that it could face a threat there similar to that posed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysts close to Iran and its proxies say that is exactly the idea.\u201cIt\u2019s like a replication of the Hezbollah model,\u201d said Ali Rizk, a Lebanese analyst who writes for Al Monitor, a news website focused on the Middle East. Iran is already training fighters in southern Syria, he said, so that if Hezbollah draws down its presence there, as its leaders have vowed to, it will leave behind a Syrian prototype.In recent months, at least two Iraqi militia leaders have visited the Lebanon-Israel border with Hezbollah, and militia members say the visits have included developing plans for how they might collaborate in a future conflict.Both sides say they do not want war, and the fear of extensive destruction and civilian deaths has deterred new hostilities since the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. But the more entrenched Iran\u2019s allies become, the greater the pressure Israeli leaders could face to launch a strike \u2014 and the greater the chances that a miscalculation or mistake by either side could provoke new hostilities.Some analysts have expressed hopes that Russia, which also intervened in Syria on Mr. Assad\u2019s behalf, could serve as a check on Iran\u2019s ambitions. Russia has cooperated with Iran during the war but also seeks to maintain good relations with Israel.Notably, Russia has not publicly complained when Israel has bombed convoys believed to be bound for Hezbollah. Others question to what degree the Syrian population will buy into Iran\u2019s ideological project, noting that only a tiny portion of Syrians share Iran\u2019s Shiite faith.Much remains unclear about Iran\u2019s intentions. Days after Israel destroyed the drone, Israeli military officials said they were still not sure whether it had been armed, had been sent on a surveillance mission or was merely a test of Israel\u2019s defenses.\u201cIt is very important for us to understand its mission,\u201d Brig. Gen. Tomer Bar, the chief of staff of the Israeli Air Force, told reporters. \u201cWe have to understand it and we will investigate it till the end.\u201dBen Hubbard and Anne Barnard reported from Beirut, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}

The subway was mentioned four times and homelessness was mentioned only once.Mr. de Blasio has already been criticized as he enters his second term for perhaps being more interested in his national profile and whatever may come after City Hall than in the day-to-day management of government.And his focus in the speech on the big picture, while skimming more lightly over some of the gritty problems of city life, might have left some of his listeners wondering if he was seeing the fairest but not the trees.When, at the start of his speech, Mr. de Blasio mentioned a Rikers Island guard who was injured recently when he was attacked by inmates, a protester in the theater shouted: \u201cYou gotta do more! You\u2019re not doing enough!\u201d He was escorted out.Mr. de Blasio talked about the need to work with the state government in Albany to achieve many of his policy goals \u2014 but he offered no glimpse of how he expected to break the crippling deadlock between himself and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state Republican lawmakers.The new in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s speech came in a 10-point plan to strengthen democracy by improving the way the city carries out elections and encouraging more voting and citizen participation.\u201cWe must re-democratize a society that is losing its way,\u201d he said.Mr. de Blasio said that he would appoint a commission to recommend changes to the City Charter, in order to create a more far-reaching program for public financing of election campaigns (the city already has what is considered to be one of the most robust in the country).\u201cOur goal is for elections to be funded primarily by public dollars, thereby greatly reducing the power of big money,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. He said that the goal was to get \u201cbig money out of politics.\u201dMr. de Blasio was the target of multiple investigations during his first term into his political fund-raising and the favors that donors sought in return. He often dodged questions about his ethics by saying that the role of money in politics should be reined in.The mayor said that the charter revision commission would also propose ways to better reach out to voters to provide them information about elections, candidates and the location of polling places. He said that was necessary because the Board of Elections, which is governed by state law, does not do an adequate job. The commission\u2019s recommendations would have to be approved by voters.Mr. de Blasio also said that he would budget $500,000 a year for electronic and digital security to protect the city\u2019s voting system.The mayor said that he would name a \u201cchief democracy officer,\u201d whose job would be to solve \u201cthe problem of shrinking voter participation.\u201d The job will come with the goal of registering 1.5 million New Yorkers to vote in the next four years. There are currently about 4.6 million registered voters in New York City \u2014 so Mr. de Blasio\u2019s goal could mean an increase of nearly one-third.The plan calls for a registration push among high school students 17 and older, and an expanded civics curriculum that would be used at all grade levels.Advertisement"}

He was 64.The country\u2019s president, Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9, announced the death on Twitter. No cause was given.Mr. Ouedraogo (pronounced oh-dra-OH-go) was in his early 30s when he wrote and directed his first feature, \u201cYam Daabo\u201d (\u201cThe Choice,\u201d in the Moor\u00e9 language of Burkina Faso, which is in Western Africa), a 1986 release about a family disrupted by famine.A bigger international success came in May 1990, when Mr. Ouedraogo\u2019s \u201cTilai\u201d (\u201cThe Law\u201d), about the violation of familial taboos, was one of two films to receive the Grand Prix at the Cannes festival, the event\u2019s second-highest honor after the Golden Palm.\u201cFilms like \u2018Tilai\u2019 do more than restore one\u2019s spirit,\u201d Jay Carr wrote in reviewing it in The Boston Globe in 1991, \u201cthey restore one\u2019s perspective, reminding us that there\u2019s still such a thing as a self-renewing world cinema, and Ouedraogo \u2014 not likely to be invited to a Hollywood power lunch soon \u2014 is a major figure in it.\u201dIn primary school, he showed enough promise that, as was customary, he was sent to Ouagadougou to continue his studies. There, he made sure to reserve enough money each week to buy a ticket for a weekend show at one of the city\u2019s three outdoor cinemas, favoring karate films and Hindi musicals.Mr. Ouedraogo continued his education at the Institut d\u2019Hautes \u00c9tudes Cin\u00e9matographiques in Paris. (Burkina Faso is a former French protectorate, and its official language is French.) He received a degree in film studies at the Sorbonne in 1985.Mr. Ouedraogo largely used villagers and other nonprofessional actors in his films. Sometimes, to explain what he was doing, he would have to show them a movie first because they had never seen one. Scripts were often useless because his amateur actors couldn\u2019t read.Throughout his career, Mr. Ouedraogo advocated for better financing for African films \u2014 he would often travel to Paris to secure backing for his \u2014 and for setting a high bar.\u201cI want African cinema to escape from the ghetto, to get more resources,\u201d he told The Guardian in 1991, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see myself as an \u2018African\u2019 director. I think films should be relevant to everybody.\u201dMr. Ouedraogo was sometimes criticized for presenting one particular aspect of Africa \u2014 small stories of village life \u2014 and not taking on subjects like rampant political corruption. But he was unapologetic.\u201cSome people make politics their life,\u201d he told The Guardian in 1991. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dHis most recent feature film, according to the Internet Movie Database, was \u201cKato Kato\u201d in 2006. He also sometimes directed for African television and the theater and produced movies.A list of his survivors was not immediately available, but he had a large extended family, as is evident from the credits on his movies, which are full of Ouedraogos. Although Mr. Ouedraogo once explained that the name is common in his country and that not all people with it are related, many actors and crew members were from his family, which made for an interesting scene at Cannes in 1990.\u201c \u2018Tilai\u2019 takes place in remote African villages made of mud and straw, and is played by a fine cast of barefoot actors, a number of whom are the director\u2019s relatives,\u201d the critic Janet Maslin wrote in The Times. \u201cImmediately after the screening of \u2018Tilai,\u2019 this same group and the director himself appeared at a black-tie festival reception in their dinner clothes and were warmly congratulated by, among others, the director of a film festival in Moscow.\u201cCulture shock in Cannes isn\u2019t just an occupational hazard.

{"Headline": "U.S. Pays Billions for \u2018Assisted Living,\u2019 but What Does It Get?", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal investigators say they have found huge gaps in the regulation of assisted living facilities, a shortfall that they say has potentially jeopardized the care of hundreds of thousands of people served by the booming industry.The federal government lacks even basic information about the quality of assisted living services provided to low-income people on Medicaid, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, says in a report to be issued on Sunday.Billions of dollars in government spending is flowing to the industry even as it operates under a patchwork of vague standards and limited supervision by federal and state authorities. States reported spending more than $10 billion a year in federal and state funds for assisted living services for more than 330,000 Medicaid beneficiaries, an average of more than $30,000 a person, the Government Accountability Office found in a survey of states.States are supposed to keep track of cases involving the abuse, neglect, exploitation or unexplained death of Medicaid beneficiaries in assisted living facilities. But, the report said, more than half of the states were unable to provide information on the number or nature of such cases.Just 22 states were able to provide data on \u201ccritical incidents \u2014 cases of potential or actual harm.\u201d In one year, those states reported a total of more than 22,900 incidents, including the physical, emotional or sexual abuse of residents.Many of those people are \u201cparticularly vulnerable,\u201d the report said, like older adults and people with physical or intellectual disabilities. More than a third of residents are believed to have Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia.The report provides the most detailed look to date at the role of assisted living in Medicaid, one of the nation\u2019s largest health care programs. Titled \u201cImproved Federal Oversight of Beneficiary Health and Welfare Is Needed,\u201d it grew out of a two-year study requested by a bipartisan group of four senators.Assisted living communities are intended to be a bridge between living at home and living in a nursing home. Residents can live in apartments or houses, with a high degree of independence, but can still receive help managing their medications and performing daily activities like bathing, dressing and eating.Nothing in the report disputes the fact that some assisted living facilities provide high-quality, compassionate care.The National Center for Assisted Living, a trade group for providers, said states already had \u201ca robust oversight system\u201d to ensure proper care for residents. In the last two years, it said, several states, including California, Oregon, Rhode Island and Virginia, have adopted laws to enhance licensing requirements and penalties for poor performance.But the new report casts a harsh light on federal oversight, concluding that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has provided \u201cunclear guidance\u201d to states and done little to monitor their use of federal money for assisted living.As a result, it said, the federal health care agency \u201ccannot ensure states are meeting their commitments to protect the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving assisted living services, potentially jeopardizing their care.\u201dCongress has not established standards for assisted living facilities comparable to those for nursing homes. In 1987, Congress adopted a law that strengthened the protection of nursing home residents\u2019 rights, imposed dozens of new requirements on homes and specified the services they must provide.But assisted living facilities have largely escaped such scrutiny even though the Government Accountability Office says the demand for their services is likely to increase because of the aging of the population and increased life expectancy.Carolyn Matthews, a spokeswoman for the company, the Residential Assisted Living Academy, said: \u201cUnfortunately, there has been elderly abuse in this business. We are trying to change the industry so the elderly have better quality care and we are not warehousing them.\u201dThe government report was requested by Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican who is the chairwoman of the Special Committee on Aging; Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, a Republican who is the chairman of the Finance Committee; and two Democratic senators, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.The Trump administration agreed with the auditors\u2019 recommendation that federal officials should clarify the requirement for states to report on the abuse or neglect of people in assisted living facilities. The administration said it was studying whether additional reporting requirements might be needed.\u201cAlthough the federal government has comprehensive information on nursing homes providing Medicaid services, not much is known about Medicaid beneficiaries in assisted living facilities,\u201d the report said.Assisted living was not part of the original Medicaid program, but many states now cover it under waivers intended to encourage \u201chome and community-based services\u201d as an alternative to nursing homes and other institutions.The report said that assisted living could potentially save money for Medicaid because it generally cost less than nursing home care. Under the most common type of waiver, Medicaid covers assisted living only for people who would be eligible for \u201can institutional level of care,\u201d in a nursing home or hospital.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Did Your Pay Raise Go? It May Have Become a Bonus", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA growing preference among employers for one-time awards instead of raises that keep building over time has been quietly transforming the employment landscape for two decades. But it was accelerated by the recession\u2019s intensity, which made employers especially cautious about increasing labor costs.The stream of companies announcing bonuses for their employees in the wake of the newly minted tax cuts is just the latest expression of the trend.There has been \u201ca continuing dramatic shift in the mix of compensation,\u201d Aon Hewitt, the human resources consulting firm, noted last summer in its latest annual survey of company pay practices.In 1991, for example, spending on temporary rewards and bonuses for salaried employees, known as variable pay, accounted for an average of 3.1 percent of total compensation budgets, while salary increases amounted to 5 percent.In 2017, one-time payments consumed 12.7 percent to those budgets; raises amounted to just 2.9 percent.\u201cPressure to increase productivity and minimize costs,\u201d the report concluded, had pushed employers to forgo raises and rely more on short-term awards \u201cas the primary means of rewarding for performance.\u201dOrdinarily, the jobless rate and wage growth are like two ends of a seesaw: When one drops, the other is supposed to rise. But that link seems broken, and like film-noir detectives, analysts have scrutinized hard-edge statistics and fuzzier psychological indicators for clues about why.In the recession that began a decade ago, the businesses most likely to survive tended to be the most conservative spenders, said Douglas G. Duncan, the chief economist at Fannie Mae. That approach was rewarded and has now been reinforced, he said, helping to restrain the growth of full-time work forces and salaries.Aon Hewitt\u2019s annual surveys seem to bear that out. The practice of spending more on variable pay than on permanent raises took root in the 1990s, when growing competition from abroad increased pressure on companies to keep a lid on prices and production costs.Pay-for-performance and other bonuses increasingly functioned as a release valve. Companies could offer more money to attract talent or when profits were strong, and pull back when business was slow.After the recession, the trend accelerated.\u201cThe response in 2009 was unlike any prior response to a recession or depression in that organizations actually reduced salaries, they didn\u2019t just freeze them as a means of allegedly avoiding greater layoffs,\u201d said Ken Abosch, a partner at Aon Hewitt. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a lesson learned from that.\u201d That lesson: Stay nimble.The tax overhaul has prompted hundreds of employers, including at least 40 members of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, to pass on savings to workers.The recessionary hangover encouraged employers to avoid adding fixed costs and to be as flexible as possible in staffing and compensation. The trend toward outsourcing work that was once handled in house as a way of saving money fits in with that story line.The percentage spent on salary increases never returned to its pre-2009 levels, the Aon Hewitt surveys show, while the percentage spent on bonuses and other short-term rewards climbed to new levels. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll see a long-term increase in real wage growth,\u201d Mr. Abosch said.Most bonuses still come in traditional forms: payoffs for executive-suite occupants and deal hunters, or sweeteners for newly hired employees. Certain industries, like finance and insurance, with their longer tradition of year-end and performance-based rewards, continue to have much bigger bonus budgets than sectors like retail.But the practice has expanded. In 1991, fewer than half of companies that Aon Hewitt surveyed had a broad-based rewards program. Last year, 88 percent did.\u201cIt\u2019s now widespread across all industry sectors, even some that were holdbacks such as utilities, health care, not-for-profits and government,\u201d Mr. Abosch said.Salaried workers, rather than hourly wage earners, remain much more likely to be the recipients of such extra payments.If given a choice, most workers would take a raise. When Aon Hewitt asked 2,079 American workers in a second, newly completed survey what they would like to see their employers do with their tax-cut windfall, 65 percent chose a pay raise \u2014 twice as many as any other option, including a bonus or a 401(k) contribution.\u201cIt was appreciated, but it doesn\u2019t fix the long term,\u201d Ms. Gower said of the bonus. \u201cWe need a livable wage that we can support our families off.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTNoam Scheiber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How I Uncovered Volkswagen\u2019s Rigged Monkey Experiments", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt started with an anonymous informer who gave me hundreds of pages of documents from a lawsuit filed against Volkswagen in the United States. Among them was a deposition by Jake McDonald, a scientist at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque.That was weird. What did an Albuquerque lab have to do with Volkswagen?It turned out that a research organization overseen and wholly financed by Volkswagen and other German carmakers had hired Lovelace to test the effects of diesel exhaust on monkeys. By locking 10 monkeys in glass chambers, and exposing them for four hours to diluted exhaust from a Volkswagen Beetle, according to court documents, the carmakers hoped to prove that modern technology had neutralized the toxic effects of diesel fumes, which are blamed for hundreds of thousands of premature deaths.But the experiments were fundamentally flawed. The diesel Volkswagen Beetle used in the experiments was fitted with illegal software that reduced emissions substantially in lab conditions like those in Albuquerque, while allowing profuse amounts of pollution at other times. In other words, the emissions produced by the Beetle in the lab bore little relation to those produced in the real world.In addition, the experiments were plagued with procedural errors, and did not even clearly show that a rigged Volkswagen was less harmful to the monkeys. All the monkeys \u2014 even those in the control group that didn\u2019t breathe any exhaust \u2014 showed signs of inflammation in their lungs. But it wasn\u2019t clear if the inflammation came from the exhaust or from the medical exams conducted before the experiments, which according to court records were not done properly. The experiments produced no useful scientific knowledge.It would have been possible to just write a story about this clumsy attempt to salvage diesel\u2019s declining reputation. But Jim Yardley, the editor on the story, pushed me to broaden the scope and use the monkey experiments as a window into the ways in which automakers have tried to influence the scientific debate about diesel, as well as the methods they use to exert political influence in Berlin and Brussels.That broader story took a lot more reporting. Pinning down how the automakers used the studies to influence public policy was difficult. Environmental groups and lobbyist watchdog organizations told me that when corporations sponsor research, they rarely wave the studies around publicly. Rather, their front organizations manage to get the studies published in scientific journals, obscuring who paid for the research. The findings enter the bloodstream of the body politic, subtly influencing the debate.The front organization that commissioned the monkey experiments and others related to diesel is the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, known by its German initials E.U.G.T. To assess the group\u2019s impact on the debate, I obtained a list of its other studies.I discovered that some of the research had been cited by reputable organizations, including an arm of the British government. One study commissioned by the E.U.G.T., which cast doubt on whether traffic restrictions in cities led to cleaner air, influenced the judges in a court case in Austria to reject a suit by citizens of Graz who were pushing for the creation of a low-emissions zone in the city.Why the outrage over the fate of 10 macaque monkeys when Volkswagen had already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the United States Clean Air Act and other charges? After all, we already knew that diesel exhaust has caused hundreds of thousands of people to die prematurely, and that Volkswagen and other European carmakers took advantage of weak enforcement to mislead the public about how much pollution their vehicles produced.I think the explanation is this: Until the 10 monkeys became part of the story, Volkswagen\u2019s fraud had no identifiable victims. When people die from lung cancer or heart attacks after breathing air polluted by diesel cars, it\u2019s impossible to point the finger at any one carmaker. The ill effects are cumulative and may take years to manifest themselves.The 10 unfortunate monkeys, forced to breathe exhaust so that Volkswagen and the others could sell more cars, provided the scandal with its first specific casualties. They crystallized public frustration with the auto companies\u2019 behavior.As the magazine Der Spiegel wrote in an editorial, \u201cThe faces of our animal relatives opened our eyes to the unscrupulousness of this industry.\u201dIn Germany, the monkey experiments may prompt action that watchdog groups have been seeking for years. Political leaders, fearful that their longtime acquiescence to the auto industry has become a liability, are talking about forcing all lobbyists to register and disclose their contributions to politicians, as they must already do in the United States. There are increasing calls for car companies to retrofit old diesels with better emissions equipment. And during the debate in Parliament, several representatives spoke of a need for \u201cculture change\u201d in the industry, a hint that they may push automakers to change their management.In the days following the publication of my article, the No. 1 question readers asked was what happened to the monkeys \u2014 the answer to which I can now at least partly provide.According to the Albuquerque lab, the 2014 experiments did not kill them, and they were returned to the general population of primates kept by the lab. Their fate since then is unclear \u2014 a spokeswoman for the lab said it shares information about the medical conditions of its animals only with government regulators. But it is safe to say they are among the most influential nonhuman primates in German history.Advertisement"}

And because the growth of the technology industry has played a huge role in California\u2019s recent boom, a drop in company valuations or in venture capital investments would reverberate swiftly through the state\u2019s economy and tax receipts.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to believe we are going to have a recession this year or the next year,\u201d said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm in Los Angeles, referring to Mr. Brown\u2019s grim forecast. \u201cHe\u2019s just pointing out the obvious, which is that things feel good now but there is going to come a time when all hell is going to break loose \u2014 and we better be ready for it.\u201dMr. Brown\u2019s statements highlight California\u2019s distinction as a state of high highs and low lows. From the recession of the early 1990s to the 2001 dot-com crash to the housing collapse of a decade ago, downturns often end up being more pronounced in the state than elsewhere. The next recession, whenever it comes, will almost certainly land harder here than it does in the rest of the country. And that boom-bust pattern is especially tough on California\u2019s budget \u2014 something that Mr. Brown, who was first elected governor more than four decades ago, knows well.In 2009, as the last recession took hold, California state revenue fell 19 percent, versus 8 percent for state revenues nationwide, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. There has been a strong rebound since then, but the gains are unlikely to last. That is because California\u2019s government relies on a heavily progressive income tax that generates most of its revenue from a relatively small number of wealthy taxpayers whose incomes are erratic.\u201cHis successor gets a world in which revenues are more volatile,\u201d without the option of raising taxes, said David Crane, a lecturer in public policy at Stanford University and a former adviser to Mr. Brown\u2019s predecessor, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. \u201cThat\u2019s a really tough world to operate in.\u201dA recession would also further expose problems that have festered for decades. Across California, cities and school districts are having trouble keeping up with ballooning pension obligations, squeezing teacher salaries and state services. In warning about budget troubles to come, Mr. Brown was making a case for adding more of today\u2019s surplus to the state\u2019s rainy day fund to cushion the blow of the next downturn.Still, economists generally agree that the state\u2019s long-term prospects are bright. It is home to many of the world\u2019s most valuable and innovative companies, and it attracts an outsize portion of the skilled work force and venture capital financing, helping it create new industries as old ones slow down or fade away.And recession forecasting is a tough business even for those whose livelihoods depend on it, like Ed Del Beccaro, a senior managing director in the Walnut Creek office of Transwestern, a commercial real estate brokerage. He manages a team of brokers and travels around the Bay Area giving speeches and forecasts to chambers of commerce and other business groups.\u201cTwo years ago I was predicting a recession in September of 2017, and in October I said we were going to have a recession at the end of 2018,\u201d he said. \u201cToday I think that unless we get bombed by North Korea, we will have a pretty amazing two years of growth.\u201dWith a sudden spurt in demand for office space, Mr. Del Beccaro said, he is hiring new workers and spending more on marketing to prospective clients. \u201cI was just authorized to go out and get more brokers and offer them incentives to hopefully get them to switch over from other companies,\u201d he said.But winter will come eventually, and when it does, Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel about planning ahead may help shape how California weathers it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Winter Olympics\u2019 Security on Alert, but Hackers Have a Head Start", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Department of Homeland Security is warning Americans planning to attend the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang that cybercriminals are likely to be targeting the Games.Just how those hacks could lead to broader attacks is not clear. But cybersecurity researchers said the Olympic Games \u2014 more digitized than ever \u2014 are ripe targets for hackers searching for embarrassing information on everyone from athletes to organizers or simply looking to cause trouble by manipulating scoring or lighting systems.More than 300 Olympics-related computer systems have already been hit, with many of them compromised, the security company McAfee said last month, in what its investigators described as a preliminary hacking campaign. On Friday, the second stage of that attack appeared to be underway, as assailants siphoned data from victims\u2019 machines back to their own computers systems, McAfee\u2019s researchers said.Who was doing it and why they were doing it could take several months to figure out. Ryan Sherstobitoff, a senior analyst at McAfee, said the hacks had appeared to be well organized and backed by substantial resources, with \u201cthe hallmarks of a nation state.\u201d What that nation state planned to do with the stolen data and its foothold in victims\u2019 machines, Mr. Sherstobitoff said, was still anyone\u2019s guess.A spokesman for the International Olympic Committee declined to comment on how the organization was addressing the heightened threats.Security researchers often discuss risks with a level of informed paranoia. Some of their warnings are based on what is possible but has not actually occurred in the real world. On other occasions, their warnings are based on what has already happened, and where those incidents could lead.But cyberattacks on international events have become common. The 2015 nuclear negotiations in Geneva and the 2009 climate talks in Copenhagen, for example, were plagued by hackers from various nation states. The Olympics are another alluring target \u2014 but with wall-to-wall television coverage.\u201cThe Olympics involve so many countries, and so many sports, many of which have their own infrastructure, that it has become a rich target environment for many adversaries,\u201d said John Hultquist, director of threat intelligence at the security firm FireEye.He has been tracking the activities of Russian hackers and other groups as they lay the groundwork for attacks on Olympic organizations. In the past few months, Mr. Hultquist said, his team at FireEye has seen several examples of Russian groups tampering with the computers of Olympic-related organizations. The activity is \u201cobviously meant to drag Olympics-related organizations through the mud and discredit them,\u201d he said.Last month, the group posted emails and other documents online from the International Luge Federation, claiming they demonstrated violations of antidoping rules. And earlier in January, the group released hacked emails and documents from the International Olympic Committee, which it advertised as proof \u201cthe Europeans and the Anglo-Saxons are fighting for power and cash in the sports world.\u201d\u201cThe Kremlin has its fingerprints on cyberattacks that were retribution for exposing the Russians\u2019 Sochi games doping scheme, which was a fraud on the purity of sport,\u201d said Doug DePeppe, a founder of Sports ISAO, a nonprofit cybersecurity organization in Colorado Springs. The group is trying to help sports associations, including Olympic organizations, combat threats.\u201cTheir goal is to say, \u2018No one is following the rules, and Russia shouldn\u2019t be singled out,\u2019\u201d Mr. DePeppe said.FireEye, McAfee and other security companies said that over the past few months they had seen attack groups from Russia, and others of unknown origin, dispatch hundreds of \u201cspearphishing\u201d emails, laced with malicious links and attachments, to target Olympic-related groups.They also have seen the groups set up computer servers under the names of some of their targets and seemingly innocuous organizations like the South Korean Ministry of Forestry. They warn that those activities could be a prelude for a broader Russian campaign.The worst-case scenario would be attacks in which hackers tried to shut off lights in a stadium during an event, or perhaps even tampered with electronic timing results, warned Betsy Cooper, the executive director at the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkeley.Over the past few weeks, the United States State Department has set up a temporary security monitoring operation on one floor of its embassy in Seoul. Analysts from the State Department, the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security are scheduled to arrive there this week.But an official who was briefed on the State Department-led operation, and who was not allowed to discuss it publicly, worried that the operation was too focused on combating traditional threats like physical attacks on venues.The State Department did not reply to a request for comment.Elsewhere in Pyeongchang, an alliance of security personnel from South Korea, various Olympic sponsors, technology suppliers and cybersecurity sleuths from around the world are monitoring computer screens and potential threats at the unmarked Security Command Center.Each country participating in the Olympics also has its own security delegation on the ground, with those from the United States and Israel among the largest. Those delegations are busy conducting their own threat assessments and receiving daily threat briefings from South Korean law enforcement authorities.While cybersecurity experts believe the North Korean threat was lessened by the last-minute addition of a North Korean delegation to the Games, they have not ruled out that North Korea may be looking to embarrass its southern neighbor.\u201cOne thing is for certain: We can\u2019t simply rely on these actors to behave themselves in this context,\u201d Mr. Hultquist said. \u201cThey\u2019ve proven, again and again, over the past few years that they are not afraid to flout international norms and create chaos.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anbang Takeover Sends Blunt Message: China Wants to Fix Its Debt Problem", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s top leader has a message for his country\u2019s biggest deal makers that could reverberate across the world: Get your debt under control \u2014 or else.For years, Beijing encouraged big Chinese companies to invest overseas, spreading the country\u2019s wealth and influence beyond its borders. The money transformed global markets and industries.Now, the government wants to rein them in, worried that the debt-fueled spending spree could curtail the country\u2019s growth. A concern is that the companies\u2019 big borrowing binge could weigh on the country\u2019s financial system.The action against Anbang shows China\u2019s companies, banks and other pillars of the country\u2019s economy that President Xi Jinping has embraced financial stability and is serious about curbing China\u2019s addiction to debt. As part of the move, the government also charged Wu Xiaohui, Anbang\u2019s high-flying and politically connected former chairman, with engaging in fraudulent fund-raising and taking company assets.\u201cAll of the animals have now witnessed Wu\u2019s pyre,\u201d said Brock Silvers, the chief executive of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai investment advisory firm, \u201cand everyone in the zoo now understands the message.\u201dBy moving aggressively and publicly, China\u2019s government may give regulators in other countries new reasons to question the political connections and financial backing of Chinese companies hoping to make overseas deals, lest Beijing emerge as an unwelcome new landlord should times get tough. Authorities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have already been ramping up their scrutiny of Chinese deals.Any slackening in the pace of buying could cool deal making and disappoint investors who have reaped windfalls thanks to profligate Chinese spenders.In recent years, Chinese money has helped drive up the prices of real estate, oil fields, hotels and just about any other asset that big companies buy and sell. The purchases have included the strategic (global agribusinesses and energy companies) and the prosaic (movie theaters and video games). Anbang\u2019s corporate empire includes major financial firms in South Korea and the Netherlands, as well as properties worth billions of dollars.In a statement, Anbang said it supported the takeover and would remain private, despite government oversight.\u201cOur business and operations are stable,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are confident that this stable operation will continue under the interim management working group and in the long term.\u201dChinese state media and other official channels provided little guidance on Friday about why Beijing had taken over Anbang or what government ownership might mean. Experts said such a drastic step would have required approval at the highest levels of government.Anbang is in some ways a fitting example of what might be called China Inc. Begun as a modest car insurance company in 2004, it used cheap debt and financial engineering \u2014 sometimes borrowing directly from individuals with promises of big returns \u2014 to build a juggernaut in just a few years. Risk may have built Mr. Wu\u2019s empire, but it also led to the company\u2019s downfall.Now, under official pressure, many of the companies \u2014 a group referred to as the \u201cgray rhinoceroses,\u201d big problems that are ignored until they start moving fast \u2014 are unloading assets. Dalian Wanda last year shed billions of dollars worth of property investments. HNA is paring properties amid analysts\u2019 questions about how it will meet its heavy debt obligations.As official skepticism of Anbang grew, so did public skepticism.But many Chinese regulators had been hesitant to act aggressively, and the pace of enforcing discipline had been slow. With Anbang, the Chinese government may have hoped to set an example, by seizing control rather than engineering a quiet injection of cash from a pliant state company.China\u2019s ambitions, though, are likely to attract renewed scrutiny. Regulators in the United States and elsewhere have been asking tough questions about the ownership and stability of acquisitive Chinese companies. Some lawmakers and White House officials support broadening the authority of regulators who review takeover offers.\u201cAnyone who knows anything about China knows the nature of the party and state and the opacity of company ownership,\u201d said Fraser Howie, a former banker in Asia and a co-writer of three books on the Chinese financial system. \u201cThere was never any excuse for not asking the difficult questions. A lot of foreign regulators just skipped over them and were far too relaxed in their approach.\u201dMore than $4 billion worth of deals by Dalian Wanda, HNA and Fosun, including some in China, await approval, according to Dealogic, a data provider.It is not clear what will happen to Anbang\u2019s overseas properties, including the Waldorf Astoria, which is undergoing an expensive renovation. Anbang spent $15 billion on high-profile overseas deals from 2009 to 2017, according to Dealogic. The acquisitions included well-known hotels in London, Manhattan, Mexico and Paris; insurance companies in South Korea and the Netherlands; and even a stake in Woori Bank, once among South Korea\u2019s largest lenders. Woori could not be reached for comment.A Vivat spokeswoman said that \u201cas for now,\u201d the government takeover of Anbang would \u201cnot affect Vivat or its clients.\u201d She added that the insurer was subject to Dutch laws and regulations and monitored by Dutch supervisory authorities.Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley reported from Beijing and Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong.

The space station is currently scheduled to operate through 2024, but the expectation was that it would be extended through at least 2028.The budget numbers were confirmed by a person who was not authorized to talk publicly about them.In future years, the administration would like NASA\u2019s spending to drop to $19.6 billion and stay flat through 2023. With inflation, NASA\u2019s buying power would erode, effectively a budget cut each year.A NASA spokesman said he could not discuss the budget proposal until it was released.The proposal is just an opening bid. Congress decides the final spending numbers, sometimes adjusting them or ignoring a president\u2019s priorities. But an administration\u2019s wishes are often incorporated.Additionally, no one has been nominated for the No. 2 position, deputy administrator.\u201cI hope that those reports prove as unfounded as Bigfoot,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness, said on Wednesday during a Federal Aviation Administration conference on commercial space transportation.He decried \u201cnumbskulls\u201d at the Office of Management and Budget in the White House for coming up with the idea. \u201cAs a fiscal conservative, you know one of the dumbest things you can do?\u201d he said. \u201cCanceling programs after billions in investment when there is still serious usable life in it.\u201dThe same conference was attended by Scott Pace, the executive secretary of Mr. Pence\u2019s space council. While he did not discuss details of the budget, Mr. Pace suggested that money needed to be freed up for new initiatives.For NASA to push human spaceflight further, he said, \u201cthe kinds of commitment of resources that traditionally we\u2019ve done in low-earth orbit, we can direct some of that toward deeper space exploration.\u201dThe budget proposal promises \u201ca seamless transition to the use of future commercial capabilities,\u201d and allocates $150 million in 2019 to encourage commercial development in low-Earth orbit.The administration proposes $900 million for this goal through 2023. If structured like earlier NASA public-private partnerships, like the ones for carrying cargo and crew to the space station, the money would be split between two or more companies.By contrast, the United States has spent close to $100 billion building and operating the International Space Station.But space experts so far do not see how that would be viable economically because NASA currently spends $3 billion to $4 billion a year.\u201cI haven\u2019t really seen anyone talking about that,\u201d said Tommy Sanford, the executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group representing many of the new space companies. \u201cI think that\u2019d be difficult.\u201dMr. Sanford said the federation was concerned about setting a specific end date. He said it would be better to define benchmarks that commercial alternatives would need to achieve before the International Space Station is retired.In recent years, more companies have started using the station in areas like pharmaceutical research and manufacturing of fiber optical cable.\u201cIf we abruptly end that, without a smooth transition plan,\u201d John Elbon, vice president and general manager of space exploration at Boeing, said at last week\u2019s conference, \u201call that investment will be for naught.\u201dFor a greater focus on the moon, the budget plan describes investing in commercial companies to develop and fly robotic landers to carry experiments and other payloads to the moon.Those companies could include Moon Express and Astrobotic Technology, two companies originally created to compete for a $20 million grand prize in the Google Lunar X Prize. The X Prize Foundation conceded last month that none of the remaining competitors would be able to reach the moon before the prize expires on March 31. Both companies still plan to head to the moon in the next couple of years.In addition, Blue Origin, a space company started by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has proposed a larger lander called Blue Moon that could deliver several tons of cargo to the surface of the moon.Efforts to increase research and development aimed at next-generation space technologies for a range of human and robotic missions, one of the priorities of the Obama administration\u2019s space policy, would be refocused on nearer-term development on moon missions.For astronauts, the goal is still to reach \u201cthe vicinity of the moon\u201d in 2023. That is the current schedule for the first crewed launch of the Space Launch System, which would fly around the moon but not land.Under the proposed timeline, work on a lander would not start until that year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Profits Drove a Stock Boom. Did the Economy Pay a Price?", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneStocks are too expensive.This is not a market forecast. I wouldn\u2019t be particularly surprised if the Dow shrugged off its recent turbulence and continued its long upward thrust. What I contend is that if the American economy behaved in the way that most economists say market economies should, stocks would in all likelihood be cheaper.It is a grim proposition. Wall Street\u2019s titans might welcome the fact that equity prices have grossly exceeded what a well-functioning, competitive economy should deliver. But for almost everybody else, it amounts to a disaster. From wage stagnation to the depressed investment rates that are holding back long-term economic growth, many of the fault lines running through the American economy can be traced back to the same root cause powering the rise of America\u2019s overpriced stocks.What makes this particularly puzzling for scholars reared on the classical models of competitive economies is that all this happened despite a persistent decline in real interest rates. In a more orthodox economy, declining rates on corporate bonds would encourage a surge in corporate investment. As companies invested more and more capital, the returns on investments would gradually decline until companies\u2019 returns matched their cost of capital: the interest rate they pay to borrow.Stock markets have recently fallen over fears that economic growth is too strong. Here\u2019s why, and one way how steep, sustained sell-offs could end up hurting the economy.In a nutshell, the United States has built an economy where businesses don\u2019t invest even though it has rarely been cheaper to finance investment. Still, they reap spectacular profits that warrant runaway share prices.What happened? It turns out that there is one straightforward reason for the American economy\u2019s unorthodox behavior. As Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues argue, the standard economic theory based on competitive markets cannot apply when markets are not competitive. And competition, in the United States, is shriveling.The scholars argue that the American economy is afflicted by \u201crents\u201d \u2014 returns in excess of what investments would yield in a competitive economy, where fat margins are quickly whittled away by competition.These rents don\u2019t fall from the sky. Companies free of competitive pressures, with the power to set prices more or less at will, squeeze them from their customers and their workers. They pad corporate profits and send stock prices sky high.Global inequality, after widening for decades, has stabilized. The share of the world\u2019s income captured by the top 1 percent has shrunk since its peak on the eve of the financial crisis.Executives love it. The critical question is what these rents hold in store for the rest of us.Still, there are good reasons to worry about rising rents, no matter where they come from. Mr. Shapiro argues that while some measures of market concentration may not be meaningful, persistently high profits are of themselves a cause for concern.Profits as a share of output have risen by half over the last 30 years. Combined with evidence that large corporations are accounting for an increasing share of revenue and employment, Mr. Shapiro writes, \u201cit certainly appears that many large U.S. corporations are earning substantial incumbency rents, and have been doing so for at least 10 years, apart from during the depths of the Great Recession.\u201dThis is particularly true in the tech sector, where a handful of dominant companies \u2014 you know the ones I\u2019m talking about \u2014 have sustained spectacular profits for years. Their sky-high stock prices suggest that investors expect high profits to continue as well.\u201cThey probably are geniuses; what they are doing is wonderful,\u201d Mr. Shapiro told me. \u201cStill, you would expect competition to erode away the excess profits over time.\u201dHere is why we should worry.Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues built an alternative model of the American economy by doing away with the assumption of perfect competition. They contend that there are barriers to entry that stop competitors and allow rents to persist.In this economy, stock prices don\u2019t just reflect the future stream of normal economic returns that would accrue to a company\u2019s capital investment. They also include a claim to a stream of rents that generate \u201cpure profits.\u201d These profits can\u2019t be replicated by another company\u2019s capital investment. They are owned by a specific company.Rents interfere with incentives in a big way. Companies will spend more time and effort trying to preserve those rents \u2014 often by working to block rivals from their markets. Rivals will fight to grab a share of those rents for themselves, perhaps through lobbying. Amid all this jockeying, investment in productive capabilities will most likely be neglected as a secondary consideration.And inevitably, inequality will rise: The owners of the shares in the powerful corporations capturing the economy\u2019s growing monopoly rents will peel further and further away from the average Jane and Joe, who own little but their labor.This is not the kind of economy proposed by classical economic theory. It is not the kind of country portrayed by evangelists of the American dream. But it looks as if we are stuck with it, regardless of what the stock market does tomorrow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Olympians Drink a Lot of (Nonalcoholic) Beer, and Win a Lot of Gold Medals", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Simon Schempp, a biathlete on the German Olympic team, was training for the Pyeongchang Games, he often capped a hard day on the trail with a bottle of nonalcoholic beer. He enjoys the taste of beer like most Germans, who drink more of it per capita than the people of almost any other nation. But he drank the nonalcoholic variety for more than just the flavor.\u201cIt\u2019s a really good drink directly after training or after competition,\u201d said Schempp, who won a silver medal in the 15-kilometer mass start event on Sunday.Schempp\u2019s sober assessment is popular in Germany. While most people see nonalcoholic beer as a responsible replacement for regular beer, Germans often drink it in place of sports drinks after exercise. Beer or Gatorade? No contest.Johannes Scherr, the doctor for the German Olympic ski team, said nearly all of his athletes drink nonalcoholic beer during training. And the brewery Krombacher has supplied 3,500 liters (about 1,000 gallons) of nonalcoholic beer to the athletes\u2019 village so German athletes can enjoy it during competitions at the Pyeongchang Games, where Germany is tied for the most gold medals.German beer companies originally marketed nonalcoholic beer as the \u201ccar driver\u2019s beer\u201d after it was invented in East Germany in 1973. A decade ago, Scherr, who also teaches sports medicine at the Technical University of Munich, noticed that beer companies were beginning to pitch their nonalcoholic products to health-conscious consumers.\u201cA lot of companies tried to associate beer, especially nonalcoholic beer, and sports,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there wasn\u2019t any scientific background behind it.\u201d\u201cThis was pretty surprising to us,\u201d said Scherr, who published the results in the peer-reviewed journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise.If nonalcoholic beer helped athletes recover more quickly from grueling workouts, then it could allow them to train harder. Scherr credits the nonalcoholic beer\u2019s salubrious effects to its high concentration of polyphenols, immune-boosting chemicals from the plants with which its brewed.\u201cAfter that, we really had the proof: It\u2019s really healthy and not only a marketing gag,\u201d said Holger Eichele, the chief executive of the German Brewers Association. From 2011 to 2016, German consumption of nonalcoholic beer grew 43 percent even as overall beer consumption declined, according to Euromonitor International. New brewing techniques helped to diversify and improve the flavor, and now there are more than 400 nonalcoholic beers on the market in Germany. Germans drink more nonalcoholic beer than any nation, except Iran.\u201cIt tastes good, and it\u2019s good for the body,\u201d Linus Strasser, an Alpine skier from Munich, said on Sunday after finishing his second run in the men\u2019s giant slalom. \u201cAlcohol-free wheat beer, for example, is extremely healthy. It\u2019s isotonic. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good for us sports guys.\u201dMany breweries market their nonalcoholic beers explicitly as sports drinks. The Bavarian brewery Erdinger, for instance, calls its nonalcoholic wheat beer \u201cthe isotonic thirst quencher for athletes\u201d and advertises it with the motto, \u201c100% Performance. 100% Regeneration.\u201d Heineken promotes its nonalcoholic beer Heineken 0.0 with lines like, \u201cThere is no limit to what the human body can achieve,\u201d and recently struck a deal to sell Heineken 0.0 in the vending machines at McFit Fitness, Germany\u2019s largest chain of gyms. At most major German marathons, nonalcoholic beer is available to runners at the finish line. Erdinger handed out 30,000 bottles at the Berlin Marathon last year.Sales have been helped by the fact that traditional sports beverages, like Gatorade, are not particularly popular in Germany. Nonalcoholic beer has a lower sugar content compared with many sports drinks, and Germans drank three times as much nonalcoholic beer as they did sports drinks in 2016.Moritz Geisreiter, a German speedskater, said he drank nonalcoholic beer from the grocery store before switching to a specialized sports beverage designed by a nutritionist. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice solution for someone who doesn\u2019t want to pay dozens of euros a week for a nutrition drink,\u201d he said last week at the Olympic skating oval in Gangneung, South Korea.Scherr doesn\u2019t prescribe nonalcoholic beer to the German Olympic skiers. Most of them are Bavarian and drink it on their own. He usually recommends that athletes drink a nonalcoholic beer after exercise, but a 2016 study by Chilean researchers in the peer-reviewed journal Nutrients also found that nonalcoholic beer before a workout helped soccer players stay hydrated compared to regular beer and water. Scherr also believes it benefits most endurance athletes and may be less helpful in sprint or strength-based competitions, where inflammation is less of a problem.Despite its demonstrated benefits, nonalcoholic beer has been slower to catch on with athletes from other countries. When the Ethiopian runner Guye Adola finished second at last year\u2019s Berlin Marathon, setting the record for the fastest-ever marathon debut, he did not take a sip from the enormous mug of Erdinger nonalcoholic beer that was handed to him when he finished.\u201cI was scared that it might contain alcohol and I didn\u2019t want to add to my fatigue,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn our country, we don\u2019t have such stuff at the finish line.\u201dOf course, at the finish line, after months of training, many German athletes crave something with a kick \u2014 which is why Krombacher also shipped 11,000 liters of regular beer to South Korea.\u201cSometimes an alcoholic beer can also be good,\u201d Strasser said with a smile.Ben Crair reported from Berlin, and Andrew Keh from Pyeongchang, South Korea.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Build Kenya\u2019s First Coal Plant? Hint: Think China", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe plan\u2019s champions, including senior Kenyan officials, say the plant will help meet the country\u2019s fast-growing demand for electricity and draw investment. Its critics worry that it will damage the area\u2019s fragile marine ecosystem, threaten the livelihoods of fishing communities and pollute the air.The plan embodies a contradiction of Chinese global climate leadership: The country\u2019s huge coal sector is turning outward in search of new markets as coal projects contract at home. A Chinese multinational is tapped to build the $2 billion, 975-acre project, and a Chinese bank is helping to finance it. The project is among hundreds of coal-fired power plants that Chinese companies are helping to build or finance around the world.Coal could upend those goals.\u201cI see no reason for them to do it,\u201d said Erik Solheim, head of the United Nations Environment Program, which is based in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. \u201cThey should invest heavily in hydro, solar, wind. They are already, but they could do even more.\u201dNot least, Mr. Solheim said in an interview, the rapidly falling price of renewable energy sources makes a coal-fired power project \u201cmuch less viable.\u201dThe port town of Lamu, established in the 14th century within an archipelago of small islands near Somalia, is among the oldest continually inhabited places on Africa\u2019s Indian Ocean coast. Arab traders sailed here in their wooden dhows on their way south to Zanzibar. They brought dates and steel utensils from Arabia; they took back mangrove logs and cowrie shells.All morning long, along the old town seafront, men unload mangrove logs and palm fronds. Fishers bring in their catches. No cars are allowed in the old town. The only taxis in its narrow lanes are donkeys. The once-thriving tourism industry has shrunk sharply because of a series of attacks by the Somalia-based terrorist group known as the Shabab.To get to the coal plant site from Lamu town, you have to hire a boat to cross the channel and then drive along a sandy path. Cashews grow amid the wilderness. There are patches of sesame, kitchen gardens of watermelon and papaya, and a lot of uncertainty in the air. No one here has seen a coal plant before. No one really knows how it will affect them.Shebwana Mohammed, an 18-year-old who was riding his bicycle near the project site, said he felt a mixture of worry and hope. \u201cIf it comes with a job I\u2019m ready to take it,\u201d he ventured.An older man, Mohammed Shee, who grows cassava and cashews on the edges of the plant site, said he had lost a few trees when the road was built. He didn\u2019t know what to make of the project, though he said he worried about the forest. \u201cIf the trees dry up how will a farmer survive?\u201d he wondered aloud.Whether Kenya needs coal-fired electricity is a matter of dispute, with some energy analysts concluding that wind and geothermal sources could generate enough electricity and be more cost-effective.Then, there is the matter of where the coal would come from. The plant developer, a Kenyan consortium called Amu Power, plans to import coal initially; only later would a Kenyan coal mine, far in the country\u2019s interior, come online.The environment secretary at the Kenyan Environment Ministry, Alice Akinyi Kaudia, was skeptical of the project\u2019s utility, saying that it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d to her country\u2019s commitment to reduce emissions under the Paris climate accord.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.The Lamu project has backing at the top of the government, though.A lawsuit by a local group, filed in November 2016 in Kenya\u2019s National Environmental Tribunal, has stopped construction in its tracks. For now, no smokestacks tower over the baobabs; the only signs of construction are concrete discs that demarcate the forest and farmland acquired for the plant.In court documents, the national environmental management authority, a semiautonomous agency within the Environment Ministry that reviews the impact of development projects, said it had approved the proposal. It maintained that \u201call environmental concerns were considered and mitigation measures were recommended,\u201d and asked that what it called the \u201cmisconceived\u201d lawsuit be dismissed.For its part, Amu Power said that the plant would offer what Kenya needs most to attract investment: electricity to power a big road-and-rail project to connect its landlocked neighbors to a new port, also under construction in Lamu.The plant would use seawater for cooling. The discharged water, said Cyrus Kirima, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, would be warmed by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit but would not harm marine life.As for its carbon footprint, Mr. Kirima was eager to point out that Kenya\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are a fraction of the levels of industrialized countries.\u201cYou need to do business,\u201d Mr. Kirima said. \u201cYou need investment. It\u2019s not as though Kenya is out in top gear to build coal plants.\u201dThe same cannot be said for China, though.\u201cAs China has reduced its dependence on coal domestically it has expanded overseas, to relieve excess domestic capacity,\u201d said Katharine Lu, who researches energy investments at Friends of the Earth, an environmental lobby group.In Lamu, another constituency stands to gain, at least in the short-term: An estimated 600 households whose land has been acquired for the project are in line for financial compensation, which helped to explain why Abdul Rahman Abdi, a local mangrove timber dealer, was bullish on the idea.Mr. Abdi bought 19 acres within the project site three years ago. He said he had been reassured by government officials \u2014 the deputy president, William Ruto, came to Lamu to speak to residents \u2014 that the project would enrich rather than damage the area. \u201cThey assure us they\u2019re going to bring a lot of money with this project,\u201d he said. \u201cThey assure us that they\u2019re not crazy.\u201dMr. Abdi has paid a personal price in the fight over the plant. He has fallen out with a lifelong friend, Walid Ahmed Ali, who has spent the last two years roaming from island to island with Save Lamu, the group that is suing to stop the project, telling people that a coal plant could ruin their air and water and ultimately their livelihoods.It is not a popular position, Mr. Ahmed Ali and his colleagues acknowledge. People call them names. Friends dismiss them as enemies of progress. Even a few relatives turn their backs.Compared to the compensation money on the table, their warnings about the future seem vague.\u201cThis is the only place we call home, the only place we have relatives and families,\u201d Omar Elmawi, the national liaison officer of Save Lamu said in his second-floor office. Its walls are plastered with maps of the region, marked by symbols of natural riches: coral, lobster, sea cucumber.\u201cYou can never get enough compensation to evacuate everyone,\u201d he said.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guatemala Arrests Ex-President and His Finance Minister in Corruption Case", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Former President \u00c1lvaro Colom of Guatemala and his finance minister, who is now the chairman of Oxfam International, were arrested Tuesday in a graft case that is the latest chapter in the country\u2019s sweeping attack on corruption.The police arrested Mr. Colom and nine former members of his cabinet in early-morning raids after a long-running investigation into fraud involving a new bus system in Guatemala City.Mr. Colom is the fourth former president of Guatemala to face corruption charges as a result of investigations led by an international panel of prosecutors trying to break up networks of corruption and end impunity.Mr. Colom and his former finance minister, Juan Alberto Fuentes Knight, appeared at an initial court hearing in Guatemala City along with other former cabinet members, and were then placed in detention until a hearing scheduled for next week. Mr. Fuentes Knight, a well-regarded economist, has been the chairman of Oxfam International, a confederation of charitable organizations, since 2015.\u201cFor us, everything was legal,\u201d Mr. Colom, a social democrat who was Guatemala\u2019s president from 2008 to 2012, said before the hearing. \u201cI am sure there will be nothing at the end.\u201dProsecutors said Tuesday that $35 million in government money had been paid to a consortium of private bus companies in charge of the system, known as the Transurbano, in a deal approved by Mr. Colom, Mr. Fuentes Knight and other ministers without proper legal oversight. Almost a third of the money was spent on equipment that was never used, prosecutors said, and it was unclear how the rest was spent.Rafael Espada, who was Mr. Colom\u2019s vice president, told a local radio station that he had warned the president that the bus project lacked sufficient oversight. \u201cSeveral of those arrested today have done good things for their country, but anyone who by action or omission has exceeded the law should be responsible for their actions,\u201d said Mr. Espada, who was not among those implicated.Oxfam International\u2019s executive director, Winnie Byanyima, said that Mr. Fuentes Knight had informed the charity that he had \u201ccooperated fully with the investigation in the confidence he did not knowingly transgress rules or procedures.\u201dMr. Fuentes Knight said before Tuesday\u2019s hearing that he had warned against continuing government payments to the bus companies, citing \u201canomalies.\u201dIn the decade since the Guatemalan government invited the United Nations-backed anti-corruption panel to work alongside the attorney general\u2019s office, a series of investigations have uncovered graft reaching to the top of the political establishment.Through it all, Mr. Colom had remained above the fray and become an elder statesman in Latin America, leading observer missions to monitor regional elections. Two weeks ago, the secretary general of the Organization of American States appointed Mr. Colom to mediate a political crisis in Honduras after contested elections there. Among his tasks in Honduras was to defend a new anti-corruption commission \u2014 modeled after the one in Guatemala that has now charged him.Nic Wirtz contributed reporting from Guatemala City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Good Health Care Deal, but Only for Some", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHere\u2019s the good news about the announcement this week that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase are forming a new company to cover health care for their employees: If you\u2019re one of the million-plus people who work at these companies, or a family member of one, you\u2019re likely to get cheaper, better health care pretty soon.Here\u2019s the bad news: If you\u2019re one of the approximately 300 million other Americans, you might not see savings for a long time, if ever. And in the short term at least, you could be hit by bigger medical bills.Together, these three behemoth corporations will be able to wrest great deals and discounts in their negotiations from hospital systems, drug manufacturers, medical device makers and doctors\u2019 groups. These are likely to be better deals than what lesser companies can wrangle.Now, with Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon forming a new health care company, employers will have an intimidating proxy warrior in their battles over the $3 trillion United States health care market.Medicare, by law, is not allowed to negotiate discounts on drug prices. But you can bet Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire will. Millions of American companies do not have the power, knowledge or data to drive down prices charged by labs or hospitals. But this new company most likely will.Recent history shows that when the medical system loses income from one sector (in this case, three huge corporations), it is adept at making up for it in another. As the Goliaths wrestle over how much they should pay or be paid, the Davids \u2014 small companies, individuals who purchase their own insurance and the uninsured \u2014 are often left footing the bill.Those bills can be astronomical, like $5,000 for an M.R.I. scan or $100,000 for knee replacement surgery. Hospital systems argue that they have to charge such prices because government insurers \u2014 Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 don\u2019t pay enough to cover their costs. Medicare disputes that. And \u201ccovering their costs\u201d is a fungible calculation that can include multimillion-dollar executive salaries.Commercial insurers negotiate down from those high prices. But while good negotiators can get great deals, others will miss out. And the uninsured often get bills \u2014 and collection notices \u2014 asking them to pay the highest prices of all.The pharmaceutical industry knows it will need Amazon to deliver drugs. Hospitals might want Chase to finance equipment purchases. And who would dare alienate Warren Buffett, who has called health care costs \u201ca hungry tapeworm on the American economy\u201d? The three titans are also likely to insist that the best hospitals \u2014 the Sloan Ketterings and Cleveland Clinics \u2014 be available to their workers.Yes, they may use technology in smarter ways to benefit patients. This might include home monitoring of heart rhythms and blood sugar; diagnosing via telemedicine and iPad; delivering prescription medicines to doorsteps; and bringing medicine into the 21st century with online billing and payment. They may also be able to provide employees some degree of pricing transparency so that they can make better choices.In doing so they will probably be able to reduce the high administrative costs associated with our health care system, an estimated 25 percent of hospital spending, and give patients more control of their care.How can the rest of us get in on the deal? If the new health care company permits outside firms and individuals to buy into whatever they create, that could set off a revolution. That new company would, essentially, become a novel insurer \u2014 although one that is cheaper, more efficient and patient-friendly. And that could be good for the entire health care system.But what if the three corporations try to turn their health care company into a profit center? This week\u2019s announcement said the new company is \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d That doesn\u2019t quite say \u201cnonprofit.\u201d If the long-term game plan of the Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire offshoot is to function as a business that is sold to the rest of us to please shareholders, then we may end up pretty much back where we started. And that is not where we want to be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Skadden, the Giant Law Firm, Got Entangled in the Mueller Investigation", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe interest of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in Skadden appears to go beyond Mr. van der Zwaan. Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has requested and received documents from Skadden related to its Ukraine work, according to two lawyers familiar with the investigation. The special counsel has investigated $4 million in secret payments that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates are accused of funneling to Skadden and other firms from accounts in Cyprus, and could get more information on Skadden from Mr. Gates, who worked closely with the firm. Lawyers at Skadden are on edge, according to people who have worked with the firm.Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry threatens the delicate balance that Skadden has struck between lucrative sources of revenue. The firm has made huge profits from corporate work for image-conscious United States companies, while also representing riskier international clients, such as Russian oligarchs and companies with close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin and former Soviet states.\u201cThe mentality is that Skadden wouldn\u2019t be afraid of doing something like this, if there was a chance to utilize their skills and status to take advantage of what sounds like a very lucrative business, and they saw no legal or ethical proscription against their taking on the matter,\u201d he said.Skadden\u2019s work is part of a trend in recent years of lobbyists and lawyers earning increasingly larger paydays by marketing their connections in Washington to foreign politicians, countries and companies willing to pay hefty fees to burnish their reputations in the United States and on the international stage.Among those reaping windfalls are large international law firms like the Washington-based Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, which represents the governments of Japan, the Maldives, Nicaragua and South Korea, among others.Those firms, which have not been accused of impropriety, disclosed the foreign contracts to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law requires anyone who lobbies or does public relations for foreign individuals, companies, governments and political parties to reveal detailed information about their work and payments for it. The act is intended to prevent foreign actors from surreptitiously influencing American public policy.\u201cThis is creating concern in the Washington lobbying community about not only complying with FARA, but also a new emphasis on enforcement that perhaps folks didn\u2019t think was happening or would happen,\u201d said Thomas J. Spulak, a lawyer in the Washington office of King & Spalding who specializes in lobbying compliance.Mr. Mueller has scrutinized Skadden on two fronts \u2014 its own work for Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government, and its role advising to two other powerhouse Washington lobbying firms paid to bolster his government, Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group.Skadden\u2019s opinion, which was written by a partner, Kenneth A. Gross, and an associate, and was reviewed by The New York Times, asserted that the firms were not required to register because their client, the Brussels-based European Center for a Modern Ukraine, \u201cis a private nongovernmental organization\u201d not controlled or funded by a foreign government or political party.Despite Mr. Gates\u2019s admission that he misled Skadden, people who worked with Podesta and Mercury privately blame the law firm for the faulty guidance.Mercury, which relied on Skadden for years for FARA advice and for assistance last year in responding to subpoenas from the special counsel, is no longer working with Skadden, according to three people in the lobbying industry who were briefed on the change.Mercury said in a statement that it \u201cacted appropriately, following our counsel\u2019s advice from the start.\u201d The firm said that Mr. Gates, in pleading guilty, admitted that he \u201cdidn\u2019t tell the truth to our lawyers when he spoke to them about this project.\u201dRepresentatives from Podesta as well as Mr. Gross declined to comment.Skadden has been cooperating with prosecutors, a spokeswoman, Melissa Porter, said in a statement. Lawrence S. Spiegel, a partner who specializes in government enforcement and white-collar crime, has been assigned to handle interactions with the special counsel, and Ms. Porter noted that the firm dismissed Mr. van der Zwaan and said that the lying charges he pleaded guilty to are \u201ccontrary to our values, policies and expectations.\u201dBut Skadden may not be able to limit its legal exposure by distancing itself from Mr. van der Zwaan if the special counsel can implicate the firm in wrongdoing in the work or payments on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government, said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics.\u201cWhy he was lying is a big question, and did anyone else at the law firm know he was lying?\u201d Ms. Roiphe said. \u201cIf he was lying for his own purposes, I don\u2019t think that knowledge would be imputed to other lawyers at the firm.\u201dThe answers to those questions are not entirely clear.Mr. van der Zwaan admitted misleading prosecutors about two conversations in September 2016 with Mr. Gates and an unidentified business associate of Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort. They discussed their belief that Skadden\u2019s work for Mr. Yanukovych exposed the firm to possible criminal charges in Ukraine. No such charges have been filed.After the conversation with the business associate, prosecutors said, Mr. van der Zwaan called the senior Skadden lawyer on the Ukrainian project, Gregory B. Craig, who served as the White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Court filings do not reveal what was discussed, and Mr. Craig was not identified by name by prosecutors.Adding a layer of intrigue, a consultant who worked on the report said that it was facilitated in part by Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a former Russian Army linguist and longtime associate of Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort who is \u201cassessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service,\u201d according to court papers. Mr. Kilimnik did not respond to a request for comment.Skadden did not respond to questions about the financing of its Ukraine work, but it said in a statement that the report was independent and noted that it found that Ms. Tymoshenko \u201cwas denied basic rights under Western legal standards.\u201dThe Washington lobbyists who worked on the issue with Mercury and Podesta said that Mr. Craig himself was involved in promoting the report to journalists and members of Congress \u2014 activity that experts said should have prompted FARA registration requirements.Skadden internally reviewed the FARA implications of its Ukraine work before deciding not to register, according to the consultant who worked with the firm on the report.Ms. Porter, the Skadden spokeswoman, said that neither Mr. Craig nor any of the firm\u2019s other lawyers \u201cengaged in any activity that required them or the firm to register under FARA.\u201d Mr. Craig did not respond to requests for comment.And last year, as the Justice Department was inquiring about the Ukrainian work, Skadden returned about half of the reported $1.1 million it was paid by the Ukrainian government.Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and Matthew Goldstein from New York. Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting from Washington. Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When \u2018Reform\u2019 Means a Process of Elimination", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsThis air of positivity helps explain why nearly every policy proposal in Washington ends up advertised as a reform. Slashing taxes on the wealthy is \u201ctax reform.\u201d Repealing Obamacare is \u201chealth care reform.\u201d Building a wall along the Mexican border is \u201cimmigration reform\u201d \u2014 but so is finding a path to citizenship for Dreamers. In his State of the Union address, President Trump mentioned reform nine times, describing solutions for problems ranging from border control to opioid addiction and hailing \u2014 to thunderous applause, if not high factual standards \u2014 the recent passage of \u201cthe biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.\u201dReform lives and breathes good intentions. It declares the existence of a concrete problem that really does need to be solved. Political enemies are forced onto the defensive: Opposing reform means defending the status quo, no matter how bloated or feckless the current state of affairs may be. This tactic is particularly useful when so-called reformers hope to gut the very programs they\u2019re claiming to improve. \u201cWelfare reform\u201d set that template in the 1990s, purporting to free Americans from dependency by giving them a whole lot less welfare. Attempts at \u201creforming\u201d Obamacare, in 2017, meant getting rid of as many of its provisions as possible.All this reflects the continued hollowing out of our political language, in which words often generate emotion without producing meaning. \u201cReform,\u201d these days, may purport to fix things, but it tends to evade the hard work of defining either a problem or a solution. It posits a self-evident consensus \u2014 about a system\u2019s failures, and about what might be preferable \u2014 where none exists.The shift toward reform as a matter of public policy came with the rise of industrial capitalism. By the early 20th century, middle-class Americans found themselves awash in social crises: overcrowded cities, political corruption, mass immigration, wild disparities of wealth. But they were also surrounded by new ideas about how to solve those problems, from a muckraking press to the budding expertise of social scientists, who promised that humans could understand and fix large-scale problems. From this mix came the idea of \u201creform\u201d as a way to adjust society to cope with its new realities \u2014 and the image of \u201creformers\u201d as a special breed of educated do-gooders. Crusading intellectuals like Jane Addams and John Dewey came to epitomize this type: privileged members of society who put their talents to work devising new ways to help the poor or to educate children, aiming to liberate the human spirit to reach its full potential.Progressive reformers helped bring about tenement laws and income taxes, trustbusting and labor protections, women\u2019s suffrage and the direct election of senators. Some of these measures tried to rein in the capitalist beast, returning the country to an age of yeoman farmers and small-scale producers; others embraced the modern dream of organizing human activity in ever more rational, efficient ways. In either case, some Americans wanted none of it, and saw \u201creform\u201d as perilously close to an elite conspiracy. The era\u2019s conservatives insisted that human nature \u2014 and therefore human society \u2014 was irredeemably imperfect, and that too much mucking around with social legislation bred an overreaching, tyrannical government. Left-wing radicals often disliked such projects, too, insisting that the dribs and drabs of reform were a bourgeois project that only delayed what really needed to be done, which was obviously revolution. In her famous 1899 essay \u201cReform or Revolution,\u201d the German socialist Rosa Luxemburg argued that reform should never be an end in itself, but that agitating for it could be a means of preparing for the final confrontation with capitalism.These tensions lasted well into the New Deal, the crowning years of America\u2019s enthusiasm for reform. New Dealers held on to progressive ideas while sloughing off some of the moralizing. Over time, though, their economic policies ushered in what the historian Alan Brinkley has described, in the title of a 1995 book, as \u201cThe End of Reform.\u201d The New Deal, he wrote, grew from a complex tradition of progressive reform, then \u201cattached the word \u2018liberalism\u2019 to it, and set about transforming it.\u201d The new liberals ultimately pinned their hopes on economic growth and Keynesian tinkering, not the trickier task of actively redistributing wealth and power. Over the decades that followed, they would orient themselves increasingly toward civil and social rights rather than sweeping economic reform, a subtle but important shift.This may have spelled the \u201cend\u201d of a certain mode of reform, but it did little to change reform\u2019s association with progressives and liberals \u2014 even when it was taken up by their opponents. In 1955, the historian Richard Hofstadter published a book whose title named the period from the 1890s through the 1940s \u201cThe Age of Reform.\u201d He accepted as axiomatic that reformers came from \u201cthe side of the left in American history.\u201d Still, he noted, there was now a tendency among conservative politicians to claim \u201creform\u201d and \u201creformer\u201d as gauzy, feel-good labels. \u201cWe usually reserve our highest acclaim for the politician who has in him a touch of the liberal reformer,\u201d Hofstadter wrote. As a result, any talented conservative politician learned how to \u201cexert his maximal influence by using the rhetoric of progressivism and winning the plaudits of the reformers\u201d \u2014 while otherwise working against what most progressives would want.Six decades later, a similar impulse seems to hold sway in Washington. While Democrats search for a muscular patriotic language to win back Trump voters (or galvanize their own), Republicans and conservatives seem happy enough to claim the gentler mantle of reform, especially when facing popular skepticism or outright hostility toward their policy proposals. Having accomplished \u201ctax reform,\u201d Speaker Paul Ryan now dreams of \u201centitlement reform,\u201d through which he envisions reducing the deficit by cutting back on signature liberal programs like Medicare and Social Security. In a recent open letter sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, 12 conservative figures urged Ryan, along with Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, not to forget about \u201chealth reform,\u201d by which they mean continuing the effort to undo Obamacare. Several signers of that letter have been described as \u201creform conservatives,\u201d a loose term that signals inside-the-Beltway policy seriousness while creating distance from the more xenophobic elements of the Republican Party.Not all aspects of reform carry quite the same partisan or ideological tinge. \u201cCriminal-justice reform,\u201d intended to reduce the harms of mass incarceration, seems to be one of the few genuinely bipartisan agenda items in Washington. (Trump himself, who rails against \u201csavage\u201d criminals, has spoken about \u201creforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.\u201d) \u201cCampaign-finance reform\u201d occasionally rallies support across party lines, as do a few select aspects of \u201cimmigration reform.\u201dBut even those issues \u2014 narrow, practical and still contentious \u2014 point to some of the limits of reform right now. A century ago, reform meant coming up with inspiring new ideas that would lead to greater justice, a confidence that human planning and ingenuity could accomplish grand and transformative things. Now it seems to mean, at best, restrained corrective measures \u2014 and far more often than that, actively undoing the policies of the past, an act of hardheaded resignation rather than of collective hope. Reform once promised a future of unparalleled opportunity. Today, it often marks the opposite, a loss of faith in the idea of progress itself.Beverly Gage is a professor of American political history at Yale.

The elevators were out of order, the stairwells dark. Built in stages beginning in the 1940s on Chicago\u2019s Near North Side, Cabrini-Green consisted of barracks-style rowhouses and 23 towers. When Ricks arrived, more than a third of the 3,600 units were vacant. The Chicago Housing Authority said it couldn\u2019t afford to do the repairs to ready them for occupancy, and not just at Cabrini. The C.H.A. had a stock of 42,000 apartments, but the number in use had fallen to fewer than 33,000.The vacant fifth-floor apartment Ricks entered looked like a crypt. Plywood covered the windows. The kitchen cabinets dangled or were missing altogether. Ricks surveyed the surroundings, counting four bedrooms. There was a full bathroom on one side of the unit and a half bath on the other. The front room was large enough for a dining table and a sofa, and it was connected to the kitchen, which (she checked) had a working stove and refrigerator. The ceilings were high, the walls made of seemingly indestructible cinder block. Ricks had freckles that wandered the bridge of her nose and reached her high cheekbones, which now sharpened to points as she smiled. What she saw looked like a home.Ricks lived at Cabrini-Green for the next 21 years. She worked as a teacher\u2019s aide in the local schools that most of her own (eventual) 13 children attended. She babysat, ran an after-school program and served free lunches out of the field house by her high-rise. She moved her aging mother in with them, and Ricks\u2019s grown children found jobs in construction, home health care, retail and at a new residential complex built atop the old Madison Street \u201cskid row,\u201d an area refashioned into the \u201cWest Loop.\u201d Ricks didn\u2019t leave Cabrini after one of her nephews was hit with several bullets through her apartment window \u2014 his heart stopped twice before he survived. She stuck it out as the city demolished every other public-housing high-rise in Chicago not reserved for the elderly, including all the towers at Cabrini-Green save hers. After the start of this civic remodeling, in 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley said that breaking up the severe concentrations of poverty of high-rise public housing would finally imbue long-neglected neighborhoods with vitality; the mostly black residents who lived there in social and economic isolation would be able to reap the rewards of the resurgent city. \u201cI want to rebuild their souls,\u201d Daley declared. But Ricks believed her soul was doing all right on its own. She refused to go, in 2010, even as every neighbor remaining in her building took whatever replacement housing was offered them. She outlasted them all. \u201cI\u2019m the last woman standing,\u201d Ricks liked to declare.Ricks held firm to a belief that if she followed the rules, if she kept up her part in an agreement, then she was entitled to all that was promised her. Her three youngest children \u2014 Reggie, Rose and Raqkown \u2014 were still on her lease, along with two of her nearly 40 grandchildren. She wasn\u2019t in her apartment illegally, she contended. She paid her rent on time. No one caught her with drugs or guns. So how could the C.H.A. just assign her a new unit? But the city took her to court, and a federal judge gave her 10 days to vacate the building. That was that. \u201cI had to go,\u201d she conceded. \u201cEither that or be homeless again.\u201dAs it had the day she arrived at Cabrini-Green, snow covered the ground on the December morning in 2010 that she left. A crowd of reporters jostled the last high-rise tenants of what had been the city\u2019s and the country\u2019s most well-known public-housing project. \u201cAn inglorious end to an infamous era,\u201d as one news outlet put it. Another described Cabrini-Green as \u201cthe housing development that came to symbolize the squandered hope of them all.\u201d Deonta Ricks lugged a cardboard box filled with his mother\u2019s most prized possessions: the trophies he and his siblings had won for basketball tournaments and perfect attendance and the one he was awarded for being valedictorian of the school that was still there, an empty field away. The Cabrini-Green neighborhood, only a few blocks west of the ritzy Gold Coast, had a new library and police station, new shopping and upscale housing. The school, too, had been renamed and given a makeover, and it now served only those students who tested in, ranking it among the best elementaries in Illinois. Rose, then 17, rolled a suitcase with a \u201cRoute 66\u201d sticker on it. \u201cI\u2019ve been here basically my whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cLike it\u2019s hard leaving when you\u2019ve got so much memories of it. You knew everyone. You felt safe.\u201dWhen the trophies were stowed and the furniture loaded onto a truck, Annie Ricks ducked into a sedan the same off-white color as her high-rise. The car spun its wheels on the snow and gained traction, and she was gone.Then, as now, the idea of government-run housing was maligned as anticapitalist and socialist; it clashed with a national ethos wrapped up in visions of the frontiersman and the self-made entrepreneur. When the Housing Act of 1937 was being debated, it was opposed by real estate trade groups and property owners\u2019 associations, by builders, suppliers, the U.S. Chambers of Commerce and the departments of the Interior and the Treasury. Although the subsidy was reserved for only stable families with modest incomes \u2014 the \u201cdeserving poor\u201d \u2014 the ceiling on what qualifying residents could earn was said to discourage hard work, acting as a sap on initiative and pluck. Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d dramatized the backlash against Roosevelt\u2019s call for a deeper social contract of shared responsibility: The hero of the 1943 novel is an architect of a public-housing complex who becomes enraged when he returns from a trip to discover that his bare-bones high-rise has been compromised to include \u201cthe expense of incomprehensible features\u201d like balconies, a gymnasium, extra doorways and decorative brickwork. In an act portrayed as a valiant defense of his convictions, he dynamites the entire building. Maybe most telling, the same Depression-era legislation that funded the first public-housing complexes also created the federally insured private home loan. With this revolution in home financing, buyers were able to put down as little as 10 percent of a house\u2019s cost and pay off their mortgages in small increments over an unprecedented 30 years. Even today, the federal government devotes three times as much each year to mortgage-interest deductions and other subsidies to the speculative real estate market \u2014 essentially public housing for homeowners \u2014 than to the entire annual budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.The first public-housing developments were often simple and unadorned brick rowhouses or duplexes. They were required to be built to minimum standards, so as not to compete with the private rental market, and the overall populations were diverse, in part because federal rules dictated that public housing couldn\u2019t change the existing racial makeup of a neighborhood. In the 1950s, cities began to build massive complexes of clustered towers encircled by plots of land closed off to through streets. It was a purity of modernist city planning, influenced by the avant-garde \u201ctowers in the park\u201d urban reimagining of the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. The density and nearly identical stripped-down designs of the high-rises were also believed to cut down on costs while meeting greater demand.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I died and went to heaven,\u201d one of the first tenants of a development in Chicago recalled years later. J.S. Fuerst, the former head of research and statistics at the C.H.A., collected this testimonial and dozens of others like it from early occupants of the agency\u2019s properties for a 2003 book titled \u201cWhen Public Housing Was Paradise.\u201d Even though these were low-income communities of thousands of people crammed together on isolated plazas, many families still found a modest home to be somehow divine after the damnation of the cold-water flats they left behind. There, they had been afraid of fires and sickness and eviction. Public housing, by contrast, was new and orderly. All the families went through a screening process. The buildings had teams of janitors on call around the clock. Groundskeepers maintained the gardens and lawns. There was a city agency responsible for answering calls. The C.H.A.\u2019s first executive director, Elizabeth Wood, worried not that the new developments might be too large and come to define an area as low-rent, but rather that they wouldn\u2019t be large enough to counteract the damaging effects of poverty and disrepair around them. \u201cIf it is not bold,\u201d she said in 1945, \u201cthe result will be a series of small projects, islands in a wilderness of slums beaten down by smoke, noise and fumes.\u201dAcross the entire country, a majority of public housing remained in low-rises; there were eventually more than 3,000 local authorities, most with fewer than 500 units. But large housing \u201cprojects\u201d came to dominate urban landscapes and symbolize for many the unruliness and otherness of the \u201cinner city\u201d in decline. The towers-in-the-park design was only ever partly to blame. In Chicago, as elsewhere, high-rise developments were built intentionally in neighborhoods that were already segregated racially; rather than apportioning the working poor across a number of areas and helping to diversify cities, public housing had the effect of solidifying racial and economic boundaries in superblocks detached from the street grid, in towers of concrete and steel. Yet they were also perennially underfunded and perilously mismanaged. The developments were allowed to deteriorate as maintenance and repairs lagged. And as the broader fortunes of cities declined \u2014 diminishing populations and disappearing jobs, spiking poverty and crime and drug use \u2014 public housing bore the worst of those effects.Soon, those same broad trends were used to justify abandoning the basic democratic idea of providing shelter for all. In 1972, when the 33 Pruitt-Igoe towers in St. Louis began to be imploded a mere 18 years after the complex fully opened, the televised image, with its mushrooming cloud of dust and debris, defined the popular notion of the public-housing experiment: It needed to be destroyed.For other cities, demolition still remained a political and practical impossibility. In previous decades when slums were cleared, those displaced were sent into public housing. Now where could tens of thousands of people from the projects be sent? But the aversion to social safety-net programs only came to root more deeply in the American mainstream. After retaking Congress in 1994, Republicans said they planned to scrap the federal housing agency entirely. President Clinton, promoting his cuts to the welfare system and proclaiming \u201cthe era of big government is over,\u201d pre-emptively reorganized HUD. The agency promised to \u201cinfuse market discipline\u201d into public housing. The anti-urban impulse that had sent middle-class families to the suburbs had reversed itself, and young professionals were flocking to city centers near their jobs and one another.In 1990, Chicago\u2019s population started to tick up for the first time in 40 years; the area surrounding Cabrini-Green added 4,000 white residents during the previous decade, and vacant lots that had sold for $30,000 a few years earlier were being snapped up for five times that amount. As the fortunes of cities changed once again, public housing experienced a new pressure. HUD began to award municipalities tens of millions of dollars in grants to tear down their public-housing high-rises and replace them with much smaller developments that mixed public-housing families with higher-income renters and market-rate owners. Proposals to preserve some of the towers, filling in the cleared land around them with a variety of housing types, were rejected. Many low-rise developments in rejuvenating areas were targeted as well. A majority of the relocated public-housing residents were given Section 8 vouchers to rent from landlords in the private market. Nationwide, 250,000 public-housing units have been demolished since the 1990s. Atlanta, Baltimore, Columbus, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Tucson \u2014 just about every American city got in on the action. But no city knocked down as many as Chicago.Ricks wanted to remain upbeat about the move. But when violence broke out at her new home, the longtime Wentworth residents said it was the fault of the newcomers, the outsiders from Cabrini-Green, a number of whom had been moved there. An elderly woman announced for Rose to hear that she didn\u2019t like the Cabrini people and wanted them gone. When Reggie and Raqkown tried to play basketball at the courts beside their apartment, the guys there threw elbows and fists, trying to turn the game into a brawl. A group of boys jumped Reggie in the courtyard. Other former Cabrini residents who ended up there had guns pulled on them. \u201cPeople at Wentworth think you\u2019re stepping on their turf,\u201d Ricks said. \u201cThis is not your turf. This is C.H.A.\u2019s turf. You can\u2019t run me from my home. Because I do pay rent.\u201dShe often made the trip to visit her friends at the remaining strip of rowhouses at Cabrini-Green. She went to the jazz concerts held in the nearby park. Like many relocated families, she felt safer in the vestiges of the old neighborhood. When Raqkown, Ricks\u2019s youngest, left his high school most days, he traveled to the field house at Cabrini. The principal at the neighborhood elementary school said two-thirds of his students were former Cabrini families who took the bus and train long distances to get there. Several Cabrini-Green Facebook pages formed, people reporting job opportunities and business ventures, sharing words of inspiration and announcements of deaths in the Cabrini family. Oftentimes a post showed a photo of one of the disappeared high-rises \u2014 \u201cWho can say what building this is?\u201d \u2014 leading to long threads of competing memories.On an airless Saturday night in the summer of 2012, Ricks stepped outside into the Wentworth courtyard. She\u2019d been confined to her apartment all day taking care of grandchildren and wanted to relax. She set up a small table, placing atop it a transistor radio and a can of bug spray. She popped open a bottle of iced tea she bought at the gas station and tuned the radio to a gospel station. Then she was startled by screaming in the distance. She recognized the voice before she saw him: Reggie. He came racing toward her out of the darkness with Raqkown sprinting beside him. A mob of men were at their heels. Her sons dashed past her and up the stairs to their apartment, their pursuers rushing past as well. Rose, who was inside, opened the door for her brothers, and the Wentworth guys charged in behind them, colliding into her. Ricks ran up the stairs after them. \u201cHome invasion!\u201d she cried.In the cramped apartment, one invader knocked a television off the wall and stomped his foot through it. They pushed over a chest of drawers and threw chairs. Reggie, who was bleeding from his head, lifted a cooking pot off the stove and swung it to fend off blows. Rose armed herself with a mop. Their mother usually carried a fist of keys with her, and she now punched with it. She held the aerosol can of bug repellent as well, and she sprayed it into any face close by. \u201cI\u2019m just going to say it like this,\u201d Ricks said later that night, \u201cwe did whatever we had to do to get their asses out of our house.\u201dFor the next two weeks, Ricks stayed with a son in the Cabrini rowhouses. One of her older daughters put up Reggie and Raqkown. Rose moved in temporarily with another sibling in the western suburbs. A social-service provider asked Ricks if she wanted to go to a shelter. She didn\u2019t. A shelter wasn\u2019t any place to live. \u201cThat\u2019s like giving up,\u201d Ricks said. With the home invasion, her old stubbornness returned. No way was she going to be cheated out of a four-bedroom again. Not this time. She was going to keep her family together.She put in for a transfer to a different C.H.A. development along the lakefront, and she documented every time she phoned the agency to get an update. She checked in with a pro bono lawyer who agreed to take her case, asking when she should expect to move.\u201cJust trying to get them to confirm that you\u2019re eligible to be on the wait list for a four-bedroom,\u201d he told her.\u201cSo how long will that be?\u201d\u201cI wish I knew. I think they\u2019ll respond to me. I\u2019ll bother them until they do. I think this is going to be taken care of. It\u2019s not going to be done quickly.\u201d\u201cIt should be quickly, because you\u2019re my lawyer,\u201d Ricks said.\u201cI may be a lawyer; however, I\u2019m not a magician.\u201dShe ended up cutting ties with him. He\u2019d been emailing the C.H.A. since July, but three months later, her situation remained the same. \u201cI\u2019m not prejudiced,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I\u2019d have been white, he\u2019d have moved me the very same day. He doesn\u2019t have to live in Wentworth Gardens, in the ghetto, as they say.\u201dMany more families were like the Rickses, people who went from run-down public housing to rehabbed public housing, albeit still in areas of concentrated poverty. The same proved true for those who moved with a voucher. The C.H.A. currently oversees 16,000 units of occupied public housing, more than a third of which are designated for the elderly, and 47,000 vouchers in the private market. The combination of the two exceeds what the agency\u2019s total supply of housing was in the \u201990s. Nationally, the number of families using a Section 8 rent subsidy has doubled over the last 25 years, to 2.3 million. In theory, a voucher gives a family the choice to live anywhere. But the rents the federal government pays to Section 8 landlords are generally not enough for a home in a diverse neighborhood with strong schools and low crime; most landlords taking vouchers aren\u2019t in \u201copportunity\u201d areas but in poor and racially isolated ones not so different from the razed government-run high-rises. In 2003, an independent monitor of the C.H.A.\u2019s first years of relocations offered a bleak assessment: \u201cThe result has been that the vertical ghettos from which the families are being moved are being replaced with horizontal ghettos, located in well defined, highly segregated neighborhoods.\u201dThe families that were dispersed from Chicago\u2019s demolished public housing have been blamed for the city\u2019s recent surge in gun violence, as well as for crime in the suburbs, the greater Midwest and even parts of the South. Several studies have shown that C.H.A. residents did not spread disorder wherever they settled, as if they carried an infectious disease. But these families were moved primarily to areas of Chicago that were already hollowed out of population, schools, occupied homes, jobs and resources. In South Shore, which took on more Section 8 renters than any other neighborhood in the city, 3,700 apartments were caught up in foreclosures, one out of every five rental units. The problems of concentrated poverty and isolation, which the demolitions were supposed to solve, persisted \u2014 and relocated families now found themselves in strange territory without their former support networks. People in public housing had, by necessity, bartered services, shopped together, shared food, stepped up when a neighbor lost a loved one. Annie Ricks\u2019s oldest daughter, Kenosha, left Cabrini-Green when she was in her 20s and moved with her family to a block on the West Side. \u201cI\u2019ve been out here almost a decade, and I know three or four of my neighbors,\u201d she told me recently. \u201c\u2009\u2018They from the projects,\u2019 people say. But they don\u2019t know me. They weren\u2019t raised how we were raised. We were raised to stick together. If you\u2019re a neighbor, you let the next neighbor know what\u2019s going on. They don\u2019t do that out here.\u201dDevelopments like Cabrini-Green did in fact need to be made safer and more livable, and maybe even torn down. But the public had an obligation as well to ensure that those who lived there didn\u2019t lose out when the high-rises were replaced. Virtually no new public housing has been built in the country in decades. There\u2019s still a stock of over a million units nationwide, down from a peak of 1.4 million. Much of it is at risk. A HUD-commissioned study in 2010 found a $26 billion backlog in repair and maintenance needs, a figure estimated to have ballooned since then to more than $50 billion. Each year, some 10,000 to 15,000 units are lost solely because of neglect. The New York City Housing Authority had long avoided the failings that troubled authorities in other big cities. Towers in New York are the norm; maintenance and management remained strong, and high demand for housing allowed for renters with a greater range of incomes. But the city\u2019s 2,500 buildings, home to 400,000 New Yorkers, now need $17 billion in unmet repairs. The problem is often worse in small cities and less-urban areas, because there is no other supply of low-income rentals once dilapidated public housing is shuttered. HUD, rather than trying to replenish its dangerously insufficient capital fund, submitted a 2018 budget that would slash it by another two-thirds.All of this comes amid an affordable-housing crisis that is as urgent as it is unheeded. Today, only one of every five families poor enough to qualify for a housing subsidy actually receives one. A quarter of all renters nationwide pay more than half their income in rent. Families are forced to make harmful choices between rent and food, doctor\u2019s visits and education costs. In their search for what public-housing agencies had promised as the minimal requirement of a \u201cdecent, safe and sanitary home,\u201d the poor have been pushed farther from the economic activity and opportunities of city centers. The current head of the Chicago Housing Authority, Eugene Jones Jr., has envisioned a remedy, albeit an unlikely one, coming in the form of an infrastructure bill that would fully fund housing assistance, coupling the subsidy with the wraparound services \u2014 health care, day care, job training and transportation \u2014 that residents need to thrive. \u201cI\u2019m not a Republican, but we\u2019re trying to transform our residents out of public and assisted housing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe end game is that you\u2019re moving off subsistence.\u201d It\u2019s a noble goal. But there simply is no adequate supply of housing at that next step up. In 2014, when the C.H.A. opened a lottery just to make it onto the waiting list for either a voucher or public-housing unit, 280,000 families entered their names, a quarter of all the households in Chicago.Around the old Cabrini-Green and other expensive urban real estate markets, close-cropped towers are again being built. These are high-end private developments, although they occasionally set aside a number of subsidized apartments for an allotted period of time in exchange for tax breaks and building rights. The common sentiment is that the people who can afford the luxury high-rises have created their own good fortune; the generous government benefits they receive are rightfully earned. For those in Wentworth Gardens or Chicago\u2019s distant South Side or any impoverished neighborhood in the country, no political will exists anymore for the government to step in and transform the blocks that have been left to decline. Affordable-housing advocates are by no means pushing for a return to large public-housing high-rise developments, but some have noted that a few towers mixed in here and there with the luxury condos wouldn\u2019t stand out.There are calls to again mobilize the country\u2019s resources. The Bipartisan Policy Center has endorsed a universal voucher program that would guarantee rental assistance to the country\u2019s 11.4 million extremely low income households. Several studies by the Urban Institute and other research organizations show that such an endeavor would recoup much of its cost in reduced homelessness and also ease health problems and other consequences of instability that are ultimately paid for by governments. Several organizations in recent years have proposed tax credits for cost-burdened low-income households. And a bill introduced numerous times by the Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison sets out to cut the mortgage-interest deduction for wealthier homeowners and use the $200 billion in savings over 10 years to close the affordable-housing deficit. Congress did, in fact, cut the mortgage-interest deduction as part of last December\u2019s tax bill, though by much less than low-income housing proponents had wanted. The savings went not to creating affordable housing but to offsetting the tax benefits that Republicans doled out to corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Seventy years into our test as a country to provide housing for those who have too little, we are hardly any closer to passing.Rose and her toddler daughter remained in the apartment at Wentworth Gardens. Her brothers slept there less and less frequently. With their mother gone, their lives became more itinerant. They stayed with girlfriends or with other siblings scattered around the city and the surrounding suburbs. Wentworth hadn\u2019t become any safer for them. Reggie, in his early 20s, was arrested there after another fight. A group of guys at the development pounced on Raqkown and broke a bone in his neck. But it wasn\u2019t clear where they would be better off. Raequonn Ricks Williams, a 19-year-old relative, was shot on the West Side, one of the 762 people murdered in Chicago in 2016. Reggie and his mother had squabbled before her death. He\u2019d been turned down at more than a dozen job interviews, and Annie Ricks berated him for giving up. He racked up arrests. \u201cWhen Reggie left Cabrini, he felt his whole family was gone,\u201d Kenosha said of her younger brother. \u201cHis immediate family plus everybody he was in, like, preschool with.\u201dRose left finally for an apartment building 25 blocks farther south. She had got her daughter into a school near there, and she had also come to feel haunted at Wentworth, always expecting to see her mother emerge from one of the bedrooms. Back in 2014, at her mother\u2019s funeral, Rose had been unable to speak through her tears. A hundred former Cabrini-Green residents showed up at the West Side church to pay their respects. Rose\u2019s siblings talked about their mother\u2019s stubbornness, her determination to provide for them: \u201cWhat she didn\u2019t have, she made sure we had it,\u201d one said. Reggie said he didn\u2019t care that he had a terrible singing voice, and he started in on an R. Kelly song: \u201cDear Mama, you wouldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019m goin\u2019 through/But still I got my head up just like I promised you.\u201d Kenton, Ricks\u2019s fourth of nine sons, said they all learned from her example. \u201cBe strong, take care of the kids, take care of family,\u201d he repeated. She made them all better people. \u201cShe\u2019d do anything for anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just love.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cash-Strapped Chinese Giant Taps a New Money Source: Its Workers", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Just before payday, an email went out to employees from top executives: Give us your money, and we\u2019ll make it worth your while.It was one of many pitches by HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate struggling under an estimated $90 billion in debt accumulated during a global shopping spree that included buying stakes in multinationals like Hilton Hotels and Deutsche Bank.The company, in an email, advertised an \u201cemployee treasure\u201d product with an 8.5 percent return if workers handed over $1,500. A similar one dangled 9 percent. A third mentioned a return as high as 40 percent if employees ponied up $15,000.These pitches, more than a dozen of which were reviewed by The New York Times, were not part of an employee stock program. Instead, they appear to be high interest loans, with the company as borrower and its workers as lenders.It is unclear how much money HNA has raised from employees. The company has long offered such investments to its employees as a way to incentivize them and to share in the company\u2019s success, Thomas A. Clare, an attorney for HNA, said in an email.\u201cHNA has never approached the offering of these products and opportunities as a financing mechanism, as the amounts contributed by HNA employees to these opportunities are a very small percentage of the funds raised,\u201d he said.Companies around the world allow employees to buy stock or provide other ways for workers to invest in the business. But the HNA pitches do not offer direct ownership stakes in the business.The offers reviewed by The Times had similar hallmarks, namely high returns for funding certain operations.In an email dated Jan. 4, one HNA unit told employees that it needed nearly $8 million to fund a duty free business. It advertised a 9.8 percent annualized interest rate. One week later, HNA\u2019s media and entertainment arm said it was looking to raise nearly $80 million from employees, pledging strong returns and a plan to build up the business.Some emails have asked for big investments, while others emphasized how little employees have to invest to be eligible for hefty returns. One email, dated Jan. 17, offered commissions to employees who referred friends and family.\u201cIf you successfully invite someone else to invest in fixed-term wealth management products,\u201d the email told employees, \u201cyou can get a high commission.\u201d The email did not elaborate.In one seven-day period in January, an HNA employee received seven separate pitches. Mr. Clare said any increase would be the result of trying to incentivize more employees.Chinese companies have often turned to individual investors or their own workers to raise money. But such moves, according to some China finance experts, can signal problems.\u201cIt\u2019s a desperation measure when companies really have no other source of financing and they are stuck,\u201d said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research, a corporate research firm.\u201cInternal funding is a common way for companies to raise funds,\u201d said Sun Lijian, an associate professor at the China Center for Economic Study at Fudan University in Shanghai.\u201cBut employees shouldn\u2019t be forced to contribute and they should be informed of all the details of the project including the risks,\u201d he added.Raising money from workers is legal in China if an employer clears regulatory hurdles, experts say, particularly permission from the country\u2019s central bank. The People\u2019s Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment.Companies raising money directly from Chinese investors must obtain licenses from securities, insurance or banking regulators. The HNA pitches reviewed by The Times did not say whether they were reviewed by regulators.Mr. Clare, HNA\u2019s attorney, said that the offerings comply with all laws and referred questions to the various Chinese regulatory agencies, which did not respond to requests for comment.HNA sometimes directed employees to Jubaohui, its online investment portal, which is generally open to Chinese investors. The portal also has an employees-only area. Publicly, HNA often positions itself as a major player on the move, with talented leadership and vast resources at its disposal.Jubaohui has had trouble paying back some investors, according to an email sent to an investor and reviewed by The Times. It promised to pay later at a higher interest rate, after it was unable to make the final payments of two investments at the end of last year.Mr. Clare, the attorney for HNA, said, \u201cAbsent specific evidence that Jubaohui was actually late in making a required payment, there is no basis for any such statement or speculation.\u201dAs HNA has faced more questions about its operations by both the local and foreign media, the company has issued groupwide emails urging employees to not speak to reporters. In January, HNA\u2019s human resources department told employees they would be required to take a test on how to deal with the news media, according to an internal document reviewed by The Times.Meanwhile, the emails kept flooding employee inboxes.\u201cYour year-end bonus is here,\u201d said one sent on Jan. 15, for an investment tied to HNA\u2019s Qianhai Air and Shipping Exchange arm. In one corner of the email was the animated image of a smiling barrel overflowing with gold coins.The next day, another one backed by Qianhai Air and Shipping was sent out. It cited the rising cost of school and property in major Chinese cities, then contrasted it with the $16 minimum investment for the product, called Ladle Full of Gold.\u201cThe cost of living is high?\u201d it said. \u201cLadle Full of Gold won\u2019t give in!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Developers Seek $6 Million Tax Break for Trump-Managed Hotel", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs President Trump\u2019s family business prepares to open a hotel in the Mississippi Delta this fall, its local development partners have asked the State of Mississippi to subsidize the project with up to $6 million in tax breaks, according to documents obtained through an open records request.If approved, the benefits could offset nearly a third of the projected $20 million in costs for the hotel, which is owned by the local developers, Dinesh and Suresh Chawla.The Chawla brothers are already financing the project through a bank loan, but Dinesh Chawla said in an email to The New York Times that the Mississippi tourism tax rebate would \u201cimprove our cash flow.\u201d The Chawlas, who applied for the rebate in late December, are also planning to use city and county property tax abatements, records show.The development in Cleveland, Miss., is expected to be the first in a new line of upscale hotels the Trump Organization is rolling out under the name Scion. The Trump Organization, which will brand and manage the Mississippi hotel, but not own it, did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Chawla, in the email, said that the Trump Organization played no role in the rebate application and that his company first considered applying for it in 2015, two years before he teamed up with the Trumps. He said the Trumps and the Chawlas had agreed that any rebate \u2014 which Mississippi offers in an effort to draw tourists \u2014 would not figure into fees paid to the Trumps.Still, if the state approves the tax rebate for the Chawlas, it could indirectly, but personally, benefit the president, who owns the family business through a trust, an arrangement that raises some constitutional concerns, critics and legal experts say.\u201cThe country\u2019s founders included the emoluments clauses as a big bright-line rule,\u201d said Jed Shugerman, a professor at the Fordham University School of Law who helped write a legal brief in support of the plaintiffs in the emoluments litigation. Assessing the Chawlas\u2019 application, he argued that while some state incentives are allowable, \u201cMississippi has discretion to give the tax rebate, and if they do award it to this hotel, then they are likely giving Trump an emolument.\u201dIn preparation for the same brief, John Mikhail at Georgetown University Law Center studied 40 dictionaries from the founding era and concluded that the term \u201cemolument\u201d was almost always defined more broadly than the Trump administration has interpreted it. Still, some legal experts argue that domestic emoluments are allowable so long as Mr. Trump does not earn them from his service as president.\u201cIf you\u2019re applying the original meaning of emolument, the Mississippi transaction you\u2019re describing could reasonably be called one,\u201d Mr. Mikhail said. \u201cWhether or not it\u2019s the precise kind of emolument prohibited by the Constitution is a more difficult question.\u201dWhen he became president, Mr. Trump decided not to sell off his assets, but he promised that new hotel branding or management projects would be subject to approval from an outside ethics adviser, Bobby Burchfield. In general, Mr. Burchfield is required to review transactions or contracts between the Trump Organization and local, state or federal agencies as well as certain deals with private entities, he has said. Because the Trump Organization itself did not request the Mississippi rebate and would receive no direct benefit from it, Mr. Burchfield said he is unlikely to scrutinize it.The Chawla brothers, who are seeking the rebate from the Mississippi Development Authority, seemed confident that it would be approved. Although the authority is still reviewing the application, a business plan the Chawlas submitted to local officials in December stated that the hotel \u201cutilizes local tax credits and the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) Tourism Tax Rebate program,\u201d and that \u201cour development team is securing final agreements.\u201dThe partnership between the Chawlas and the Trumps materialized after Mr. Bryant, also a Trump supporter, introduced members of the two families during the presidential campaign.In his email to The Times, Dinesh Chawla said political influence had not played a role in the development. \u201cNo contact with Governor Bryant or his executive staff has been made regarding the project, other than our general discussion about what the project contains,\u201d he said. \u201cThe project is subject to review by financial auditors, construction supervisors, and it cannot be bypassed by executive staff, nor the Governor to my knowledge.\u201dClay Chandler, a spokesman for Mr. Bryant, said the Chawlas had followed the same procedure as other applicants for the tax rebate.\u201cMr. Chawla\u2019s project has been in the works since before the presidential election,\u201d he said. \u201cState law guides the application process, and state law alone will determine if any application is approved.\u201dMr. Bryant had ties to the Chawlas before the election, having honored their father, V. K. Chawla for his contributions to state tourism. And he called their family after their father\u2019s death in 2015, the Chawlas\u2019 corporate website said. That year, Suresh Chawla wrote an article that appeared in local newspapers about how his father, an Indian immigrant, had sought and received business advice from Mr. Trump decades earlier.After Mr. Trump took office, executives from the Trump Organization reached out to the Chawlas about teaming up.At the time, the Trump Organization, known for five-star luxury properties bearing the Trump name, was beginning a new line of four-star hotels called Scion Hotels and Resorts and a budget-friendly chain called American Idea hotels. The Trump name will not appear on these hotels.The Chawlas, who own 17 hotels in the Mississippi Delta, including Comfort Inns and Hampton Inns, agreed to brand their new Cleveland project, which was already under construction, the Scion West End. They also agreed to convert three of their existing hotels into American Idea properties.On Dec. 28, the Chawlas submitted the tax rebate application for the Cleveland hotel with the Mississippi Development Authority, according to a redacted partial copy of the application obtained through the records request. The Trump name was not mentioned anywhere in the application, an agency spokesman said.The tourism program, according to the agency, is set up to allow a developer to recoup some of the sales taxes collected on a property to \u201creimburse the applicant for eligible costs incurred during the project\u2019s construction.\u201d The agency said 23 tourism rebate applications had been approved under the program, including 10 for hotels.A rebate for the Chawlas would be capped at 30 percent of the projected $20 million in eligible costs, or about $6 million, their application said.The Chawlas estimated that the project would draw tens of thousands of visitors, including many from out of state, and that it would eventually create more than 100 jobs, the application said.Dinesh Chawla said in the email to The Times that he was \u201cworking very hard and ethically to create jobs, tourism opportunities, and a chance to showcase our Delta culture in food, music and the arts to the whole world.\u201dPlans call for a 96-room boutique hotel as part of a complex that includes eight buildings. There would be two restaurants, as well as a meeting and event center and a spa, according to a copy of the business plan, which was obtained through a public records request. The hotel rooms are expected to cost between $145 and $185 a night, though the Chawlas have not finished setting the rates.\u201cWe are inviting the world to the Mississippi Delta,\u201d the Chawlas wrote in the business plan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "1.5 Million Retirees Await Congressional Fix for a Pension Time Bomb", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe deal creates a select congressional committee to craft what could effectively be a federal rescue of as many as 200 so-called \u201cmultiemployer\u201d pension plans \u2014 in which employers and labor unions band together to provide retirement benefits to employees.Many of these plans are hurtling toward insolvency in the coming decade, with benefits owed to retirees projected to swamp what the plans can afford to pay. The 16-member, bipartisan committee will have to come up with a solution and legislation by the end of November, which the full Senate would need to vote on by the end of the year.Select congressional committees have long struggled to produce results, like one during the Barack Obama administration meant to reduce the growth of the national debt. This committee\u2019s work will be complicated by disagreements over whether companies, retirees or taxpayers should bear the brunt of the cost for shoring up pension plans that would otherwise run out of money.Pension plans across the nation are facing shortfalls, with both corporate plans and those for public employees like teachers and firefighters owing more to retirees than the investment funds can possibly pay. But the looming collapse of the multiemployer pension system is significant given the sheer number of people affected and the potential for a devastating economic ripple effect: retirees losing the pension checks that keep them afloat and a potential wave of bankruptcies among the companies that once employed those workers.The situation has been brewing since the 2008 financial crisis, as investments plummeted, leaving many plans in the red. The slow economic recovery and recent stock market rally have not been sufficient to reinvigorate the plans, which are jointly funded by labor unions and employers whose workers participate in them.\u201cWe want the system stabilized and fixed in the long term because we\u2019re in so many plans and we have a lot of employees in the plans,\u201d said Chris Langan, vice president of finance at U.P.S. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is not wise to wait on.\u201dNow, Congress must decide whether to rescue these funds with low-cost loans, force them to cut benefit payments or let the funds go bankrupt and wipe out retirees\u2019 entire pensions.Ms. Wong and other advocates of congressional action say they are optimistic that the committee can achieve rare bipartisan success. Members of Congress across the aisle, they say, are coming to grips with the cost of doing nothing.\u201cThis committee forces Congress to get serious,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, a longtime champion of unions who represents many retirees covered by the pension plans, and who fought for the committee\u2019s creation in the spending bill. \u201cIt forces us to come together and work out differences.\u201dIf the multiemployer pension plans go broke, the federal safety net created to protect retirees will not have enough money to make good on the promised benefits, leaving workers with little to no retirement benefits.\u201cIt\u2019s an urgent problem that needs to be fixed,\u201d said Alicia H. Munnell, a management professor at Boston College and the director of its Center for Retirement Research. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s an ideological divide \u2014 do you bail these people out or not?\u201d\u201cNo one wants to see old, poor people penniless in retirement,\u201d she said.Mike Walden, a retired Teamster and the president of the National United Committee to Protect Pensions, has led fellow retirees to Washington for several years to pressure members of Congress to fix the problem. Retirees, already squeezed by living on a fixed income, are frustrated at the prospect of seeing their benefits reduced or eliminated if Congress does not act, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand, when they take money away from us, how much they\u2019re going to hurt the economy.\u201dMr. Walden called the creation of the committee a \u201cmeaningful step\u201d to soothe nervous retirees. \u201cIt\u2019s been way too long \u2014 just talk, talk, talk, talk,\u201d he said.To succeed, the committee must navigate Washington\u2019s aversion to anything that resembles a bailout, particularly as the government is running large deficits that are projected to grow $7 trillion over the next decade \u2014 and when many Republicans see unions as political enemies.And Congress has already tried to help these plans, with little success. In 2014, the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act was enacted to help funds develop rescue plans, including by reducing benefits to retirees. In 2015, Central States submitted such a plan to the Treasury Department, but it was rejected the following year on the grounds that the proposed benefit reductions were unlikely to help the fund avoid insolvency.\u201cThis is beyond party affiliation, this really cuts to the root of what retirement is going to look like,\u201d said Mr. Neal, who will be a member of the special committee and has been working to recruit more House Republicans to support his proposal.The Trump administration has been largely quiet on the situation, but when asked about it at a congressional hearing last week, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, noted that it was a \u201csignificant\u201d issue and promised to offer technical assistance to support any solution that lawmakers find.As congressional negotiators homed in on a spending deal early this year, Mr. Brown pushed Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, to attach his pension language to the larger budget agreement. The bill establishes a process to ensure that if the commission produces a bill supported by a majority of its Democratic and Republican members, the Senate will vote on that bill before a new Congress convenes next year.If concern over retirees is not enough to get lawmakers to act, those who represent pension funds hope that concern about the broader economy will. Michael D. Scott, executive director for the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, projects that if all of the pension plans that are in \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201ccritical and declining\u201d condition go broke, the federal government would face a half trillion dollars in lost tax revenue over the next decade because of the taxes that the active funds currently pay.\u201cI think ultimately the government is going to look at how much tax revenue it is going to lose without a solution,\u201d Mr. Scott said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How One Book Changed My Relationship With Money", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySelf-Helped\u201cYour Money\u201d turned out not to be a vehicle toward amassing money, as I expected. Instead, Ms. Robin encourages readers to work toward having \u201cenough\u201d \u2014 a quantifiable amount that would cover their needs and wants \u2014 rather than an ever-receding goal of \u201cmore.\u201d She proposes people live more frugally, naming consumerism and its trappings as the root of many Americans\u2019 financial challenges.So Ms. Robin\u2019s suggestion that I should live a life similar to the one my family lived, stretching dollars and counting pennies, was a radical departure, and the idea captivated me. I pored through the book, extending my commute to get through more pages. I kept reading even during my walk to the office, weaving through rush-hour foot traffic with a highlighter in hand, placing Post-its on pages I wanted to come back to.The cornerstone of the program has echoes of the common adage \u201cTime is money.\u201d In an early chapter, readers learn to find their \u201creal\u201d hourly wage by factoring the hidden time and money spent on work-related expenditures into their pay.If you are paid $25 per hour for a 40-hour workweek, for instance, but spend 30 additional hours commuting, decompressing or nursing stress-induced headaches, and $300 goes toward your business suits, your \u201creal\u201d hourly wage is $10 per hour. That means a $100 splurge at Sephora costs you 600 minutes of your life. You\u2019re forced to ask, at every turn, \u201cWas it worth it?\u201d\u201cYour Money\u201d redefines not only your relationship to money, but also to work itself.Ms. Robin calls our jobs, what we do to put food on the table, \u201cpaid employment,\u201d and argues that our collective definition of work should be expanded to include \u201cany productive or purposeful activity,\u201d such as caring for a child or volunteering at a homeless shelter. Money and \u201cpaid employment,\u201d then, should help us live fuller lives, but not dominate them.\u201cNinety percent of my brain was dedicated to making money,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter I reached financial independence, it\u2019s literally like 90 percent of my brain opened up.\u201dIn 2016, when I quit my job and moved to the Dominican Republic for a few months, using my limited savings and some freelance income to live a quality life, I felt a similar clearing of mental space. I also witnessed firsthand the sustainable way my family and others lived there. Most had fruit trees bearing coconuts, star fruit or mangoes growing on the land surrounding their houses, and my grandmother and aunts owned hogs and chickens that they\u2019d eventually sell or eat. Family gatherings happened in my aunt\u2019s living room, with one cousin contributing a few jumbo-size Brahma or Presidente bottles of beer and an uncle or aunt, a portion of the meal. When one of the wealthier neighbors in our countryside built a well, he installed a spout outside his home so anyone could fill their buckets with clean water. It was nothing like the drinks-after-work, brunch-every-weekend, treat-yourself life I lived in New York, and yet it was no less joyful.I know much of what I witnessed in the Dominican Republic isn\u2019t replicable here (it\u2019s much harder to raise goats or pigs in my concrete yard in Queens), and that frugality as a choice is a privilege that does not solve the real issues of inequality that force many to live paycheck-to-paycheck. But Ms. Robin argues that if more people adopted the tenets of the book, there would be more resources to go around.\u201cYour Money\u201d encouraged me to scrutinize my spending, and habits and patterns quickly emerged: I was impulsive and often overspent on credit. I gave frequently \u2014 to street performers or the homeless; to family and friends; to the fund-raisers who walk beside you down city streets to convince you to donate to a good cause. It\u2019s an area I\u2019d never accounted for in the past, but I started setting money aside for this purpose. I forced myself to use only what I had in my bank account, which helped me realize that my credit spending was based in fear \u2014 I was afraid of running into the walls set by my debit card balance, so I used my credit cards even when I had money in my account. Once I started spending only what I had, my spending became less mindless. I felt more aware and in control.\u201cYour Money\u201d teaches very concrete methods of keeping track of your finances \u2014 there are spreadsheets and expense tracking, simple graphs and investment recommendations \u2014 but what I took away from it was a shift in thinking, from chasing money for the sake of having it to using it in service to my goals: to help my parents, achieve financial and mental freedom and continue to write full time. It worked for my family: My dad\u2019s thriftiness helped him buy a home and start his own small business, and it helped my aunts purchase property back on the island for their retirement.

{"Headline": "Before There Was #MeToo, There Was Mary Cunningham", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the tightknit community of St. Helena, Calif., Mary Cunningham Agee is known as the Tomato Lady. She grows the best heirlooms, giving them out, along with basil, cabbage and cauliflower, to her Napa Valley neighbors. Vineyards line both sides of her 4,000-square-foot farmhouse, the one with the soft golden-white hue and the shutters with heart-shaped cutouts. Ms. Cunningham Agee tends to the grapes to produce 25 cases of pinot noir each season.Instead, her days have been dominated by a simmering legal feud with Mr. Agee\u2019s children from his first marriage, including both a disputed will that Mr. Agee revised shortly before he died and the revelation that Mr. Agee started divorce proceedings against Ms. Cunningham Agee in the final weeks of his life.The animosity between Ms. Cunningham Agee and other members of the Agee family \u2014 particularly over that will and whether Mr. Agee was of sound mind when he rewrote it \u2014 is the latest dramatic twist to a very public saga that goes back nearly 40 years, when Bill Agee and Mary Cunningham played the central roles in what was arguably the first sex scandal in corporate America.Ms. Cunningham, one of the first women ever to hold a leadership role at a Fortune 100 company, became the subject of a media frenzy in the early 1980s amid speculation and innuendo that she had slept her way to the top of Bendix Corporation, the auto parts manufacturer that Mr. Agee then helmed. (In a later article about that scandal, Forbes referred to Ms. Cunningham as \u201cundeniably appealing.\u201d) Ms. Cunningham has always said the two didn\u2019t have a romantic relationship until years later, after she left Bendix. For his part, Mr. Agee said he had promoted the bright Harvard M.B.A. solely on her abilities.But nearly four decades later, Suzanne Agee, 57 \u2014 one of Mr. Agee\u2019s daughters with his first wife, and locked in that legal battle with his second \u2014 still isn\u2019t buying that story.\u201cIt was clear something was going on,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cIf you knew my dad, he was a C.E.O., he didn\u2019t wait for things.\u201dNow, Ms. Cunningham Agee sits alone in the empty house she and Mr. Agee shared and stares at a shrine to her late husband set up in front of the fireplace. There are white candles and yellow roses in crystal vases and a framed photo of Mr. Agee (once known as \u201cthe Paul Newman of the executive suite\u201d). She thinks back to the shame she felt 40 years earlier when that scarlet A was attached to her power suit.People assume \u201cthat must be a very unhappy couple that started out all about sex in the workplace,\u201d Ms. Cunningham Agee said of her marriage. The house, she said, and the friends who filled it in the days after Mr. Agee died were a testament to \u201cthe beautiful marriage we had.\u201dThe letters arrived in bundles. Typed on word processors from the steno pool and handwritten on monogrammed note cards from kitchen tables. The senders all confided a similar sentiment to Mary Cunningham Agee. \u201cWhat happened to you,\u201d these women wrote, \u201cit happened to me, too.\u201d\u201cIt was a #MeToo moment that didn\u2019t have social media or an opportunity to tell anyone else,\u201d Ms. Cunningham Agee said. \u201cThey told me they admired me, understood me, related to the experiences and that it was wrong.\u201d\u201cThe role of women in all kinds of jobs in corporate America were under consideration, and it became part of a really major national discussion,\u201d said Angel Kwolek-Folland, a professor of history and women\u2019s studies at the University of Florida.And in the middle of it all was Mary Cunningham.\u201cWhen he said he believed in promoting women and minorities and anyone from a disadvantaged background, I said sign me up,\u201d Ms. Cunningham Agee recalled.She decided to turn down Wall Street and move to Southfield, Mich., where Bendix was based. She started as Mr. Agee\u2019s executive assistant and was soon promoted to vice president of strategic planning, a position that made Ms. Cunningham one of the highest-ranking female executives in the country.She and Mr. Agee shared limousine rides and flights on the corporate jet and checked into the same hotels (different rooms) on business trips \u2014 activities that by 2018 standards seem like prerequisites to get ahead at work but at the time scandalized the company.\u201cI kept thinking: \u2018Are you kidding me? How is a woman ever supposed to advance if you have to deny yourself the same tools and mechanisms that every man knows make a difference?\u2019\u201d Ms. Cunningham Agee said.\u201cI had a blind spot a mile wide,\u201d Ms. Cunningham Agee said, adding that she believed there was a racial component to the scrutiny she received. \u201cI walked into an environment and a culture that was not only laden with a bull\u2019s-eye on my back because I succeeded when other men could\u2019ve had that job, but I\u2019d just separated from my husband, who was African-American.\u201dShe recounted sneers in every meeting, dirty looks on every elevator ride, whispers on every visit to the ladies\u2019 room. Ms. Cunningham Agee summed up the sentiment as \u201cWho is this woman, and what was she doing in Detroit?\u201dAt best, Ms. Cunningham was portrayed as a vixen who had played her cards right (\u201cMake Your Corporate Affair Work for You,\u201d a Mademoiselle column read). At worst, she was, as The Wall Street Journal wrote, a na\u00efve young woman with \u201ca raging schoolgirl crush\u201d on the charismatic (and married) chief executive. Eliza Collins of the Harvard Business Review wrote that office romance \u201ccan break down the organizational structure,\u201d adding that the \u201cleast essential to the company\u201d should be terminated, even though that person is likely to be the woman.The Agee-Cunningham scandal \u201cbrought to the forefront the very common romantic relationship that is kindled inside a work organization,\u201d said David A. Harrison, a professor at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cBefore then, it was taboo to talk about it.\u201dMs. Cunningham became so central in the debate about women in corporate America that when she faced pressure to resign in 1980, Gloria Steinem volunteered to defend her to the Bendix board.In 1984, Ms. Cunningham Agee wrote \u201cPower Play: What Really Happened at Bendix,\u201d a book that told her side, including making the case that she wasn\u2019t romantically involved with her then-boss. (The first kiss doesn\u2019t happen until roughly 200 pages in.)Looking back, Ms. Cunningham Agee said she had bonded with Mr. Agee because of what they had both endured, from a voracious news media and a cutthroat corporate culture that used her as a pawn to take down Mr. Agee.\u201cThere was an overwhelming sense of compassion,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d been two people in a foxhole together.\u201dBut popular opinion had seemingly made up its mind about Mary Cunningham Agee. \u201cEverybody said, \u2018See, we told you so.\u2019 It became a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d Ms. Kwolek-Folland said. \u201cThis fit into how the world worked \u2014 she must\u2019ve been sleeping with the boss.\u201dMs. Cunningham Agee can be such an adept dealmaker that she once struck up a conversation with a young woman in the back seat of an Uber pool car and persuaded her to go on a blind date with her son, Will. Ten months later, the two were married.That young woman, McKinley Agee, 29, is fiercely loyal to her mother-in-law and said she could never shake the caricature of a manipulative home wrecker who had tried to insert herself into the old boys\u2019 club of corporate America.\u201cI think the narrative we continue to see is that of a scandalous affair, but ultimately it was a great love story,\u201d McKinley Agee said.That is not how Mr. Agee\u2019s three children with his first wife, Diane Weaver, see things.For nearly 40 years, they had almost no contact with their father and blame Ms. Cunningham Agee\u2019s controlling nature for the estrangement. Suzanne Agee said she believed that her father \u201chad a lot of remorse\u201d over not keeping in close contact with his first family but that he couldn\u2019t do so \u201cwithout breaking ties with Mary.\u201dIn response, Ms. Cunningham Agee said she had urged her husband to reconnect to his first family, but couldn\u2019t persuade him. \u201cEvery Christmas, I begged him to do it,\u201d she said.In October, less than two months before he died, a frail Mr. Agee, who suffered from scleroderma, a degenerative disease of the immune system, reconnected with his first family. Legal documents show that he gave Suzanne Agee power of attorney (along with his 32-year-old daughter with Ms. Cunningham Agee, Mary Alana Kurz), filed for divorce and rewrote his will to divide his assets among Ms. Cunningham Agee and his five children. (Previously, the will had left everything to Ms. Cunningham Agee.)Ms. Cunningham Agee attributes his erratic behavior to dementia. She said doctors had diagnosed Alzheimer\u2019s in 2014. His health deteriorated, and in mid-October she put him in an assisted living facility. She said that her husband \u201cwas very conflicted and paranoid\u201d and that he had used the divorce filing \u2014 which would\u2019ve divided up the couple\u2019s assets and allowed Mr. Agee to alter his estate planning \u2014 as \u201ca good tool to get out of assisted living.\u201d (The divorce was never finalized, which means the proceeding would be legally nullified.)But Suzanne Agee and others close to Mr. Agee disputed the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis and said he was mentally competent. In an Oct. 29 email exchange, Bruce A. Miroglio, a lawyer and friend to the couple, wrote that Ms. Cunningham Agee had \u201cretained counsel, to help her get Bill declared incompetent.\u201d He wrote, \u201cBill is still competent.\u201d Mr. Agee was never declared mentally incompetent by the courts.Ms. Cunningham Agee said that until those final weeks, her marriage had been blissful, but people close to the family said the couple had been living in separate wings of their St. Helena home, comparing the arrangement to the 1989 movie \u201cWar of the Roses.\u201d Ms. Cunningham Agee confirmed that they lived on different floors, but said it was because Mr. Agee, whose illness had taken its toll, walked with a cane and couldn\u2019t climb stairs.In her version of the story, she was the consummate caregiver, bestowing on Mr. Agee chocolate milkshakes and foot massages in the middle of the night.\u201cWe all miss a great man who had Alzheimer\u2019s and acted out at the end,\u201d Ms. Cunningham Agee said, adding that it would be a shame to dwell on that difficult seven-week period in the twilight of his life after a long, happy union.The battle over the will is likely to be for naught. In 2016, Mr. Agee put all of the couple\u2019s assets, estimated at several million dollars, into a trust and made Ms. Cunningham Agee trustee. Even if the new will is valid, anything of real value is controlled by the trust, said a family friend with direct knowledge of the legal arrangement, who was not authorized to speak about it publicly.Suzanne Agee said it wasn\u2019t about the money, but about a father\u2019s love and his attempts at reconciliation at the end. However, she indicated that she intended to test the legality of the new will, even if it appeared unlikely to stand up.\u201cI believe in principle that it should be seen by the courts and a judge should be allowed to decide,\u201d Ms. Agee said.In late October, weeks before Mr. Agee died, he traveled to Seattle to reconnect with his children and grandchildren with his first wife. (Ms. Kurz also reunited with her half siblings during this period, straining relations with her mother.) He died of respiratory failure at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle on Dec. 20.\u201cHe got old and frail and wanted to make it right before he died,\u201d Ms. Agee said.Ms. Cunningham Agee attributed the end-of-life trip to Seattle to Mr. Agee\u2019s dementia and said they had reconciled at the end before sharing a heartfelt goodbye via FaceTime.\u201cHe said, \u2018I want you to know I\u2019ll never stop loving you,\u2019 and I told him, \u2018You\u2019re completely forgiven,\u2019\u201d she said, tearing up as she recalled their final conversation.For decades, the Agee-Cunningham saga had been out of the headlines. Now, both families seem unable to shake the swirl of the scandal and speculation that consumed their early relationship in the 1980s and resurfaced at the end of Mr. Agee\u2019s life.\u201cThey may still harbor feelings from 40 years ago,\u201d Ms. Cunningham Agee said of her husband\u2019s first family.Suzanne Agee, indeed, recalled in vivid detail how some 40 years ago Ms. Cunningham Agee had inserted herself into their family, including helping with her sister\u2019s college applications, sharing a phone line with their dad and accompanying them on family trips. (Ms. Cunningham Agee said those duties had come with being Mr. Agee\u2019s executive assistant.)Making matters worse for the family, Ms. Agee said, was the relentless scrutiny. \u201cWe\u2019d be out in public years later, well into the late 1980s, and people would be discussing the whole Agee-Mary thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was humiliating.\u201dLike much of the media, the Agee children from his first marriage saw Ms. Cunningham Agee as not only their father\u2019s mistress, but the cause of the unraveling of Mr. Agee\u2019s once-promising corporate career.Ms. Cunningham Agee left Seagram after two years and formed a venture capital and strategic consulting firm with Mr. Agee. She never went back to the corporate world and would spend most of her career working on charitable causes, including founding the Nurturing Network, a nonprofit that provides women with an alternative to abortions. Now she\u2019d like to get involved in charitable causes to help find a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s, she said.\u201cI am doing my best to remain above the darkness that entered his life so unexpectedly and at such a vulnerable time,\u201d she said in a Feb. 1 email. \u201cHe knew he was unconditionally loved and that any anguish caused by his illness was completely forgiven.\u201dSuzanne Agee doesn\u2019t see Ms. Cunningham Agee as a devoted wife and grieving widow. Rather, her father\u2019s death and the current imbroglio reminded her of how masterfully a much younger Mary Cunningham had spun the story of her tenure at Bendix.\u201cIs she the victim, or is she the villain?\u201d Ms. Agee asked.It has all been a strange confluence of events for Ms. Cunningham Agee \u2014 her husband\u2019s death and the still-open wounds it has exposed, unfolding along with the national reckoning about women in the workplace. She has been thinking a lot about those letters stashed quietly away in trunks all these years. In the Twitter era, their voices would\u2019ve culminated in a public scream.\u201cIt was women trying to tell their truth\u201d \u2014 about what it was like for them being the subject of nasty office rumors, Ms. Cunningham Agee said. And while she doesn\u2019t like to dwell on how her corporate career could\u2019ve gone differently, there remains a tinge of regret about the heights this promising young Harvard M.B.A. could\u2019ve reached had her situation happened in the current era.\u201cThis interview isn\u2019t easy,\u201d Ms. Cunningham Agee said last month. \u201cI\u2019m reliving experiences from 1980 that never should\u2019ve happened.\u201dSteve Lohr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Weeks After Trump Blocked It, Democrats\u2019 Rebuttal of G.O.P. Memo Is Released", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe document was intended by Democrats to offer a point-by-point refutation of what it called the \u201ctransparent\u201d attempt by President Trump\u2019s allies on the committee to undermine the congressional and special counsel investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign.But the dueling accounts reflected an extraordinary struggle on the committee to try to shape public perceptions of the credibility of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agencies. For weeks, instead of focusing its full energy on investigating an attack on the American democratic system, the committee has been pulled into a furious effort by Mr. Trump and his allies to sow doubts about the integrity of the special counsel inquiry and the agencies conducting it.The Democratic memo amounted to a forceful rebuttal to the president\u2019s portrayal of the Russia inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d being perpetrated by politically biased leaders of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department.The newfound animosity toward the F.B.I. among ostensibly law-and-order Republicans was reflected this past week at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where speakers like Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association, attacked what they called its \u201crogue leadership.\u201dAt the conference on Saturday, Representative Devin Nunes of California, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, said the newly released memo showed that Democrats were engaged in a cover-up and were \u201ccolluding with parts of the government\u201d to carry it out.Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said on Saturday that the Democratic memo should \u201cput to rest\u201d Republican assertions of wrongdoing against the former Trump aide, Carter Page, in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act process.\u201cOur extensive review of the initial FISA application and three subsequent renewals failed to uncover any evidence of illegal, unethical or unprofessional behavior by law enforcement and instead revealed that both the F.B.I. and D.O.J. made extensive showings to justify all four requests,\u201d he said in a statement.Republicans, including Mr. Trump, were undeterred. The White House dismissed the Democratic document as an attempt \u201cto undercut the president politically.\u201dThe president said on Saturday night that the memo confirmed the Republican version of events and reflected poorly on Democrats, suggesting that both were grounds for launching an investigation of his political opponents.\u201cThat was nothing but a confirmation, and a lot of bad things happened on the other side \u2014 not on this side, but on the other side \u2014 and somebody should look at it, because what they did was really fraudulent,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview with the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro.\u201cBy somebody,\u201d the president added, \u201cI mean you-know-who.\u201d He appeared to be referring to Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, whom he has savaged in recent days for failing to open an investigation of unspecified \u201ccrimes\u201d by Democrats.The Intelligence Committee dispute centers on an application by the F.B.I. in October 2016 to secure a secret warrant to spy on Mr. Page, suspected by American law enforcement of being a Russian agent, as well as the subsequent renewals.House Democrats made public a heavily redacted memo that was drafted to counter Republican claims of surveillance abuses against a former Trump campaign aide.The Republicans complained that the F.B.I. did not tell a secret intelligence court that Mr. Steele\u2019s work had been financed by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, suggesting that a judge needed to know that information to evaluate the credibility of the information.But the Democratic document shows that the F.B.I. did tell the surveillance court that Mr. Steele\u2019s research was commissioned by someone who wanted to discredit Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and that the information provided by Mr. Steele, a trusted source in the past, was only part of the evidence supporting a wiretap.According to the memo, officials laid out a \u201cmultipronged rationale\u201d for spying on Mr. Page, including his past interactions with Russian spies, and informed the court of a counterintelligence investigation then underway into the Kremlin\u2019s covert influence campaign.Mr. Page, a former investment banker based in Moscow, had been on the F.B.I.\u2019s radar for years, long before his work with Mr. Trump. The Democratic memo reveals that the F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Page as late as March 2016 about his contacts with Russian intelligence agents, the same month Mr. Trump added him to his foreign policy advisory team.The information from Mr. Steele was about \u201cspecific activities in 2016\u201d by Mr. Page, including suspected meetings with close associates of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during a July trip to Moscow, the Democrats said.The document says that the bureau did disclose to the court that it had made use of information that was gathered through politically motivated means and quotes from the application itself.\u201cThe F.B.I. speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the F.B.I. wrote in the application.The Democrats said that it would have been inappropriate and inconsistent with standard practice for officials to have disclosed to the court the names of American individuals and organizations that had paid Mr. Steele.The F.B.I. frequently relies on sources who have agendas, whether it is a gang turncoat or a mafia informer. What is typically seen as important by courts is that the agenda is disclosed to a judge.House Democrats made public a heavily redacted memo that was drafted to counter Republican claims of surveillance abuses against a former Trump campaign aide.In the case of Mr. Page, the surveillance applications were reviewed by four different judges, all appointed by Republican presidents, the document says. Each approved of the request.The memo also asserts that in applications to renew the wiretap, the F.B.I. provided the court with information from independent sources corroborating Mr. Steele\u2019s findings. Much of the specific corroborating evidence was blacked out.And, according to the Democrats, the wiretap produced \u201cvaluable intelligence\u201d for the F.B.I. that was used to justify its renewal three times. The document once again offers specific examples, which were redacted by the Justice Department.The Democratic document also rebuts claims by Republicans, including Mr. Trump, that the F.B.I. relied on Mr. Steele\u2019s findings to open its counterintelligence inquiry in late July 2016. Information from Mr. Steele, the memo says, did not reach the F.B.I. counterintelligence team investigating Russian meddling until mid-September, well after the inquiry had been opened and after the F.B.I. had already begun looking at other campaign associates.The document challenges several other prominent Republican claims. For instance, the Republican memo asserted that the F.B.I. had presented to the court a Yahoo News article from September 2016 as corroboration of Mr. Steele\u2019s claims, despite the fact that it later emerged that Mr. Steele had been a source for it.The Democrats said that the article, and another it did not identify, was merely used to inform the court that Mr. Page had publicly denied having the meetings in Moscow.Mr. Page, in a statement, called the memo \u201ca smear campaign\u201d by Democrats that only made it more important that the underlying applications be released publicly.Adam Goldman, Charlie Savage and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Golden Knights Soar, Las Vegas Stakes Its Claim as a Sports Town", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Mary Kelly and her husband, Thomas Lindqvist, are the type of fans that sports executives in Las Vegas dream about.When the N.H.L. released its schedule last summer, Kelly and Lindqvist saw that their beloved Pittsburgh Penguins would visit Las Vegas to play the expansion Golden Knights on a Thursday in mid-December.Eager to see their team play in the newest N.H.L. city, Kelly, Lindqvist and a dozen friends planned a long weekend around the Penguins game. They booked rooms on the Strip, at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, and spent the weekend seeing the sights.\u201cWe bought tickets as soon as they went on sale,\u201d said Kelly, who has had Penguins season tickets with her husband for a decade. \u201cWe go to about one road game a year, to Chicago, Buffalo, New York, D.C.\u201dBefore game time in Las Vegas, she looked across a plaza outside T-Mobile Arena, where many hundreds of Penguins fans were congregating, and said: \u201cWe did not expect to see this.\u201dIt\u2019s fair to say the owners of the Golden Knights, the N.H.L. and the city of Las Vegas did not expect that, either. By most measures, the hockey team\u2019s inaugural season has been a smashing success \u2014 one the Raiders hope to duplicate when they move to the city from Oakland for the 2020 N.F.L. season.With 41 wins and 87 points through Monday, the Golden Knights have been extending the record for most wins by an N.H.L. expansion team week after week. In first place in the Western Conference, they are the second-highest scoring team in the league and look poised for a playoff run.According to Fanatics, the largest online seller of licensed sports goods, the Golden Knights have ranked fourth in N.H.L. merchandise sales this season \u2014 and first since the start of 2018.The fast start by the Golden Knights has, for now, allayed fears that the N.H.L.\u2019s decision to put another team in a desert city would lead to financial trouble. (See: Coyotes, Arizona.) Commissioner Gary Bettman has for years pushed for new teams in the Sun Belt, with mixed success, and aiming for Las Vegas, in particular, seemed like an overreach.But an influx of out-of-town fans has complemented the Golden Knights\u2019 fast start on the ice and at the box office. This is good news for local hotels, restaurants and casinos, which host 43 million visitors a year, and for the team as it gets its bearings in the market.Other N.H.L. teams in areas that attract transplanted retirees \u2014 like the Arizona Coyotes and the Florida Panthers \u2014 also tend to have strong crowds supporting the opposition. The Golden Knights, though, appear to have specifically designed their game nights like most things in their city: as tourist attractions.While hockey is certainly the central focus of game nights, the Knights have added a medieval motif, sometimes comically. The Zambonis that drive on the ice have jousts mounted on their sides to simulate a duel. The arena includes a 24-foot knight\u2019s helmet and three castle structures, including one for cheerleaders with pompoms. Catapults are used to launch T-shirts into the crowd.\u201cWe wanted to focus on Vegas as the entertainment capital of the world,\u201d Bubolz said.But the definition of success will be far different. While the Knights play in a privately built arena, Nevada promised to use $750 million in hotel taxes to help pay for a new, domed stadium for the Raiders. The bonanza of public money persuaded the league\u2019s owners to let the team move, and melted the N.F.L.\u2019s long-running objections to playing in Las Vegas \u2014 based on the presence of legal sports gambling.The Raiders hope to double down on the Knights\u2019 success at drawing out-of-town visitors. In most N.F.L. markets, roughly 5 percent of fans at a typical game are from out of town. Yet according to the Raiders\u2019 projections, about half the fans at the 10 Raiders home games will come from outside Las Vegas, including many from neighboring California.\u201cAs far back as a decade, we all believed teams would travel very well to Las Vegas,\u201d said Bill Hornbuckle, the president of MGM Resorts International and a member of the Las Vegas Stadium Authority, which has negotiated specifics of the stadium deal with the Raiders.Sporting events in Las Vegas, he added, \u201cmake what is normally a three-hour experience into a three-day experience.\u201dHornbuckle said that of the 48,000 fans who had paid a deposit for personal seat licenses, which will probably cost between $4,000 and $6,000, 48 percent were from Southern Nevada. But nearly 30 percent were from Southern California, and the remainder from elsewhere in the country.But while the Golden Knights moved into a pre-existing arena, the Raiders are responsible for construction of their stadium. The team, though, will have to cover only about one-third of the estimated $1.8 billion price tag. The rest will come from the hotel tax, an N.F.L. contribution of $200 million and an estimated $250 million from the fans\u2019 seat license fees.The Raiders will operate the stadium and keep all revenue from every event there, not only football games. An existing monorail, which was privately financed, may be extended to reach the stadium and ease concerns about traffic and a lack of parking.Jim Nagourney, a former sports executive in New York who now lives in Las Vegas, has repeatedly criticized the arrangement with the Raiders, which could require taxpayers to cover any shortfall in the hotel tax revenue. He said the number of available parking spaces was too small, and he questioned whether half of the stadium\u2019s 65,000 seats could be filled with out-of-town fans. Attendance for preseason games is notoriously spotty, and if the Raiders play poorly, their fans from outside Las Vegas may be less likely to travel long distances to see them, he said.Nagourney also said the assumption that fans would stay for nearly three days was based on visitors for conventions, not sports events. He does not believe it was necessary to bring the Golden Knights and the Raiders to Las Vegas to validate the city\u2019s status.\u201cIt was a prestige thing,\u201d Nagourney said. \u201cBut find me a map that doesn\u2019t already have Las Vegas on it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Make the Friends Happy. Don\u2019t Have a Wedding Party.", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byField NotesWhen Bobby Rosen and Cara Safon got engaged last August, there were many decisions to be made. A venue had to be chosen. A guest list would be created. Neither Mr. Rosen nor Ms. Safon is religious, but the two began discussing possible Jewish and Chinese traditions that they felt might add to their ceremony.One decision required little to no discussion: Both Mr. Rosen and Ms. Safon were certain that they did not want a wedding party to accompany them down the aisle.\u201cWe had talked about this years before we got engaged,\u201d Ms. Safon said. \u201cWe were in full agreement that we didn\u2019t want to have a wedding party.\u201dMs. Safon and Mr. Rosen, both 29, met during a semester abroad in South America while they were attending University of California, Berkeley. They began dating their senior year and have been together since. Mr. Rosen is in his final year of Yale School of Medicine, while Ms. Safon is a researcher at the Yale School of Public Health.They are a part of a growing number of couples who are opting out of the wedding party entirely, regardless of the size and style of the wedding.Ms. Blum, who has been in the planning business for 31 years, notes that the trend of partyless weddings picked up about four to five years ago. This is in part because of the shifting age at which couples are getting married.\u201cFor couples who are 30 and over, I\u2019d say it\u2019s about a 50-50 chance that they have a wedding party. Over 30, a lot of friends are pregnant. They have kids. It becomes much more of a to-do.\u201dThe desire to spare friends the stress of being a bridesmaid or groomsmen is a common theme among these couples, and speaks to a sometimes divisive view of what it means to be in a wedding party. Has it become less of an honor, and more of a hassle?\u201cI wanted our wedding to feel like a really big party,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to feel like they had a role, or a responsibility to fulfill. I don\u2019t even like the idea of telling someone what color to wear. I wanted our friends to be free and unique, and be themselves.\u201dMr. Flatow didn\u2019t mind. Ms. Mahmood said that she and her fianc\u00e9 \u201cliked the idea of it being just the two of us up there. Plus, I feel like there\u2019s always a little friction when it comes down to a bride telling her bridesmaids what to wear, or what events to organize for her.\u201d\u201cI went through the wedding process with my sister and a number of friends,\u201d Ms. Popelka said. \u201cAnd I saw that when they had wedding parties, people would get very hurt that some friends were invited to be in the bridal party and others weren\u2019t. Their friendships weren\u2019t as strong after the wedding because of that.\u201dRather than risk it, Ms. Popelka, who enjoyed being her sister\u2019s maid of honor, decided that she would do without for her wedding. Instead, she and Mr. Beier, 34, planned an intimate wedding with just 38 guests.\u201cAll of my best friends who were there knew that they were important to me,\u201d she said.Ms. Popelka also wanted to spare her friends the costs associated with being a bridesmaid, noting that she had spent, \u201ceasily thousands of dollars\u201d participating in non-local weddings before.\u201cAnd the cost has gone up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe addition of destination bachelorette parties in particular has had an impact; there can be huge variations depending on if you\u2019re a local bridesmaid, or if you\u2019re from out of town.\u201dIt\u2019s an undeniably large cost, especially, as Dr. Thompson says, \u201cfor what amounts to four or five hours of a friend\u2019s life. It\u2019s a big commitment to ask of someone.\u201dMs. Blum says that couples often try to shoulder some of these costs to ease the burden. \u201cThere are so many variables on who pays for what,\u201d she said. \u201cShould you pay for the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses? Part of the groomsmen\u2019s tuxedos? Those are added costs to a, likely, pricey event. A lot of couples think, we don\u2019t need this! We can get ourselves down the aisle.\u201dThese costs can skyrocket even more as wedding parties become larger and larger. Ms. Blum says that, for her couples who do have wedding parties, they are almost always include at least six attendants on each side, sometimes ballooning to 10 or 12.\u201cYou can\u2019t have your second cousin on one side and not the other; you can\u2019t have two of your college roommates and not the third,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same conundrum that it is for guests, but the pressure factor becomes a little more obvious when it\u2019s in the wedding party.\u201dThe wedding party tradition has historical roots dating back to ancient Rome and feudal China. \u201cA bride would have attendants to protect her from evil spirits,\u201d Dr. Thompson said. \u201cBy having several women who are dressed alike, the spirits, or kidnappers, wouldn\u2019t know which person was the bride.\u201dWhile being identically dressed may seem less appealing today, the role of bridesmaid or groomsman remains a position of honor. \u201cThere is a status associated with being in a wedding party that sets you above other guests,\u201d Dr. Thompson said.That separation of wedding party and guests is what Ms. Safon and Mr. Rosen are hoping to avoid when they get married later this year. \u201cWe feel really blessed to have a lot of important people in our lives,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cWe want everyone who is there to participate equally.\u201dMs. Blum says that her couples who skip having attendants are finding other ways to include, or recognize, particularly close friends and family. \u201cYou can have friends be ushers. Or have them walk down the aisle and sit down. Do readings. There are endless variations.\u201dMs. Mahmood and Mr. Flatow had a close friend act as their officiant; they also asked a number of friends to speak at their reception.Ms. Popelka and Mr. Beier kept their guest list small in order to make the entire wedding feel intimate; rather than a traditional reception, they had dinner with their guests at San Francisco\u2019s Wayfare Tavern. Both couples note that their close friends were neither hurt nor surprised by their decision to forgo a wedding party.\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of us planning a wedding the way we want, Bobby,\u201d Ms. Safon said to Mr. Rosen. \u201cWe can do it our way, and make it a really inclusive event.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Wells Fargo and Federal Reserve Struck Deal to Hold Bank\u2019s Board Accountable", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a Thursday evening in mid-January, a group of top Wells Fargo executives sat down for dinner in an upscale surf-and-turf restaurant near the White House. At nearby tables, power brokers ate seafood on ice and sipped cocktails out of copper mugs.The Wells Fargo executives \u2014 including the chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, and the finance chief, John R. Shrewsberry \u2014 enjoyed their crab legs, but they were in Washington on unpleasant business. The Federal Reserve planned to impose tough sanctions on the San Francisco-based bank for years of misconduct and the shoddy governance that allowed it.The executives\u2019 mission, according to three people directly involved in the negotiations, was to avoid further shaking investor confidence in the bank and its management team.Officials at the central bank had a different goal, according to people familiar with their thinking. They wanted to send a message to the Wells board that it would be held responsible for the company\u2019s behavior.As part of the announcement on Friday, the Fed and Wells said the bank would replace four members of its 16-member board, although the changes were not mandated under the so-called consent order.The settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.Ms. Yellen\u2019s successor, Jerome H. Powell, was the top Fed official overseeing the negotiations with Wells Fargo, and he is likely to maintain the Fed\u2019s emphasis on holding bank boards accountable.This account is based on interviews with six people involved in or briefed on the negotiations, representing both the bank and the Fed, who were not authorized to speak publicly about regulatory matters.In early January, Wells officials heard from the Fed that the central bank planned to impose stiff new penalties. Executives were furious that the proposed sanctions seemed more draconian than those imposed on banks that nearly cratered the global economy a decade earlier, according to people familiar with the thinking of top bank executives.Then, on conference calls and face-to-face sessions in Washington, the negotiations began.One crucial participant was Wells\u2019s general counsel, C. Allen Parker. His advantage was that he was new to Wells, not part of what one bank adviser called the \u201cancien r\u00e9gime.\u201d He joined last spring after more than two decades at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the white shoe law firm where he had been the presiding partner.The lead officials for the Fed were its general counsel, Mark E. Van Der Weide, and Michael S. Gibson, the director of supervision and regulation.After an opening round of talks, Wells concluded that the Fed was not likely to budge on its central demand: that the bank put the brakes on any growth until it proved that its governance was substantially improved. That meant the bank would not be able to increase the assets \u2014 like loans or investments \u2014 it was holding above its current level of about $2 trillion.Wells wanted wiggle room. Executives negotiated to have the assets calculated over a rolling two-quarter average. That meant they could swell above $2 trillion at times, as long as they dropped lower at other times.The top priority for Wells was that the order be lifted quickly, said participants in the talks. The bank\u2019s negotiators wanted the Fed to commit to a speedy timetable for reviewing its progress. The Fed responded that it wanted Wells to move quickly, which Wells officials interpreted as meaning the Fed would act swiftly, too.The future of the bank\u2019s board was a thornier issue.Wells had already replaced about half of its scandal-era directors.The Fed wanted more change, according to people familiar with the central bank\u2019s thinking. The regulators had taken notice of public anger about the government\u2019s past practice of taking actions against corporations without holding people responsible. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, had met twice with Ms. Yellen last year to push the Fed to force out Wells\u2019s directors, according to a participant in the meetings. Ms. Warren also made the argument to Mr. Powell, the incoming Fed chairman.While not adopting Ms. Warren\u2019s suggestion, Fed officials emphasized to Wells the importance of \u201crefreshing the board,\u201d said people who participated in the negotiations.Bank executives responded that they already planned to replace four more directors. That would leave no more than three directors who had been around during the misconduct.That appeared to satisfy the Fed.The central bank also alerted Wells that Mr. Gibson, the Fed\u2019s top regulator, planned to write public letters to two former Wells chairmen, scolding them for their inadequate oversight. Wells officials pushed Mr. Gibson not to be too harsh, according to a person familiar with the matter.The two sides reached a rough agreement early last week. It blocked Wells\u2019s assets from going beyond their current level, adopting Wells\u2019s request for assets to be calculated using a rolling average, and required the bank to submit a cleanup plan. It also established a timetable for the Fed to review the bank\u2019s progress, leaving Wells executives hopeful that the handcuffs would come off within a year.The replacement of the four directors wasn\u2019t part of the written agreement, which still needed signoffs from the boards of both the Fed and Wells.Friday was Ms. Yellen\u2019s final working day as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman. It wasn\u2019t clear if that accelerated the settlement talks, but that morning, Wells\u2019s directors held a conference call and voted to sign the consent order, said people close to the bank. A bank executive phoned Mr. Van Der Weide at the Fed to tell him.On Friday afternoon, Ms. Yellen went to the PBS NewsHour studios to tape an interview, not expecting the Wells deal to come to fruition on her watch.The Fed\u2019s announcement described the consent order. The headline of its news release announced the pending departures of four Wells board members.When they saw that, Wells officials were irate, said the people familiar with executives\u2019 thinking. They thought it sounded like the boardroom changes were being done at the Fed\u2019s instruction.The bank\u2019s own announcement of the consent order had mentioned the pending boardroom departures only in passing. The bank had hoped to make the changes without assigning blame to the departing board members.In a hastily convened conference call on Friday night, Mr. Sloan, Wells\u2019s current chief, tried to reassure analysts and investors that the bank would be able to maneuver around the asset cap by selling certain assets and continuing to lend to customers.He estimated on the call that the Fed\u2019s order could shave up to $400 million off the bank\u2019s 2018 profits. That represents less than 2 percent of what Wells earned last year.An earlier version of this article misstated when Elizabeth A. Duke became Wells Fargo\u2019s chairwoman. It was in January, not last summer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kurdish Syria, Where the Fallen Find Fame", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey are the war dead of the Kurds\u2019 participation in Syria\u2019s six years of conflict: Syrian Democratic Force fighters, especially from Kurdish units, who were killed in battle \u2014 and they are everywhere.In a civil war in which hundreds of thousands of Syrians have died, honoring those killed has become a potent recruiting tool, one that all sides use. The Kurds have institutionalized it, lavishing resources on both the dead and their survivors.Veneration of the war dead is a potent morale booster, especially among the People\u2019s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., which Turkey condemns as terrorists. The Americans consider the Kurdish units as the main component of the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is vital in the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State.Do not call her a bereaved mother, said Aisha Affendi, a co-president of the Movement for a Democratic Society in Kobani, whose son Shervan was killed in an ambush at 19. \u201cI am the mother of a martyr,\u201d she said, a phrase habitually uttered with defiance, and one that confers instant credibility in Kurdish society.One of the officials at the Martyrs Institute in Manbij is named Darwish Salahudin, but when people introduce him to a stranger, they won\u2019t use his name, they\u2019ll say, \u201cThis is the brother of the martyred Comrade Botan.\u201dHe brightened, relating that. \u201cWe see it as an honor to be the relative of a martyr; everybody knows who we are.\u201dThe well-funded Martyrs Institutes in every northern Syrian city hand out pensions to parents, spouses and children of fighters killed in battle, and in some cases of civilian victims as well. They also host museums with galleries of hundreds of enlarged photographs of the local fallen; finance signs and billboards with faces of groups of the dead; print off likenesses of all shapes and sizes to distribute to homes, offices and public spaces; and stage public memorial events, with marches and speeches on anniversary days. No public office in Kurdish areas is without at least one and usually many photographs of the fallen.Then there are the cemeteries. Every major city now has a section for the mostly Kurdish fighters from the Y.P.G., as well as the Women\u2019s Protection Units, Y.P.J. They are well tended, with permanent staff and no expense spared, usually in striking contrast with the much shabbier civilian graveyards.The cemetery for war dead outside Kobani, on the border with Turkey, has a towering marble altar pavilion, elaborate and decorative, and a massive rotunda is under construction. Inside the rotunda, officials plan to put keepsakes from many of the dead fighters \u2014 relics like the wristwatches they were wearing when killed, or a notebook, a piece of clothing or even just a lock of hair. All have been gathered and carefully cataloged, waiting for the rotunda museum to be finished.The graves in Kobani, more than 1,200 so far, are each two-tiered marble-clad tombs with earthen planters on top. Many are decorated with a mix of plastic flowers and live plants, and festooned with photographs of the dead.\u201cPeople wish they could be buried here, and I would love to be buried here myself,\u201d said Muhammad Keno, whose niece and nephew, both militia members, are buried in the Kobani cemetery.Similar Martyrs Institutes and cemeteries have sprung up all over the Kurdish areas in northern Syria, which the Kurds call Rojava, and even in Arabic areas like Manbij under their control.Ibrahim Qaleif, an Arab and vice president of the Manbij Martyrs Institute, said he saw nothing strange about such expansive veneration of the dead.\u201cAs much as we give the martyrs, it doesn\u2019t compare to the lives they gave for us,\u201d he said.Staff members at the institutes are continually looking for new ways to make displays for the fallen, he said, ranging from billboards with a hundred of their pictures, to wallet cards the size of baseball cards, with the vital statistics of each war dead.Plans are underway, said the co-president Arif Bali, to begin hanging photographs of the dead from the hall\u2019s ceiling once they run out of wall.\u201cIn our history, we carry a very heavy burden, a debt to our martyrs,\u201d Mr. Bali said. \u201cOur martyrs gave us the right to speak in our own language. They are like flowers in our gardens.\u201dThat is more than just talk. Babies are given the names of the war dead; friends change their names to those of famous fighters who have been killed, or just of fallen friends.Some Kurds even seem to invite death in war, which their American advisers say makes them formidable in battle \u2014 though likely to take considerable casualties. The Americans have expressed consternation that the Kurds will seldom wear body armor or helmets, even when they have the equipment.\u201cWe have a lot of that stuff here, somewhere in storage,\u201d said Haqi Kobani, the deputy commander in charge of administration for the Syrian Democratic Forces, at the militia\u2019s headquarters in northern Syria. \u201cNo one ever wants to wear them.\u201dIn the cemetery for war dead in Qamishli, a city in northern Syria, Farhan Ebid, his son and a friend were planting an olive tree this month in front of the grave of another son, Orhan Qamislo, who died fighting with the Syrian Democratic Forces in Manbij at age 21.Mr. Ebid\u2019s son Abdulrazaq, 19, then joined the Y.P.G. to replace his brother, taking his brother\u2019s backpack, his rifle \u2014 and his name. So he is now also called Orhan Qamislo; even his father addresses him as Orhan.\u201cWhen he took his name, it was like my son the martyr had never died,\u201d Mr. Ebid said.Advertisement"}

Prokhorov, who led Russia\u2019s biathlon federation before and during the 2014 Sochi Games, is backing a long-shot legal effort against the whistle-blower, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that will commence with a defamation lawsuit to be filed in New York State Court on Tuesday.The suit, which The New York Times reviewed before it was filed, claims Dr. Rodchenkov defamed three now-retired Russian biathletes \u2014 Olga Zaytseva, Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina \u2014 when he linked them to the state-controlled scheme that corrupted the last Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.The women, who were stripped of the silver medal they secured in a relay event at the Sochi Games, are seeking $10 million each in damages.The suit is the latest legal maneuver for Russian athletes and sports officials who have been rebuffed at nearly every turn in their effort to dispute their involvement \u2014 witting or unwitting \u2014 in one of global sports\u2019 most notorious cheating scandals. The International Olympic Committee barred Russia from sending a delegation to this month\u2019s Winter Games in South Korea, though about 170 athletes from Russia were given special dispensation to compete as neutral athletes.The I.O.C. will decide this week whether to reinstate Russia\u2019s federation for Sunday\u2019s closing ceremony and allow the Russian flag to be flown there.\u201cThis claim has zero chance of surviving a motion to dismiss,\u201d said James Walden, Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s lawyer. \u201cIt is as credible as the rest of Russia\u2019s lies. So I will gladly defend it.\u201dThe three Russians bringing the suit were among 43 athletes penalized for doping in Sochi by a special I.O.C. panel. Evidence against the three women appears to be among the most damning. According to investigators, drug-testing bottles that held their urine had telltale marks of tampering, their urine samples had levels of salt that aren\u2019t explainable through natural means and their names were included on a register of athletes believed to have been provided performance-enhancing substances by Dr. Rodchenkov.\u201cNone of my athletes have ever tested positive, period,\u201d Mr. Balber said in a telephone interview. He said the athletes went through the same secure protocols that were required of everyone. \u201cThere are so many demonstrably false statements in what Rodchenkov has put in his affidavits and what he said publicly that it\u2019s essentially a house of cards.\u201dThe world\u2019s best athletes schussed down the slopes, zoomed down the track and skated across the ice in South Korea. Here\u2019s what you want to know about this year\u2019s events.Most of the Russian athletes banned by the I.O.C. also have never tested positive for banned substances because the \u201cscheme is by nature and purpose elusive,\u201d according to a 45-page document outlining the disciplinary panel\u2019s reasons for finding Ms. Zaytseva guilty.But the I.O.C.\u2019s disciplinary commission in December determined: \u201cWhatever his motivation may be and whichever wrongdoing he may have committed in the past, Dr. Rodchenkov was telling the truth when he provided explanations of the cover-up scheme that he managed.\u201dRussia\u2019s biathlon program had a doping problem that predated the discovery of the orchestrated scheme, with a spate of athletes from its teams testing positive years earlier.The former I.O.C. President Jacques Rogge said in 2011 that he was so concerned about the country\u2019s biathlon federation that he urged Russia\u2019s president at the time, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to take stronger action against drug cheats. Mr. Prokhorov has been personally touched by the most recent doping allegations, with Dr. Rodchenkov claiming in a sworn affidavit that Mr. Prokhorov played a role in obscuring the scheme when he led the Russian Biathlon Union.Mr. Prokhorov has strongly rejected Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s claims and all doping accusations.\u201cThere are a number of individuals who are providing support for this challenge, both financial and otherwise,\u201d Mr. Balber said about the defamation suit. \u201cMr. Prohkorov is certainly one of them, but he\u2019s not the only one.\u201dMr. Prokhorov, 52, is among several of Russia\u2019s most influential businessmen who back the national Olympic effort. His involvement in the biathlon lawsuit follows a promise he made last year to fight the doping charges.\u201cIf Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina decide to fight and defend their honor, I\u2019m ready to provide any legal and financial support,\u201d Mr. Prokhorov told the Russian news agency Tass in November. \u201cWe have a positive experience in this field. I am prepared to hire the best lawyers to defend the interests of our biathletes in any country of the world, where it will be most appropriate.\u201dIn a telephone interview from Moscow, Ms. Zaytseva said the case was intended to let the world hear the truth, and that the claims against her and her teammates were made up. \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth, and I swear on my parents that I\u2019m telling you the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t anyone believe me but only believe the person who\u2019s accusing me? That for me is very hard to understand.\u201dMs. Zaytseva said she did not understand why her salt levels could be so high, but speculated a diet rich in salted foods like red caviar and salted fish might provide the answer. \u201cBut I repeat I\u2019m not a doctor or a chemist, so I don\u2019t really understand these things,\u201d she said, adding that she had never knowingly taken any banned substances.In September, a Russian court ordered the arrest of Dr. Rodchenkov in absentia. He was accused of \u201cabuse of official powers\u201d which lead to \u201cgrave consequences.\u201dRussian athletes are performing at the Pyeongchang Games as part a neutral team; they are identified only as Olympic Athletes From Russia, and are competing in uniforms and equipment that does not bear the Russian flag. Russia has yet to pay a $15 million fine the I.O.C. demanded in December when it banned a number of athletes, coaches and officials for their roles in the doping conspiracy. The fine must be paid if Russia is to be restored to full membership before the closing ceremony on Sunday.Like Ms. Zaytseva, Mr. Balber said he could not explain why his clients\u2019 samples appeared to be tainted. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, I\u2019m not able to opine on the medical condition, but I do know that the overwhelming majority of statements that he\u2019s made in his affidavits and public statements vis-\u00e0-vis my athletes are false,\u201d he said.Despite being under federal protection, Mr. Rodchenkov has remained in the news media, granting interviews before and during the Winter Games. He said he supported the participation of clean Russian athletes in the Games. The much-depleted team has struggled, failing to win a single gold medal through Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An \u2018Iceberg\u2019 of Unseen Crimes: Many Cyber Offenses Go Unreported", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Philadelphia, hidebound ways of confronting iPhone thefts let thrive illicit networks to distribute stolen cellphones. Detectives treated each robbery as an unrelated street crime \u2014 known as \u201capple picking\u201d \u2014 rather than a vast scheme with connected channels used by thieves to sell the stolen phones.And in Nashville, investigators had no meaningful statistics on a nasty new swindle of the digital age: the \u201ccheating husband\u201d email scheme. In it, anonymous extortionists mass-email large numbers of men, threatening to unmask their infidelities. The extortionists have no idea if the men have done anything wrong, but enough of them are guilty, it turns out, that some pay up, sometimes with Bitcoin.Each case demonstrates how the tools used to fight crime and measure crime trends in the United States are outdated. Even as certain kinds of crimes are declining, others are increasing \u2014 yet because so many occur online and have no geographic borders, local police departments face new challenges not only fighting them, but also keeping track of them. Politicians often promote crime declines without acknowledging the rise of new cybercrimes.Detectives only learned of the \u201ccheating husband\u201d scheme from faithful spouses who were not victims. The crime did not fit into any existing category, and since the police had made no arrests, they had no statistics to feed to a national crime database in Washington that can prepare other jurisdictions for the scheme.\u201cSuspects take advantage, knowing that \u2018Hey, I\u2019m basically committing crimes blindly,\u2019 without the fear of prosecution,\u201d said Capt. Jason M. Reinbold, commander of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department\u2019s criminal investigations division. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t analyze something if I don\u2019t have data.\u201dIn a sense, technology has created an extraordinary moment for industrious criminals, increasing profits without the risk of street violence. Digital villainy can be launched from faraway states, or countries, eliminating physical threats the police traditionally confront. Cyberperpetrators remain unknown. Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, ask themselves: Who owns their crimes? Who must investigate them? What are the specific violations? Who are the victims? How can we prevent it?\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly challenging,\u201d the police chief in Tucson, Chris Magnus, said. \u201cThere\u2019s such a lack of clarity.\u201dThe rise of the crimes flies in the face of the proclamations of politicians who declare crime an all but defeated societal ill.But to many criminologists, academics and law enforcement leaders, crimes like car theft are anachronisms in a modern era in which the internet\u2019s virtual superhighways have supplanted brick-and-mortar streets as the scenes for muggings, prostitution rings or commercial burglaries. They see dips in traditional violence and larceny as offset by a twin phenomenon: A surge in the evolving crimes of the digital era, and the fact that they are not fully captured in law enforcement\u2019s reporting systems.\u201cIt\u2019s the old iceberg metaphor,\u201d said Nola Joyce, a former deputy commissioner of Philadelphia\u2019s police department. \u201cWhat we know about is above the surface. But in terms of value, and in terms of harm, a lot of that crime is below the surface.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying that came out of the Vietnam War,\u201d she added, \u201cthat said, `If you can\u2019t measure what matters, what you measure matters a great deal.\u201dMs. Joyce is working with others on a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, to modernize local and federal crime-classification systems.New solutions are a priority, too, for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and progressive police commanders. They say that without timely, accurate data on crime, criminal justice leaders cannot see and respond coherently to national trends or make informed policy and spending decisions or tailor deployment strategies to best battle them.In its report, Mr. Wexler\u2019s group said its findings represented a wake-up call for the nation\u2019s 18,000 policing agencies facing an increase in technology-based crimes, that sprawl across jurisdictions, and recommended they fight back with similar tools by: developing their own digital expertise; hiring civilian analysts; mining technology, to help solve crime; encouraging banks to forward reports of theft rather write off their losses.Above all, policing needs \u201cbetter systems for gathering data,\u201d the report said.It is an issue that dates back to 1929, when the F.B.I. first rolled out its Uniform Crime Reporting system that still stands today. Designed as a summary count, it mainly tracks a handful of so-called Part One index crimes: murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, arson and auto theft. The counts include only the top charge in a given episode.But 40 years later, data collection is still haphazard as policing agencies that protect just 31 percent of the country\u2019s population volunteer to abide by the deeper reporting standards. (An example: There is no national database of police officers\u2019 use of deadly physical force.) Still, the F.B.I. is charging forward, vowing to move fully to its 1980s-era vision by 2021. Only last year did it began collecting data on two new offenses in its fraud category: hacking/computer invasion and identify theft.\u201cCrime data reporting \u2014 in its current state \u2014 is not collecting the right information to understand and analyze current events,\u201d Stephen G. Fischer Jr., an F.B.I. spokesman, said. \u201cToday\u2019s information age has changed how we see the world and what the world expects from policing.\u201dThe panel of the National Academy of Sciences is looking past the F.B.I.\u2019s unmet goals \u2014 which it sees as one component of a new approach. The panel wants a fresh system for understanding the nature and extent of crime today, said Janet L. Lauritsen, the panel\u2019s chair and a criminology professor at the University of Missouri.Better data fosters transparency, which can build trust with civilians even if it yields statistical crime increases, said Col. Edwin C. Roessler Jr., the police chief in Fairfax County, Va., who is the F.B.I. director\u2019s chairman for converting policing to a new crime classification system. Data offers the evidence to lobby government for more money or better laws, he said. In fact, when Colonel Roessler demonstrated how each gang homicide, on average, required 25 search warrants for \u201ccyberdata, cellphones and other social media,\u201d it helped win financing for a new Cyber Bureau and new \u201ccyberexperts\u201d to work gang cases and build meaningful statistics and intelligence.\u201cWe\u2019ve got gaps here, where we\u2019re not catching the root causes of all kinds of criminal activity,\u201d the colonel said, a flaw with real-life consequences.\u201cOnce you get into cyberspace,\u201d he said, \u201cdata about anything is so limited that it\u2019s really, really hard to figure out even what might be happening locally that impacts that crime.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is It So Hard for Democracy to Deal With Inequality?", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn theory, in a democracy, the majority should influence \u2014 some would even say determine \u2014 the distribution of income. In practice, this is not the case.Over the past few decades, political scientists have advanced a broad range of arguments to explain why democracy has failed to stem the growth of inequality.The result, Piketty argues, is a political system that pits two top-down coalitions against each other:In the 1950s-60s, the vote for left-wing (socialist) parties in France and the Democratic Party in the US used to be associated with lower education & lower income voters. It (the left) has gradually become associated since 1970s-80s with higher education voters, giving rise to a multiple-elite party system: high-education elites vote for the left, while high-income/high-wealth elites for the right, i.e., intellectual elite (Brahmin left) vs business elite (merchant right).In this country, Democratic reforms adopted after the 1968 convention \u2014 an event marked by police violence against antiwar demonstrators \u2014 produced a radical shift in power within the Democratic Party.there was an American party system in which one party, the Republicans, was primarily responsive to white collar constituencies, and in which the other, the Democrats, was primarily responsive to blue collar constituencies.After reform, Shafer contends,there were two parties each responsive to quite different white collar constituencies, while the old blue collar majority within the Democratic Party was forced to try to squeeze back into the party once identified predominately with its needs.Shafer\u2019s white collar constituency is, in fact, what Piketty describes as \u201ca higher education\u201d or \u201cintellectual\u201d elite \u2014 his \u201cBrahmin left.\u201dThe Piketty report is a significant contribution to the growing collection of studies analyzing the inability of democratic forces to adequately counter inequality.They cite five possible explanations.First, growing bipartisan acceptance of the tenets of free market capitalism. Second, immigration and low turnout among the poor resulting in an increasingly affluent median voter. Third, \u201crising real income and wealth has made a larger fraction of the population less attracted to turning to government for social insurance.\u201d Fourth, the rich escalated their use of money to influence policy through campaign contributions, lobbying and other mechanisms. And finally, the political process has been distorted by polarization and gerrymandering in ways that \u201creduce the accountability of elected officials to the majority.\u201dIn the five years since their essay was published, we\u2019ve seen all of this play out; in the case of campaign contributions in particular, the authors provide strong evidence of the expanding clout of the very rich.In recent decades, there has been a large increase in the number of people who contribute to political campaigns: In 1980, there were 224,322 individual contributions, the four authors write, and by 2012, that number grew to 3,138,564.The accompanying chart shows that the share of contributions donated by the top 0.01 percent of the voting age population grew from 16 percent in the 1980s to 40 percent in 2016.In other words, if money buys influence over policy, the top 0.01 percent bought nearly triple the influence in 2016 that it purchased in the early 1980s.It\u2019s not a new thing. This is what George Wallace and Ronald Reagan were about also. Its current reincarnation is almost surely due to the fact that both globalization and technological changes have left behind vast swathes of the country. But why have these people found a home in the Republican Party, not in the Democratic Party? That\u2019s less clear, but if I were to make a guess, I would say that this is related to the fact that economic hardship does not work by itself. It needs to tap into other grievances, and in the US context these have been related to pent-up hostility towards blacks and immigrants (and perhaps their own albeit slow upward mobility). If so, it is natural that it is the Republican Party, with its southern strategy and more welcoming attitude towards soft racism, that has come to house this discontent.Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale who writes extensively about inequality, praised Piketty\u2019s work but noted that he and othershave argued that the Democrats were cross-pressured by rising inequality because they wanted to maximize campaign cash as well as votes and because they got most of their institutional support from a coalition of single-issue groups. This cross-pressure, in turn, contributed to their weak attempt to maintain the allegiance of the white working class.Like Acemoglu, Hacker argues that the Piketty analysis does not place enough emphasis on race:It doesn\u2019t seem very fundamental to Piketty\u2019s story. Yet it\u2019s impossible to deny that the realignment of the parties around race created the opening for the GOP to gain the support of white voters \u2014 especially downscale white voters \u2014 by exploiting resentment of racial and ethnic minorities.\u201cI\u2019m not sure this analysis is all that useful,\u201d Baker wrote me.I see Piketty is missing the way in which markets have been restructured to redistribute income upward and to take away options for reversing inequality and promoting growth in ways that benefit low and middle income workers.Piketty, in Baker\u2019s view, \u201csees the market outcomes as largely given and redistribution just means tax and transfer policy.\u201dBaker is not optimistic about full-throated economic liberalism in the Democratic Party.\u201cBecause the party has largely supported an agenda that redistributes upward, they have lost much of their working class base,\u201d he wrote in his email to me:The friends you keep matter. The speeches that folks like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama give at Wall Street firms are not a good look. The banks don\u2019t hand you huge honorariums if they think you are going to take their money and put them in prison.There is \u201can ongoing battle,\u201d Baker continued,in the Democratic Party as well as in most of the left parties across Europe. There are those who would like to accept inequality and focus exclusively on issues like gender equality and anti-racism. I would never minimize the importance of combating gender inequality or racism/nativism, but if that means ignoring the policies that have led to the enormous inequality we now see, that is not a serious progressive agenda.If Democrats must adopt a broader agenda to counter inequality, Piketty\u2019s study is indispensable. He demonstrates that the highly educated constituency currently controlling the party has been ineffective in protecting the material interests of the less well off.For one thing, the well-educated leadership of the left is thriving under the status quo. The economic gains of those with college degrees \u2014 now, remember, the majority of the Democratic electorate \u2014 are shown in the accompanying graphic. From 1988 to 2012, the inflation-adjusted income of college graduates increased by 16 percent and for those with advanced degrees by 42 percent.In contrast, those with some college but no degree saw a 1 percent increase; those with a high school degree saw a 0.3 percent income growth; and those without a high school degree saw their income decline by 13 percent.There is no question that the Democrats\u2019 loss of non-college white support has deep roots in the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. The fight for equal rights for African-Americans resulted in the full-scale regional realignment of the South toward the Republican Party and turned once solidly Democratic precincts in working class sections of Chicago, Boston, Milwaukee and other major cities into partisan battlegrounds.These upheavals have left the party of the left ill-equipped to tackle not only inequality but economic mobility more broadly and with it the pervasive decline of much of what has become red America.This in turn raises the question: Can a party split between an upscale wing that is majority white and a heavily minority working class wing effectively advocate on behalf of a liberal-left economic agenda? The jury is out on this question, but the verdict could very well be no.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Boeing\u2019s Pursuit of Beloved Brand in Brazil Hits Political Headwind", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 The American aerospace giant Boeing is eagerly pursuing a partnership with the Brazilian jet maker Embraer as part of a global battle with its European rival, Airbus.But the talks, which moved into high gear late last year, are advancing at a politically fraught time in Brazil, and the Brazilian government \u2014 which owns a so-called golden share that gives it veto power over any change in ownership at Embraer \u2014 could derail a deal the two companies are said to be racing to complete.A deal with Embraer would give Boeing a broader portfolio of aircraft, including, crucially, access to Embraer\u2019s smaller regional planes, which compete directly with jets manufactured by the Canadian company Bombardier.To prevail, however, Boeing will need to overcome political misgivings in Brazil, even though Embraer has a lot to gain.The Brazilian government, which appeared to have been caught off guard when news of the talks emerged in late December, has responded warily, and coolly, to the idea of ceding to a foreign company significant control of an enterprise that is a source of national pride and a pillar of Brazil\u2019s defense industry.President Michel Temer told journalists in December that foreign participation could be welcome up to a point, but that a takeover was out of the question: \u201cThere isn\u2019t the slightest consideration of selling control to another company,\u201d he said.Boeing, backed by the Trump administration, sought to undermine Bombardier even before Airbus snapped up a 50.01 percent stake in the CSeries program, by arguing before the United States Trade Commission that the Canadian company had taken advantage of Canadian subsidies to sell planes to Delta Air Lines below market cost.At Boeing\u2019s urging, the Commerce Department had decided that duties of nearly 300 percent should be placed on the CSeries aircraft. But in a surprise move, the commission, an independent agency, ruled against Boeing last week, raising the stakes of its courtship with Embraer.The two companies have a lot to gain from an alliance and virtually no overlap in production, according to analysts. Beyond expanding its portfolio, Boeing could take advantage of an army of experienced engineers who are not currently working on new models at Embraer.\u201cThis partnership is a powerful opportunity to align two national aerospace leaders,\u201d Phil Musser, the senior vice president of communications for Boeing, said in a recent statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a great fit for both companies.\u201d\u201cThe one thing everyone is focused on right now is co-opting smaller players,\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, which tracks the aerospace and defense industries. \u201cAnd the problem for Boeing is that, oh boy, Airbus is looking global.\u201dWith Brazil\u2019s presidential election looming in October, political opposition to the deal is only expected to grow, putting pressure on Boeing and Embraer to find common ground as quickly as possible. Officials at both companies declined to describe the state of negotiations in detail.Conversations have been constant since December, with Boeing executives shuttling back and forth to Bras\u00edlia, the capital, to meet with a newly created negotiating group, with officials from the Defense and Finance Ministries, the Air Force and the Brazilian Development Bank, which is also a stakeholder in Embraer.Officials from both companies and the Brazilian government said Boeing had sought to make its initial takeover proposal more palatable by offering concessions. The possible concessions would include allowing the Brazilian government to retain veto rights over strategic decisions and military programs, and creating a distinct subsidiary with firewalls that would safeguard defense projects and technology.Boeing has not abandoned hope of getting a controlling interest, according to sources at both companies familiar with the negotiations, and it is contemplating structuring the deal in a way that would leave Embraer with significant autonomy.On Friday, a prominent Brazilian columnist wrote that Boeing had a new proposal to create a separate company with Embraer\u2019s commercial aviation business, splitting it from the military business. In a securities filing, Embraer responded that it had not received a new proposal from Boeing, but that \u201cthe parties involved are analyzing possibilities to enable a combination of their businesses, which could include the creation of other companies.\u201dJoining forces would give Embraer the global reach of Boeing at a time when Chinese and Russian manufacturers are encroaching on its market. It would also cut its supply-chain costs.Embraer was privatized in 1994, and foreign investors now hold 85 percent of the company\u2019s shares, but the company remains one of Brazil\u2019s most iconic and beloved brands. Putting it on the market during an election year will almost certainly force presidential candidates to stake out nationalistic positions.While champions of a deal at both companies say they recognize that the window of opportunity is getting narrower by the day, they continue to pursue a partnership aggressively.\u201cThe opportunity with Embraer we do think is an important one,\u201d said Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive officer of Boeing, during an earnings call this past week. \u201cWe know that the government of Brazil has raised some concerns or issues that we fully respect, and we\u2019re working through the details of potential options going forward and doing that in a very diligent way.\u201dBut some analysts are skeptical the deal can be pulled off in the face of such political headwinds.\u201cI don\u2019t see it happening,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cThis is the crowning achievement of Brazilian industry. A lot of people are going to fight it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tax Law Gives Municipal Bonds a New Allure", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many people with hefty state and local tax bills, the new federal tax law gives municipal bonds a powerful new appeal.That is because the new law caps the state and local tax deduction that can be claimed on federal returns at $10,000. For many households, that cap will outweigh any potential benefits from other changes in the law.For such people, tax-free investment income becomes ever more valuable \u2014 and municipal bonds can fit the bill.The interest income paid on municipal bonds is exempt from federal tax. And if you own municipal bonds issued within your state, the interest income can also be free of state (and often local) tax.What\u2019s more, the economic backdrop for 2018 could make municipal bonds one of the better slices of the fixed-income market. Municipal bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than, say, Treasury bonds, whose yields have been rising as Federal Reserve interest rate policy shifts, and with glimmers of inflation getting off the floor.A high-grade, 10-year municipal bond issue currently has an average yield of roughly 2.5 percent. That compares with a 3.3 percent taxable yield for someone in the 24 percent federal tax bracket, and 4 percent for a taxpayer paying the top federal rate of 37 percent. The taxable equivalent yield is even higher if the income is also exempt from a state tax.By comparison, the yield on a 10-year Treasury bond is below 3 percent and the yield on the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund, which invests in taxable government and corporate bonds, was recently only 2.5 percent.Despite the appeal of munis, though, you need to be careful: The muni market can be tricky.For one thing, amid fiscal belt tightening since the financial crisis, the pace of new municipal bonds hitting the market has declined. The tax law revision also eliminated advance refunding issues, a type of municipal bond financing that accounts for around 15 percent of the market, intensifying supply constraints.At the same time, individual investors own about 70 percent of the municipal bonds, and demand from them seems likely to remain strong. Morningstar Direct reported $34 billion in net inflows to municipal bond funds and exchange-traded funds in 2017 \u2014 even before investors in high-tax states had the chance to huddle with their advisers to assess the impact of the new tax law.With hungry investors chasing a smaller pool of municipal issues, the prices of bonds are likely to be bid higher. (In the world of bonds, yields move in the opposite direction from prices; so higher bond prices mean lower yields.)That pressure has already caused the yield difference between municipal bonds and comparable Treasuries to widen \u2014 reducing the muni advantage. For much of the last decade, the tax-free yield on a 10-year high-grade municipal bond was at least 90 percent of the taxable yield on a 10-year Treasury. That ratio is now down to the low 80s. Hugh McGuirk, head of the municipal bond team at T. Rowe Price, expects that this ratio will \u201cbe even under more pressure\u201d as a result of these supply and demand issues.Municipal bonds issued within your home state can be enticing because of the extra tax features. Around one-quarter of the nearly $700 billion in muni bond funds and E.T.F.s is invested in single-state portfolios, according to Morningstar Direct.Troubles loom on the horizon, though.Moreover, the $10,000 federal cap on state and local tax deductions may make it harder for local officials to sell tax increases. If residents balk at higher taxes, future revenue increases will increasingly be generated through less-predictable fees and fines. Over time, that sort of shift could impair a city\u2019s or state\u2019s financial health. \u201cIt may be a subtle year-over-year change where the cumulative impact over a decade could be meaningful,\u201d said Mr. Stern of Breckinridge.That would hurt general obligation municipal bonds, which are backed by the taxing power of a municipality. Mr. McGuirk of T. Rowe Price said that while these bonds account for about one-third of new muni issues annually, his firm\u2019s municipal bond funds usually have 15 percent or less invested in them.\u201cThat\u2019s our long-term concern, baked in for the challenges of state and local issuers to finance obligations,\u201d he said. It is a concern that seems to be shared by many managers; according to Morningstar Direct, the average muni fund allocates 15 percent to those bonds.Another type of muni, a general revenue issue, is an alternative. Such bonds rely on the income generated by a specific project, like a water and electricity project. That income source could be quite reliable, because households and businesses are likely to keep paying their utility bills. For households now facing higher personal income tax bills because of the reduction in the state and local income tax break, these bonds might rate as essential tools to generate tax-free income.Advertisement"}

But the steady move of technology companies into downtown San Francisco is shifting the center of gravity of what is arguably America\u2019s most innovative industry from the rambling, suburban streets of the Valley to the tightly concentrated and increasingly vertical neighborhood behind San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero.Facebook\u2019s decision last year to lease more than 400,000 square feet in a skyscraper across from the newly opened Salesforce Tower will put offices of the biggest names in tech \u2014 Google and LinkedIn among them \u2014 within walking distance of each other.In the middle of all this is the Transbay Transit Center, which opens in June and is advertised as the Grand Central of the West.\u201cThe building is starting to come to life,\u201d said Dennis Turchon, senior construction manager for the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, the public organization charged with building the structure.To critics it is a glorified bus terminal, and an expensive one at that \u2014 the cost hovers around $6 billion, according to the authority.Yet the transit center has ambitions to be much more. A 5.4-acre park on the roof has a half-mile walking loop, an outdoor theater and gardens populated by dozens of mature trees. It\u2019s an elevated park that has been compared to the High Line in New York. The tech offices that surround the center connect directly with the park, as does a gondola that will whisk visitors to the park for the sidewalk below.During a week in which the Trump administration has sought to put infrastructure on the agenda, the transit center, which was built with close to $600 million in federal money from the stimulus package during the Great Recession, is a rubber-meets-the-road test for America\u2019s infrastructure plans. The center was built on top of a giant underground concrete box designed to be the San Francisco terminus for both CalTrain, the railway that runs through Silicon Valley to San Jose, and high-speed rail, which is meant to connect San Francisco with Los Angeles.Building the 1.3-mile tunnel that will bring the tracks into the station will take years and hundreds of millions of dollars.

It conferred eligibility only on female property owners age 30 and older, the culmination of years of campaigning and militancy by leaders such as Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst. It took a decade more before Britain extended the vote to all women 21 and over.Since then, much legislation has been passed to advance women\u2019s equality. Ms. Hughes-Jennett, wearing the suffragists\u2019 white, green and purple ribbon on her jacket lapel, pointed to the Equal Pay Act in 1970. \u201cBut it still takes a while for culture to catch up with the law,\u201d she said.Ms. Brandler said, \u201cWomen have moved closer to the glass ceiling, but a woman has to be twice as good to be equal to a man.\u201dBritain\u2019s suffragist movement emerged in the late 19th century, when Parliament extended the franchise to greater swaths of the male population while continuing to deny it to women. The National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies, made up mostly of middle-class women, was formed in 1897, eventually becoming the biggest suffrage organization, with 50,000 members.Originally, under the leadership of Fawcett, the movement was largely moderate. But it eventually split, with a more militant faction, the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union, forming under by Pankhurst.Pankhurst, who was arrested numerous times, led angry street demonstrations at which hundreds of suffragists were arrested. Beginning around 1910, their tactics became quite violent, including arson attacks and the bombing of the house belonging to the chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George.One suffragist, Mary Richardson, slashed a painting at the National Gallery in London with a meat cleaver. A Sikh princess, Sophia Duleep Singh, threw herself in front of the prime minister\u2019s car.Those actions have stoked a debate lately over whether the women should be considered \u201cterrorists.\u201d The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed that issue on Tuesday, pledging to pardon them posthumously if he ever claims the prime ministership.Earlier in the day, the original Representation of the People Act was wheeled out in Parliament for the first time. And in Manchester, birthplace of the suffragist movement, Prime Minister Theresa May talked about the women who \u201cpersevered in spite of all danger and discouragement because they knew their cause was right.\u201dMrs. May also appeared in Parliament for a photograph with all of its more than 200 female members.\u201cWe\u2019ve made good progress,\u201d Britain\u2019s home secretary, Amber Rudd, said on Twitter. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to do to help women in politics.\u201dAcross London, people thronged around Parliament and Trafalgar Square, where 59 life-size images of prominent suffragists were displayed.The government is spending $1.4 million to erect statues of women across the country. In April, Fawcett will become the first woman to be so honored in Parliament Square. A statue of Pankhurst will go up in Manchester, the city\u2019s first new monument to a woman in more than 100 years.On Trafalgar Square on Tuesday, a group of high school seniors was taking selfies by the suffragist portraits.

{"Headline": "With a Monday Vote Expected, Democrats Press to Release Their Own Memo", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee backed away on Sunday from President Trump\u2019s claim that a newly released memo vindicates him in the Russia investigation, Democrats pressed for the release of their own classified rebuttal, with a vote expected on Monday on whether to make it public.Democrats have said their 10-page memo corrects mischaracterizations by the Republicans and adds crucial context to actions by the F.B.I. and the Justice Department in obtaining a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order to wiretap the former Trump aide, Carter Page.The Democratic document, if the Intelligence Committee votes to release it, would be subject to the same review by the president. An official said on Sunday that the White House was open to releasing it pending an examination to protect intelligence sources and methods.\u201cGenerally speaking, we\u2019re open to considering any document the House Intel Committee submits to us for declassification along the lines that the Nunes memo was considered,\u201d said a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, referring to Representative Devin Nunes of California, who spearheaded the Republican memo as the Intelligence Committee chairman.The Democratic memo is said to contend that the F.B.I. was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than Republicans had claimed. Republicans allege that the bureau did not disclose to the court that information from a former British spy, Christopher Steele, that was used in the warrant application had been partly financed by the Democratic National Committee and lawyers for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.People familiar with the document have said it also rebuts Republican claims that Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I. at the time, had told the Intelligence Committee late last year that the agency would not have sought a wiretap of Mr. Page without Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier of information.Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, a senior Democrat on the committee, said on Sunday that Americans needed to see the Democratic document.\u201cWhat we will learn is that it is not true that this FISA warrant was awarded solely on the basis of the Steele dossier,\u201d Mr. Himes said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe will also learn that the F.B.I., because they are very careful people, didn\u2019t mislead the judge, that the judge had some sense that this information came out of a political context.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, told Mr. Trump in a letter that any move to block the memo would \u201cconfirm the American people\u2019s worst fears\u201d that the release of the Republican document was intended solely to undermine the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.House Republicans had been promoting their secret memo for weeks, with some arguing that it would fundamentally reshape the public\u2019s view of Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry. Mr. Trump, who has routinely referred to the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d characterized the memo as a damning indictment of the inquiry.But even though the president said the memo had vindicated him, in reality it did nothing to clear him of either collusion with the Russians or obstruction of justice \u2014 the lines of inquiry being pursued by Mr. Mueller. The memo in fact undermined some Republicans\u2019 efforts to cast doubt on the roots of the investigation by confirming that the inquiry was already underway before law enforcement officials presented the Steele information in obtaining the warrant to conduct surveillance on Mr. Page.On Sunday, several Republicans on the Intelligence Committee distanced themselves from Mr. Trump\u2019s statements. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, who advised the Republican committee staff members who drafted the memo, said that he saw no substantive connection.\u201cIn my opinion, what we\u2019re dealing with is a situation within our FISA court and how we process within our government agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it really has anything to do with that,\u201d he added, referring to the broader Russia inquiry.The people familiar with the Democratic document say that it reveals that while the F.B.I. did not name the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign as having funded the Steele research, the bureau disclosed to the court that the information it had received from him was politically motivated. That, the Democratic memo says, gave the judge in the case the information he needed to make a decision about its usefulness.The memo is also said to argue that Republicans distorted the testimony by Mr. McCabe, the F.B.I. official, and left out reams of other evidence included by the F.B.I. to support the bureau\u2019s suspicions that Mr. Page was acting as an agent of Russia. Mr. McCabe in fact presented the material as part of a constellation of compelling evidence that raised serious suspicions about Mr. Page, a former Moscow-based banker who had been on the F.B.I.\u2019s radar for years, according to those familiar with the memo.Democrats have publicly called for the Republican-controlled committee to release a transcript of the interview with Mr. McCabe.Peter Baker contributed reporting from West Palm Beach, Fla.Advertisement"}

Mr. Orban was among the recipients of scholarships from foundations sponsored by the financier during the transition to democracy.In 1991, he founded Central European University and gave it a generous endowment, which stood at 500 million euros, or about $610 million, last year, creating one of the most modern and sought-after centers for the social sciences in the country and Eastern Europe.The threat to close it was part of relentless government campaign to associate Mr. Soros with the migration crisis and to persuade Hungarians that he was educating and financing opposition to Mr. Orban\u2019s government.As Hungary prepares for elections in April that are widely expected to hand Mr. Orban four more years as prime minister, the campaign has grown more intense. Visitors to Hungary this winter saw a country in which Mr. Soros was depicted as a public enemy.Large billboards were a frequent presence throughout the country, and advertisements on radio, television and the internet all had the same message: Mr. Soros is organizing mass migration to Hungary and the rest of Europe.Last month, the government proposed the so-called Stop Soros Bill, which would ban organizations judged to support migration and tax financing they receive from organizations abroad.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the status of Central European University, saying that it had been \u201cspared\u201d closure because it had received accreditation.

Cohen, President Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, said on Tuesday that he had paid $130,000 out of his own pocket to a pornographic-film actress who had once claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump.\u201cNeither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in a statement to The New York Times. \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201dHe declined to answer several follow-up questions, including whether Mr. Trump had been aware that Mr. Cohen made the payment, why he made the payment or whether he had made similar payments to other people over the years.Mr. Cohen has previously said that Mr. Trump has denied an affair with Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. She has said the affair took place soon after Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, gave birth to the couple\u2019s son, Barron.Mr. Cohen said that he had given a similar statement to the Federal Election Commission in response to a complaint filed by the government watchdog group Common Cause, which contended that the payment, made through a limited liability company that Mr. Cohen established, was an in-kind contribution to the Trump campaign.Officials with Common Cause also sought to determine whether the payment was made by the Trump Organization or another person.\u201cThe complaint alleges that I somehow violated campaign finance laws by facilitating an excess, in-kind contribution,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in his statement. \u201cThe allegations in the complaint are factually unsupported and without legal merit, and my counsel has submitted a response to the F.E.C.\u201dHe said he would not make any additional comments about the commission complaint \u201cor regarding Ms. Clifford.\u201dHope Hicks, now the White House communications director, said at the time that the report of an affair was \u201ctotally untrue\u201d and that the Trump campaign had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of any payment to Ms. McDougal.Maggie Astor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Coalition Deal Has Both Sides Sour, Even Before the Ink Dries", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt this stage, it is hard to tell which side feels most aggrieved.During the election campaign, Mr. Schulz told voters his party\u2019s role was in opposition. He insisted that neither the Social Democrats, nor he personally, would enter into another government led by Chancellor Merkel.Weeks later, as the deal for the new government began to take shape, Mr. Schulz went further, announcing that he would be willing to take on the post of foreign minister. That stoked ire among the rank-and-file, which have yet to approve the deal.Sensing the need to quell the discontent, Mr. Schulz walked back his designs on the Foreign Ministry and announced that he would step down as the party\u2019s chairman as well.\u201cWith my resignation from office and decision not to participate in the government, I want to bring the debate over personnel in the Social Democrats to an end, so that the members can really concentrate on what is in the coalition agreement,\u201d Mr. Schulz told reporters on Tuesday.\u201cI leave this office without bitterness or resentment,\u201d Mr. Schulz added. \u201cIn this office, I have experienced highs and lows as are seldom experienced in politics in such a form. That is just the way it is.\u201dNot all Social Democrats are so persuaded.Despite winning two key ministries, finance and foreign, and commitments to work toward several of their policy goals, many of the 470,000 Social Democratic members remain staunchly opposed to what they view as a sellout.Now, party leaders are racing against their own March 2 deadline for the rank and file to vote thumbs up or down on the deal. A rejection would sent the country back to new elections.Even as the Social Democrats scramble to sell the new agreement, in the eyes of many members of the chancellor\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic Union, it is their party, not its junior partners, that has been forced to make the greatest concessions.Ms. Merkel appeared on the country\u2019s public broadcaster ZDF on Sunday night to explain her decisions and respond to the growing criticism from within her own ranks.\u201cI understand the disappointment,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. But she said the coalition was necessary to ensure stability and Berlin\u2019s ability to play a defining role in Europe. \u201cAnd now we need to show that we can start with a new team,\u201d she said.Even if that new team finally gets into place, the long haggling and the divisive preamble to her next government have made it clear that the chancellor will be in a weakened position.The Social Democrats received just 20.5 percent of the election results, and yet still found themselves in a position of power in the coalition negotiations, noted Martin Florack, a professor of political science at the University of Duisburg-Essen.The chancellor was left with little choice but to make deep concessions to get the Social Democrats on board for another joint government \u2014 the third such venture since 2005. The alternative would have been new elections, and possibly the end of her tenure.\u201cI think the Social Democrats were in a position to let the coalition talks collapse, and Ms. Merkel couldn\u2019t have afforded that,\u201d Mr. Florack said.So far, neither the chancellor\u2019s explanations nor the reshuffling at the top of their own party have been enough to convince the youth wing of the Social Democrats that a new role in government is worth it.The coalition agreement \u201cis an expression of a more-of-the-same attitude and a riding out of problems,\u201d the Young Socialists, or Jusos, said in a position paper that evaluated the terms of the agreement.Their leader, Kevin K\u00fchnert, is campaigning for the rejection of the deal on the ground that it lacks the change the younger generation says is needed after 12 years of Ms. Merkel\u2019s leadership.\u201cWe have a responsibility to think beyond the perspective of four years,\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert told a crowd in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg district on Tuesday. \u201cWe have a responsibility to look at why our party is constantly ramming its head against a wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The short answer is that, in most places in the world, the reckless borrowing that led up to the financial crisis of 2008 does not seem to have reoccurred. Still, when a long period of low interest rates ends, as appears to be the case now, all the borrowers and lenders who have grown used to cheap credit may retrench in ways that may not be initially obvious. In other words, debt has a propensity to bite the economy on the behind just when it least expects it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Bell Pottinger, P.R. Firm for Despots and Rogues, Met Its End in South Africa", "Date": "2018-02-04", "News": "The British firm Bell Pottinger, hired by three brothers now caught up in a nationwide corruption scandal, helped drive racial tensions to levels not felt since apartheid.Supported byThis is ironic because Bell Pottinger always seemed defiantly beyond shame. During its 30 years in the upper echelons of Britain\u2019s spin doctoring game, it sought to polish the image of dictators (Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus), repressive regimes (Bahrain and Egypt, to name two) and celebrities accused of despicable crimes (the Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius after he was charged with murder).As the power of the Guptas and their holding company, Oakbay Investments, gained attention, the family wanted the public relations equivalent of a stun grenade \u2014 a distraction that would draw attention away from them and onto their many enemies.So Bell Pottinger was retained, and given an assignment that initially sounded benign enough: grass-roots political activism intended to help poor blacks.By the following year, Bell Pottinger was embroiled in a national maelstrom. In TV reports, editorials and public rallies, it stood accused of setting off racial tensions through a furtive campaign built on Twitter bots, hate-filled websites and speeches. All were pushing a highly toxic narrative, namely that whites in South Africa had seized resources and wealth while they deprived blacks of education and jobs. The message was popularized with an incendiary phrase, \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201dHow Bell Pottinger went bankrupt is a tale of corporate skulduggery that seems lifted from \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the P.R. edition. During the Gupta disaster, a vicious boardroom struggle unfolded, one that pitted a co-founder, Tim Bell, against James Henderson, 53, who ran the firm in the years before it went under. Their conflict centered on the perennials of business potboilers, namely power and money.The scandal has engulfed the nation. Mr. Zuma is a member of the African National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela and post-apartheid comity. His alliance with the Guptas, and their exploitation of racial animosity, has underscored just how far the party has wandered from its roots after winning its first election in 1994.Though the only corporate fatality, Bell Pottinger is just one of the companies tainted by the Guptas. A small coterie of multinationals is now under investigation by South African authorities, including local units of three companies, McKinsey, KPMG and the software giant SAP.The Guptas\u2019 most devastating legacy is the harm they did to the cause of economic reform. With so many blacks in South Africa mired in poverty, the topic is urgent, but discussion about it has been debased by its association with a notorious and self-serving P.R. campaign.In the midst of that campaign, racial tensions rose to levels that had not been felt since apartheid. \u201cWhite monopoly capital,\u201d a phrase that for years had been confined to left-wing academic circles, was suddenly unavoidable. A political group with reported links to the Guptas warned of a coming civil war.When Bell Pottinger\u2019s role became public, protesters rallied against the company, both in South Africa and outside the firm\u2019s London office. A subsequent investigation by the Public Relations and Communications Association, a trade group in Britain, ended with the ejection of Bell Pottinger.\u201cIn my years of running the P.R.C.A., I have never seen anything worse, never seen anything equal to it,\u201d Francis Ingham, director general of the trade association, said in an interview. \u201cThe work was on a completely new scale of awfulness. Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201dWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.London is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.It was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\u201cMorality is a job for priests,\u201d he deadpanned in a recent interview, between puffs of an ever-present cigarette. \u201cNot P.R. men.\u201dWith the company co-founder, Piers Pottinger, Mr. Bell conceived a \u201cgo anywhere, do anything\u201d ethos, as they called it. When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.Bell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.This included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.After two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.When the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.In fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.The Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.Fret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201dMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201dBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201dThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201dThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201dSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.The corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.The billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201dBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.Mr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.For his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201dThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.More than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.There were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.As the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.An atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201dNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201dFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\u201cMe and others felt that there was something strange going on under the surface of this onslaught,\u201d said Pieter-Louis Myburgh, author of \u201cThe Republic of Gupta.\u201d \u201cLong before Bell Pottinger\u2019s role became known, we smelled a rat.\u201dThe campaign coincided with a period in which the Guptas badly needed a makeover. The brothers had moved to South Africa from Uttar Pradesh in India in 1993 at the behest of their father, who thought the end of apartheid was a terrific business opportunity. The Guptas befriended a variety of A.N.C. luminaries, including Mr. Zuma.Relationships with politicians were soon producing results, said Mr. Myburgh. In 2016, South Africa\u2019s Sunday Times listed Atul Gupta as the seventh richest man in the country, with a net worth equivalent to more than $700 million.The brothers had operated in relative obscurity until 2013, when a jet filled with some 200 guests attending the four-day wedding of a Gupta niece was given permission by a highly placed official to land at an air force base that ordinarily barred commercial traffic. The public was incensed.From there, the publicity would only get worse. Politicians described being summoned to the Gupta compound and offered ministerial jobs and, on occasion, multimillion-dollar bribes.In March 2016, a onetime A.N.C. member of Parliament named Vytjie Mentor wrote on Facebook, and later in a sworn affidavit, that the Guptas said she could become minister of public enterprises, though only if she helped cancel the India route flown by South African Airways. (The Guptas had links to a rival.) When she declined, Jacob Zuma ambled into the room and told her, in Zulu, \u201cIt\u2019s OK, girl. Take care of yourself,\u201d according to the affidavit.Bell Pottinger\u2019s work for the Guptas was not widely known until November 2016, when a video interview of Ajay Gupta, arranged by the company, leaked to the media. The content of the interview was largely banal. It was proof, though, that one of Britain\u2019s most famous P.R. firms was helping the brothers.The leak alarmed Mr. Henderson because the video resided exclusively on the company\u2019s servers. Mr. Henderson hired Pelican Worldwide, a corporate intelligence firm, to determine whether someone had hacked Bell Pottinger\u2019s system. When no signs of hacking were found, suspicion inside the company fell on Jonathan Lehrle and Darren Murphy, two executives who would depart in December 2016 and start a new P.R. firm with Mr. Bell.Both men deny involvement.Bell Pottinger\u2019s links to the Guptas went full-on radioactive in March of last year, when a mysterious 21-page report was posted on the website of the South African Communist Party. Written anonymously and without any cited sources, the report laid out the history of Bell Pottinger\u2019s work for the Guptas, tagging the firm as the brains behind Twitter hashtags, like #HandsofftheGuptas and an array of bogus social media accounts.Mr. Henderson issued a news release asserting the report contained statements that were \u201cwholly untrue.\u201dHe had a point.Instead, the role of Bell Pottinger was to keep a close eye on social media related to the Guptas and their enemies. A cache of some 200,000 internal documents, christened the GuptaLeaks, that wound up in the media last summer, includes a Bell Pottinger presentation titled \u201cGupta Family online landscape briefing document.\u201d It tracks mentions of the Guptas and a list of hashtags and keywords, some pro-Gupta, some anti-Gupta.\u201cSentiment is more positive in conversations online compared to yesterday,\u201d the report states.Likewise, there is scant evidence that Bell Pottinger promoted \u201cwhite monopoly capital,\u201d the phrase that helped doom it. A law firm report commissioned by the company later concluded that employees of the firm had used the phrase \u201con occasion.\u201d That is more often than is defensible, though it hardly explains the term\u2019s sudden vogue.The 21-page document had credibility, however, because it contained details that only insiders could have known, some of which were utterly gratuitous. Like the cost to rent the Italian villa for the wedding of Victoria Geoghegan, the Bell Pottinger executive who led the South African team.A few days after the report went public, an anti-Zuma demonstration in South Africa included anti-Bell Pottinger placards. One showed a photograph of Ms. Geoghegan with blood dripping from her lips and the words \u201cGupta\u2019s Girl\u201d over her head. A demonstration in front of Bell Pottinger\u2019s London office soon followed.In April, Bell Pottinger canceled its deal with the Guptas, citing \u201cincreasingly strong social media attacks on our staff and our business.\u201d It didn\u2019t help.Nor did Mr. Henderson\u2019s \u201cunequivocal and absolute apology\u201d in July, or his resignation in September the day before Britain\u2019s P.R. trade group tossed out Bell Pottinger. The company suffered \u00a38 million worth of client losses in 48 hours and layoffs began soon after.Other companies linked, both directly and indirectly, with the Guptas are just beginning to deal with fallout of their own. The South African Companies and Intellectual Property Commission is pursuing criminal complaints that emerged from an investigation into state contracts and the Gupta-Zuma nexus, which have ensnared KPMG, SAP and McKinsey.A spokeswoman for KPMG said in a statement that apologies have been made \u201cto those affected,\u201d adding that nine senior partners at the company had departed. SAP issued a statement in October apologizing \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d and noting that three staff members had been placed on leave. McKinsey has denied involvement in acts of bribery or corruption and issued a statement saying, \u201cWe are sorry for the distress this matter has caused the people of South Africa.\u201dFor its part, Bell Pottinger never shook allegations that it ran that vitriolic social media campaign, nor that it was responsible for injecting \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d into the national dialogue.Clearly, Bell Pottinger was not an innocent bystander, and for a crisis management firm, it did a terrible job of managing this crisis. At least a dozen chances were missed to avert calamity.\u201cAs chief executive at the time, I take culpability for not closing down the account in the early stages,\u201d Mr. Henderson said in an interview. \u201cWhilst I was not involved at any time in any way in the account, I should have taken action earlier.\u201dIts errors notwithstanding, the company ended up being blamed for an even greater number of misdeeds than it actually committed, and it is worth asking how that happened.Former employees contend that they were the target of \u2014 what else? \u2014 a furtive P.R. campaign.Inside Bell Pottinger, it was widely believed that Mr. Bell wanted to damage the company just enough to weaken Mr. Henderson and compel a change of leadership.\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, who stated that he had nothing to do with the 21-page report. At the same time, he readily acknowledges that he started plans to take control of Bell Pottinger as soon as he left it. He hoped to line up investors and buy up enough shares to force out Mr. Henderson. He said he abandoned the plan after deciding that the firm was beyond saving.The Gupta-Bell Pottinger campaign backfired on just about everyone, especially the Guptas. In an August statement, the brothers said they intended to sell all of their South African holdings by the end of 2017.Mr. Zuma could soon be removed by his party over issues of corruption and the stagnant economy. His term was supposed to end in 2019, but Cyril Ramaphosa, the man who became head of the A.N.C. in December, has called for Mr. Zuma to step down. A judicial inquiry was recently announced to investigate \u201cstate capture\u201d and the president\u2019s relationship to the Guptas.A spokesman for the Guptas did not return emails. President Zuma has repeatedly denied all accusations of corruption.Mr. Henderson lost everything when the firm failed, starting with his reputation. He became known as the guy in charge of a public relations company that perished in a public relations fiasco.The British media reported that he lost his entire life\u2019s savings when Bell Pottinger evaporated and for a time, he also seemed to have lost his fianc\u00e9e. The American socialite Heather Kerzner had invested a sizable chunk of her personal wealth in Bell Pottinger four months before it went under. The wedding was originally scheduled for November. Mr. Henderson said the couple hoped to marry.\u201cThat\u2019s our intention,\u201d he said.But arguably the greatest casualty of the Gupta-Bell Pottinger campaign is the very cause it nominally championed, helping impoverished blacks. Like most propaganda, the ideas promoted by the Guptas contained kernels of truth. The economic advancement of blacks postapartheid has indeed been painfully slow.The topic is now exponentially more fraught, given its association with the Guptas, who tried to use it as a way to enrich themselves and expand their power. For a young democracy that is grappling with a history of institutionalized racism and trying to spread wealth more evenly throughout the country, the results have been tragic.\u201cThe damage done by this campaign is not over,\u201d said Sipho Pityana, a businessman who headed the Department of Labour under the Mandela administration. \u201cIt shapes the discourse about inequality in South Africa to this day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In South Africa, One Question Dominates: How Much Longer Should Zuma Stay?", "Date": "2018-02-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 It is, in South Africa\u2019s political parlance, the season of the two centers of power.And now the single question driving the politics of South Africa has become one of timing. When will Mr. Zuma cease to be South Africa\u2019s president?As that question hangs in the air, the people around the two men have to decide which one to back, how strongly and when. It is as if an older sun has lost its gravitational pull to a newer one \u2014 and the orbiting planets, in some confusion, have been realigning themselves.Under South Africa\u2019s Constitution, the Parliament elects the president. That leaves the A.N.C., which dominates the legislative body, with two options if it wants to recall Mr. Zuma before the end of his term in 2019: Order him to step down and avoid bringing the matter to Parliament; or allow the anti-Zuma camp to join forces with opposition lawmakers to impeach him.Among Mr. Zuma\u2019s supporters, the reaction has been more complicated. A few high-profile former allies of the president, including the finance and police ministers, have leapt into Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s camp with head-spinning speed.Others have dug in, clearly hoping to extend Mr. Zuma\u2019s presidency \u2014 and their own power \u2014 as long as they can.\u201cWe should never do it in a way that is going to humiliate President Zuma,\u201d said Mr. Ramaphosa, who has been the nation\u2019s deputy president since 2014.Even as negotiations over Mr. Zuma\u2019s departure continue, power has begun to shift in real ways. Mr. Ramaphosa led the nation\u2019s delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, effectively acting as South Africa\u2019s leader on the world stage.More significantly, there have been domestic developments that would have been highly unlikely before Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s election as party leader in December.At some state enterprises, which have been the source of much public corruption in recent years, Mr. Zuma\u2019s allies have been quickly replaced by respected officials chosen by Mr. Ramaphosa. State prosecutors have begun investigating some senior political allies of the president, along with the Guptas, a powerful family with close business ties with Mr. Zuma\u2019s relatives and his inner circle.Mr. Zuma\u2019s fate now lies with the A.N.C.\u2019s top leadership, which remains divided, with an edge in Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s favor, political analysts said.He spoke at a rally in Mr. Zuma\u2019s home province, KwaZulu-Natal, where loyalists voiced strong support. The province, which is the A.N.C.\u2019s biggest source of votes nationally, remains one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s strongest cards in his negotiations with Mr. Ramaphosa \u2014 as does the party\u2019s youth league, which held the rally.Mandla Shange, the youth league\u2019s spokesman in KwaZulu-Natal, dismissed any talk of removing Mr. Zuma.\u201cThat\u2019s not a decision you just take,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere must be a transition plan between President Zuma and President Ramaphosa. That is why President Zuma\u2019s term of office ends in 2019, so we expect President Zuma to continue to be president until 2019.\u201dBut analysts say that because of the survival instinct of the A.N.C., which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, it is unlikely that Mr. Zuma will be allowed to serve out his full term. The longer Mr. Zuma stays in power, the harder it will be for Mr. Ramaphosa to rebuild the party\u2019s brand before next year\u2019s elections.How and when Mr. Zuma leaves office, experts say, will influence how much Mr. Ramaphosa can reinvent the A.N.C. before next year\u2019s elections.\u201cThe A.N.C.\u2019s continued, foolhardy inability to remove President Zuma clearly indicates that the A.N.C. cannot be trusted and cannot be relied upon to bring about the changes promised by its newly elected leadership,\u201d Bantu Holomisa, leader of the opposition United Democratic Movement, said in a news conference.He was disappointed that the A.N.C.\u2019s top leaders had not tried to remove Mr. Zuma at their first meeting in January. But he was impressed by prosecutors moving against some of Mr. Zuma\u2019s political and business allies, and the thought of returning to the A.N.C. was no longer inconceivable to him.\u201cOnce Ramaphosa gets rid of Zuma and all those corrupt guys are taken to task, perhaps then I can have another way of thinking \u2014 but only then,\u201d Mr. Zitha said. \u201cZuma must be toothless. But right now he still has teeth. He can chew whatever he wants to chew.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It sits defenseless, all but surrounded by encroaching basins of water. Just two miles north is the jagged tip of a fortresslike levee, a primary line of defense for greater New Orleans, whose skyline looms in the distance. Everything south of that 14-foot wall of demarcation, including the gritty little town of Jean Lafitte, has effectively been left to the tides.This three-part special report about the ecological crisis facing Louisiana\u2019s vanishing coast, and the people who live there, is the\n        product of a partnership between The New York Times\n        and NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune of New Orleans.Jean Lafitte may be just a pinprick on the map, but it is also a harbinger of an uncertain future. As climate change contributes to rising sea levels, threatening to submerge land from Miami to Bangladesh, the question for Lafitte, as for many coastal areas across the globe, is less whether it will succumb than when \u2014 and to what degree scarce public resources should be invested in artificially extending its life.One sweltering evening last July, almost everyone from around Lafitte gathered near dusk at the bayou\u2019s edge to celebrate the expenditure of nearly $4 million of those scarce public resources. There were shrimpers and crabbers, tug captains and roughnecks, teachers and cops. All had come for the ribbon cutting for a grand new seafood pavilion, the latest gambit by the longtime mayor, Timothy P. Kerner, to save the town from drowning.Free beer sloshed in plastic cups as folks ambled about the cavernous, open-sided shed, sampling shrimp r\u00e9moulade and alligator-stuffed mushrooms. Once the politicians had finished flattering one another from the podium, a Cajun band, fronted by a fiddler in a shimmery blue dress, cranked up a rollicking fais-dodo.Amid the celebration, a fireplug of a man in crisp jeans and a starched white shirt cheek-kissed and bro-hugged his way through the crowd. This was Timmy Kerner\u2019s party. In his third decade as mayor, Mr. Kerner had managed to persuade the parish, state and federal governments to pay for his signature showcase at the entry to town.It might seem counterintuitive to keep building on land that is submerging. But Mr. Kerner did not see it as his job to take a 10,000-foot view. In the years since Hurricane Katrina, he had grown weary of being rebuffed in his quixotic campaign to encircle Lafitte with a tall and impregnable levee. He could rhapsodize all he wanted about preserving his community\u2019s authentic way of life. The cost-benefit calculus \u2014 more than $1 billion to protect fewer than 7,000 people \u2014 always weighed against him.So he had set out to change it. His strategy was to secure so much public investment for Jean Lafitte that it would eventually become too valuable to abandon. In a decade, he had built a 1,300-seat auditorium, a library, a wetlands museum, a civic center and a baseball park. Jean Lafitte did not have a stop light, but it had a senior center, a medical clinic, an art gallery, a boxing club, a nature trail and a visitor center where animatronic puppets acted out the story of its privateer namesake.Some of the facilities had been used sparingly, and many at the grand opening questioned whether the seafood pavilion would be much different. To the mayor that was largely beside the point. What mattered was that the structure existed, that its poured concrete and steel beams made Lafitte that much more permanent.\u201cDo we lose that investment, or do we protect it?\u201d Mr. Kerner asked, barely audible above the din. \u201cI hope people will see that, hey, not only are we fighting hard to exist, but, you know, maybe this place is worth saving.\u201dThe sky began to dim over the bayou. \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful place, and it\u2019s getting prettier by the day,\u201d he said, ticking off his improvement projects. \u201cThis is just another step at building the community. It sends a message that we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201cNo matter what, we\u2019re not leaving.\u201dLouisiana\u2019s \u201cworking coast\u201d is dotted with communities that, like Lafitte, may not outlast the people who currently live there: Cocodrie, Delacroix, Dulac, Grand Isle, Isle de Jean Charles, Kraemer, Leeville, Paradis, Pointe-aux-Chenes, Venice.Since prospectors first discovered oil in Louisiana 117 years ago, 57,465 wells have been drilled in 10 coastal parishes, according to the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources. Thousands of miles of canals have been dredged through marshes for access. They broaden each year from erosion caused by boat traffic and storm currents, even as their spoil banks block natural water flow. A 50,000-mile thicket of pipelines connects rigs to refineries and tank farms across the state.After years of laissez-faire regulation, some consequential finger-pointing has begun in the courts, where parish governments and private landowners are for the first time suing energy companies to rebuild their land. To date that burden has fallen mostly on taxpayers, even when the property being repaired is owned by oil and gas interests, an examination of state records shows.The impact extends far beyond Louisiana\u2019s shoreline.Last year, Louisiana officials acknowledged for the first time that even with a vast restoration program, even with tens of billions of dollars they do not have, they no longer believed they could build land fast enough to offset the losses. Plotted on a map, their projections show 40-mile swaths, encompassing Jean Lafitte and everything below it, splashed in red to denote that, without action, they will disappear within decades. The crisis has become existential, with policymakers confronting choices about which communities they can afford to rescue.Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, insists that his state is \u201cnot in full retreat mode,\u201d that \u201cthe science shows there is a window of opportunity\u201d to sustain portions of the coast. But in a state not known for fiscal oversight, concerns linger about whether good money will be thrown after bad.\u201cPeople argue that if you make the investments appropriately it will be fine, and it could be,\u201d said Mitch Landrieu, the outgoing mayor of New Orleans. \u201cBut nobody really ever has the appetite to have a conversation about cutting off your arms so you can still walk.\u201dThe sputter and thrum of boat motors announces the morning along Bayou Barataria well before sunup. Burly men in rubber boots load ice and bait into trawlers moored behind their houses and prepare to push off in the dark.On a clear day out on the Pen, a four-mile lake that was farmland a century ago, the silhouettes of New Orleans office towers and the Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery are visible to the north and east. Lines of crab traps stretch across the flat water, buoyed with floats painted in their owners\u2019 signature colors, like jockeys\u2019 silks. Alligator snouts skim the surface of nearby canals, and a boat\u2019s approach sends a blue heron flapping into labored flight.The people of Lafitte have lived off the water for generations \u2014 trapping and skinning muskrats and other marsh dwellers, fishing, crabbing, oystering, building and repairing boats, ferrying workers and supplies to offshore rigs. Many accept the irony that the water may eventually destroy the economy it built.Jean Lafitte is laid out for six linear miles along a two-lane road that curves around the east bank of the bayou. Newer houses on land subdivided from a 19th-century sugar cane plantation were built atop six-foot mounds to keep the water at bay. Many older structures have been elevated hydraulically and placed on pillars 10 feet or higher, a process that can cost nearly as much as the house is worth. While government programs pick up some of the expense, there is not enough funding, and some homeowners cannot afford their share, which often exceeds $100,000.Yet many cannot imagine living anywhere else. They complain that the bloodless cost-benefit formulas determining which communities get protection give little weight to the qualities that make Lafitte desirable (the name Lafitte is used to refer to the town and its adjacent unincorporated areas). Children, they point out, still spend barefoot summers tubing and fishing and training bird dogs to leap off docks. And when they graduate from high school, three-fourths will have been together since prekindergarten.The policymakers \u201cdon\u2019t place value on anything but the money, not the longevity of these communities, not the culture,\u201d said Tracy Kuhns, 64, a longtime resident of the Barataria community across the bayou from Jean Lafitte. \u201cOne of the problems in this country is that people don\u2019t have any connection to where they live. People really want that. Why would you take it away from people who already have it?\u201dMs. Kuhns, the president of Louisiana Bayoukeeper, an advocacy group for water quality and clean fisheries, pointed out that she did not lock her door (which flies open all day as her 17 grandchildren come and go). There have been but two murders in Jean Lafitte in the past 20 years, compared with 3,829 in New Orleans.At the center of town sits St. Anthony Catholic Church, which sponsors the Blessing of the Fleet Festival when brown shrimp season opens each spring. The first catch fills the freezers of cousins and neighbors before anything left is sold to Nunez Seafood and other dockside wholesalers.After a long day on the water, some may wet their whistle with $2.75 Budweisers at Mitch Martin\u2019s Welcome Inn, where a swamp-pop band plays on Wednesday nights and gray-haired ladies line dance.The tavern is run by Timothy and Thomas Wiseman, brothers better known as White Boy and Zabo. Almost everybody in Lafitte has a nickname, some more self-explanatory than others: Skinny Boy, Sandbags, Lunch Meat, Pink Cow. When Tom Wiseman, 52, was a child, someone decided he looked like another guy nicknamed Zabo. \u201cForty years it has followed me now,\u201d he said.The Wisemans find that the absence of levee protection reinforces the sense of Lafitte as a place apart, for better and worse. \u201cWe\u2019re outside the line, and they don\u2019t care about us,\u201d Tim Wiseman, 54, said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been like that.\u201d\u201cNow we just expect water and damage every five years,\u201d his brother said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life.\u201d\u201cAnd you know what? It still does not make us want to leave,\u201d Tim said. \u201cAre we economically feasible? Hell no. But this place will survive. If we end up living on rafts, there will be people living here.\u201dAlthough only two feet above sea level, Lafitte rarely experienced significant damage from hurricanes until 2005. That year, Katrina\u2019s 120-mile-per-hour winds stripped roofs off houses; a month later, Rita sent enough water coursing through lower Jefferson Parish to dislodge whitewashed tombs from graveyards. Homeowners in Lafitte found skulls and an artificial hip among the debris. Together, the storms forced the demolition of more than 150 houses.\u201cThe first time, I sat on the sofa and just watched it come in,\u201d remembered Chris Dufrene, 73, whose house flooded three times before he had it elevated eight feet three years ago. \u201cWorst feeling I\u2019ve ever had. Nothing you can do about it.\u201dShrimpers and guides had been noticing astonishing changes out on the water for years. Shambles of fishing cabins sat stranded on pilings, more distant from shore each season. Duck blinds had dissolved into muck. Land bridges no longer bridged.\u201cI\u2019ve been out here since 1981, and the beaches are eroding, the salt water\u2019s intruding and all the islands in Barataria estuary that were protecting the land are washing away,\u201d said Troy Schultz, 54, who trawls and crabs with his son, Troy Jr., 28. \u201cBig Island is gone. Cat Island is gone. St. Mary\u2019s Island is gone. They were miles long. Now it\u2019s so open that every time you get squalls and storms it pulls up the marsh grass.\u201dThese days, the main road through Jean Lafitte floods almost any time a gusty storm blows in from the south. A mere sideswipe from Tropical Storm Cindy last June pushed several feet of water into streets and yards. The merciless hurricane season of 2017, with Harvey followed by Irma, Maria and Nate, made clear that the town\u2019s days may be numbered.After Katrina left 1,833 dead in 2005, local, state and federal governments spent more than $20 billion to redesign failed and inadequate levees and pumps for metropolitan New Orleans. Even those improvements may not be sufficient to spare the area\u2019s more than 1.3 million residents from another monster storm.But in Lafitte, only 25 miles south, the hurricane defense system consists mainly of Mr. Kerner and whichever men he can employ to sling tens of thousands of 25-pound sandbags, often for days on end.The mayor feels the threat viscerally, like many with deep roots here. His family settled in Lafitte in the early 1800s. He married a local girl at 18 (Darla Kerner was 16), and worked as a commercial fisherman, barkeep and tax collector before assuming his place as heir to one of the country\u2019s most enduring political dynasties.Mr. Kerner has been mayor for 26 of his 58 years. With a gap of only eight years in the 1950s, a Kerner has held Lafitte\u2019s top office since 1888, when his great-grandfather became justice of the peace. His father, Leo E. Kerner Jr., spearheaded the effort to incorporate Jean Lafitte in 1974 and became its first mayor, serving 17 years.Leo Kerner had been a welterweight champ in the Navy, and taught his boys how to spar, in politics as in the ring. The current mayor is known in Jefferson Parish, Baton Rouge and Washington as a single-minded scrapper who fights best from a defensive crouch. He can be quick to lose his temper when he feels Lafitte is being disrespected, but is also fast to apologize and hug it out.Paradoxically, perhaps, some of the funding \u2014 including about a third of the cost of the seafood pavilion \u2014 has come from federal recovery grants that flow south each time the town is bludgeoned by a storm.As the water creeps closer, Mr. Kerner has increased the value of Jean Lafitte\u2019s physical plant sevenfold in a decade. And yet, on his central mission to ensure his town\u2019s future, he considers himself a failure.\u201cWhen I ran for this office,\u201d Mr. Kerner said, \u201cI ran to provide a levee. That was my dream. I guess I haven\u2019t done a very good job so far, because we don\u2019t have one.\u201dIf Lafitte has a chip on its shoulder, it is not without cause.That left Mr. Kerner to devise his own plan, and find a way to pay for it. His concept was to phase in the construction of a chain of 10 linked ring levees, 65 miles in all, that would enclose each populated sector of Lafitte. Cost dictated that the walls of dirt, steel and concrete would be seven-and-a-half feet high at the outset, enough for protection from modest storms but not from a major hurricane. A levee of at least twice that height is typically needed to meet the standard of \u201c100-year protection,\u201d meaning it should withstand flooding from a hurricane with a 1 percent chance of occurring in a given year.For a while, the corps encouraged the mayor to pursue small federal grants to build segments of the system. In 2003, with about $10 million, construction began on the first link, which will eventually contain the town\u2019s schools and municipal buildings.Then came Katrina, producing storm surge that overwhelmed portions of the New Orleans-area levee and flood wall system. In addressing the damage, Congress raised standards for the height and strength of the levees that the Corps of Engineers would build, effectively disqualifying the Lafitte project.Mr. Kerner also found little support locally, where the regional levee authority with jurisdiction over Lafitte was focused on protecting areas closer to New Orleans. In 2007, David J. Bindewald Sr., then the president of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority \u2014 West, told Mr. Kerner explicitly that there would be no money for his levees.Instead, he sent Mr. Kerner a letter offering \u201cseveral thousand un-filled sand bags and sand sufficient to fill the bags\u201d along with \u201ca quantity of shovels.\u201dThe furious mayor figured he could do better than that on his own, and persuaded allies in the Legislature to create the Lafitte Area Independent Levee District. Funded by a small property tax, the levee authority pays Mr. Kerner $12,000 a year as its president, on top of his mayoral base salary of $79,538, according to legislative audits.Mr. Kerner\u2019s power play did not instantly change the essential dynamic. In 2009, after Hurricane Gustav, the corps began studying options for a new levee that would span a stretch of the lower coastal zone. Only one of several routes under consideration would have protected Lafitte. But at a levee board meeting in 2011, corps officials announced their determination that none of the proposed alignments could be justified economically.\u201cWhat do you suggest we do?\u201d an exasperated Mr. Kerner asked Mark Wingate, the corps engineer managing the project.Mr. Wingate said he suggested studying nonstructural options, including relocation.\u201cYou\u2019re reading my mind,\u201d Mr. Kerner responded, \u201cbecause when I saw that map the first thing I thought was that I wanted to relocate your jawbone.\u201d He nodded at Mr. Wingate\u2019s two associates. \u201cAnd your jawbone and your jawbone.\u201dIn the parking lot after the meeting, the corps officials stiffened when they saw the pugilistic mayor striding purposefully toward them. But he was only coming to apologize.Bruised but not defeated, Mr. Kerner thought there might be another way.Over the past decade, the authority has grabbed money from a bag of sources to undertake 135 projects at a cost to the state of more than $2.4 billion (with another $2 billion budgeted for the next three years). Sixty-five square miles of land have been built or improved, along with 297 miles of levee and 60 miles of barrier islands and berms, according to the authority.The coast these days is awash in ambitious engineering projects. Near Jean Lafitte, for instance, more than 1,000 acres of marsh have been created in and around Bayou Dupont in an $82 million state-managed project that pumped sand from the Mississippi up to 13 miles away. Where open water stood in 2009, there is now walkable land, thick with saplings and shrubs.That made the worst-case scenario in the 2012 master plan the best case for 2017 and led to a startling reversal: Louisiana could slow the submergence of the coast, but not arrest it. Even if the plan was somehow fully funded, and the state succeeded in adding or maintaining 800 square miles of wetlands over 50 years, there would still be a net loss of at least 400 square miles and possibly as many as 3,300.That recalibration necessarily shifted the state\u2019s approach. \u201cOnce you accept the diagnosis that much of south Louisiana is going to disappear, you still have to have a strategic retreat,\u201d said David Muth, director of the National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Gulf Restoration Program. \u201cHow do you plan this shrinking of the footprint, which is complicated by socioeconomics and by real questions about how fast sea level will rise and how fast you can build wetlands?\u201dTorbj\u00f6rn E. T\u00f6rnqvist, a Tulane geologist who is an authority on subsidence, warned that decisions about places like Lafitte would be \u201ca piece of cake compared to what\u2019s coming \u2014 because a little down the line we\u2019re going to be talking about communities not of 2,000 people but of much bigger things.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s the matter of where to find the master plan\u2019s aspirational $50 billion \u2014 twice the entire state budget.The state and its coastal parishes have been counting on about $176 million a year from federal offshore oil leases under a revenue-sharing law passed in 2006. But steep declines in prices and drilling have lowered those projections.All told, even under the rosiest circumstances, the $50 billion master plan, which many experts consider inadequate, lacks at least $30 billion in revenue.\u201cAll of us believe our citizens deserve more than probably we can deliver,\u201d said Bren Haase, the authority\u2019s chief of planning and research.For its 2017 revision, the authority split its theoretical budget between hopeful restoration efforts, like rebuilding marshes and barrier islands, and defensive risk-reduction projects like raising levees and elevating houses. It re-evaluated proposals with a refined formula that weighed each project\u2019s cost against the flood damage it would avert.The price tag for the Lafitte ring levees had risen to $1.2 billion, equating to more than $170,000 per resident. Despite Mr. Kerner\u2019s efforts to rebalance the cost-benefit calculus, the annual savings amounted to less than a tenth of that, placing it near the bottom on the state\u2019s list. When the authority published its draft in January last year, the mayor found that his ring levees, his lifeline for Lafitte, had been discarded.The mayor and his constituents felt betrayed once again. \u201cIt just makes all your fears justified,\u201d said Ray Griffin, the manager of Cochiara\u2019s Marina. \u201cWhen they make a decision like that they just basically slap you in the face and say bye.\u201dIn an ecosystem as multifaceted as the Louisiana coast, the protection of one habitat may pose a mortal threat to another, or at least be perceived that way. Flood control is a zero-sum game. The water has to go somewhere.So there is natural suspicion in Lafitte about the most audacious engineering proposal in the state master plan, the $1.4 billion Mid-Barataria sediment diversion. The experimental project, which is under design, would carve a gap in the levee on the Mississippi\u2019s west bank just southeast of Lafitte. When the river is high, floodgates could be opened to redirect sediment-rich water into adjoining marshland at up to 75,000 cubic feet per second.This occasional freeing of the river may build land more gradually than the continual pumping of dredged sand. But environmental groups argue that it will do so in a self-sustaining way at comparatively low cost. The state estimates that the diversion will deposit enough sediment over 50 years to fill the Superdome more than 22 times.\u201cWe know we need benefits now,\u201d Mr. Haase said, \u201cbut if we\u2019re not doing anything to fundamentally change the causes of our land loss, then we\u2019re perhaps not investing our dollars wisely.\u201dIn Lafitte\u2019s fishing community, there is deep concern, with some scientific backing, that flushing fresh water into brackish marshes and bays will imbalance the salinity needed to nurture shrimp, oysters and crab. Scientists argue that salinity will change with or without the diversion, but seafood industry groups have threatened to sue if it is built.\u201cIt will completely kill these fishing communities,\u201d said Clinton Guidry, a Lafitte resident who once presided over the Louisiana Shrimp Association. \u201cIs that the trade-off you want? If you lose shrimp fishermen for one generation, they\u2019re gone forever.\u201dFor Tim Kerner, the Mid-Barataria diversion provided a bargaining chip. After his 100-year levees were axed from the master plan, he continued to push for funds to complete the ring system at lower height. The state owed Jean Lafitte, he argued, because the diversion would make the town even more vulnerable.Things came to a head in January last year when Mr. Kerner made his case, loudly, at a meeting with state officials. Seated nearby was his great benefactor in Baton Rouge, State Senate President John A. Alario Jr., a soft-spoken power broker whose district includes Lafitte.\u201cYou know,\u201d Mr. Kerner told Johnny Bradberry, the chairman of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, \u201cif I was a senator or a state rep from my area sitting at this table, I would be very upset. You have projects all along the coast, and this area, where the Senate president is from, you have nothing but a sediment diversion that nobody really wants.\u201dHe reminded the officials of all of the money the state had been spending in Lafitte \u2014 the bridges, the civic center, the seafood pavilion. \u201cIt\u2019s so inconsistent for C.P.R.A. to say we\u2019re not worth saving when other government agencies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s throwing away the investment of tax dollars you already put in this place.\u201dWhen the final master plan was presented to the Legislature in June, language had been inserted that the state and the Lafitte levee authority would be \u201cfocused on securing nearly $308 million\u201d for the lower tidal protection levees and flood walls. The plan also called for spending $200 million in Lafitte over 30 years to elevate 1,237 houses, flood-proof nine businesses and buy out two property owners. (Coastwide, the master plan calls for spending a theoretical $6 billion over 50 years to elevate, improve or buy out 26,200 properties.)The question now is how quickly money will materialize. Mr. Kerner believes the levees can be completed for considerably less than the $308 million estimate. Regardless, the state has budgeted only $35.5 million for them over the next four years.\u201cThose 2,000 folks down there would like very much for us to be committed to a $1 billion ring levee,\u201d said Mr. Edwards, the governor. \u201cWell, we just can\u2019t do that. But we haven\u2019t given up on them either.\u201dProspects seem dim for a federal bailout to shore up Lafitte and the rest of Louisiana\u2019s coast. Preserving the state\u2019s wetlands is a tough political sell because many Americans do not appreciate the magnitude of their self-interest there. Increasingly, Louisiana faces competition from more populous coastal zones that also are at grave risk, like South Florida, metropolitan New York and the Texas Gulf.The only other pockets deep enough to fill the financial gap belong to oil and gas. Even in a time of retrenchment, the energy industry remains among Louisiana\u2019s most vital employers, revenue generators and civic and political donors. But with drilling in decline and the BP oil spill a fresh memory, Louisianans seem newly receptive to holding the industry accountable for the consequences of its activities.In a recent poll of 565 Louisianans by NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune, 72 percent said the oil and gas industry should help pay for coastal restoration along with the government. (Mr. Kerner happens to agree.) Another 18 percent said the industry should bear the cost alone. Only half said they were willing to pay higher taxes to redeem the coast.In 2013, with the political landscape shifting, the levee authority charged with flood control in New Orleans sued 97 oil and gas companies, presenting a novel claim.There is considerable documentation of advance knowledge. Scientists and conservationists have sounded alarms since the 1920s about the loss of land to oil exploration. Documents uncovered through discovery show that the industry\u2019s own studies began making the connection nearly 50 years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s that old saying \u2014 you don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, also a Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t say they have no effect, the canals, but I think it\u2019s a money grab against an industry that has been very good to Louisiana.\u201dIn 2016, when the governor\u2019s office changed parties, Mr. Edwards reversed Mr. Jindal\u2019s stance and intervened in support of the parish cases. \u201cOil and gas is a huge component of our economy, and we want them to be successful,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cBut we also want them to act responsibly when they explore for and produce hydrocarbons.\u201dOil and gas industry leaders acknowledge that their potential exposure is substantial. They warn they will not roll over to trial lawyers who they believe are extorting them for a global settlement.\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight every single last issue because we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve done anything wrong,\u201d said Gifford Briggs, vice president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, which represents independent producers and service companies.Chris John, a former Democratic congressman who presides over the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, said the lawsuits failed to recognize numerous other causes of coastal degradation and would not be settled. He said that \u201cthe energy industry has conducted its operations in accordance with government-issued permits and applicable federal, state and local regulations.\u201dMr. Briggs echoed that defense. \u201cYes, if you dig a canal or build a slip, is there technically a loss of marsh or land? Sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s done through permit. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s any additional liability or responsibility beyond fulfilling the obligations of the permit.\u201dJean Lafitte has not yet reached the tipping point when bankers and insurers perceive that the lifetime of their loans and obligations could exceed the lifetime of the town. Indeed, real estate values are relatively high, if only because there is so little to be had.But there are early signs of an exodus, particularly among younger residents. The population of the area declined by 21 percent between 2000 and 2010, although estimates suggest it has rebounded slightly this decade. Enrollment at the two public schools dropped 27 percent from the peak before Katrina and Rita, but has risen by 10 percent since.Mr. Kerner believes the declines reflect temporary dislocations. But some, like Buttercup Mancuso, have left for good. She, her husband and three of their children evacuated their rental house in lower Lafitte before it flooded during Hurricane Isaac in 2012. They returned to find mold sprouting two feet up the walls.The family abandoned their belongings except for their photographs. \u201cLosing everything once was enough for me,\u201d Ms. Mancuso, 43, said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t do it again.\u201d They moved to the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, and eventually to North Carolina.Travis Johnson, 70, a retired Army and commercial helicopter pilot who moved to Barataria in 2000, said that at his age he would gladly take a government buyout for his waterfront house.\u201cI drove out of here during Hurricane Rita with water flowing over the hood of my Jeep,\u201d he said. \u201cShould one delay evacuation, it is not possible to escape. I don\u2019t want a lot of complications.\u201dBut Lafitte\u2019s lifers, for the most part, seem resigned to wait things out. The centuries spent fishing and trapping have built a resilient and self-reliant culture. More than 250 years since the Acadians were expelled from Nova Scotia, there remains a deep resistance to another forced exile.\u201cPeople that don\u2019t understand it say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just move away?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Kuhns, the Louisiana Bayoukeeper president, who refuses to join her daughter, Ms. Mancuso, on the other side of the levee. \u201cThe people who are connected to these communities don\u2019t think that way. It\u2019s a whole culture that\u2019s connected to the earth and the water. You can\u2019t replicate it.\u201dAnd so the men sandbag. Last hurricane season, they stacked them by the thousands in anticipation of Tropical Storm Cindy, then unstacked them when the floodwater receded. They did it again for Hurricane Harvey and once more for Nate.The mayor supervises up and down the road from his white Ford Expedition, crossing himself as he passes the Catholic church. He pitches in long enough to let his back start aching, then carps that it\u2019s because the young guys today don\u2019t know how to properly swing and catch.He remembers each storm as a fight, tallying them as wins and losses. In the old days, they would stack 200,000 sandbags. \u201cIt was like being in a war zone,\u201d Mr. Kerner said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t go to bed for two or three days at a time.\u201dWith sections of two of the ring levees complete, the men got by with only 20,000 sandbags when Nate narrowly missed Lafitte last October. \u201cEach time you just have to be ready and fight it as if it\u2019s going to be the worst thing that ever happened,\u201d Mr. Kerner said. \u201cAnd then you may have to do it again a week later.\u201dThe mayor has developed a sixth sense for the telltale signs of whether Lafitte will flood. As Cindy moved in last June, he watched the tide rising near the Goose Bayou bridge: \u201cThat water won\u2019t quit,\u201d he cursed. \u201cLook at the whitecaps. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t want to see.\u201d Soon the water was lapping at his tailpipe.Four months later, on the night Nate landed near Biloxi, Miss., he divined better news from the bayou\u2019s outward flow, indicating that the leading edge had curled in harmlessly from the north. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dAs he drove home, eyelids drooping, Mr. Kerner could not help feeling annoyed that the town had expended so much effort for no reason. Then he remembered that no one had been hurt, no one had been washed out of his or her home or stranded in distress. \u201cSuch a relief,\u201d he thought.He eased into bed, bone-weary and sore, like an aging boxer, and lost himself in reveries of shiny new buildings and 16-foot levees \u2014 whatever might spare Jean Lafitte from the water, for now.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the federal grant to relocate residents of Isle de Jean Charles.

{"Headline": "Enough. Give Russia Its Flag Back, Then Make Real Changes.", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesPYEONGCHANG, South Korea \u2014 Now that the Pyeongchang Olympics are almost over, the International Olympic Committee has to decide whether Russia has done enough penance for its state-sponsored doping program to march with its flag in the closing ceremony on Sunday.It is not an abstract question. The Russians were here, after all: The country had nearly 170 athletes competing as neutrals under the opposite-of-neutral label of Olympic athletes from Russia. But the hand-wringing about the flag has grown tiresome.Will the Russia team remain in exile or not? Could a partial ban solve the problem, in which the Russians would be allowed to wear official team uniforms bearing the flag, yet still be barred from carrying the flag? Could they carry the flag, but wear neutral uniforms?What\u2019s next? Official Russian uniform jackets, but neutral pants? Neutral jackets, but Russian-flag-themed pants? A Russian flag, but one only half the regular size?Enough of this farce. Just give the Russians their flag back. And then let\u2019s start talking about the real issue:The International Olympic Committee\u2019s plan for showing the Russians who\u2019s the boss has \u2014 most likely on purpose \u2014 lacked teeth from the start.The I.O.C. will have to demand that all national Olympic committees and sports federations pitch in, but it needs to reach deeper into its own pockets, too. NBC Universal has committed nearly $8 billion for the media rights for the Games from 2021 through 2032. That\u2019s a lot of money for the I.O.C. to throw around, and right now seems like the right time to throw a lot more of it at antidoping.Ahead of these Winter Games, the I.O.C. talked a big talk to clean up Olympic sports, yet allowed Russia to send one of the largest contingents to these Games, and then approved a \u201cneutral\u201d uniform with the word \u201cRussia\u201d on it.So what\u2019s the sense in letting the I.O.C. pretend to be a hard-liner on doping now that the Games are almost done by keeping the Russian flag out of the closing ceremony? The fact that it\u2019s even considering reinstatement, or the laughable partial reinstatement options, shows it still isn\u2019t serious about punishing nations that cheat to win.Russians won 13 medals through the first 13 days of the Games. None were gold, though that is likely to change when the women\u2019s figure skating is decided Friday morning here. But the Russians were awarded four silvers and nine bronzes, and that\u2019s still something.But you can\u2019t help but wonder, given Russia\u2019s history, if some of the athletes who finished behind them were robbed again. We know at least two Norwegians who\u2019ve already had their medal moment stolen.\u201cI think having a Russian that has tested positive is not a good thing,\u201d said Angela Ruggiero, the chairwoman of the I.O.C.\u2019s athletes\u2019 commission and a four-time Olympian in hockey. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want any athletes testing positive, but in this particular situation, where they\u2019re under a microscope, it does raise questions.\u201dSo after a positive drug test, why is the I.O.C. even debating whether Russia should march under its flag on Sunday? Sam Edney, a Canadian luger, said the Russian curler\u2019s doping positive should guarantee that the Russian flag never waves inside the stadium. He has reason to be annoyed.Edney was part of a team that finished fourth in Sochi, while a Russian team won silver. The Russian squad was later stripped of the medal for doping, meaning Edney and the Canadians would move up to bronze. But then the silver medal was reinstated just before these Games after the Russians won an appeal.The Russians celebrated in Sochi, and they will celebrate here, too. They have been waving their flag in the stands and painting \u201cRussia\u201d on their faces.Russian journalists showed up at figure skating this week wearing T-shirts that said, \u201cI Don\u2019t Do Doping,\u201d even as the evidence clearly showed that, actually, Russians did \u201cdo doping.\u201d Again.Maybe they should let the whole Russian team wear those shirts on Sunday. Let them march in their Russian uniforms behind a Russian flag held high.It would be a perfect symbol of how much the I.O.C. seems to value clean sport.Email: juliet@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Anthony Kennedy Retire? What Influences a Justice\u2019s Decision", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySidebarWASHINGTON \u2014 Supreme Court justices say they do not act politically when they decide cases. But they freely admit to taking account of politics in deciding when to retire. Most justices, for instance, try to step down under politically like-minded presidents.For the second year in a row, rumors that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy may retire from the Supreme Court are sweeping Washington. He is 81, and he is doubtless weighing many factors in deciding whether to stay. Among them, experts in judicial behavior said, are the tug of party loyalty, the preservation of his judicial legacy and how close his retirement would be to a presidential election.Justice Kennedy has long held the decisive vote in many of the Supreme Court\u2019s most contested and consequential cases, and his retirement would give President Trump the opportunity to move the court sharply to the right. If Justice Kennedy steps down, the confirmation fight over his successor will be titanic.Justices often try to retire when the president is of the same party as the one who appointed them. Justice Kennedy was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. President Trump may be an unconventional Republican, but he is a Republican.\u201cIf the incumbent president is of the same party as the president who nominated the justice to the court, and if the incumbent president is in the first two years of a four-year presidential term,\u201d the study found, \u201cthen the justice has odds of resignation that are about 2.6 times higher than when these two conditions are not met.\u201dJustices also take account of who controls the Senate and its internal rules.\u201cSo anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they\u2019re misguided,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s now or never,\u201d said Mr. Ward, a political scientist at Northern Illinois University. \u201cIt\u2019s either this year or you wait until the next election.\u201dParty loyalty is likely to overcome more subtle concerns about judicial legacy, Mr. Ward said. Justice Kennedy holds the crucial vote in many closely divided cases, and he has been drifting to the left. He has cast conservative votes in cases on campaign finance and gun rights but has lately voted with the court\u2019s liberal wing on gay rights, abortion and affirmative action.Ms. Chabot also explored justices\u2019 decisions to forgo opportunities to retire under like-minded presidents.Of the 16 justices since 1954 who reached the age 65 and had served on the court for at least 18 years, Ms. Chabot found, nine passed up politically opportune retirements, risking having to leave the court for health reasons in less attractive circumstances.Two of them \u2014 Justices White and John Paul Stevens \u2014 retired later on. Justice Elena Kagan replaced Justice Stevens, and her voting record resembles his.Another two, Justices Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, could have retired under President Obama but continue to serve.Staying on is understandable, Ms. Chabot wrote. \u201cRetirement from the court is very costly for a justice,\u201d she wrote, \u201cas he or she must permanently give up what is often an immensely personally rewarding position as well as the most powerful judicial office in the United States.\u201dTry as they might, Mr. Ward said, justices have had only mixed success in deciding when to step down.\u201cThey can\u2019t completely time their retirements perfectly because they\u2019re just like us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to get sick, and they don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to die, and they don\u2019t know who is going to win the next election.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated who replaced Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court. It was Justice Elena Kagan, not Justice Sonia Sotomayor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Links North Korea to Syria\u2019s Chemical Weapons Program", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 North Korea has been shipping supplies to the Syrian government that could be used in the production of chemical weapons, United Nations experts contend.The evidence of a North Korean connection comes as the United States and other countries have accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons on civilians, including recent attacks on civilians in the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta using what appears to have been chlorine gas.The supplies from North Korea include acid-resistant tiles, valves and thermometers, according to a report by United Nations investigators. North Korean missile technicians have also been spotted working at known chemical weapons and missile facilities inside Syria, according to the report, which was written by a panel of experts who looked at North Korea\u2019s compliance with United Nations sanctions.The report highlights the potential danger posed by any such trade between Syria and North Korea, which could allow Syria to maintain its chemical weapons while also providing North Korea with cash for its nuclear and missile programs.The possible chemical weapons components were part of at least 40 previously unreported shipments by North Korea to Syria between 2012 and 2017 of prohibited ballistic missile parts and materials that could be used for both military and civilian purposes, according to the report, which has not been publicly released but which was reviewed by The New York Times.Neither the report\u2019s authors nor members of the United Nations Security Council who have seen it would comment, and neither would the United States\u2019 mission to the international agency.It is unclear when, or even whether, the report will be released.\u201cI don\u2019t know about its publication date, if any,\u201d St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday in response to queries. Asked to comment on the report, he said, \u201cI think the overarching message is that all member states have a duty and responsibility to abide by the sanctions that are in place.\u201dThe eight experts who make up the panel all come from different countries and possess specific expertise in areas like weapons of mass destruction, maritime transport and customs controls. Since 2010 the panel has had a mandate from the Security Council to investigate possible sanctions violations by North Korea and present its findings in an annual report.Though experts who viewed the report said the evidence it cited did not prove definitively that there was current, continuing collaboration between North Korea and Syria on chemical weapons, they said it did provide the most detailed account to date of efforts to circumvent sanctions intended to curtail the military advancement of both countries.William Newcomb, who was a member of the United Nations panel of experts on North Korea from 2011 to 2014, called the report \u201can important breakthrough.\u201dSince the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, there have been suspicions that North Korea was providing equipment and expertise to maintain the chemical weapons program of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. Those suspicions were not assuaged when in 2013 Syria signed onto the Chemical Weapons Convention and claimed to give up its chemical weapons stocks.\u201cWe knew stuff was going on,\u201d Mr. Newcomb said. \u201cWe really wanted to up the game on chemical weapons programs, and we just weren\u2019t able to get what we needed to do so.\u201dThe report, which is more than 200 pages long, includes copies of contracts between North Korean and Syrian companies as well as bills of lading indicating the types of materials shipped. Much information was provided by unidentified United Nations member states.The military-related cooperation, if confirmed, indicates major shortcomings in the international effort to isolate both countries. The shipments would have eluded detection even though both nations are subject to highly restrictive sanctions, and are under the intense scrutiny of American and other spy services.North Korea\u2019s relationship with Syria takes up one section of the report, which also documents the many ways the government of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, has tried to circumvent sanctions. It describes how North Korea uses a complex web of shell companies and sympathetic foreign citizens to gain access to international financing, employs sophisticated cyber operations to steal military secrets and enlists its own diplomats in smuggling operations.It also criticizes Russia and China for failing to do enough to enforce sanctions on items like oil, coal and luxury goods.The sanctions, it says, have yet to be matched \u201cby the requisite political will, international coordination, prioritization and resource allocation necessary to drive effective implementation.\u201dThe report gives fresh details of a military relationship between North Korea and Syria that goes back decades. During the Arab-Israeli wars in the 1960s and 1970s, North Korean pilots flew missions with the Syrian Air Force. Later, North Korean technicians helped to develop Syria\u2019s arsenal of ballistic missiles and to build a nuclear power plant capable of producing plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons. Israel destroyed the plant in 2007.In 2015, Syria honored that assistance by opening a monument and park in Damascus dedicated to North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung, grandfather of the current leader. The unveiling ceremony, held as Syria\u2019s civil war raged, featured North Korean and Syrian dignitaries, military officials and a marching band.North Korea has provided training and support for Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program since at least the 1990s, according to a coming book by Bruce Bechtol, a former Korea analyst at the United States Defense Intelligence Agency who is now a professor at Angelo State University in Texas. The book also describes an accident in 2007 in which several Syrian technicians, along with North Korean and Iranian advisers, were killed in the explosion of a warhead filled with sarin gas and the extremely toxic nerve agent VX.The relationship with Syria \u201chas been a boon for the North Korean military-industrial complex,\u201d Mr. Bechtol said in an interview.The United Nations report says the cooperation continued during Syria\u2019s civil war, despite international sanctions. Crucial evidence of that was found in January 2017, when two ships carrying acid-resistant tiles, commonly used in the construction of chemical weapons factories, were interdicted at sea en route to Damascus, the report said.Those shipments were among five deliveries agreed to in a contract between a government-owned company in Syria and the Korea Mining Development Trading Corp., a North Korean company involved in arms exports, according to the report. It based those findings at least in part on copies of contracts provided by the shipping company, identified as Cheng Tong Trading Co. Ltd., based in China.The report said the three other shipments had been sent between Nov. 3 and Dec. 12, 2016.The report did not say which country interdicted the two January tile shipments or whether the other three shipments were delivered to Damascus. The contract stipulated that the materials were to be delivered to the Metallic Manufacturing Factory, a company run by the Syrian government that was penalized by the United States Treasury Department last year for its involvement in Syria\u2019s weapons industry.Several months earlier, in August 2016, a delegation of North Korean missile technicians visited Syria, at which point there was a transfer of \u201cspecial resistance valves and thermometers known for use in chemical weapons,\u201d the report said, without elaborating. An unidentified United Nations member country told the report\u2019s authors that North Korean missile technicians worked at Syrian chemical weapons and missile facilities in Barzeh, Adra and Hama.In 2013, after the Obama administration threatened military action in response to a sarin gas attack on the rebel enclave of Ghouta that some experts estimated killed 1,400 people, Mr. Assad agreed to destroy his stockpile and join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which comprises 192 countries that are to have dismantled their chemical weapons programs.But Western officials and nonproliferation experts have long suspected that Mr. Assad retains some chemical weapons.So far this year, according to diplomats and witnesses, several chlorine gas attacks have occurred in rebel-held areas in Ghouta, Idlib and Afrin. A separate United Nations panel also said Mr. Assad\u2019s forces were responsible for a sarin gas attack on the rebel-held village of Khan Sheikhoun last April that killed at least 83 people and sickened roughly 300.Mallory Stewart, a former State Department official who was involved in the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program, said that there were always concerns that the Assad government had not listed all of its chemical weapons stockpile on its declared inventory of what it gave up. The report, she says, \u201cconfirms everything we\u2019ve been saying.\u201d\u201cCertainly what we tried to do in the last administration is dismantle the entire chemical weapons program,\u201d Ms. Stewart said, \u201cwhich we know they never did.\u201dEstablishing the origins of such weapons has been difficult. In November, Russia used its Security Council veto to end the work of an independent panel investigating chemical weapons used in the Syrian conflict. The Joint Investigative Mechanism, as it was known, had found that both the Syrian government and Islamic State militants had used chemical weapons in the war, though Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations labeled the panel\u2019s reporting \u201ca joke.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the role William Newcomb played on a United Nations panel of experts on North Korea.

{"Headline": "Sharp Words Over Wall Halt Plans for Mexican President to Visit White House", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s refusal to publicly drop his demand that Mexico pay for a wall on its border with the United States has derailed tentative plans for President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to make his first visit to the Trump White House next month, after a contentious telephone call last week reinflamed tensions on the issue, American and Mexican officials said.The two presidents agreed to scrap the trip after what had been planned as a diplomatic phone call to lay the groundwork for a meeting devolved into a bitter quarrel over the wall, a signature campaign promise of Mr. Trump\u2019s that has long outraged Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has said Mexico has no intention of paying for it.In the call, Mr. Trump balked at Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s attempts to secure a commitment that he would concede publicly during his visit to Washington that Mexico would not pay for the border wall, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a confidential conversation.Mr. Trump grew exasperated, one official said, when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not drop the matter and move on to other issues.The blowup left officials on both sides deeply disappointed that months of constructive negotiations laying the groundwork for a meeting between the presidents and rebuilding trust between the governments had been scuttled in one phone conversation. The presidents were hoping to use Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s visit to Washington to sign a number of bilateral treaties covering the drug fight, border issues and other matters, and to discuss trade, including the status of their efforts to renegotiate Nafta, the officials said.By Sunday, both governments were eager to put the best possible face on the squabble, insisting that a meeting was still possible and that relations had not suffered an irreparable blow.\u201cWe enjoy a great relationship with Mexico, and the two administrations have been working for a year to deepen our cooperation across a range of issues including security, immigration, trade and economics,\u201d Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement.After the call, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, spoke with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and the two agreed they should keep working on areas of agreement, another administration official said.Both sides said a possible meeting between the two presidents remained on the table, though not on the timeline or in the style that had been planned.The confrontation, according to a Mexican official, chilled the warmth and good will that had been built up between the two sides over months of negotiations, and sapped whatever level of trust had been developed after a difficult start to the relationship.It was not the first time that a disagreement over the wall spoiled the chance for the two presidents to establish a rapport.\u201cIf you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to a transcript of that call obtained by The Post and posted online last summer.The collapse of the new, tentatively scheduled March visit was similarly abrupt. When Mr. Videgaray returned from a visit to Washington 10 days ago, he seemed pleased with his progress. The Mexican Foreign Ministry published a picture of Mr. Videgaray at a working lunch with Mr. Kushner; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser; and various members of the cabinet, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.Tucked into the account of the foreign minister\u2019s trip was news that came as a surprise to Mexicans: The two sides had agreed to begin planning a meeting between Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Mr. Trump. The idea was met with astonishment in Mexico, where Mr. Trump is widely despised for his stream of insults against Mexican immigrants and his insistence on building a wall and sticking Mexico with the bill.A cartoon last Sunday in the newspaper Reforma asked incredulously why the trip was planned, noting that Mr. Trump had not changed any of his policies, and depicted Mr. Trump smashing a pie into Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s face.Before the phone conversation, the two sides had agreed \u2014 at the behest of Mr. Trump\u2019s team \u2014 that the presidents should avoid talking about the thorny issues that had scuttled their first planned meeting, the Mexican official said, and Trump administration officials told their Mexican counterparts that they would ensure that the president would not dwell on past disagreements.But during the call, the official said, Mr. Trump lost his temper. A White House official said Mr. Trump had simply become frustrated at Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s insistence on staying on the subject of the wall.The Mexican government has more than the damage to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s reputation to worry about. His handpicked candidate to succeed him, former Finance Minister Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, is running in third place in the July 1 presidential election. A botched meeting between the two presidents could ricochet and hurt Mr. Meade\u2019s struggling campaign.The White House and the Mexican government issued separate short statements on Tuesday noting that the two presidents had spoken by phone to exchange condolences over the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., and a helicopter crash in Oaxaca, Mexico.The Mexican statement said the governments would continue their bilateral agenda \u201cthrough the coordinated efforts of their teams.\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s spokesman, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, said Saturday night that the Mexican government had nothing else to add to that statement.The White House said Mr. Trump had \u201cunderscored his commitment to expanding cooperation between the United States and Mexico on security, trade and immigration.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Kirk Semple from Mexico City.

In the days since the attack that killed 17 people here, I have continued replaying those terrifying moments in my head.It began when a fire alarm went off just before school was supposed to end. We thought nothing of it. People in my finance class had already left, and I grabbed my backpack to evacuate. The next thing I knew I heard people running and shouting, and my teacher yelling at us to get back in the class.I sprinted to her closet and crammed myself against shelves filled with papers and binders. The rest of the closet filled up with the other students. We thought it was an active shooter drill. It wasn\u2019t.My phone flooded with messages from friends and family, from other states and other countries, asking if I was O.K. The world knew what was happening even before we did. I texted my sister to make sure everything was all right with her. I checked in with my friends, and most of them were safe, or had evacuated. I texted my family and told them that I loved them.My classmates scoured the internet, searching for news about what was happening. We found out the shooter was in the freshman building, 50 feet away from our classroom. I was busy shaking in the corner of my little bunker, trying to calm my panic, while rumors about the shooter and the victims arrived by text and Snapchat. We could hear loud noises outside. Were they gunshots? We weren\u2019t sure.After over an hour of confusion and heat, the police SWAT team finally came to get us.We ran out with our phones in our pockets, and our hands over our heads. I have never run so fast. I met up with my friends and sat with them, still in shock. I saw kids crying, traumatized. At home it still didn\u2019t feel real. We tried to watch some TV to distract ourselves. We saw celebrities and politicians talking about our school. But it didn\u2019t feel like our school, it seemed like a movie, a dream, a nightmare.My parents worked hard to leave war-torn Lebanon so that their children would never have to experience the violence and loss that they did. My dad was a first-aid volunteer with the Lebanese Red Cross. He continued his engineering education, worked for General Electric in France and was transferred to the United States. My family lived in Utah; Colorado, where I was born; Minnesota; and finally Florida. My parents chose Parkland to settle in because of Marjory Stoneman Douglas\u2019s stellar reputation, and because we thought that it was a safe place to live. But that isn\u2019t true anymore. The promise of safety and security failed us.One week ago, nobody knew about the small suburb that was Parkland. Now every time I look up \u201cMarjory Stoneman Douglas\u201d on the internet, the top suggestion is \u201cshooting.\u201dMy friends, classmates and teachers are dead. I see the media portraying them as good children who were smart and kind, but they were much more than that.My friend Gina is dead. I had just talked to her that morning in art class. We laughed together, we sang together, we smiled together. We will never do that again. How could someone be this despicable? When I think about it, I start bawling.We can\u2019t let innocent people\u2019s deaths be in vain. We need to work together beyond political parties to make sure this never happens again. We need tougher gun laws.If a person is not old enough to be able to rent a car or buy a beer, then he should not be able to legally purchase a weapon of mass destruction. This could have been prevented. If the killer had been properly treated for his mental illness, maybe this would not have happened. If there were proper background checks, then those who should not have guns would not have them.We need to vote for those who are for stricter laws and kick out those who won\u2019t take action. We need to expose the truth about gun violence and the corruption around guns. Please.It\u2019s devastating that this happened on Valentine\u2019s Day, a day that\u2019s supposed to be about love. Take this as a sign to hug your loved ones and be sure to tell them you love them every day because you never know when it will be their last.If you have any heart, or care about anyone or anything, you need to be an advocate for change. Don\u2019t let any more children suffer like we have. Don\u2019t continue this cycle. This may not seem relevant to you. But next time it could be your family, your friends, your neighbors. Next time, it could be you.Christine Yared is 15.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lower Oil Prices Force Saudis to Widen Their Circle of Friends", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe changing nature of the energy industry \u2014 the oil production boom in American shale fields, the persistence of lower crude prices, and the rise of natural gas \u2014 has transformed the geopolitical equation.While Saudi Arabia is still a major energy producer, it must compensate for its lost revenue. And the United States, China and Russia are all circling in hopes of gaining a financial advantage.Russia, smarting from Western sanctions and lower oil prices, is moving to embrace Saudi Arabia for energy deals despite their rivalry in Syria, where the two countries support competing sides. China, with its domestic oil production in steep decline, seeks a stable flow not just of Saudi oil but of Saudi investment in its growing petrochemical and refinery industries.And Washington is willing to overlook those flirtations in the hope that Saudi Arabia will continue to be a strategic bulwark against Iran.The desires of all three superpowers fit neatly into Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategy to find new investment partners as part of a broader push to diversify its oil-dependent economy, trim large budget deficits and secure the future of both the kingdom\u2019s welfare state and its monarchy.For Mr. Putin, it was an audacious embrace of an American ally as he moved to expand his nation\u2019s energy riches despite the current sanctions. For Mr. al-Falih, it was a chance to discuss future gas sales, attract investment in Saudi Aramco and coordinate efforts to prop up global oil prices.\u201cIf we continue to work the way we do, we will turn from rivals to partners,\u201d Mr. Putin told Mr. al-Falih at the public ceremony. The Saudi official readily agreed.The ultimate success of the Saudi Aramco public offering and the entirety of the kingdom\u2019s economic reform remain in question, and progress so far has been mixed. Nevertheless, American, Chinese and even Russian financiers are entwined in a complex dance around the initial public offering, which is promised for later this year.President Trump has publicly called for the I.P.O. to be listed in New York. A Saudi listing now appears more likely, with additional trading in London or Hong Kong. Global financiers say they want a piece of the action wherever it occurs.The interest in the I.P.O. has given the kingdom greater leverage at a time when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, through which it has long wielded power, has lost much of its clout.\u201cThe Saudis are compensating for their lost power in OPEC and they are showing pure geopolitical pragmatism in their new energy and foreign policy,\u201d said Bill Richardson, a former energy secretary and ambassador to the United Nations. \u201cBut they are not just compensating for lost power. They are adding to their power in world politics.\u201dSaudi Arabia has had a central role in global energy since at least World War II. When the kingdom created a global glut of oil to gain market share in the mid-1980s, it sent prices into a tailspin that contributed to the bankruptcy of the Soviet Union at the same time that it was financing Afghan rebels fighting the Soviets.The kingdom was such a crucial supplier of oil to the United States that Washington went to war in the early 1990s in part to protect it from a possible Iraqi invasion. And when China needed new energy supplies for its expanding economy in the early years of the new century, Saudi Arabia was there with an ambitious oil exploration program to meet the new demand.But OPEC can no longer control oil prices alone. A flood of oil from American shale fields has enabled the United States to slash imports of OPEC oil and begin exporting to markets that were once dominated by Saudi crude.The Saudis, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are seeking to link cuts in OPEC production over the past two years with cuts by Russia, another oil-exporting powerhouse, to buoy prices. Over the longer term, the Saudis want to import natural gas to replace domestic consumption of oil for electricity, freeing more crude for export.At the same time, the country is expanding its investments in refineries and petrochemical plants around Asia and the United States to guarantee markets for its crude while making additional sales of higher-value gasoline, diesel and other refined products.\u201cLow oil prices have made the Saudi way of life unsustainable, so they have to find alternatives,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former Middle East analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency and the author of \u201cKings and Presidents: Saudi Arabia and the United States Since F.D.R.\u201d \u201cAny partner they can find that can help them do that, they are going to embrace enthusiastically.\u201dThe most surprising partner is Russia, which remains on the opposite side of the Syrian civil war and is also trying to build better relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitter regional rival.In the fall of 2016, the crown prince\u2019s father, King Salman, made the first official trip to Russia by a reigning Saudi monarch. Multiple cooperation agreements including military sales were reached, as well as a commitment by Russia\u2019s largest petrochemicals company, Sibut, to build a plant in Saudi Arabia.Relationships between the Chinese and Saudi oil companies had already grown close in recent years. Aramco bought a 25 percent stake in a refinery in Fujian Province operated by the state-owned oil giant Sinopec, and the companies have joint refinery ventures in Saudi Arabia. China and Saudi Arabia also signed a preliminary agreement last summer to create a $20 billion investment fund for infrastructure, energy and mining projects.\u201cWe might as well work with them,\u201d said Sadad Ibrahim al-Husseini, a former Saudi Aramco executive vice president. \u201cThey desperately need energy, and we have a heck of a lot of energy, so the pieces fit.\u201dSuch deals also promote Saudi Aramco\u2019s efforts to become a global refining powerhouse. That can only increase the value of the proposed initial public offering of the company, which already produces more crude than any other in the world.Many international banks, including JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, have been seeking to advise the kingdom and have a role in the eventual deal.\u201cEvery global investment bank should be interested in a lead role given the quality of the company and the fact that it would be the largest I.P.O. in history,\u201d said Osmar Abib, global head of oil and gas at Credit Suisse Securities.The kingdom has valued the company at $2 trillion, a number that investment bankers say would be realistic only if oil were worth $100 a barrel, nearly $40 more than the current price.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for them to persuade anybody to buy a hunk of Aramco until they figure out how to be more transparent about the royals\u2019 take and the actual value of the company,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, who was the State Department\u2019s top energy official early in the Barack Obama administration.Saudi oil executives say the issues of valuation and governance will be worked out in the end because the crown prince and his father view the public offering as central to remaking the economy with more foreign investment.\u201cThere is no backtracking,\u201d Mr. al-Husseini said. \u201cThe I.P.O. commitment is driven by a central leadership, by people who are empowered to make decisions. It\u2019s not a winding narrow road that comes to no conclusion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lee Harris Pomeroy, 85, Dies; Architect Revived Subway Stations", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLee Harris Pomeroy, whose architectural touch is visible around New York City \u2014 in the subway stations he redesigned, the Fulton Mall that he helped to plan in Brooklyn and the limestone-sheathed Swiss Bank Tower he devised to fit in with nearby landmarks like Rockefeller Center and the flagship store of Saks Fifth Avenue \u2014 died on Feb. 18 in Manhattan. He was 85.His daughter, Jordana Pomeroy, confirmed his death but did not specify a cause.\u201cArchitecture is a social art as well as a technical, problem-solving process,\u201d Mr. Pomeroy told his daughter in an email exchange last year. \u201cBut it is also a means of giving form to ideas, as well as satisfying a practical need. And that is what makes it so special.\u201dAlthough Mr. Pomeroy designed projects around the world, among them the Binhai International Convention and Exhibition Center in Tianjin, China, he was probably best known for his work in the city where he lived.\u201cLee was the quintessential New York City architect,\u201d said Sandra Bloodworth, director of arts and design for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. \u201cHe loved New York, and he loved the civic side of historic preservation and transportation.\u201d\u201cWe thought of the restoration of this major historic landmark as a significant gesture of respect to the Bronx,\u201d Mr. Pomeroy said when the station\u2019s renovation was completed in 2013.\u201cIt was chaos before,\u201d Mr. Pomeroy said in 2000, referring to the difficult pedestrian flow before the renovation. \u201cThis is all open now, a continuous flow.\u201dMr. Pomeroy\u2019s passion for preservation found a slightly different outlet in the early 1980s, when he entered a battle on Broadway to save the Helen Hayes and Morosco Theaters from being demolished to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel on Broadway. He was a member of Community Board 5, which included the theater district, and had his office in the Plaza Hotel.\u201cHe felt that Times Square was being destroyed, and he wanted to do something about it,\u201d Joyce Pomeroy Schwartz, his sister, said in a telephone interview.Mr. Pomeroy worked with Actor\u2019s Equity and helped write a report that offered a way to incorporate the theaters in the hotel\u2019s design. The campaign failed, but the city soon conferred landmark status on many remaining Broadway theaters to prevent their destruction. (Another theater in the district was renamed for Helen Hayes shortly afterward as well.)Mr. Pomeroy was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 19, 1932. His father, Alfred, was a furniture designer who owned a store on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. His mother, the former Florence Greenberg, was a homemaker. \u201cOur father was always full of ideas and wonder,\u201d Ms. Schwartz said, \u201cand we grew up loving design.\u201dArchitecture fascinated the younger Mr. Pomeroy.\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in the balance between old and new,\u201d he said for \u201cStreet Value\u201d (2010), a book about the Fulton Mall by Rosten Woo, Meredith TenHoor and Damon Rich. He added: \u201cEarly buildings were not done necessarily for utility; architecturally designed buildings were designed mostly because they were symbols, like pyramids and Greek temples.\u201dHe graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., with a bachelor\u2019s degree in architecture, then earned his master\u2019s from the Yale School of Architecture in 1961.Two years later, his firm Pomeroy, Lebduska Associates, designed the privately-financed conversion of a former red-brick mint factory in Downtown Brooklyn to artists\u2019 studios \u2014 earning a Progressive Architecture award for adapting the building \u201cingeniously and sensibly, and with respect for the existing architecture\u201d \u2014 but the conversion was not completed until 1975. Shortly before the renovation was done, Mr. Pomeroy told The Times that the project had been inspired partly by his father\u2019s love of Brooklyn.\u201cFrom him,\u201d he said, \u201cI inherited an allegiance to the borough and thought this project would help enhance its image.\u201dThe Fulton pedestrian mall was another Brooklyn project for Mr. Pomeroy, which involved designing street furniture, canopies, vendors\u2019 kiosks, lighting, graphics and signage. His plan to cover the eight-block retail area with a fiberglass canopy \u2014 at one point it was going to be pink \u2014 was not supported by merchants.\u201cThe whole idea was to create a space that doesn\u2019t exist in New York,\u201d he told the authors of \u201cStreet Value.\u201dAt the more ambitious Swiss Bank Tower, Mr. Pomeroy designed a 36-story building that gave the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store space to expand. But he also wanted it to be compatible with its famous architectural neighbors. He told The Times in 1990 that he thought of the tower \u201cas having, in form and proportion and material, a dialogue with Rockefeller Center.\u201dIn addition to his daughter and sister, Mr. Pomeroy is survived by his wife, the former Sarah Berman; a son, Jeremy, and seven grandchildren. Another daughter, Alexandra, died in 2015.Antonio Figueroa, an associate principal at the Pomeroy firm, said Mr. Pomeroy did not have a single, definable style as he moved from projects as diverse as the mid-1980s restoration of Grand Central Terminal to the master planning of a mixed-use development in Bangalore, India, called Skill City, which has not been built.\u201cHe felt that every project had its own dynamic, and the only style there was had to be a celebration of the context in which the project is done,\u201d Mr. Figueroa said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a subway station in a historical area, that has to be celebrated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Whether it will see 400 is no sure thing.As Jean Lafitte and other vulnerable little towns that fringe the bayous plead for some small measure of salvation, New Orleans today is a fortress city, equipped with the best environmental protection it has ever had \u2014 probably the strongest, in fact, that any American city has ever had. Yet even the system\u2019s creators have conceded that it may not be strong enough.The problem, in the argot of flood protection, is that the Army Corps of Engineers designed the new system to protect against the storms that would cause a \u201c100-year\u201d flood \u2014 a flood with a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year. And that, experts say, is simply insufficient for an urban area certain to face more powerful storms.Federal, state and local governments have spent more than $20 billion on levees, flood walls, gates and pumps in greater New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But much of the city sits below sea level, making it vulnerable if infrastructure were to fail.LakePontchartrainBayouSauvageNew OrleansEastGentillyMetairieLakeBorgneCentralWetlandsLowerNinth WardNew OrleansMississippi R.AlgiersLakeCataouatcheWest ClosureComplexLakeSalvadorJeanLafitteLakePontchartrainBayouSauvageNew OrleansEastGentillyMetairieLakeBorgneCentralWetlandsLowerNinth WardNew OrleansMississippi R.AlgiersLakeCataouatcheWest ClosureComplexDesAllemandsLakeSalvadorJeanLafitteLakePontchartrainBayouSauvageNew OrleansEastGentillyMetairieLakeBorgneCentralWetlandsLowerNinth WardNew OrleansMississippi R.AlgiersLakeCataouatcheWest ClosureComplexDesAllemandsLakeSalvadorJeanLafitteLakePontchartrainBayouSauvageNew OrleansEastGentillyCentralWetlandsNewOrleansLowerNinth WardAlgiersMiss.

R.West ClosureComplexLakeSalvadorJeanLafitteLakePontchartrainNewOrleansJeanLafitteThe New York Times | Source: Army Corps of Engineers\u201cAll along we knew that 100-year was somewhat voodoo math,\u201d said Garret Graves, a Republican congressman from Louisiana and former chairman of the state\u2019s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. Indeed, the corps has stopped calling its handiwork a hurricane protection system, opting instead for the more modest Hurricane & Storm Damage Risk Reduction System.How that came to be is a story of money and politics and, perhaps, a degree of Louisiana fatalism. In simplest terms, though, it comes down to a mismatch between limited resources and limitless amounts of water.If New Orleans is culturally and culinarily unique among American cities, it is also uniquely vulnerable: Half the city lies below sea level, and is sinking still, and the buffer of protective wetlands that can knock down the force of incoming hurricanes is eroding away.As he ends his eight-year run at City Hall, the mayor, Mitch Landrieu, sounds as if he has a bit of the prophet about him. The combination of sea level rise, subsidence and coastal erosion, he said in an interview, poses an \u201cexistential threat\u201d for New Orleans.\u201cWhat we should have done,\u201d Mr. Landrieu said, \u201cis build to a 10,000-year flood standard, which is what the Netherlands built to, and we didn\u2019t, and that was for the country a monetary decision.\u201dThe Army Corps spent nearly 50 years building the old hurricane protection system for New Orleans. More than 1,400 people died in the city when it failed. So in the aftermath of Katrina, Congress thought big.In the end, though, the interim level became the benchmark. One central factor was a congressional compromise reached during the George W. Bush administration that came to be known locally as the Devil\u2019s bargain. Under the deal, New Orleanians would remain eligible for federal flood insurance if the system could be brought up to the 100-year level \u2014 the protection needed for insurance eligibility in what the government defines as a flood zone. An insurance standard became a proxy for a safety standard.Though the corps produced a 4,000-page report with a host of alternatives, it offered no recommended course of action. That, along with the financing, largely fell to the state. By 2012, the state\u2019s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority had already issued two versions of its own master plan, the later one calling for Katrina-level or greater protection for New Orleans. But when the third plan was released in 2017, predictions for the effects of climate change had outstripped ambition: The seas were rising so fast, the authors concluded, that with its $50 billion price tag for greater New Orleans and the south Louisiana coast, the hoped-for protection was out of reach. What\u2019s more, that much money might never become available.Sidney Coffee, who led the state authority from 2005 to 2008, said the state had to balance the needs of the city with those of the rest of Louisiana. \u201cThe state has always wanted the best, the highest level of protection that could be afforded for New Orleans,\u201d she said.Because of measures like these, \u201cwhat resulted from the design was much more like a 500-year system than a 100-year system,\u201d said Ed Link, an engineering professor at the University of Maryland who led the corps-sponsored investigation of the levee failures in Katrina. With an emphasis on improving evacuation protocols, even supplying transportation for pets, fewer deaths are expected during the next Katrina.But the flooding could still be severe \u2014 during a 500-year flood, as much as five feet deep in the half of the city that sits below sea level. In August, a thunderstorm dumped between six and nine inches of rain over parts of the city within a three-hour period, overwhelming antiquated pumps \u2014 some dating to 1912 \u2014 and causing extensive flooding. Updating the drainage system will cost at least $1 billion through 2026, and perhaps much more.One of the most spectacular features of the city\u2019s new defenses is a 1.8-mile-long wall that cuts across wetlands at a corner of Lake Borgne, east of the city. It stands 26 feet above the water line and cost $1.1 billion. Its support piles reach more than 100 feet into the muck of the lake. Its top is crenelated like a castle wall.And it illustrates how, in many parts of New Orleans, upgrading further is not feasible.The wall was designed for a 100-year storm, with some extra height to compensate for subsidence and estimated sea level rise over 50 years. But at this location, Katrina sent a far stronger surge.There is no easy fix. While earthen levees can be raised by adding dirt, raising the wall even higher would be impractical, said Robert Turner, director of engineering and operations for the regional levee authority that operates the barrier. A cap of an additional foot could be built, he said, but \u201cif you try to go higher than that over time, you can stress the pile foundations that hold this barrier in place.\u201dTo many local officials, 500-year protection is a fantasy. Susan Maclay, the head of the levee authority for the New Orleans-area communities on the west bank of the Mississippi River, said that finding the money to maintain the current system was daunting. The financially squeezed state government, too, is searching for a way to pay its share of the hurricane protection system \u2014 $100 million a year for the next 30.\u201cYou\u2019re so focused on killing the snakes right in front of you that you can\u2019t, it\u2019s just not feasible, to think beyond the immediate problem,\u201d Ms. Maclay said.All the while, the rest of the state is waiting for its own 100-year protection.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to sell, on the state level, elevating New Orleans protection to 500 when you have places such as Jean Lafitte, Terrebonne Parish, Houma, New Iberia and other places that have zero level of protection, or at best 10-year protection,\u201d said Jerome Zeringue, a state representative. New Orleanians, he said, \u201cshould lessen their expectations.\u201dThe rest of the nation, too, awaits a higher level of protection from the effects of climate change: Major cities like New York and Miami, but also smaller communities like Galveston, Tex., want costly projects of their own. \u201cThe rest of the coast, and the rest of the country, needs help,\u201d said Col. Michael Clancy, commander of the New Orleans district of the corps.Still, more must be done, said Mr. Graves, the Louisiana congressman. The projects to protect the state so far are tremendous, but what is to come will have to be \u201ctremendouser,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cPeople say we can\u2019t afford to do this \u2014 I would say we can\u2019t afford not to.\u201dRepairing hurricane damage is always far more expensive than providing protection. Katrina cost between $120 billion and $150 billion, Mr. Graves noted. The new system has already saved hundreds of millions of dollars in smaller storms like Hurricane Isaac in 2012. \u201cWhen a big one comes,\u201d he said, \u201cthat project will pay off multiple times over.\u201dSara Sneath of NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune contributed reporting.Designed and produced by Danny DeBelius.Last year, The New York Times and NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune of New Orleans agreed to collaborate to bring attention to the impact of climate change on land loss in one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable and vital regions. The approach made sense because the future of Louisiana\u2019s coast, which is critical to the energy, seafood and shipping sectors, should be of great concern to those who live there as well as to those who merely benefit from its bounty. At a time of intense financial pressure on local news coverage, it was reasoned that readers of both publications would be served by joining the long expertise of NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune with the resources and skills of The Times\u2019s reporting, video, photography, graphics and design staffs.The result is this package of articles and graphic illustrations, 10 months in the making, timed to coincide with this year\u2019s tricentennial of New Orleans. The lead article tells the story of the intrepid mayor of a threatened Louisiana fishing village who is fighting to save his town from encroaching seas. Another examines the expenditure of billions of dollars to repair and improve the New Orleans levee system after Hurricane Katrina, and questions whether it is nearly enough to protect the city through its next 100 years. A third introduces readers to the latest threat to Louisiana\u2019s coast, an aphid-like insect that, along with nutria and feral hogs, is destroying the vegetation essential to keeping the wetlands from dissolving.Together, they depict a losing race against time, one likely to be replicated in coastal zones around the world as sea levels rise.

{"Headline": "The True Source of the N.R.A.\u2019s Clout: Mobilization, Not Donations", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Florida and other states across the country, as well as on Capitol Hill, the N.R.A. derives its political influence instead from a muscular electioneering machine, fueled by tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of campaign ads and voter-guide mailings, that scrutinizes candidates for their views on guns and propels members to the polls.\u201cIt\u2019s really not the contributions,\u201d said Cleta Mitchell, a former N.R.A. board member. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability of the N.R.A. to tell its members: Here\u2019s who\u2019s good on the Second Amendment.\u201dThe N.R.A.\u2019s impact comes, in large part, from the simplicity of the incentives it presents to political candidates: letter grades, based on their record on the Second Amendment, that guide the N.R.A.\u2019s involvement in elections. Lawmakers who earn an \u201cA\u201d rating can count on the group not to oppose them when they run for re-election or higher office.For candidates who earn lower grades, the group deploys a range of blunt-force methods against them. The N.R.A. mails the voter guides to its five million members, displaying images of favored candidates on the front, and some state chapters bombard supporters with emails about coming elections.The organization\u2019s calculation is that its money is better spent on maintaining a motivated base of gun rights supporters than on bankrolling candidates directly.Those numbers are tied to campaign finance reports filed by individual lawmakers. The N.R.A.\u2019s spending on messages like its voter guides does not need to be disclosed, because it falls into the category of a membership-based group communicating with its members.Ms. Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who sat on the group\u2019s board for nearly a decade, said its record of loyalty to those who stand by it was a cornerstone of its influence. \u201cThey know that it\u2019s not easy, sometimes, to stick with the N.R.A.,\u201d she said of the group\u2019s leadership. \u201cAt times like this, it\u2019s very easy to get stampeded by the media and the left.\u201dThis type of spending also comes with risks, particularly when the group ventures into so-called purpler parts of the country, where the two parties have similar levels of support. The N.R.A.\u2019s presence can draw in an increasingly well-funded collection of groups that support gun control, and can sometimes unnerve moderate voters.\u201cThere were parts of the state where they wouldn\u2019t run their ads because they knew it would drive voters to supporting me,\u201d Mr. Herring said, adding of the N.R.A.\u2019s campaign spending: \u201cIt did elevate the conversation, the issue, but it was also one that I wanted to talk about.\u201dStill, in more rural areas where voters fiercely support gun rights, Democrats have routinely paid a price in recent years for crossing the N.R.A.In Colorado, where a Democratic-held state government passed new gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, the N.R.A. helped bankroll successful recall campaigns against two Democratic lawmakers, including the powerful president of the State Senate.The former Senate leader, John P. Morse, who lost his seat in 2013 by a margin of 319 votes, said the N.R.A. had played a decisive role in motivating Second Amendment voters in a low-turnout race. After that, Mr. Morse said, Democrats have \u201crun like scalded rats from the issue.\u201d\u201cThey turn out people that already agree with them,\u201d Mr. Morse said of the N.R.A. \u201cThe reason why gun policy is where it is in this country, at this point, is that the rest of us are too lackadaisical.\u201dThe organization has focused heavily in recent years on high-profile Senate elections in conservative-leaning states that are key to the balance of power in Congress, amassing an imposing record of victories, including that of Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Tom Cotton of Arkansas.\u201cWhat we are seeing right now is a reversal of fortune,\u201d Mr. Feinblatt said. \u201cThe truth is, they are making bad bets. And they are out of sync. Their power is diminishing by the day.\u201dEric Lipton reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Has Good News for Once: Its First Quarterly Profit", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter often feels like the digital equivalent of a swamp.As a business, however, Twitter might finally be starting to work.\u201cWe did what we said we were going to do,\u201d an exultant Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, said on Twitter. \u201cOur focus and self-discipline continues to improve.\u201dIt\u2019s a measure of the undisciplined \u2014 O.K., brutal \u2014 nature of Twitter that most of the replies to Mr. Dorsey\u2019s tweet were not congratulations but insults and criticism. Others were incomprehensible.What counts, however, is that those cranks and critics are there in the first place. The number of people who use the service monthly rose 4 percent to 330 million, which \u2014 while not a big increase \u2014 is something. Those who use the social media service every day grew 12 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit gains.\u201cThe user growth is kind of astounding,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media and tech analyst at the research firm BTIG, who has been recommending the stock for a year. \u201cThey were barely growing two years ago.\u201dTwitter originally showed tweets in reverse chronological order \u2014 the latest posts, however mundane, were on top. Now it is using algorithms to try to show the most important tweets first, making the site more engaging.\u201cIf you show the right tweets to the right person at the right time, it creates user happiness,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said. \u201cThat means more time spent on the site, which means more opportunities for advertising.\u201dOver all, Twitter reported a profit of $91 million in the final three months of 2017, compared with a loss of $167 million a year earlier. Margins were much better, expenses were lower and stock-based compensation decreased sharply.Other numbers were not as impressive. Revenue rose 2 percent to $732 million in the quarter. Revenue from advertising, which makes up the bulk of its revenue, increased 1 percent. In general, Twitter exceeded low expectations.\u201cA solid result across the board and builds upon the momentum\u201d from the third quarter, analysts at UBS wrote in a research note.One quarter is not much of a streak, and Twitter has often been unable to keep it up. Jim Cridlin, the global head of innovation at Mindshare, a unit of the advertising giant WPP, said that while Twitter\u2019s momentum continued into the fourth quarter, the company still faced \u201csignificant headwinds.\u201dFor the current quarter, UBS calculated that Twitter would generate $583 million of revenue, $11 million more than analysts were predicting. That might keep the party going.What really is helping Twitter is that there are only three American social media companies that count. Facebook is by far the largest, but is under pressure from all quarters precisely because of its size and influence. It is trying to moderate the latter without hurting the former, which is going to be tricky. Snap is a singular effort forging its own direction as a communications platform.That leaves Twitter, troubled as it might be.\u201cAdvertisers have a huge desire to be on mobile devices more, but there are not a lot of ways to reach people on applications worthy of your home screen,\u201d said Mr. Greenfield. \u201cTwitter is on your home screen.\u201dDavid Streitfeld reported from San Francisco and Chad Bray from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Is Getting Paid to Save the Music Industry: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify files to go public.\u2022 Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles.\u2022 The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one?\u2022 What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?\u2022 The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope.\u2022 And is Jared Kushner\u2019s weakness his family business?Perhaps more than any other streaming service, Spotify has revived the fortunes of recording artists. It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday.The numbers are included in Spotify\u2019s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing\u2019s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, \u201cconsists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.\u201dThe filing says Spotify had \u20ac3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was \u20ac2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. \u201cThis decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,\u201d the filing said.But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that.\u2014 Peter EavisAccounting nerds delving into Spotify\u2019s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy.Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of \u20ac324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled \u20ac179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda?It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung \u20ac439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year.\u2014 Peter EavisDirect listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market.Spotify won\u2019t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days.Here\u2019s a look at the details:Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang.Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify\u2019s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public.In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby.Dick\u2019s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT:\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201dOver five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero.Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest.\u2022 Mr. Ackman\u2019s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet.How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high.Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIs it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no.BackgroundSnap\u2019s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock.The criticism has also overshadowed Snap\u2019s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent.BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock\u2019s annual report:As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as \u201ccommon ownership\u201d. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.The filing goes on to say:If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock\u2019s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years.What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy.To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes.Is it working? Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year.Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony.\u2014 Peter EavisSky is both a telecom operator \u2014 selling TV, internet and phone services \u2014 and a media company with its own original news, sports and entertainment programming.

{"Headline": "Trump Lawyer\u2019s Payment to Porn Star Raises New Questions", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, told The New York Times on Tuesday that he had used his own funds to facilitate the payment to the actress, Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, adding that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign had reimbursed him for the payment. He insisted that the payment was legal.But Mr. Cohen\u2019s assertions left many questions unanswered, including whether the payment was truly a personal gift by him or whether he was reimbursed by some other party, like Mr. Trump or an associate of Mr. Trump.In a brief interview on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen declined to answer questions about whether Mr. Trump had reimbursed him, whether the two men had made any arrangement at the time of the payment, or whether he had made any payments to other women or accusers of the president.\u201cI can\u2019t get into any of that,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\u201cThe thing seems so weird that it invites an inquiry into what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cLawyers don\u2019t go around giving $130,000 to strangers, benefiting their clients, without billing their clients.\u201dKeith Davidson, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented Ms. Clifford in the 2016 transaction, issued a statement Wednesday declaring that Mr. Cohen had told him at the time that the $130,000 payment was coming from his own funds.\u201cI represented Stephanie Clifford in the Michael Cohen/Stephanie Clifford transaction,\u201d Mr. Davidson\u2019s statement said. \"I read today that Michael Cohen reports that the source of the $130,000 paid to Ms. Clifford was from his own personal funds. That assertion is in complete harmony with what he informed me of at the time of the transaction.\u201dMs. Clifford believes that Mr. Cohen, in making his statement, has breached a nondisclosure agreement she signed in connection with the payment, releasing her from the confidentiality commitment, according to Gina Rodriguez, her manager. Ms. Clifford, she said, is now offering to sell her story to media outlets so that she can tell her version of events.Mr. Cohen worked as a lawyer for the Trump Organization for roughly a decade, with an office near Mr. Trump\u2019s on the 26th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan. Part fixer, part pit bull biting back at anyone who attacked Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen frequently badgered reporters over stories he found unflattering toward his boss during the campaign. He was often quoted in interviews lavishing praise on his boss.Mr. Cohen\u2019s statement on Tuesday acknowledging that he had sent the money to Ms. Clifford was linked to a deadline requiring him to respond to a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission by Common Cause, a liberal-leaning watchdog group.The group alleges that the payment amounted to an undisclosed, in-kind contribution to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign that violated the individual contribution limit of $2,700. (Such limits do not apply to candidates spending their own money.)In his statement to The Times on Tuesday, Mr. Cohen insisted that the payment did not violate campaign-finance laws, saying, \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201dBut on Wednesday, Paul S. Ryan, the vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, said that if the funds were truly Mr. Cohen\u2019s, the payment was an excessive contribution, and if not, \u201cwe still need an investigation to figure out whose money this was.\u201dIf the commission dismisses the complaint without an investigation, he said, the group is considering filing a lawsuit against the agency or against the Trump campaign.Depending on what the circumstances turn out to be, he and other ethics specialists pointed to Rule 1.8, which governs financial arrangements between a lawyer and a client. One provision generally prohibits lawyers from lending money to clients during contemplated or pending litigation, although Ms. Clifford appears to have been threatening to talk \u2014 not to sue.Another provision requires a written and signed agreement if there is a loan between a lawyer and a client. If it turns out that the arrangement was envisioned as a loan that Mr. Trump would eventually repay, Mr. Cohen was obliged to create such a document.But if Mr. Cohen intended to make a gift to Mr. Trump by paying off Ms. Clifford without expecting any reimbursement, then no written agreement was required, the specialists said. Nor would the rule have required a document if some third party, like one of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy associates, had reimbursed Mr. Cohen.Last month, Mr. Cohen sent Wall Street Journal reporters a written statement in Ms. Clifford\u2019s name denying that she had had \u201ca sexual and/or romantic affair\u201d with Mr. Trump or \u201creceived hush money from Mr. Trump.\u201d He also issued his own statement saying that Mr. Trump \u201cvehemently denies\u201d any affair with her.If evidence emerged showing that those statements were false and that Mr. Cohen knew they were false, his role in disseminating them could violate Rule 8.4, several legal ethics specialists said. It prohibits lawyers from engaging \u201cin conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201dStill, Mr. Gillers said that Mr. Cohen\u2019s \u201cexplanation is sufficiently improbable to spark a disciplinary committee investigation.\u201d Anyone can file a complaint asking the committee to investigate him, or it can open a file on its own, he said, cautioning that it works slowly and that its proceedings are secret unless they result in public discipline.\u201cThe committee has the jurisdiction to get to the bottom of it if it wishes to do so.\u201dRebecca Ruiz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citing Hostility, Leader of Anti-Corruption Panel in Honduras Resigns", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The leader of an international anti-corruption panel in Honduras has resigned, delivering a blow to the campaign against the country\u2019s deeply rooted corruption and throwing the future of the panel into doubt.In a letter released late Thursday, the panel\u2019s leader, Juan Jim\u00e9nez Mayor, a former Peruvian prime minister, said that his small group of prosecutors had been abandoned as they faced rising hostility from the Honduran government.The panel is backed by the Organization of American States, but the regional body\u2019s secretary general, Luis Almagro, who appointed Mr. Jim\u00e9nez, refused to meet with him in Washington two weeks ago. Mr. Jim\u00e9nez had planned to discuss the corruption cases his prosecutors were pursuing and the resistance, including threats, that was blocking their work.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be alone, and he knows it,\u201d Mr. Jim\u00e9nez wrote.The panel\u2019s top prosecutor, Julio Arbizu, a former anti-corruption prosecutor in Peru, and a Chilean judge, Daniel Urrutia, also resigned from the panel.Although Mr. Jim\u00e9nez said the remaining group, some two dozen experts, would continue its investigations without him, it might be difficult to attract someone with his background to take charge of the task in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras.\u201cThe question now is whether Almagro will step up and appoint a qualified and experienced prosecutor to replace Juan Jim\u00e9nez or simply appoint a diplomat disinclined to ruffle feathers in Honduras,\u201d Eric L. Olson, a Honduras expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, wrote in an email. \u201cThat would be disastrous.\u201dTensions between Mr. Almagro and Mr. Jim\u00e9nez had been rising for months, but the last straw appeared to be a letter that Mr. Almagro sent to President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez on Wednesday. In it, he complained that the panel, known by its Spanish initials as the Maccih, \u201chad not been able to produce the results and prosecutions of corruption cases that we would have wished and which we owe to the people of Honduras.\u201dIt was an odd complaint to direct at Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez. The president\u2019s allies have worked to sabotage much of the panel\u2019s efforts, freezing proposed legislation to protect witnesses and stalling the enforcement of new campaign finance laws.But the most direct affront came last month, after the attorney general\u2019s new corruption unit, working with the panel, charged five legislators with pocketing money intended for social projects in their constituencies. In response, the Honduran Congress passed a budget decree that froze all investigations into the money for those social projects, and a judge threw out the case against the lawmakers.Furious, Mr. Jim\u00e9nez said then that the investigation had spread to about 60 current and former lawmakers, including the powerful president of the Congress, Mauricio Oliva Herrera, a close ally of the president.The investigation also appeared to be widening beyond Congress.

{"Headline": "At the Bobsled Track, Women Push for Equality", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPYEONGCHANG, South Korea \u2014 The path to equality in winter sports is long and winding, caught up in questions of funding, assumptions about female strength, and international sports federation politics.The world\u2019s top female bobsledders \u2014 and some top male executives in the sport \u2014 say it is past time to put women on equal footing with the men, but they say they are facing pushback from international officials. Opponents of expansion argue that there are not enough female bobsledders in most countries to justify a second event for women, and they fear adding one to the Olympic program would come at the expense of male athletes.Elana Meyers Taylor, a two-time Olympic medalist and the pilot of the top American team, said that line of reasoning was a Catch-22. The only way to encourage more women to pursue bobsledding, she says, is to let women participate in a four-man competition.\u201cFor most people, they only thing they know about bobsled is \u2018Cool Runnings,\u2019\u201d Meyers Taylor said, referencing the 1993 Disney film. \u201cWell, \u2018Cool Runnings\u2019 was of course four men in a bobsled, and four-man is considered the highlight of our sport. It\u2019s what everybody knows. It\u2019s what everybody watches. And it\u2019s the big dog of our sport.\u201dThe two-time Olympic gold medalist Kaillie Humphries of Canada, an on-ice rival and off-track ally of Meyers Taylor, also has pushed for the inclusion of a women\u2019s four-man event (the sport refers to the disciplines as \u201ctwo-man\u201d and \u201cfour-man\u201d regardless of the gender of the athletes). Both acknowledge that they need to recruit more women to the sport to help make their case more effectively.In November 2014, Meyers Taylor and Humphries each piloted four-man bobsleds in a World Cup race. They were the first female pilots to compete in a four-man event after the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation ruled that the discipline was gender neutral. Each woman drove the sleds with three men as the push athletes.In the four-man event, the pilot begins in the sled, so their strength and speed do not affect the result. Peter van Wees of the Netherlands, a member of the executive board of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, said women can drive the four-man sled and want to. \u201cNow it\u2019s just making sure that our system allows,\u201d he said.Many women who compete in bobsled say their biggest barrier is a lack of funding for training and competing at international levels. A four-man sled costs tens of thousands of dollars, and that doesn\u2019t count the years of research and engineering behind its construction.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that with many nations, if they have a limited budget and they have to decide between expanding their men\u2019s program and starting a women\u2019s program, it\u2019s typically women that get cut out of the budget,\u201d said Darrin Steele, the chief executive of U.S.A. Bobsled and Skeleton and a vice president of the international federation.The international federation has set up a working group to try to address the issues that have prevented the progression of women in the sport, specifically focusing on the hurdles that make bobsledding prohibitively expensive.The international federation is even considering the introduction of a new category: the monobob, a sled for one athlete. The federation would purchase a fleet of standardized sleds, making bobsled a contest of strength and driving skill rather than an arms race for the best and most expensive engineering.The federation is also considering providing sleds in a variety of sizes \u2014 including four-man sleds \u2014 to athletes to help increase participation, with the goal of attracting more female drivers and more nations to participate.But the bobsled federation remains cautious. Allowing women\u2019s bobsled to expand at the Olympics might force some men\u2019s bobsledders to step aside because the I.O.C. limits the number of athletes in each sport.\u201cWe have a lot of federations that have invested 10 years and people\u2019s careers that will come to an abrupt end if we say, \u2018O.K., the U.S. is only allowed two sleds because there is now one four-man for women coming in,\u2019\u201d Van Wees said.While the international federation could ask for a larger quota, receiving it is not guaranteed.\u201cIt\u2019s just a hard decision to make \u2014 because you will end careers of as many male bobsledders as you will add careers for female bobsledders,\u201d Van Wees added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just your history holding you back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "University of Pennsylvania Takes Away Steve Wynn\u2019s Honors. And Bill Cosby\u2019s, Too.", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe university announced the decisions a week after reports emerged that Mr. Wynn, a Penn alumnus and former trustee, had frequently demanded naked massages from female employees, sometimes pressuring them for sex, in one case leading to a $7.5 million legal settlement.Mr. Cosby and Mr. Wynn are among a string of well-known men accused of sexual assault or harassment, forcing colleges to reconsider tributes like honorary degrees, which are often bestowed on celebrities and business leaders with the hope of spurring major donations.Several universities also said they would revoke honorary degrees to the television news personality Charlie Rose.Large contributions to universities often come with the expectation that the donor\u2019s name will be prominently displayed on a building, so the accusations against Mr. Wynn presented Penn, an Ivy League school in Philadelphia, with a particular conundrum.Students had already begun making their feelings known about Wynn Commons, an outdoor area on campus named for Mr. Wynn after he made a $7.5 million donation in 1995. A protest was planned for Friday, and earlier this week, the word \u201cWynn\u201d was vandalized with black paint. The university quickly covered it up with plywood, with only the word \u201cCommons\u201d remaining visible.In 2015, the university rebuffed calls to revoke Mr. Cosby\u2019s honorary degree. At that time, the university said that while the allegations against Mr. Cosby were deeply troubling, \u201cit is not our practice to rescind honorary degrees.\u201dBefore Thursday, Penn had not rescinded an honorary degree in a century, since it took similar action against Kaiser Wilhelm II and Ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff of Germany during World War I.In explaining the university\u2019s decision, which was made by an executive committee of the board of trustees, Dr. Gutmann and Mr. Cohen wrote that once the committee decided that Mr. Wynn\u2019s honorary degree, bestowed in 2006, needed to be revoked, it had to do the same with Mr. Cosby\u2019s 1990 honor.\u201cThe decision to remove the name Wynn Commons could not be made independently of considering the other ways in which the university had previously recognized Mr. Wynn,\u201d the email said. \u201cIt became necessary, therefore, to consider the appropriateness of Mr. Wynn\u2019s honorary degree and any other honorifics Penn had previously bestowed.\u201d\u201cThat decision in turn made it also clear that the multiple and highly credible charges involving Bill Cosby warranted the same action.\u201dThe Republican National Committee said it would not return Mr. Wynn\u2019s contributions unless he were found guilty of the accusations, though the Republican Governors Association and several Republican members of Congress have returned his money or donated the amounts to charity.The University of Iowa announced plans this week to remove Mr. Wynn\u2019s name from the school\u2019s Institute for Vision Research, which Mr. Wynn helped fund with a $25 million donation in 2013.On campus Thursday, some students took photographs of the newly altered \u201cCommons\u201d sign, with traces of black spray paint still visible around the plywood covering Mr. Wynn\u2019s name.Amanda Silberling, 21, a senior from Boca Raton, Fla., who has led campus activism on sexual assault issues, said that the school had become more attuned recently to concerns about sexual misconduct.\u201cI think there\u2019s definitely been a lot more dialogue on campus in the last few years,\u201d she said, \u201cabout what role institutions like Penn play in setting examples for students and showing what a moral and ethical response to issues like this are.\u201dAs for Mr. Cosby, she said, revoking his honorary degree was a welcome gesture, even though it was late.\u201cNow that there\u2019s somebody directly affiliated with the university, with their name all over the place,\u201d he said, \u201cthey finally realize that change needs to be made, and we should probably go back and revoke Cosby\u2019s too.\u201dJon Hurdle and Kenneth Vogel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "13 Russians Indicted as Mueller Reveals Effort to Aid Trump Campaign", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department charged 13 Russians and three companies on Friday in a sprawling indictment that unveiled a sophisticated network designed to subvert the 2016 election and to support the Trump campaign. It stretched from an office in St. Petersburg, Russia, into the social feeds of Americans and ultimately reached the streets of election battleground states.The Russians stole the identities of American citizens, posed as political activists and used the flash points of immigration, religion and race to manipulate a campaign in which those issues were already particularly divisive, prosecutors said.Some of the Russians were also in contact with \u201cunwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign,\u201d according to court papers. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation, made no accusation that President Trump or his associates were knowingly part of the conspiracy.\u201cThe indictment alleges that the Russian conspirators want to promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy,\u201d Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the inquiry, said in a brief news conference. \u201cWe must not allow them to succeed.\u201dThe 37-page indictment \u2014 handed up by a federal grand jury in Washington \u2014 amounted to a detailed rebuttal of Mr. Trump, who has sowed doubts that Russia interfered in the election and dismissed questions about its meddling as \u201cfake news.\u201dThe Justice Department said Mr. Mueller\u2019s work was not complete. The indictment does not address the hacking of Democratic email systems or whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the F.B.I. investigation into Russian interference. Mr. Mueller is negotiating with the president\u2019s lawyers over the terms of a possible interview.Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies.But Mr. Trump\u2019s statement ignored the government\u2019s conclusion that, by 2016, the Russians were \u201csupporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump\u201d and disparaging Hillary Clinton, his opponent. Working out of the office in St. Petersburg, the Russians described waging \u201cinformation warfare against the United States of America,\u201d according to court documents.Whether any of that violated federal law is the weightiest question facing Mr. Mueller, and Friday\u2019s indictment did not answer it. But it painted a picture of a Russian operation that was multipronged, well financed and relentless.Russian operatives traveled across the United States to gather intelligence and foment political discord. They worked with an unidentified American who advised them to focus their efforts on what they viewed as \u201cpurple\u201d election battleground states, including Colorado, Virginia and Florida, the indictment said.In August 2016, prosecutors said, Russians posed as Americans and coordinated with Trump campaign staff to organize rallies in Florida.Such anecdotes are rare examples of how intelligence agencies work covertly to influence political outcomes abroad. The C.I.A. has conducted such operations for decades, but both Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment and an intelligence assessment last year present a startling example \u2014 unprecedented in its scope and audacity \u2014 of a foreign government working to help elect an American president.The indictment does not explicitly say the Russian government sponsored the effort, but American intelligence officials have publicly said that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed and oversaw it. The indictment notes that two of the Russian firms involved hold Russian government contracts.\u201cThis is clearly a message document,\u201d Robert S. Litt, the former general counsel to the director of national intelligence, said of the indictment. \u201cMueller wants to end the debate over whether there was Russian interference in the election.\u201dThe Russian nationals were accused of working with the Internet Research Agency, which had a budget of millions of dollars and was designed to reach millions of Americans. The defendants were charged with carrying out a massive fraud against the American government and conspiring to obstruct enforcement of federal laws.None of the defendants were arrested \u2014 Russia does not generally extradite its citizens to the United States. But prosecutors use such indictments to name and shame operatives, making it harder for them to work undetected in the future. If they travel abroad, they risk capture and extradition.Russian computer specialists, divided into day teams and night teams, created hundreds of social media accounts that eventually attracted hundreds of thousands of online followers. They posed as Christian activists, anti-immigration groups and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement. One account posed as the Tennessee Republican Party and generated hundreds of thousands of followers, prosecutors said.Separate divisions of the Internet Research Agency were in charge of graphics, data analysis and information technology, according to the indictment.\u201cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people,\u201d one of the Russians, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina, wrote as the operation was being unmasked.Their tasks included undermining Mrs. Clinton by supporting her Democratic primary campaign rival, Bernie Sanders, prosecutors said. Those instructions were detailed in internal documents: \u201cUse any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump \u2014 we support them).\u201d Mr. Mueller identified 13 digital advertisements paid for by the Russian operation. All of them attacked Mrs. Clinton or promoted Mr. Trump.\u201cHillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is,\u201d one advertisement stated.In summer 2016, as Mrs. Clinton appeared headed for a decisive general election victory, Russian operatives promoted allegations of Democratic voter fraud. That echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s own message that he was the victim of a rigged political system.After the election, the Russians kept up their efforts to foment dissent. In November, they staged two rallies in New York on the same day. One had the theme, \u201cShow your support for President-Elect Trump.\u201d The other was called, \u201cTrump is NOT my President.\u201dThe indictment does not say that Russia changed the outcome of the election, a fact that Mr. Rosenstein noted repeatedly. American intelligence officials have said they have no way of calculating the effect of the Russian influence.The Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told the RBC news website that Russian officials have not familiarized themselves with the document yet.Scott Shane and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting from Washington, Michael Schwirtz from New York, and Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ruth Simmons on Cultivating the Next Generation of College Students", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusIn 2012, after a distinguished career in higher education, which included serving as the president of Smith College and Brown University \u2014 where she was the first black woman to lead an Ivy League institution \u2014 Ruth J. Simmons retired and moved back to her home state, Texas.She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever work at a university again. But after several years, Prairie View A&M University, a historically black school with about 9,000 students, came calling.\u201cI was quite surprised to be approached about the opportunity,\u201d Dr. Simmons told me, but \u201cI also went to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 Dillard University \u2014 and I\u2019m very much aware of the ways in which these colleges play a role for many students.\u201dAfter several months as interim president of the university, she accepted the permanent position in October 2017.I asked Dr. Simmons to talk about her new role and plans for Prairie View because she has been at the forefront of many trends in higher education. At Brown, she established need-blind admissions for undergraduates (the last of the Ivy League to do so). In 2003, she commissioned a study of the university\u2019s ties to the slave trade \u2014 one of the first university efforts to uncover the historical connection between academia and slavery. At Smith, she created an engineering program, the first at any all-women\u2019s college.(Disclosure: I attended Brown and overlapped with Dr. Simmons my freshman year.)This conversation has been edited and condensed.I grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.My aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.As president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.M.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities? Frankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.I don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.M.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described? M.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together. As a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.M.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.Prairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.When I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.M.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?And I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.So much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.Advertisement"}

But along the way, she accumulated goats, pigs, sheep and a cow.Before long, she had created a working farm and later marketed her meats to some of the top restaurants in New York. She delivered whole carcasses herself from Vermont slaughterhouses directly to chefs at Daniel, Jean Georges, the 21 Club, Chanterelle and Gramercy Tavern, among others.Ms. Ratcliff, who died on Tuesday at age 84 after a long struggle with emphysema, was an early practitioner of sustainable farming and what would become the farm-to-table movement.An eccentric and at times irascible farmer who allowed her animals to wander into the living room of her 1820s farmhouse, Ms. Ratcliff was a fierce advocate for the small family farm.He said her meats were more expensive than others, but they were also better.Ms. Ratcliff organized nearly 50 other farmers into cooperatives to join her in selling and delivering meats and cheeses to New York and Boston. Though her clientele were high-end chefs, she never stood on ceremony, often showing up with a whole carcass slung over her shoulder.\u201cIt was a ragtag operation,\u201d recalled her brother, John Ratcliff, who confirmed the death. \u201cBut Lydia would arrive at these world-class restaurants in her blood-soaked pants with a Louis Vuitton briefcase under her arm, speaking French and Italian to the chefs.\u201dHer farm, Lovejoy Brook, in the small town of Andover, in south-central Vermont, was once one of a dozen dairy farms within a 10-mile radius. Today, it is the last, having survived in part because Ms. Ratcliff had diversified early as others were squeezed out by the unforgiving economics of small farming, which she also faced.\u201cYou don\u2019t do it for a profit,\u201d she said.Over the years, Ms. Ratcliff made conservative investments, cut back her herd size, sold off parcels of her original 225 acres and kept working. Even as her health declined, she continued to ride atop her tractor, toting her oxygen tank.\u201cYou don\u2019t spend your life making a creation \u2014 be it a painting or a farm or a family \u2014 for it to disappear when you die,\u201d she told Ms. Attiyeh. Having no heirs, she left the farm, now 84 acres with about 50 animals, to her manager, Dwayne Nichols.Lydia was the oldest of five children, one of whom died in infancy; another sibling, William, who was known as Tony, died in 2016. Besides her brother John, she is survived by a sister, Alexandra Richardson.Ms. Ratcliff attended the Putney School in Vermont and Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania; when her family moved to Italy, she spent her junior year in Paris at the Sorbonne. She finished college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.Ms. Ratcliff did emerge with some bedrock financial principles, such as always paying cash and never wasting anything. Still, the hardships of farming left her struggling.\u201cThat is not a disadvantage,\u201d she added. \u201cI think it is more admirable to be poor than rich. I enjoy having no money more than having a lot of money. Or I should say, I certainly was not happier with a lot of money. I am my own boss.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Revives Concerns About European Defense Plans, Rattling NATO Allies", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisMUNICH \u2014 After years of encouraging European nations to work together to provide more of their own defense, the United States is having second thoughts, driven by concerns about NATO and possible protectionism in defense industries.The new American skepticism has been the big surprise of the high-level security conference held this past week in Munich. And it has puzzled and disconcerted NATO officials, who have welcomed the European Union\u2019s new commitment, after the Russian annexation of Crimea, to do more for its own defense.Only last November, American and NATO officials embraced the bloc\u2019s plans, under a program called the Permanent Structured Cooperation on Security and Defense, or Pesco, to spend more money on defense and to do it more efficiently, on national programs that would enhance European combat capacity and reduce overlapping national equipment that does not always work together with those of other allies.The European Union created a defense research fund to provide 5.5 billion euros ($6.8 billion) a year in financing after 2020, a relatively modest sum, but one that could grow. As a psychological breakthrough, Pesco and the fund \u201cmark a cultural revolution in Brussels,\u201d the French defense minister, Florence Parly, said at the Munich conference.The German defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, said \u201cWe want to remain trans-Atlantic but also more European,\u201d on defense, so that Europeans can shape the international order. The German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, declared that Europe needed a common \u201cpower project\u201d to avoid remaining a \u201cvegetarian with a lot of problems in a world of carnivores.\u201dBut in the past few days, American officials have raised new questions and doubts about these European plans, expressing concerns that they could weaken the NATO alliance and cut out United States military manufacturers from bidding on certain European projects.Last week, the American ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, warned that Washington did not want Pesco or a new European Defense Fund \u201cto be a protectionist vehicle for E.U.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to watch carefully, because if that becomes the case, then it could splinter the strong security alliance that we have,\u201d she added, referring to NATO.\u201cWe are supportive of it, as long as it is complementary to and not distracting from NATO\u2019s activities and requirements,\u201d Ms. Wheelbarger said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see E.U. efforts pulling requirements or forces away from NATO and into the E.U.\u201dWhile applauding the new European Union initiative, he said, \u201cI also highlight that we need to avoid duplication\u201d between the Europeans and NATO.\u201cThis is not about an alternative to NATO,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is about strengthening the European pillar within NATO.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important for Europeans to state again and again that this is not competition for NATO or an alternative to NATO,\u201d he added. \u201cSome doubts remain.\u201dWhen pressed, Mr. Stoltenberg said that European efforts must be coherent with NATO goals for equipment needed to enhance capability, European assets must be available for NATO operations and not reserved for particular European ones, and there should be \u201cthe strongest possible synchronization\u201d with NATO members who are not members of the bloc, \u201cbecause the E.U. cannot defend Europe by itself.\u201dNATO members that are closer to Russia, like Poland, have also expressed concerns that a European Union defense initiative could pull resources away from NATO toward other missions, like France\u2019s expeditions against jihadists in North Africa.One senior NATO official, who insisted on anonymity because he is not authorized to speak on the issue publicly, expressed confusion and puzzlement over the sudden shift. The official said these random comments, as he described them, reflected a lack of understanding by the White House of the European project, and he put them down to Mr. Trump\u2019s long-held belief that America\u2019s allies take advantage of the United States on trade.The American concerns seemed exaggerated, the official said, noting that the European Defense Fund represents less than 1 percent of the bloc\u2019s budget and less than 1 percent of member nations\u2019 current military spending.Daniel Fiott, a defense expert with the European Union Institute for Security Studies, a research group, said that he was \u201csurprised to hear the return to the language of duplication, which we thought we had put behind us.\u201d Looking at the early projects for Pesco, he said he saw no duplication with NATO\u2019s.The real task is getting Europeans to spend more efficiently and usefully on defense, he said, given the threats from Russia. \u201cBut the E.U. is incapable of creating a competitive structure to NATO,\u201d he added.This conference of trans-Atlantic security experts is the best place for Washington to reassure European allies and send them messages, as Vice President Mike Pence did last year, asserting Mr. Trump\u2019s support for NATO and the principle of collective defense, analysts say.But this year, only Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, spoke for the administration, and he said little about Europe. Mr. Mattis and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, did not speak publicly at all.That would be short of the goal of all members spending 2 percent, but it represents significant progress, especially if the money is spent more efficiently and cooperatively.To that end, the Obama administration had urged Europe to take more responsibility for itself, with the former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, Victoria Nuland, saying that the problem was not a strong Europe but a weak one.Mr. Daalder said that the failure to deliver a clear American message of support for Europe was a mistake. The United States should have welcomed the European initiative and increased spending as \u201ca plus for burden sharing\u201d instead of creating friction, he said.\u201cBut President Trump and his administration have made it clear that they see a world of competitors, not allies,\u201d Mr. Daalder said. \u201cThey have made it clear they don\u2019t want a strong Europe, but see Europe as a competitor, which can only please Russia.\u201dThe traditional strength of the United States is that it has allies, Mr. Daalder said, \u201cwhile Russia and China have clients.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a defense expert with the European Union Institute for Security Studies. He is Daniel Fiott, not Flott.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind a Key Anti-Labor Case, a Web of Conservative Donors", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the summer of 2016, government workers in Illinois received a mailing that offered them tips on how to leave their union. By paying a so-called fair-share fee instead of standard union dues, the mailing said, they would no longer be bound by union rules and could not be punished for refusing to strike.\u201cTo put it simply,\u201d the document concluded, \u201cbecoming a fair-share payer means you will have more freedom.\u201dThe mailing, sent by a group called the Illinois Policy Institute, may have seemed like disinterested advice. In fact, it was one prong of a broader campaign against public-sector unions, backed by some of the biggest donors on the right. It is an effort that will reach its apex on Monday, when the Supreme Court hears a case that could cripple public-sector unions by allowing the workers they represent to avoid paying fees.One of the institute\u2019s largest donors is a foundation bankrolled by Richard Uihlein, an Illinois industrialist who has spent millions backing Republican candidates in recent years, including Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois.Tax filings show that Mr. Uihlein has also been the chief financial backer in recent years of the Liberty Justice Center, which represents Mark Janus, the Illinois child support specialist who is the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case.And Mr. Uihlein has donated well over $1 million over the years to groups like the Federalist Society that work to orient the judiciary in a more conservative direction. They have helped produce a Supreme Court that most experts expect to rule in Mr. Janus\u2019s favor.The case illustrates the cohesiveness with which conservative philanthropists have taken on unions in recent decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to look at the Janus case and earlier litigation as isolated episodes,\u201d said Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a Columbia University political scientist who studies conservative groups. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a multipronged, multitiered strategy.\u201dIn doing so, these donors have not just brought labor to the brink of crisis but threatened the Democratic Party as well.Amid changes in the campaign finance landscape and the decline of private-sector unions, the party and its candidates have increasingly relied on major public unions for funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect spending during the 2016 presidential cycle. Those unions include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, whose Council 31 is the defendant in the Janus case.And that is clearly on the mind of Republicans. In a recent interview, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, acknowledged the potential of the Janus case to hurt Democratic fund-raising for the coming midterm elections. \u201cIn states where they got rid of the automatic deduction and employees figured they could keep their own money, they did,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it could have an impact.\u201dConservative groups aren\u2019t alone in locking arms to advance an ideological agenda. For decades, liberal donors and foundations, sometimes working together through coalitions like the Democracy Alliance, have promoted liberal goals in a variety of ways. Some backed groups, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, that used litigation to move American society leftward.But the extent of the coordination on the right often dwarfs liberal efforts. Especially on the state level, conservative groups are \u201cdoing different things, mobilizing different constituencies,\u201d Mr. Hertel-Fernandez said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all working with one another. You don\u2019t see the same thing on the left.\u201dAs the percentage of unionized private-sector workers has collapsed in recent decades, public-sector unions, which have held steady in the mid-30s since the early 1980s, have increasingly become a target.Conservatives chafe at the unions\u2019 political influence, which they believe not only props up the Democratic Party but also drives up government spending and skews public policy on issues like education.In seeking to produce similar results nationally, conservative donors have created a symbiosis between groups aiming to overturn Supreme Court precedent favorable to unions and groups that take advantage of those rulings to drain unions of members.The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation of Wisconsin, which had over $800 million in assets in 2016, has funded both kinds of organizations.Then in 2016, the court heard a case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, that could have struck down fair-share fee requirements for all public employees represented by unions in more than 20 states, including California, Illinois and New York. The case was brought by a group that has received millions of dollars from the Bradley Foundation.Richard Graber, the chief executive of the Bradley Foundation, said the foundation avoided short-term tactical considerations in its giving. But he acknowledged that the increase was driven partly by the recent Supreme Court developments, which promised to make such opt-out campaigns more compelling for union members. (Some conservative groups are currently raising money for even more ambitious opt-out campaigns to take advantage of a favorable ruling this year.)In February 2016, the month after the Supreme Court heard the Friedrichs case, Justice Antonin Scalia died, depriving conservatives of a decisive fifth vote to strike down mandatory union fees. That gave the Liberty Justice Center, backed by Mr. Uihlein, a chance to try again.Few philanthropists have funded a more sweeping assault on labor than Mr. Uihlein, who with his wife, Elizabeth, founded a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company called Uline.Mr. Uihlein is an ardent conservative who considers many Republican office holders too moderate on fiscal and social issues, according to those who know him.\u201cIt\u2019s not just politics for him,\u201d said his friend Leonard A. Leo, the Federalist Society executive vice president, who declined to offer specifics on Mr. Uihlein\u2019s views. \u201cI think he is philosophically attuned to conservative ideas,\u201d added Mr. Leo, whom the Trump White House enlisted to shepherd the Supreme Court nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch, Justice Scalia\u2019s successor.The Uihleins have spent tens of millions of dollars over the past decade supporting Republican candidates and committees. That includes contributions to super PACs backing the 2016 presidential campaigns of Mr. Walker and Mr. Cruz, and at least $250,000 to help Mr. Walker survive a 2012 recall election. (Mr. Uihlein did not respond to a request for comment.)Mr. Rauner has been a major ally in the fight against public-sector unions. Shortly after taking office in 2015, he challenged the constitutionality of mandatory union fees in federal court.By the time a judge ruled that Mr. Rauner lacked standing for his lawsuit, the Illinois Policy Institute, which drew more than one-third of its $5.8 million in revenue that year from Mr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation, had found a viable plaintiff to replace him: Mark Janus. The Liberty Justice Center and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which Mr. Uihlein also contributes to, represented Mr. Janus in court.Since then, the policy institute has sought to persuade state employees to leave their union through its mailing campaign. It said it had obtained employees\u2019 names through Freedom of Information Act requests.At the center of this network is a longtime conservative activist named John Tillman, who serves as the chief executive of the Illinois Policy Institute as well as the chairman of the Liberty Justice Center and Think Freely Media.In an interview, Mr. Tillman, who managed a call center earlier in his career and talked up his \u201cmarketing-centric approach\u201d to promoting free enterprise, said the institute is fighting the enormous power of union leaders but is not anti-union per se.\u201cIn the late 1800s, early 20th century, business owners had all the power, and workers had very little power,\u201d he said. \u201cUnions and collective bargaining emerged as a way to level the playing field. I think it was an amazing story of success.\u201dBut in other contexts, Mr. Tillman has been less conciliatory.In a fund-raising solicitation by the policy institute in December, Mr. Tillman claimed credit for helping more than 2,600 workers leave their union, resulting in a loss of $1.2 million in union revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Illinois to throw off the shackles of big labor and big government,\u201d he wrote.\u201cWhen you and I look around Illinois and see the devastation the union-dominated status quo has inflicted,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe simply have no choice.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Without Steve Wynn, Casino Empire Risks Losing More Than a Name", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the chief architect of modern Las Vegas, and a visionary who didn\u2019t understand the meaning of subdued, Steve Wynn spent more than three decades luring visitors to the Strip with his opulent hotels, fantasy-filled casinos, fine dining experiences and luxe shopping.But now, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is: What is the $18 billion Wynn Resorts casino and hotel empire without Steve Wynn?Hours after an unscheduled meeting of Wynn Resorts\u2019 board of directors on Tuesday, Mr. Wynn, a 76-year-old billionaire, suddenly resigned as the chairman and chief executive of a casino conglomerate that stretches from Las Vegas to Boston to Macau.With pressure mounting on his lucrative business operations, including a half-finished $2.4 billion casino resort near Boston, and with shareholder lawsuits and various investigations clouding his future, Mr. Wynn said he was stepping down because of \u201can avalanche of negative publicity.\u201dHe denied the allegations, calling them \u201cpreposterous.\u201d And in his statement Tuesday evening, Mr. Wynn did not admit to any wrongdoing.A Wynn Resorts spokesman said Mr. Wynn was not available for comment Wednesday.On Wednesday, shares in Wynn Resorts rebounded by jumping 8.6 percent, as Wall Street investors hoped that Mr. Wynn\u2019s surprise departure would stave off any significant licensing or regulatory fallout.But on Wednesday afternoon, members of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission said it would not halt its investigation of Mr. Wynn and his company, noting that he continued to hold stock and could exert influence over the company and its brand.The commission is determining the suitability of Mr. Wynn and his partners to hold the lone license awarded to build a casino in eastern Massachusetts. The luxury resort is on track to open in June 2019.\u201cA central question is, what did the board of directors and staff know, and when did they know it, about the settlement and the associated allegations?\u201d said Stephen Crosby, chairman of the commission. He was referring to a settlement reported by The Journal in which Mr. Wynn allegedly paid $7.5 million to a former manicurist.\u201cThat\u2019s a critical point for us and for the public of Massachusetts to know ASAP,\u201d Mr. Crosby added.While the various investigations continue, it is unclear how Wynn Resorts will proceed without its longtime leader.Matt Maddox, the company\u2019s president since 2013, was named Mr. Wynn\u2019s replacement. Mr. Maddox joined the company in 2002 after working in corporate finance for what is now Caesars Entertainment.Billy Vassiliadis, chief executive of R & R Partners, the firm that markets Las Vegas for the city\u2019s Convention and Visitors Authority, said Mr. Wynn was \u201can idea generator.\u201d\u201cNone of us in this world are irreplaceable,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Vassiliadis said. \u201cBut that kind of raw imagination is pretty rare.\u201dFrank Fahrenkopf, a former Republican National Committee chairman who founded the American Gaming Association and is a close friend of Mr. Wynn\u2019s, said he had not talked to Mr. Wynn about the decision. But he added that he could not imagine others forcing the mogul to step down.\u201cI know him well enough to know no one\u2019s going to come in and say, \u2018You built this company, but we think you should resign,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fahrenkopf said.\u201cThis thing wasn\u2019t getting any better,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were moving in Massachusetts. There\u2019s discussions about what could happen in Macau. He decided it was in the best interests of the company, the shareholders, to step down. This was a decision that Steve made on his own.\u201dWynn Resorts is not the first corporation or entity to confront the thorny predicament of a megastar leader\u2019s becoming embroiled in controversy.Before the celebrity businesswoman Martha Stewart went to prison in 2004 on charges of obstruction of justice, she stepped down as chief executive of her publicly traded company. But she continued to wield influence at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in a creative director role as she worked to improve her image by talking openly about her time in prison and the plight of the other inmates.Mr. Vassiliadis, whose firm is famous for the What Happens Here Stays Here campaign, believes the Wynn brand can succeed even without its namesake.\u201cThe product they have stands apart from the man, and the Wynn brand stands for luxury and service,\u201d he said.Given the nature of the allegations against Mr. Wynn and the growing power behind the #MeToo movement, the company could face a consumer backlash if his name remains a prominent part of it.If moral outrage builds, it may make sense for the company to simply move quickly and come up with another name for the properties, said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\u201cIf they decide they are going to do it, then they should rip the Band-Aid off and just do it,\u201d she added.But removing Mr. Wynn from the Wynn empire is easier said than done.He is likely to maintain an awkward, physical presence at Wynn, given that he maintains a residence at the villas of the Wynn hotel. Many of Wynn Resorts\u2019 top executives were handpicked by Mr. Wynn and, many analysts suggested, remain loyal to him, raising the possibility that other leaders could depart.Mr. Wynn\u2019s shoes \u201cwill not be easy to fill,\u201d Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong, wrote in a note on Wednesday. \u201cWhile, theoretically, the old adage that everyone is replaceable may be generally true, the Wynn dynamic is much more complicated and uncertain. Steve Wynn is WYNN (the company).\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the chairman of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.

{"Headline": "Steve Wynn Is Accused of Rape and Coercion in Police Reports", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA woman told the police that she had a child with the casino mogul Steve Wynn after he raped her, while another reported that she was forced to resign from a Las Vegas job after she refused to have sex with him.The Associated Press on Tuesday obtained copies of police reports recently filed by the two women about allegations dating to the 1970s. The police in Las Vegas said this month that they had taken the statements after a news report in January revealed sexual misconduct allegations against the billionaire.Mr. Wynn has vehemently denied the misconduct accusations the newspaper reported, and he attributed them to a campaign led by his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, whose lawyer has denied that she instigated the news article.In one police report obtained by The A.P., a woman told police officers that Mr. Wynn raped her at least three times around 1973 and 1974 at her Chicago apartment. She reported that she became pregnant and gave birth to a girl in a gas station restroom.In one instance, the woman claimed that Mr. Wynn pinned her against the refrigerator and raped her. She said he then made a phone call, kissed her on the cheek and left. The report does not explain how Mr. Wynn would have entered the apartment or whether they had known each other. The woman said she did not give him a key.In the second police report, a woman told the police that she had consensual sex with Mr. Wynn \u201cseveral times\u201d while she worked as a dealer at a downtown Las Vegas casino-hotel called the Golden Nugget, but \u201cfelt coerced to perform the acts.\u201d She reported that she was forced to resign when she turned him down.The women\u2019s names are redacted on the reports, and the police said they did not identify people who said they were victims of sex crimes.The Las Vegas case will not be investigated because the statute of limitations in Nevada is 20 years.Ralph Frammolino, a spokesman for Mr. Wynn, on Tuesday declined to comment on the latest allegations.Wynn Resorts is also facing scrutiny by gambling regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts, where the company is building a $2.4 billion casino outside Boston. Regulators in Macau, the Chinese enclave where the company operates two casinos, are also inquiring about the allegations.In addition, groups of shareholders have filed lawsuits in state court in Las Vegas accusing Mr. Wynn and the board of Wynn Resorts of breaching their fiduciary duties by ignoring what the lawsuits described as a longstanding pattern of sexual abuse and harassment by the company\u2019s founder.Advertisement"}

Both times, Jacobellis, the most accomplished athlete in the sport\u2019s history, stumbled in the semifinals, leaving without a medal.Twelve years later, most of them spent dominating the World Cup circuit, she was back in the Olympics championship race, called the Big Final.Again she left without a medal \u2014 by 0.03 seconds.Jacobellis finished fourth, missing the medal stand by about half the length of a snowboard. She led the final race midway through the curling course of rises and jumps but was passed on the bottom half. She avoided a crash near the finish line and came across a fraction of a second behind Eva Samkova of the Czech Republic, who won gold four years ago and bronze this time.Michela Moioli of Italy won the gold medal, and Julia Pereira de Sousa Mabileau of France earned silver.Friday\u2019s race on a sunny afternoon at Phoenix Snow Park felt far removed from 12 years ago, except that the memory of that slip-up in Turin has followed Jacobellis throughout her career. It spikes every four years at the Olympics, where she is rarely celebrated for her consistency atop the sport, for her world championships, World Cup and X Games victories, as much as remembered for one unforced error as a 20-year-old.She has a \u201cvery strong love-hate relationship\u201d with the Olympics, she said last fall.In 2006, Jacobellis had a big lead in the final and, on the second-to-last jump, added a stylish flourish that pulled her off balance before she crashed into the snow. A competitor raced past before Jacobellis recovered for second place.Jacobellis, 32, had the fourth-fastest time in the morning\u2019s qualifying heats, where riders compete alone against a clock to secure seeding for the group races.She cruised to a first-place finish in her quarterfinal heat. She got out front fast and, aided by early wipeouts behind her, sailed to the finish just in front of Canadian Tess Critchlow.She glided in similar fashion with a second-place finish in her semifinal heat. That put her right back where she was 12 years ago \u2014 out front again.But leads are rarely safe in snowboard cross. She was passed by one rider on a midcourse jump, then another on the subsequent curve. Another slipped past on the final series of jumps, and Jacobellis could not make it up.There was no fall. There was no big mistake. There was just a four-time Olympian heading out of the finish area as three women less-decorated in the sport celebrated their new prizes.Advertisement"}

He earned the slightly mocking nickname of \u201cPutin\u2019s cook.\u201dDespite his humble, troubled youth, Mr. Prigozhin became one of Russia\u2019s richest men, joining a charmed circle whose members often share one particular attribute: their proximity to President Vladimir V. Putin. The small club of loyalists who gain Mr. Putin\u2019s trust often feast, as Mr. Prigozhin has, on enormous state contracts. In return, they are expected to provide other, darker services to the Kremlin as needed.\u201cThe Americans are very impressionable people; they see what they want to see,\u201d the Russian state news agency Ria Novosti quoted Mr. Prigozhin as saying on Friday. \u201cI have a lot of respect for them. I am not upset at all that I ended up on this list. If they want to see the devil, let them see him.\u201dMr. Prigozhin\u2019s critics \u2014 including opposition politicians, journalists and activists, the United States Treasury and now the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 say he has emerged as Mr. Putin\u2019s go-to oligarch for that and a variety of sensitive and often-unsavory missions, like recruiting contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine and Syria.\u201cHe can fulfill any task for Putin, ranging from fighting the opposition to sending mercenaries to Syria,\u201d she said. \u201cHe serves certain interests in certain spheres, and Putin trusts him.\u201dThe most notorious venture linked to Mr. Prigozhin, however, is the troll farm that is accused of attacking opposition figures in Russia and seeking to magnify and aggravate social and political divisions in the West. Despite his frequent denials of any involvement, his critics say he and others like him provide a way for the Kremlin to engage in such activities while maintaining a discreet distance.The indictment on Friday says, among other charges, that Mr. Prigozhin frequently met in 2015 and 2016 with Mikhail I. Bystrov, the top official in the troll factory, which ran a disinformation campaign called Project Lakhta that by September 2016 had a monthly budget of $1.2 million.Boris L. Vishnevsky, an opposition member of the city council in St. Petersburg, who has called for an official investigation into threats by Mr. Prigozhin against journalists, said the Kremlin endorsed projects like the troll farm without directly organizing them.\u201cThis is done by somebody who receives large-scale government contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he gets these contracts is a hidden way to pay for his services.\u201dWhen the troll factory was formed in 2013, its basic task was to flood social media with articles and comments that painted Russia under Mr. Putin as stable and comfortable compared to the chaotic, morally corrupt West. The trolls soon branched into overseas operations focused on Russian adversaries like Ukraine and the United States.\u201cNeither Concord Company nor other structures owned by the businessman are in any way connected with the activities directed toward meddling in the U.S. election,\u201d RBC quoted one of Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s representatives as saying.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, also denied any Kremlin connection to the Internet Research Agency.Despite Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s veil of secrecy, limited details about his personal life have emerged, mostly through the Instagram accounts of his two grown children.One picture featured his son, Pavel, walking naked on the deck of the 115-foot family yacht. Other pictures showed a private jet and a vintage powder blue Lincoln Continental, said to be Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s favorite car.His daughter Polina posted a picture of the sweeping view from his wooded compound in Gelendzhik, the resort town on the Black Sea. The compound, including a pier for the yacht, was built in an ostensibly protected forest much beloved by Mr. Putin and his cronies, according to the Anti-Corruption Foundation.Delovoy Peterburg, an independent daily newspaper published in St. Petersburg, listed him last year as ranking 83rd among the city\u2019s 304 ruble billionaires, with 11 billion rubles, or almost $200 million. The newspaper included only property in the public record, said Irina Pankratova, an investigative reporter. If all property linked to him had been counted, she said, he would rank in the Top 5.An old rust bucket that he and his soon-to-be-jettisoned partners converted to the floating New Island Restaurant became St. Petersburg\u2019s most fashionable dining spot.Eventually, Mr. Putin himself showed up, towing world leaders. He hosted President Jacques Chirac of France and his wife in 2001 and President George W. Bush in 2002. President Putin celebrated his own birthday there in 2003.During these glittering occasions, Mr. Prigozhin made sure to hover nearby, sometimes even clearing empty plates.In just the past five years, Mr. Prigozhin has received government contracts worth $3.1 billion, the Anti-Corruption Foundation reported.Some Russian contract soldiers in Syria were back in the news this month after a Feb. 7 clash between Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, and Syrian government forces aided by Russian mercenaries. Reports about exactly what happened remain murky, but anywhere from five to 200 Russian soldiers have been reported killed. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday confirmed five deaths, but has refused to confirm that it has contract soldiers fighting in Syria, fueling anger among the families of those fighting about the lack of information.It has always been difficult to find his fingerprints directly on any of these shadowy firms, said Denis Korotkov, a reporter for Fontanka. The only clues are the companies\u2019 overlapping ties, including the same managers, shared telephone numbers or IP addresses.After studying this material, Fontanka and the Anti-Corruption Foundation concluded in 2016 that significant government contracts were going to clusters of fake companies designed to circumvent federal rules on competitive bidding.State regulators also reviewed eight Defense Ministry contracts won by businesses linked to Mr. Prigozhin and issued a stern rebuke in May 2017.Russian law mandates that any contract go to the lowest bidder, but the winning tenders were only a fraction lower than the rest. Otherwise the bids were virtually identical, the Anti-Monopoly Service said, calling the 2015 bids fixed.The government announced that it would not press charges.

{"Headline": "Meet Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa\u2019s New President and a Mandela Favorite", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Cyril Ramaphosa, who was sworn in Thursday as South Africa\u2019s president, recently did what many politicians do at pivotal points in their careers.He released a book.The book told of one of his passions \u2014 his love for a Ugandan breed of royal cattle that he imported to South Africa at great expense. Anticipating criticism of his wealth in a country where millions still live in shacks, Mr. Ramaphosa argued at his book launch that the cattle were not meant as trophies for the elite like him, but to help struggling black farmers in South Africa.Mr. Ramaphosa is a business tycoon, one of South Africa\u2019s wealthiest men. To many here, he represents a kind of royalty of the African National Congress, an upper class that has grown removed from the average South African that the party still claims to champion.Yet he vows that as president he will work for the ordinary citizen, root out the country\u2019s debilitating corruption and convince a highly skeptical public that, under him, the governing African National Congress can whittle away at the gaping inequality that has enraged millions of citizens.As a union organizer decades ago, Mr. Ramaphosa founded the National Union of Mineworkers, winning mineworkers benefits and better working conditions. Years later, though, he switched sides and sat on the board of a mining company, drawing criticism for his role in a massacre of wildcat strikers.After being overlooked as Mr. Mandela\u2019s successor, he went into business and helped draft new policies to expand a black entrepreneurial class. But Mr. Ramaphosa never shied from using his political ties to accumulate vast wealth for himself, and over the years, critics have said the program rewarded only a small class of black South Africans with ties to the A.N.C.\u201cFor those who were hoping that Ramaphosa would return to the A.N.C. as a new broom, sweeping the party clean with a barnstorming assault on its corrupt establishment, years of disappointment lay ahead,\u201d wrote Ray Hartley, a journalist, in his book, \u201cRamaphosa: The Man Who Would Be King.\u201dBut to Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s supporters, he was, as always, playing the long game \u2014 waiting to succeed Mr. Zuma and accumulate the power he needs to change South Africa.Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa was born in 1952 in Johannesburg, to a police sergeant and a domestic worker. He became politically active in high school and was arrested on charges involving leading a student protest while in college. He served 11 months in solitary confinement in a Pretoria prison.After earning a law degree, Mr. Ramaphosa became a labor organizer, turning the National Union of Mineworkers into the nation\u2019s biggest trade union. He rubbed shoulders as easily with South Africa\u2019s white oligarchs as with the men he represented.After the apartheid government lifted the ban on the A.N.C. and freed Mr. Mandela in 1990, Mr. Ramaphosa, just shy of 40, became the party\u2019s secretary general. Under Mr. Mandela, he played a critical role in negotiating the peaceful transition from apartheid to democratic rule in 1994, and he also helped draft the new Constitution.Influential A.N.C. leaders who had been in exile successfully pushed one of their own, Thabo Mbeki, to succeed Mr. Mandela. So Mr. Ramaphosa left politics for business, though he remained closely involved with the A.N.C.He quickly became one of the most prominent members of the new black elite. He sat on many corporate boards and acquired interests in many sectors \u2014 including mining, finance, South Africa\u2019s McDonald\u2019s restaurants and Coca-Cola bottling plants \u2014 where his high-level ties to the A.N.C. proved useful.He was involved in drafting the new Black Economic Empowerment program, aimed at encouraging the growth of a black entrepreneurial class and skills. Still, in 2012, Mr. Ramaphosa spoke of the slow economic improvement among black South Africans since the end of apartheid.Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s ties to a mining company, Lonmin, made him, in the minds of many South Africans, the symbol of an A.N.C. elite that had lost touch with its base \u2014 a sellout, some said simply.When Mr. Zuma made him the nation\u2019s deputy president in 2014, Mr. Ramaphosa became the heir apparent to South Africa\u2019s presidency.More troubling to many was that Mr. Ramaphosa publicly supported his boss or stayed quiet, even when Mr. Zuma drew criticism for the kind of corruption Mr. Ramaphosa decries. In photos, he was often seen standing next to Mr. Zuma, a wide smile across his face.By then, Mr. Zuma was openly backing his former wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to succeed him as party leader. Like her husband, Ms. Dlamini-Zuma espoused economic populism, pushing for the need for \u201cradical economic transformation.\u201d She called for transferring slices of South Africa\u2019s economic pie from whites to blacks; Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s emphasis was on growing the whole pie.In recent weeks, Mr. Ramaphosa chipped away at Mr. Zuma\u2019s support with an undeniable argument: The prospects of the party and its members would be better in a government led by Mr. Ramaphosa. Sticking with Mr. Zuma would be bad \u2014 for everyone \u2014 in the next elections in 2019.Like all good negotiators, Mr. Ramaphosa no doubt found points to make. Identified with South Africa\u2019s urban and business elite, he visited rural areas and traditional leaders, including Mr. Zuma\u2019s home province of KwaZulu Natal.Perhaps he even handed out copies of his new book, \u201cCattle of the Ages,\u201d in which he ruminates on how he, a city boy, learned late in life the spiritual value of cattle and of his ancestral village, Khalavha, in rural northern South Africa.As he grew up in the city, \u201cthe only encounter I had with cattle was buying meat at the local butchery,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa wrote.\u201cBut I guess in every man is his father, and his father\u2019s father, and his father before that \u2014 and so it always goes. Somewhere in the depths of my soul is the connection my father had with his cattle, the hills of Khalavha and his people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Unlikely Youth Revolution at the Paris Opera", "Date": "2018-02-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis was not just for show. It was a dramatic way of highlighting the Paris Opera\u2019s extraordinary success in attracting younger audiences. According to the company, it had 95,000 audience members younger than 28 last season \u2014 more than 10 percent of tickets sold and 30,000 more than just two years before.The company, which celebrates its 350th birthday next year, is an unlikely contradiction to the worldwide trend of an aging audience at operas. The average age of an audience member in Paris is 45 \u2014 48 for the opera, 43 for the ballet \u2014 compared with 58 at the Metropolitan Opera and 54 at the Staatsoper in Berlin. The largest segment of the Houston Grand Opera\u2019s audience is between 65 and 72.When St\u00e9phane Lissner was appointed as the Paris Opera\u2019s general director in 2014, he set about implementing measures focused on fostering younger attendance.\u201cThe absolute enemy of any opera is routine,\u201d said Mr. Lissner \u2014 who, for the record, is 65. \u201cYou have to find your public by taking risks.\u201dBuilding on two existing programs that gave discounts to young ticket buyers and bringing in new sources of individual donations, foundation funds and corporate sponsorship, Mr. Lissner established preview performances for people younger than 28. The tickets to these cost 10 euros and now account for 30,000 seats each season.Mr. Lissner said that 56 percent of people attending these previews, financed by the BNP Paribas Foundation, were first-time operagoers. On top of this, four performances each year, with inexpensive tickets, are designed for families new to the opera.Last year Thibaud Freund, 27, and his wife, L\u00e9a Sowinski, 26, went to the opera and ballet \u2014 Paris unites the two in a single organization \u2014 five times, two of which were under-28 preview performances. They said that the company\u2019s discount programs allowed them to attend more than they otherwise could.\u201cYou have to be very reactive to get hold of a limited number of places,\u201d Mr. Freund said. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, though, is that the seats are not in a single section. You might find yourself in the Orchestra or the Dress Circle, which would generally be out of our price range.\u201dMs. Sowinski pointed to the increasing innovation of the productions, particularly for the ballet. \u201cThe sets are more modern,\u201d she said, \u201cand also the dances, which now often use electronic music.\u201dIn 2015, the company, with funding from Swarovski and individual donors, began producing edgy short films and marketing them online as the \u201c3e Sc\u00e8ne\u201d; the name refers to the digital space as a \u201cthird stage\u201d in addition to Paris\u2019s other two, the 19th-century Palais Garnier and the newer Op\u00e9ra Bastille. About 50 films have been produced so far, and they have been viewed nearly 3 million times.Among the most popular has been \u201cNephtali,\u201d directed by the American animator Glen Keane, who came to Paris to make a study of a young ballet dancer. \u201cFigaro,\u201d a short black-and-white film by Bret Easton Ellis and inspired by \u201cThe Barber of Seville,\u201d is about a hunky opera singer who loses his voice and recovers it after a night of freewheeling debauchery. The young filmmaker Cl\u00e9ment Cogitore combined music from Rameau\u2019s Baroque opera \u201cLes Indes Galantes\u201d with footage of krump, a style of hip-hop dance. (Mr. Cogitore will direct \u201cLes Indes Galantes\u201d onstage next year.)\u201cWhat I think was a mistake at the opera was for many years to persist with a number of productions which were locked into purely vocal performance,\u201d Mr. Lissner said. \u201cToday\u2019s spectators are looking for more than that. They want to experience something theatrical as well. That\u2019s what brings young people to the opera.\u201dAs part of the celebrations of its 350th anniversary and the efforts to expand its audience, the Paris Opera has formed its first partnerships with other major French cultural institutions, including the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, the Pompidou Center and the National Library of France. The exhibition \u201cDegas \u00e0 l\u2019Op\u00e9ra\u201d will open at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in September 2019 and travel to the National Gallery of Art in Washington.\u201cFor the Degas exhibition alone, I hope there\u2019ll be about 700,000 to 800,000 visitors,\u201d Mr. Lissner said. \u201cWe believe that it and other exhibitions will help the Paris Opera to be considered by people who are more accustomed to visiting museums.\u201dParis is not the only success story: 39 percent of those booking tickets at the Royal Opera in London are now 40 or younger. But the challenge worldwide grows ever starker as companies attempt to secure audiences who are approaching opera \u2014 if they approach it at all \u2014 with ever less familiarity.Matthias Schulz, 40, the incoming general director of the Staatsoper Berlin, acknowledged that one of the biggest obstacles needing to be overcome to attract more young people to the opera is \u201cto work on reducing this fear there is of entering an ivory tower.\u201d\u201cPrejudices,\u201d he added in an email, \u201carise, as many young people are simply not familiar with opera and classical music and have nobody who can introduce them to this art form.\u201dThat is why Mr. Schulz, who begins his tenure in April, plans to introduce an Opernkinderorchester (Opera Children\u2019s Orchestra) in cooperation with music schools across Berlin. The first concert will take place on the company\u2019s main stage next year. He also plans to create a so-called opera reporter program for teenagers, who will be taken behind the scenes of rehearsals and performances and be allowed to report on them.\u201cOf course we are hoping to spark their passion for opera and for them to become advocates within their peer group,\u201d Mr. Schulz said.Mr. Lissner said he was happy that in Emmanuel Macron, France now has a young president who is a confirmed classical music lover \u2014 not always the case with his recent predecessors. Mr. Macron, who received a diploma in piano studies, has spoken in interviews of his admiration for Rossini, Bach and Schumann (though he has yet to attend the Paris Opera during his presidency).\u201cIt creates a certain \u00e9lan,\u201d Mr. Lissner said, and referred to the terrorist attacks in Paris a few years ago. \u201cWe lived through some tragic events in 2015, but I think the country is beginning to get back on its feet again. We have a president who has made it very clear that he wants the country\u2019s institutions to reform themselves, the opera included. I think that can only be a good thing.\u201d\u201cWe have to progress,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s our obligation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Chengdu, Finding Peace in Parks and Heat in Cuisine", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerExploring one of China\u2019s most exciting, progressive cities on a budget.Pandas reside almost exclusively in central China, and while a handful can be seen in zoos worldwide, the research base in Chengdu, the thriving seat of China\u2019s Sichuan Province, is one of the only places to see dozens of the animals thriving in a pseudo-natural habitat. It\u2019s just one of many compelling reasons to visit. Despite being one of the country\u2019s largest cities, Chengdu has largely flown under the radar for the tourist set; deep in the heart of China, it\u2019s closer to Tibet than to Shanghai. After recently spending 10 days there over two trips, I can say that it\u2019s a fantastically exciting, progressive city, with plenty of museums and urban temples to explore, great shopping, as well as a famously spicy cuisine that will torch the careless.How to get there? I recommend Chengdu\u2019s clean, efficient subway system, and suggest you get used to taking it. The metro, which went into service in 2010, has been built with blinding, almost frightening, speed. There are now six subway lines in operation, meaning that a new one is added every 16 months or so in a city of more than 14 million people. Single-ride tickets vary based on distance, but expect to pay between 2 and 5 yuan when you ride. You\u2019ll also notice no one bolting down the stairs to make a train in Chengdu; there\u2019s almost always another one about three minutes behind.Taxis are also easy to hail in Chengdu, as are guys on motorbikes who will, for a fee, let you hop on the back and shuttle you to your destination. But I found that walking is the best way to get around Chengdu \u2014 the city isn\u2019t as hectic as Beijing or Shanghai, and it\u2019s a pleasant place to take a stroll. Wenshu has one other perk \u2014 a lively garden area where tea and vegetarian food is served. It\u2019s here that you can get a true sense of daily life in Chengdu. Purchase a package of tea from a small kiosk near the entrance (jasmine tea was 15 yuan) and grab a thermos of hot water and a bag of sunflower seeds or lightly sweetened peanuts (5 yuan, paid on the honor system). Show your tea receipt to a worker and they\u2019ll give you a ceramic cup with a lid. Find yourself a seat in the meditative environs and drink tea and munch on snacks to your heart\u2019s content. You\u2019ll notice dozens of locals doing the same while laughing, chatting and playing cards \u2014 this is typical Chengdu.Park life is essential in China, as it\u2019s one of the few ways to escape from the crush of urbanity that marks its major cities. People\u2019s Park is another great place to walk around, unwind and take in the sights and sounds of local life. You\u2019ll see exercise and singing classes in session, along with electronic meters displaying the current decibel levels (keeping it under 65 is recommended), as well as tea-drinking and ear-cleaning. That\u2019s right \u2014 men wearing headlamps wander around with cotton swabs on the end of long, metal rods, offering to clean out your ears. If you hear a repeating tinny clang, you know the ear cleaners are near.Street food, incidentally, has its drawbacks. If you\u2019re an adventurous eater, sometimes you get sick. One day on Dongsheng Street, near People\u2019s Park, I noticed some appealing-looking stacked metal containers outside one storefront. They were sputtering steam and brimming with soft, fluffy baozi (dumplings). I bought a bag of eight (6 yuan) and chowed down happily as I turned left on Ningxia Street. After I\u2019d inhaled three, I noticed something felt slightly off. I won\u2019t get into the details, but let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t find a place to solve the issue in time. It was a long, humbling walk home. The silver lining: Drugstores are plentiful in China (they\u2019ll sometimes have a green awning or ads for knockoff Viagra in the front), and the people who work there couldn\u2019t care less about your problems. Later that day, I went into one called Bai Xin Tang and announced, \u201cla duzi\u201d (diarrhea). The woman behind the counter scarcely looked up from what she was doing as she tossed me a box of pills (30 yuan).We opted for a whole hot-and-sour fish (qianyu, from Guizhou province, 129 yuan), tangy and flavorful, and slathered in bright orange chili peppers. As I popped one, and then another, of the blisteringly hot peppers into my mouth \u2014 primarily to demonstrate that I was a foreigner with an iron gut and unafraid of spicy local cuisine \u2014 one of my companions, Jasmine, looked at me quizzically. \u201cWhy are you eating all those?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey\u2019re just for flavor.\u201d Lesson learned.Advertisement"}

She was soon to move to New York, where \u201cI know it will be cold, but the sky will be blue,\u201d she said with a grin.But more important than the weather, Ms. Nicolas, 53, is now the executive vice president, global managing director of jewelry and watches at Sotheby\u2019s. The position was created for her, an indication of the auction house\u2019s enhanced focus on watch and jewelry sales.While Sotheby\u2019s performance in the art market has been strong \u2014 the auction house\u2019s Masters Week Sales series this month brought in $82.5 million, nearly twice as much as last year\u2019s \u2014 Phillips has been stealing its thunder when it comes to watches.\u201cSotheby\u2019s has been suffering the most among auctioneers since the entrance of Phillips in the watch auction business,\u201d William Rohr, former chief operating officer of Antiquorum auctioneers, said. \u201cThey are the one that lost the most market share in 2017, especially in Geneva. The attempt to sale the Patek Philippe Calibre 89 at their 2017 May auction in Geneva was a big flop.\u201d (Bids on the watch, considered to be one of the world\u2019s most complicated pocket watches, did not meet the $6.5 million reserve price.)Tad Smith, Sotheby\u2019s chief executive, sees Ms. Nicolas\u2019 hire as part of his strategy to change that, as, he said, \u201cThe watch market is one of the most global and fastest growing collecting categories.\u201dThe effort appears to be a work in progress; as Ms. Nicolas was being interviewed, Sotheby\u2019s issued a news release announcing that Sam Hines had been hired as its worldwide head of watches, snatching him from Phillips.Ms. Nicolas was asked, \u201cWill Mr. Hines serve under or over you?\u201d\u201cUnder me,\u201d she responded, with a wisp of a smile.Ms. Nicolas has earned the right to be proud, working her way up through the trenches of the luxury watch and jewelry business. Talking rapidly in fluent English \u2014 while apologizing for not speaking the language well \u2014 she described her birth in Madagascar, where her father directed veterinary services. The family later moved to Chad and then to Upper Volta. The experience, especially the years in Upper Volta, gave her an appreciation of \u201ccraftsmanship and the link between and human hand and a piece of art,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a poor country, the people had no money, yet they created beauty and enjoyed their daily life.\u201dWhen Ms. Nicolas came to France at age 16, she experienced some adjustment problems. \u201cI had been always barefoot, it was difficult for me to wear shoes,\u201d she said, adding that it was \u201cdifficult to accept the more conservative French culture and the less friendly people. Everything was different \u2014 the cold, the rain, even the food.\u201dAfter she earned a master\u2019s degree with a specialization in international finance from Neoma Business School in France, she got a job at what was then called Price Waterhouse, auditing Cartier and Piaget in the days before they became part of the Richemont luxury group.In 1990, Cartier invited her to reorganize its product service operation. \u201cEvery client, when they enter the service center, is disappointed. They have a problem or they wouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d she said. \u201cI learned a lot about the luxury client and their expectations, which are very high. People buy jewelry and they think it will last forever. But gold can be scratched; a stone can come loose.\u201dCartier sent Ms. Nicolas to the United States as its vice president of marketing and merchandising. But while she was delighted to be in New York, \u201cI was torn between my profession and my family,\u201d she said. \u201cMy two kids couldn\u2019t join me. \u201cI cried every night.\u201d Six months later she returned to France, to manage the Cartier flagship on Rue de la Paix.There, she said, she learned the world of retail. \u201cWhat I discovered is there is a triangular connection between the brand, the product and the client,\u201d she said. \u201cThe key linking them is the sales associate. Not the top executives. The sales associate needs to know everything about the product.\u201dIn 2001 Ms. Nicolas was lured away by Christian Dior Couture, where she began working with its jewelry division and, in 2008, added timepieces \u2014 becoming the chief executive of Dior Timepieces & Fine Jewelry.Christian Dior, who founded the fashion house in 1946, \u201chad no real jewelry, only costume jewelry,\u201d Ms. Nicolas said. So, with Victoire de Castellane as the jewelry division\u2019s creative director, \"we created jewelry with real stones and French craftsmanship to express the essence, the femininity, full of colors, of the myth of the princess.\u201dMs. Nicolas directed a major upgrade of Dior watches \u2014 moving the brand \u201cfrom watches that cost 1,000 euros to 10,000 euros\u201d \u2014 by buying up and destroying all existing stock, replacing it with luxury watches with higher-quality movements and some studded with gems.Finally, Sotheby\u2019s came calling and, \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in the auction business, we share the same customer, the same passion.\u201d In her new role she will be working with digital formats, \u201cfinding different ways of thinking about auctions\u201d and developing the current online efforts, she said.She also has been charged with improving the house\u2019s efforts to educate the public. Digital improvements also will be the key there.For example, she said, \u201cwe might have a superb expert like David Bennett\u201d \u2014 Sotheby\u2019s worldwide chairman of the international jewelry division \u2014 \u201cbecome a digital ambassador\u201d and provide online lessons.Twilight arrived, adding a tinge of blue to the unrelenting gray of the sky, and Ms. Nicolas prepared to head back to the office. As she put on her coat and wrapped a scarf around her neck, she talked about how New York will provide not only clear skies, but a more international populace less steeped in tradition.\u201cGrowing up in Africa, I never really felt French,\u201d she said, so she\u2019s not sad to be leaving, but is, instead, full of anticipation for the New World that awaits her.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Clinics to Child Insurance, Budget Deal Affects Health Care", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The budget deal in Congress is billed as a measure to grant stability to a government funding process that has lurched from crisis to crisis \u2014 but it is also stuffed with provisions that will broadly affect the nation\u2019s health care system, like repealing an advisory board to curb Medicare spending and funding community health centers.Many of the provisions have been in gestation for months, even years in some cases. Some will save money. Many will cost money \u2014 potentially a lot of money.Among the more significant provisions is one that would eliminate a powerful 15-member panel, known as the Independent Payment Advisory Board, created by the Affordable Care Act to control the rising costs of Medicare.President Barack Obama and his first budget director, Peter R. Orszag, as well as some health economists, championed the board as one of the most significant cost-control provisions in the 2010 health law. The board was to recommend specific savings if Medicare spending per beneficiary was projected to grow faster than certain benchmarks. Congress could have stepped in to block the recommendations, but they did not need congressional approval to take effect.The power of the board gave pause to politicians in both parties, and health care providers and some advocates for Medicare beneficiaries said it could threaten patients\u2019 access to care. President Trump and other Republicans singled out the panel as a symbol for much that was wrong with Mr. Obama\u2019s health law.The benchmarks that were to set off the Medicare recommendations have yet to be met, and the board members have never been appointed. Nevertheless, the board has been seen as a threat. The House passed a bill in November to eliminate the board, by a lopsided vote of 307 to 111, and 76 Democrats joined Republicans in trying to kill the panel.Now, under the budget deal, it would be eliminated.The Congressional Budget Office estimated that killing the panel would increase federal spending by $17.5 billion over 10 years.\u201cThe board\u2019s unprecedented authority to alter Medicare policy could ultimately reduce seniors\u2019 access to health care and put the government, rather than the patient, at the center of the health care system,\u201d said Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota.The budget bill also spends money. It provides $3.8 billion for the current fiscal year and $4 billion for 2019 to fund community health centers \u2014 up from $3.6 billion last year.Community health centers have long had strong bipartisan support, but funds were allowed to expire at the end of September. As a result, some health centers have had to curtail services, freeze hiring or put off purchases of equipment.The increase in funds was a victory for Republicans like Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri and Elise Stefanik of New York and Democrats like Senator Jon Tester of Montana and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.The clinics care for more than 27 million people, regardless of patients\u2019 ability to pay. \u201cThey provide incredibly affordable and efficient health care,\u201d especially in big rural states like Montana, Mr. Tester said.The bill also includes an additional four-year extension of funds for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, from 2024 through 2027, on top of a six-year extension that Congress approved last month.Nearly nine million children are insured by the program, which has had bipartisan support since its creation in 1997.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, pushed for the longer extension after the Congressional Budget Office said it would actually save money \u2014 by keeping people out of health insurance exchanges, which would be more expensive to the federal government.The bill would provide some relief to Medicare beneficiaries with high prescription drug costs who hit a gap in coverage known as the doughnut hole. Drug manufacturers would be required to give larger discounts to beneficiaries in the coverage gap, starting in 2019.\u201cManufacturers of branded medications will face much higher liabilities in the Medicare coverage gap,\u201d said Daniel N. Mendelson, the president of Avalere Health, a research and consulting company. \u201cThis change could have a multibillion-dollar impact on some large pharmaceutical companies.\u201dAt the same time, health insurance companies would see their costs in the coverage gap decline.Stephen J. Ubl, the president and chief executive of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main lobby for brand-name drug makers, denounced this change, saying it \u201cprovides a massive bailout for insurance companies\u201d and undermined their incentives to control Medicare drug spending.To help offset the cost of new spending in the bill, Congress would take some money from a fund established by the Affordable Care Act to pay for public health initiatives such as preventing diabetes, heart disease and cancer.The bill would also increase premiums for Medicare beneficiaries with income of more than $500,000 a year ($750,000 for couples filing joint returns).In addition, the bill would make it easier for states to eliminate Medicaid coverage for some low-income people who hit the jackpot in lotteries. Under current Medicaid rules, income received as a lump sum, such as lottery winnings, is counted as income only in the month when it is received. Lottery winners may lose Medicaid for a month, but then reapply and, in some cases, qualify for coverage at a later date.Republicans said that Medicaid was created to help low-income people, not high-dollar lottery winners. The Congressional Budget Office said the number of people losing Medicaid because of this provision would be modest, no more than 10,000 in any month, out of more than 70 million people enrolled in Medicaid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump\u2019s Speech Says About His Mental Fitness", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "Advertisement\nAs part of the discussion about Donald Trump\u2019s lack of fitness for the presidency, some have argued that his linguistic capacities have worsened, suggesting significant cognitive decline.In interviews in the 1980s and 1990s, Mr. Trump speaks in complete sentences, using mature vocabulary and expressions. There aren\u2019t the endless digressions that make his current mode of expression a kind of vocal fantasia. America has certainly never experienced a commander in chief who expressed himself in this fashion. In public, at least.However, the distinction between public and private speech is key here, so I am unconvinced that his current speech patterns can be analyzed as evidence of dementia. Instead, they\u2019re characteristics of casual speech as it has always existed.It is easy to forget how much casual speech in general differs from writing. We tend to imagine our speech is tidier than it often is. The complete sentences and logical throughlines of writing are a stylization of speech, rather than a mirror image.Take this famous Trump utterance from July 2015.This passage also has a kind of coherence. Mr. Trump starts out addressing the nuclear deal with Iran, but then interjects some insights about his elevated qualifications for discussing the subject and his resentment of a purportedly biased media that forces him to mention them \u2013 and then he does get back to the nuclear subject. Elegant? No, but not demented, either. Facial expression and context, which print obscures, made Mr. Trump\u2019s meaning clear.NuclearUncleIntelligenceRepublicansDemocratsRepublicansIntelligenceRepublicansNuclearNuclearUncleIntelligenceRepublicansDemocratsRepublicansIntelligenceRepublicansNuclearTwo and three decades ago, Mr. Trump spoke to David Letterman and Rona Barrett in the quietly composed phrasing we expect of public figures expressing serious thoughts. So why does the same man now toss off word salad?Because he can.The younger Mr. Trump, albeit as self-obsessed as now, was not yet a rock star, and he had a businessman\u2019s normal inclination to present himself in as polished a manner as possible in public settings. Especially as someone who grew up in the 1950s, when old-school standards of oratory were still part of the warp and woof of American linguistic culture, Mr.  Trump instinctually talked \"up\" when the cameras were rolling. To him, cloaking his speech in its Sunday best would have been part of, as it were, being a gentleman.However, for him this would always have been more stunt than essence. Since he is someone who neither reads nor reflects, his linguistic comfort zone has always been the unadorned.At a certain point, Mr. Trump became the man who felt \u2013 and was comfortable saying publicly \u2013 that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and retain his supporters' allegiance. Someone with that mind-set, especially a sybaritic person unaccustomed to sustained effort,  has no impetus to speak in a way unnatural to him in public.Mr. Trump is equally unmoved by any sense that to speak as a president is a kind of kabuki or performance art, in which one doesn\u2019t so much talk as signal. He has learned that he can just show up and run his mouth, and he\u2019ll be adored regardless.Some suppose Mr. Trump started talking down deliberately in order to portray folksiness. But this imputes to him a sociological sensitivity, a reflective, outwardly focused theory of mind, that he shows no evidence of otherwise. More likely, Mr. Trump has simply taken the path of least resistance.Note, for example, another difference between the younger Mr. Trump and today\u2019s: comfort. In those old interviews he is a more buttoned-up person, obviously somewhat wary of the eyes upon him. Now, he revels in the attention as if he\u2019s the paterfamilias at the head of a Thanksgiving dinner table. The articulate Mr. Trump of yore was wearing a linguistic tuxedo; today\u2019s swivel-tongued Mr. Trump is in a linguistic track suit.The difference between the younger man talking in sentences and the older one talking in vocal ejaculations is evidence not of decline but authenticity \u2013 he has settled into his normal. Late in life an artless man has learned that he could leave his linguistic fly unzipped and life would go on. It may not be pretty, but it isn't a sign that his pants are going to fall down.Video: CBS; C-SpanAn earlier version of this article misstated the year of a speech in which Donald Trump made a digression about his education and an uncle at M.I.T.

That was 106 years ago, and since then it has been reincarnated many times \u2014 renamed, repurposed, rehabilitated. Now known as the Helen Hayes Theater, the smallest house on Broadway is about to reopen yet again, this time run by a nonprofit, becoming the sixth of today\u2019s 41 Broadway theaters to operate outside the commercial marketplace. A city landmark, the theater, at 240 West 44th Street, has a new look that reflects the contemporary aspirations of Second Stage and the simple benefits of modernization. Long said to have the worst dressing rooms on Broadway, the Helen Hayes has been renovated to remedy that situation, as well as to expand the bathrooms substantially, enable access for those with disabilities and add better equipment for maneuvering sets.The remodel is by the architect David Rockwell, who is also a Broadway set designer. He has sought to preserve the building\u2019s history (for example: molding that depicts angels holding garlands) while adding what he calls \u201ccontemporary language.\u201d The most visible example is the design of the theater\u2019s side walls, which he has covered with a pixelated blue ombr\u00e9 riff on a Fran\u00e7ois Boucher tapestry depicting Bacchus and Ariadne \u2014 a nod to a set of fabric reproductions of Boucher tapestries that once adorned the theater walls.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to look like the other theaters,\u201d said Carole Rothman, Second Stage\u2019s longtime artistic director, \u201cand we don\u2019t think it does.\u201dWinthrop Ames, a wealthy producer, director and playwright, built the Little Theater, in 1912, as an elegant and intimate playhouse, with no balcony, 299 seats, a ticket price set at a steep $2.50, and the goal of creating \u201ca place of entertainment for intelligent people.\u201d The building, designed in a neo-Georgian style, with a red brick facade, by Ingalls & Hoffman, was a visual contrast with the more ornate Beaux-Arts and classical theaters that dominated Broadway. And it had some unusual features, including a custom-designed seat up front to accommodate J.P. Morgan. Its first play was a comedy, \u201cThe Pigeon,\u201d by John Galsworthy; President Woodrow Wilson was an early patron.In 1920, a balcony was added, increasing the theater\u2019s capacity to about 600.The New York Times purchased the building in 1931, but continued to lease it for the presentation of plays until 1941. The building was then renamed The New York Times Hall, and used for newspaper events and television broadcasts. The building was sold again in 1962, and in 1963 it reopened as a theater, with a production of \u201cTambourines to Glory,\u201d by Langston Hughes. But in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it returned to television \u2014 Merv Griffin\u2019s show was among those broadcast from there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Oil to Solar: Saudi Arabia Plots a Shift to Renewables", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Life in Saudi Arabia has long been defined by the oil that flows from the kingdom. Over decades, the vast wealth it pumped out paid not just for gleaming towers and shopping malls but also for a government sector that employs a majority of working Saudis.Now, Saudi Arabia is trying to tie its future to another natural resource it has in abundance: sunlight.The world\u2019s largest oil exporter is embarking, under Prince Mohammed bin Salman, on an ambitious effort to diversify its economy and reinvigorate growth, in part by plowing money into renewable energy. The Saudi government wants not just to reshape its energy mix at home but also to emerge as a global force in clean power.Reaching that goal is a big if. But the strategy is finally making progress after fits and starts.Riyadh on Monday tapped ACWA Power, a Saudi energy company, to build a solar farm that would generate enough electricity to power around 40,000 homes. The project will cost $300 million and create hundreds of jobs, according to Turki al-Shehri, head of the kingdom\u2019s renewable energy program.By the end of the year, Saudi Arabia aims to invest up to $7 billion to develop seven new solar plants and a big wind farm. The country hopes that renewables, which now represent a negligible amount of the energy it uses, will be able to provide as much as 10 percent of its power generation by the end of 2023.\u201cAll the big developers are watching Saudi,\u201d said Jenny Chase, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a market research firm.\u201cThe country has made grand plans and pronouncements, but various bodies within it have failed to agree on the new way forward,\u201d Ms. Chase added. She referred to the agreement as \u201cthe first step in creating what is widely expected to be a major market.\u201dSaudi Arabia has talked a big game when it comes to renewables. It adopted ambitious targets for green power several years ago, but no major projects were carried out, and little changed. That is not unusual.The country\u2019s biggest solar farm in operation covers a parking lot of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, here in Dhahran. Lying just a couple of miles from a fenced-off area honoring the country\u2019s first commercially viable oil well, it generates enough power for a nearby office block.Still, the experiment with solar power has been an important catalyst, and the company built a team of experts in renewable power. The experience helped Saudi Arabia focus on conventional solar panels over another system, known as concentrated solar, in which mirrors focus sunlight to create heat.Mr. Shehri, who had worked at Aramco before leading the kingdom\u2019s renewables program, said he faced an \u201cextremely challenging\u201d task. Meeting Saudi Arabia\u2019s targets would require contracts for a series of new facilities to be awarded by the end of 2020. \u201cThe only way this was possible,\u201d he said, \u201cwas because we have done previous work.\u201dSaudi Arabia, with its vast oil resources, would seem an unlikely champion for renewables. But the country\u2019s location and climate mean it has plenty of promising sites for solar and wind farms.The costs of installing and operating those two technologies have fallen drastically around the world in recent years. That means that even in a country where oil is plentiful, renewables beckon as a cheap, and clean, alternative to traditional fossil fuels.For the project announced on Monday, Riyadh received bids for the solar farm, which will be built in Sakaka, in northern Saudi Arabia, that rivaled the lowest ever submitted at auctions anywhere. At 2 to 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, a wholesale measure of electricity, solar power here would be below the cost of fossil fuel-generated electricity, Mr. Shehri said.\u201cJust look at the prices,\u201d Ms. Chase said. \u201cThat is why they are doing it.\u201dA big push into wind and solar power would also have other benefits, notably allowing Saudi Arabia to sell more of its oil.Selling oil internationally is central to funding the Saudi budget. The terms of the Sakaka project\u2019s auction required that developers pay the upfront cost of the solar farm, in return for payments for the power they supply to the grid. That would allow Saudi Arabia to continue focusing on producing and exporting oil while it makes the shift to cleaner power.In the 1920s, the area surrounding the Aramco offices here was little more than a series of rocky hills. But then a team of American geologists discovered crude, and everything changed.Dhahran is now home to the headquarters of one of the world\u2019s most advanced and prolific energy companies, with a series of research laboratories, training centers and even a golf course on site. What had been a scattering of small towns is now a major metropolitan area housing around four million people.A major plank of the crown prince\u2019s plan to transform the Saudi economy involves finding jobs for young people. Attracting investment into what is essentially a nonexistent sector in the kingdom, Mr. Shehri said, would mean \u201ccreating jobs, creating manufacturing.\u201dStill, despite the ambitious goals and positive language, the process by which Saudi Arabia has looked to expand its wind and solar capacity has raised concerns.Analysts have pointed in particular to how Saudi leaders have chosen their preferred companies. When Riyadh produced a short list of two firms for the Sakaka project this month, it passed over one that had presented a lower bid than the finalists, leaving some experts worried about the transparency of the bidding process.Local-supplier requirements might also deter some bidders. Mr. Shehri insisted that companies interested in the Sakaka project agree to spend 30 percent of the costs on domestic suppliers and expected that proportion to rise in subsequent bidding rounds. Many companies may find it difficult to justify building factories in Saudi Arabia just to construct one power plant.The Saudi market\u2019s sheer size, however, means it merits the attention of the world\u2019s renewable energy companies. Paddy Padmanathan, the chief executive of ACWA Power, which also has other energy projects in the region, predicted in an interview last month that once the country\u2019s energy authorities became comfortable with renewables, they would ramp up their goals for wind and solar power production.\u201cMost of what they will procure going forward, I am convinced, will be renewables,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of homes a new solar farm in Saudi Arabia would be able to power. The figure is around 40,000, not up to 200,000. The error was repeated in a capsule summary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How \u2018Lolita\u2019 Freed Me From My Own Humbert", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveIt was my uncle who gave me my first copy of \u201cLolita.\u201d My father had refused to buy it for me at the bookstore we often visited together.\u201cWhy that book?\u201d my father said as he and I arrived home.\u201cI just want it.\u201d We removed our shoes at the door, where religious superstition required all things unclean to be left. \u201cI wanted to read it.\u201dI was 15, a sophomore in high school, and had learned of \u201cLolita\u201d from an English teacher who had summarized the plot, citing it as an example of unreliable narration.My uncle knew the basics \u2014 the trope of the precocious girl, the Japanese fashion subculture, the heart-shape glasses \u2014 but he had not actually read the novel when he gave it to me as a gift a few weeks later, after I told him my father wouldn\u2019t buy it.My uncle liked to buy me gifts both little and lavish: what my parents could not afford, what they forbade me to have. The benefactor role made him feel as if he were filling gaps that my parents\u2019 conservatism had left in my life.So in whichever hotel room we were staying that night (with me tucked into bed, conned out of clothes), he tossed me the forbidden paperback and said, \u201cYou\u2019d better hide this. Your mother will have a fit if she sees you reading it. You know she doesn\u2019t trust you like I do.\u201dHe issued this warning even though I hid everything from my mother, as he had trained me to do. He knew that to groom girls you must erase mothers. I knew he had groomed girls before me from the tragic stories he told of Indian girls he had been with in England, stories in which he remembered himself as more savior than predator. I didn\u2019t know their names, but across his years of abuse we formed a tight-lipped sisterhood, our silence keeping him out of jail.I wanted to read \u201cLolita\u201d because I believed it would mitigate my sexual shame. The similarity between the novel\u2019s plot and my day-to-day life had sent me on a Google search, where I read excerpts and watched trailers of both film adaptations, categorized under \u201ccrime,\u201d \u201cdrama\u201d and \u201cromance.\u201d Until then it had never occurred to me to consider my relationship with my uncle under any of those genres. That anyone could think us a romance nauseated me, while crime and drama seemed overblown.He came into my life when I was 12 and he was 53, a close family friend in a country \u2014 the United States \u2014 where my family had few relations. Childless himself, married to a mystery woman, he became my uncle in the routine way I was taught to call Indian men \u201cuncle\u201d and Indian women \u201cauntie.\u201dHe was also a progressive voice in my conservative household, sympathetic to the \u201cAmericanness\u201d in me that my mother viewed as dangerous, especially regarding sex. While my friends were getting birds-and-bees talks, my mother prohibited tampons. I did not know what a menstrual period was until I got mine. Womanhood was far-off, a state of emergency that befell other people. We operated as if men did not exist.But I had curiosities and crushes, and I came to confide these to my uncle over the handful of day trips and conversations it took him to secure my trust, and for me to love him, as briefly I did, as a girl can come to love a man who is like a father to her.Under the false pretense of his wife joining us, he turned our day trips into overnights. On weekends he drove us into Manhattan, delivering me to acting classes and then picking me up for dinners and Broadway plays.Although I was taught to accept nothing from anyone, he bought me a wardrobe of risqu\u00e9 women\u2019s clothing and warned that rejecting his gifts would be ungrateful. At an age when I considered myself invisible to men, he found gratification in pointing out when a man on the street looked at me. I gazed at myself in the mirrors of the ritzy hotels where we stayed in rooms so extravagant that I was self-conscious about taking up space. Manhattan hotel rooms became Boston hotel rooms became Connecticut hotel rooms became seaside resorts and other locations I have worked diligently to forget.I did not acknowledge that the cost of his care was molestation. To acknowledge that would make it true, so I accepted his explanations that what he did to me was either universal or imaginary, and that my pain was a product of my own tearful hysterics.\u201cCalm down,\u201d he would say, his large, damp hand resting on my thigh. \u201cEveryone is taught how to do this, how to kiss. I don\u2019t get any pleasure from it. You\u2019re mischaracterizing things.\u201dI ran with this theory, of myself as an unreliable narrator.When I began attending a Catholic girls high school, a world of women materialized. My parents believed an all-girls education would put me on the path to an Ivy League college without the distraction of boys and their gazes.To function as a schoolgirl, I cordoned off the memories of the other life I led, a life dictated by the gaze of a middle-age man. Instead, I dreamed of growing up and getting away from him. When, during a car ride, I spoke about my hopes for college, he promised to get an apartment wherever I attended. He dreamed I would come home to him after class and live with him like a surrogate wife.I wept, devastated by the prospect of a future without exit. At the intersection he kissed my forehead, apparently mistaking my tears for joy.Over time it became harder to deny the reality of the abuse, but still I felt I could tell no one. Exposing my uncle would ruin him, and I considered myself too unimportant to upend a grown man\u2019s life. So I endured, pushing my family away and pulling my uncle close, and, I hoped, past suspicion.I felt as if I were growing into two identities, the woman I was and the woman-as-object eclipsing her. And in \u201cLolita\u201d I found a strange validation: that there was glamour to be had as an object of desire. If a pedophile\u2019s gaze could be normalized and even beautified, then perhaps I could normalize and beautify my own situation. It was easier to digest an image of myself as a nymphet than to confront the reality of my victimhood.Over time, the novel became more than a coping mechanism; it became a guide. I came to see how Lolita uses Humbert\u2019s obsession with her as a means to gain power over him. In the blue kidnapping car in which the two travel cross-country, she uses this power to accuse him of rape, of being a \u201cdirty man.\u201d While Humbert fumbles to justify booking one hotel room for them both, she names their situation for the incest it is. She knows she is Humbert\u2019s vulnerability and learns how to use herself against him.Eventually, so did I.The winter I first read \u201cLolita,\u201d my uncle was trying to remain in my mother\u2019s good graces, hoping he could convince her to appoint him as my legal guardian if tragedy ever struck. He was thrilled by the growing friction between my mother and me, fights precipitated by the sexy way I had started to dress and by her suspicion that I sneaked around with college men after school, which I did. His abuse had made me promiscuous to the point of recklessness, grateful for the simple fact that my body could still want. And I found that the more I wanted other men, the less I was willing to tolerate him.When he surprised me with an apartment he had rented for us near my school, I told him, for the first time, that I hated him, that he was as much a pervert as the man in the book. And once the accusations began, I could not stop. Although he already helped to finance my school fees, I also demanded envelopes of money, determined to be ungrateful, to exact collateral. Over dinners I told him about men I had been with and what we had done, at which point he would set aside his plate and moan that he had lost his appetite.It would be a few months before I reached my breaking point and exposed him to a schoolteacher, someone I knew would be legally bound to report him.Soon after, at the police station, I supplied an affidavit. I sat in a roomful of officers who prompted and recorded me through an incriminating phone call with my uncle, the contents of which were then played back to him after his arrest, after he had dismissed the molestation charges as my \u201cmischaracterizing things.\u201dI had not mischaracterized. The story I told was neither unreliable nor glamorous, and it didn\u2019t belong to him. It was, and is, mine.Bindu Bansinath is a senior at Columbia University and was an intern for the 2017 Modern Love college essay contest.modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

For Mr. Selinger, then 46 years old and a manager at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, it was the salad. He had just picked it up for lunch at the cafeteria on the 43rd floor, and was heading back to his office in the World Trade Center to eat it when terrorists exploded a 1,200-pound bomb in the basement parking garage at 12:18 p.m., killing six people in an attack that would foreshadow Sept. 11, 2001.As Mr. Selinger waited, holding a handkerchief over his face, his rescuer, Sgt. Timothy Farrell of the New York Police Department, was rappelling off a helicopter to the roof of the North Tower to spearhead rescue operations for some of the thousands of people who were trying to evacuate. Over the following hours, emergency workers, in conjunction with civilian elevator mechanics, would bring dozens of stuck elevators to platforms on floors.\u201cI may have freed 25 or 35 people from the elevators that day, but how I remembered Carl was the fact that he wasn\u2019t really physically upset, or emotional,\u201d Sergeant Farrell, now retired, said at the lecture, which brought the two men together publicly for the first time. \u201cHe was calm, he was jocular. And he talked about how he wasn\u2019t sure what happened \u2014 and how he had first started to eat the salad for lunch.\u201cSo of course it stuck with me.\u201d\u201cOn the one hand, you have people who will be quite resilient, and who will reflect on what could have happened but didn\u2019t, and try to get a life lesson or object lesson going, and try to use the event somehow in a positive way,\u201d Dr. Yehuda said. \u201cAt the other extreme are people who remain very frightened, very overwhelmed.\u201d And of course, there is a range of reactions in the middle, she said.For Mr. Selinger, humor has helped. \u201cHe was after my salad! That\u2019s the bottom line here,\u201d he said of the moment he was rescued 25 years ago, drawing laughs from an audience that included more than a dozen survivors of the 1993 and 2001 attacks.Mr. Selinger, an engineer who lives in Bloomfield, N.J., retired from the Port Authority in 1999 but continued to work as a consultant helping aviation and transportation companies.His worn goodbye letter to his wife and three children, which is on display in the museum as part of the 25th-anniversary commemoration, tells a more somber story of that day: one of a man taking stock of his life and focusing only on what\u2019s most important. \u201cI love you very much,\u201d he wrote to them. \u201cBe good. Do wonderful things in your life.\u201d\u201cI realized,\u201d she said, \u201cthat if you can get killed going to work, you\u2019d better really love your job.\u201dPerhaps the most important part of recovering from a trauma is finding meaning in it, Dr. Yehuda said.\u201cThe people who I have seen who truly come out the other side,\u201d she said, speaking of surviving trauma in general, \u201care the people who decide in some way to help other people get through similar events, or to make it count, or to make sure it isn\u2019t in vain. Making meaning of what happened, making the world a better place to counteract the bad: That is resilience.\u201d\u201cFor a long time after the 1993 bombing, I didn\u2019t want come down to Lower Manhattan, I didn\u2019t want to look at the World Trade Center,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s time.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 Stocks enter correction territory.\u2022 Qualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s revised offer.\u2022 Snap and Twitter: From also-rans to worthy contenders?\u2022 BlackRock is reportedly setting its sights on Berkshire Hathaway and the Blackstone Group.\u2022 A top WSJ editor heads to Lazard.\u2022 Brunswick Group has named Neal Wolin as its new C.E.O.The Dow Jones industrial average and S.&P. 500 went more the 400 days without a pullback of 5 percent.That streak ended this week, and on Thursday, the two indexes fell into correction territory, defined as a pullback of at least 10 percent from their high. For both, it is the first time they have crossed into a correction since early 2016.The Dow plunged more than 1,000 points Thursday, its second decline of more than 1,000 points this week. The S. & P. 500 dropped 100 points, its third decline of more than 100 points in its history.On a percentage basis, the Dow fell 4.15 percent, the S. & P. 500 dropped 3.75 percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.9 percent.The bigger pictureAnxieties about inflation have driven the much of decline over the past week and a half. The yield on the benchmark Treasury note climbed above 2.85 percent \u2014 its highest level since 2014 \u2014 for the second time this week. Higher yields can crimp economic activity by raising borrowing costs, while also making riskier assets like stocks less appealing to bonds.Many market watchers say that investors should not worry about the recent spate of volatility in the stock market. Such swings, they say, are normal. They point to strong corporate earnings and a strengthening economy both in the United States and abroad as reasons to be optimistic about stocks.Investor sentiment has reversed in recent weeks as the sell-off in stocks gained momentum.According to the American Association of Individual Investors\u2019 weekly survey, bullish sentiment, or the percentage of respondents that say stocks will rise over the next six months, declined to 37 percent. The drop ended a streak of eight straight weeks with bullish sentiment above its historical average of 38.5 percent.It began the year at nearly 60 percent, its highest level since 2010.The contextThe survey has proved to be a good contrarian indicator. That means overly bullish sentiment often signals that the stock market is ripe for a pullback, while overly bearish sentiment often indicates that market may soon rally.The chip maker said its board had rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised $121 billion offer.The reasons\u2022 \u201cThe Broadcom proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm.\u201d\u2022 The offer \u201cfalls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction.\u201dQualcomm said that it was willing to meet with Broadcom to see if its issues with the offer could be addressed.The contextQualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.Till this week, many investors wondered whether Snap and Twitter had much of a future at a time when Google and Facebook are sucking up such a large share of digital advertising dollars. But after Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even as they remain in the shadow of Facebook and Google.\u2014 Peter EavisBlackRock itself raises a different comparison, according to Sarah Krouse of the WSJ \u2014 to Warren Buffett:The \u201cbest known\u201d example of BlackRock\u2019s approach with this new vehicle is Berkshire Hathaway, according to a fund-raising document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Omaha conglomerate run by Mr. Buffett is well known for its long-term ownership of companies.BlackRock\u2019s Long-Term Private Capital fund would be a tenth of Berkshire\u2019s $101 billion in cash. But it too would look to buy and hold positions for more than 10 years. Over all, though, this seems more akin to private equity.The practice has grown on Wall Street with the rise of activist investors, with investment banks touting their defense capabilities to corporate clients.Before becoming finance editor at the Journal, Mr. Berman oversaw the paper\u2019s business coverage and was its M.&A. reporter prior to that.Mr. Berman, who will join as a managing director and be based in New York, will start on Feb. 26.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedAndrew, with a bit of contextDennis follows in the footsteps of Steven Rattner, who worked as a reporter at the NYT in the 1980s before going to work as a banker at Lazard and becoming an influential financier. (Today, Mr. Rattner overseas Michael Bloomberg\u2019s fortune.)Dennis was my fiercest reporting competitor over the last decade and is one of the most talented financial journalists in recent memory.Mr. Wolin, who will remain based in Washington, will take over from the London-based Susan Gilchrist, who will become chairwoman of Brunswick\u2019s global clients operations and focus on client work full time.Alan Parker, Brunswick\u2019s founder, said in a telephone interview of the move, \u201cIt reflects the growth of the business and the business opportunity in America.\u201dThe contextIn some ways, the appointment of Mr. Wolin reflects that trend. Beyond his time at the Treasury Department, he previously worked as a senior executive at The Hartford, an insurer. And he was previously a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration.\u201cIncreasingly, I think senior executives and boards of directors have come to understand that a lot of their challenges and opportunitiess sit at the intersection of business and governments and society and so forth,\u201d Mr. Wolin said in a phone interview.Or as Mr. Parker put it, \u201cMore and more we hear ourselves described as a critical issues business.\u201dOther moves at Brunswick\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe recent stock market freak-out may have abated, but the dynamics that drove the sell-off \u2014 worries that faster global growth and hotter inflation will trigger faster-than-expected rate hikes \u2014 are alive and well in the currency markets.On Thursday, the Bank of England raised its growth forecasts for the United Kingdom, and Mark Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said rates would likely have to be increased faster than previously expected.The British pound promptly popped by more than 1 percent against the dollar, and yields on British government bonds rose. Treasury bonds yields in the United States also rose, with the 10-year note offering yields of nearing 2.90 percent.The sight of bond yields nearing 3 percent should keep stock investors on edge amid the growing conviction we\u2019re moving out of the era of low-interest rates, which were such a key ingredient for the near-decade-long bull market in stocks.\u2014 Matt PhillipsThe bigger pictureWhat business cares about in the proposal:\u2022 Nearly $300 billion in additional spending over the next two years\u2022 $20 billion for infrastructure spending\u2022 A lifting of the debt ceiling until March 2019The agreement will cause federal budget deficits to grow even larger, on top of the effects of the sweeping tax overhaul that lawmakers approved in December. But because the deal gives long-sought victories to both parties, the deficit effect appears to be of little concern.Steve Wynn is gone. And Wynn\u2019s shares leapt nearly 9 percent on that news.The deals flyaroundThe money will help the nearly four-year-old Swiggy build out its tech platform, expand its network and cut its delivery times.Behind the dealFood delivery is taking off in emerging markets just as it is in developed ones \u2014 but is focused even more on restaurants that make food explicitly for these services.Naspers Ventures\u2019s chief, Larry Illg, told Michael that lessons from Swiggy\u2019s rise could help it with other investments, like Delivery Hero. \u201cThe players tend not to cross borders, but consumer behavior is the same everywhere,\u201d he said.The tech flyaround\u201cI literally feel like I just scored a decade\u2019s worth of guitar lessons from Elvis,\u201d Jonathan Bush, the company\u2019s founder and C.E.O., told Michael.The big questions\u2022 Is Mr. Immelt, whose successor at G.E. is trying to turn the company around after years of stagnation, the right man to chair Athenahealth?\u2022 Can a company founder take direction from an outsider?Yesterday\u2019s newsletter misspelled the surname of Slack\u2019s C.F.O.

The Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, continue to be filled with fantastic moments of inspiration, skill, teamwork and humor. For me, this week\u2019s highlight had to be the young women of the South Korean curling team. They\u2019ve become unexpected (and stylishly bespectacled) international stars.The team earned the nickname because the top four players hail from Uiseong County, a region known for its garlic. One of the country\u2019s first curling facilities was built there in 2006, and they began training together as a fun after-school activity.(A previous version of this article misstated Kim Chohi\u2019s nickname.)The Disney-Marvel movie featuring the superhero T\u2019Challa of Wakanda collected $218 million in North America over the Presidents\u2019 Day weekend. The previous domestic record-holder for a February release was \u201cDeadpool,\u201d with $159 million.The scholarship, established in 1902, is one of the most prestigious in the world, financing up to four years of postgraduate study at Oxford University in Britain. Until recently, the program was limited to students from a short list of countries. Even British students were ineligible to apply.The Patagonian national park network will encompass 10 million acres of lush forests, serene lakes and snow-capped mountains. The initiative is the brainchild of the American founders of the North Face and Esprit clothing companies, who began buying large areas of Patagonia in 1991.Hailu Mergia, 71, is a piano luminary from Ethiopia, where he led the Walias Band, one of the country\u2019s biggest groups. Until recently, he was hardly known elsewhere, and he had given up performing publicly. For most of the past 20 years, he\u2019s lived in Washington and driven a taxi.A 2013 reissue of \u201cHailu Mergia and His Classical Instrument\u201d turned him into a cult celebrity, and he\u2019s releasing a new album, \u201cLala Belu,\u201d on Friday. It\u2019s his first collection of new music in two decades, and the first aimed at a global audience.A new study in India, which is the world\u2019s seventh-largest producer of coffee, found that growing coffee beans in the Western Ghats region didn\u2019t affect biodiversity in the area. The beans are grown as bushes under the cover of larger trees. The tree cover provides a welcome habitat for all kinds of birds \u2014 as many as 204 species, some of them at risk.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Blood Sport Politics", "Date": "2018-02-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFor all those sour headlines about slumping ratings and player protests, the National Football League landed a dandy matchup for its marquee event. More than 110 million Americans will probably watch Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles. The contest will instantly become one of the most-watched programs in American history.Orwell noted that sports faded in prominence after the fall of Rome, only to surge again in the 19th century, in England and the United States, where games became \u201ca heavily financed activity, capable of attracting vast crowds and rousing savage passions.\u201d For Orwell, the rise of sports was bound up with the rise of nationalism, both of them examples of \u201cthe lunatic modern habit of identifying oneself with large power units and seeing everything in terms of competitive prestige.\u201dFans are apt to bristle at this assessment, among them most recent presidents, who look to sports as a folksy way of connecting to voters.President Barack Obama was especially fond of this jock populism. Not only did he fill out his March Madness brackets on TV, but he used his final public appearance in office to argue that sports played a major role in our nation\u2019s moral progress.Mr. Obama\u2019s earnest belief that sports \u201cspeaks to something better in us\u201d is a common trope among aficionados. They extol the grace and courage of favorite players, the ecumenical bonding experience of fandom, and especially those moments when a devotion to athletic prowess overpowers prejudice.But the current occupant of the Oval Office has given voice to a more primal, and frankly powerful, vision of sports, the same one Orwell identified seven decades ago: \u201cSerious sport has nothing to do with fair play,\u201d Orwell wrote. \u201cIt is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in violence.\u201dAnyone familiar with the president\u2019s Twitter feed \u2014 which has become both his bully pulpit and his confessional booth \u2014 would have a hard time disputing that his brand of politics exudes this sporting spirit.Mr. Trump is ruled by a lust for competitive prestige, which he achieves by bragging and stoking feuds. Like no other president before him, he has abandoned the Jeffersonian ideal of compromise in favor of the zero-sum game. For him to win, the other side must lose.It can be tempting to mock a leader who nurses his ego by gazing at a map of his \u201cmassive\u201d Electoral College victory. But Mr. Trump is president, in no small part, because he was able to exploit the sporting spirit within us.As Americans have become geographically uprooted and spiritually unmoored, they have turned to sports as a source of tribal identity, a primarily masculine refuge from the anxieties of adulthood, the lingua franca in a fragmented culture. The hours we spend consuming sports dwarfs the amount devoted to political activism, volunteer work, even religious worship.From the moment he began his campaign, Mr. Trump understood that most Americans have exchanged the burdens of citizenship for the pleasures of fandom. And he intuited that politics, for all its precious norms and pretensions, was at its root a blood sport.While his primary opponents droned on about policy, Mr. Trump dominated debates simply by trash talking. At rallies, he bragged about his poll numbers and urged partisans to pummel protesters. He mocked elitist losers and vowed to usher in an era of winning.Establishment Republicans yelped that he needed to pivot to a gentler, more inclusive tone. But in the end nearly all of them voted for Mr. Trump. They did so because of what political scientists call \u201cnegative partisanship,\u201d an ingrained hatred for the other party that is often entirely divorced from ethics or policy.Orwell would have seen in this pattern the infiltration of the sporting spirit into our political culture. The result is voters whose prevailing ethos boils down to the motto of Al Davis, the former owner of the Oakland Raiders: \u201cJust win, baby.\u201d Even if you need to suppress votes, or gerrymander districts, or get help from Russian agents to do it.A year into the Trump presidency, the news media continues to treat politics as a kind of wonky offshoot of the sports entertainment industry. Coverage of major bills focuses more on whip counts and the tallying of winners and losers than the consequences of legislation.The president, naturally, continues to exploit this tendency. He uses the news media to sow discord, to inflame warring cultural and racial factions in a manner designed to steadily erode the common good.Should any of the Patriots or Eagles choose to kneel during the national anthem, you can be sure our tweeter in chief will post a bilious squib aimed at inciting his fans against those with the gall to protest institutional racism on Super Bowl Sunday.President Obama lauded sports as a realm capable of \u201cchanging hearts.\u201d But he never quite grasped the relationship between our devotion to athletics and the cycle of escalating recrimination and intransigence in our realpolitik.Instead, we now have a leader who grasps, all too well, the ways in which our sporting spirit can be prodded to reveal the darkest precincts of our national soul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Ethical \u2018Dark Side\u2019: Harvard, Stanford and Others Want to Address It", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, in the wake of fake news and other troubles at tech companies, universities that helped produce some of Silicon Valley\u2019s top technologists are hustling to bring a more medicine-like morality to computer science.And at Stanford University, the academic heart of the industry, three professors and a research fellow are developing a computer science ethics course for next year. They hope several hundred students will enroll.The idea is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations \u2014 like autonomous weapons or self-driving cars \u2014 before those products go on sale.\u201cTechnology is not neutral,\u201d said Professor Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. \u201cThe choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications.\u201dBut until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning \u2014 computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Mr. Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-M.I.T. ethics course.\u201cA lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data,\u201d Professor Levy said. \u201cIf data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise.\u201dThe curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data \u2014 like whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records \u2014 to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Mr. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions like: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans?Some universities offer such programs in their information science, law or philosophy departments. At Stanford, the computer science department will offer the new ethics course, tentatively titled \u201cEthics, Public Policy and Computer Science.\u201dThe expectations for the course are running high in part because of Professor Sahami\u2019s popularity on campus. About 1,500 students take his introductory computer science course every year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Better Single-Payer Plan", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt comes from the Center for American Progress, the influential liberal research group (often known as CAP). The proposal would create a program called Medicare Extra through which any American, regardless of age, could buy health insurance.Substantively, the Sanders approach has a huge advantage: simplicity. But the experience of the last 25 years \u2014 across both Bill Clinton\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s presidencies \u2014 shows the dreadful politics of pushing people out of their current insurance plan. That\u2019s why Obama promised, \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d And why he got in so much trouble when the promise proved false.In the CAP plan, people who already have coverage \u2014 either through their job or a smaller federal program, like the military\u2019s Tricare \u2014 would decide whether or not to switch. Medicare Extra would ultimately become the country\u2019s biggest insurer, but the transition would be gradual and voluntary.And what about the proposal\u2019s cost? It would be large. The necessary money would come from two main sources.The first would be taxes, on corporations and the affluent. As one possibility, the plan mentions partially undoing the Trump corporate tax cut.\u201cWe simply can\u2019t finance universal coverage without lowering health care costs,\u201d Topher Spiro, CAP\u2019s vice president for health policy, told me. \u201cThe math doesn\u2019t work.\u201dUltimately, though, I still favor more modest health care proposals to sweeping, ambitious plans, for reasons of realpolitik. The next time the United States has a government interested in improving most Americans\u2019 lives, that government is going to have to choose a small number of big priorities. And I think the top priorities should be areas where Obama made significantly less progress than he did on health coverage \u2014 like climate change, income inequality, universal preschool or immigration.But this burst of health care proposals, including the one from Sanders, has done the important work of pointing the way toward a long-term goal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Republican Plan for Paid Leave Has Stirred Concern About Social Security ", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA proposal would allow people to collect Social Security after a birth, but there\u2019s a catch. Paid leave for new parents, long a Democratic cause, has become a Republican one, too. But policymakers don\u2019t agree on what a leave plan should look like. Now some Republicans have a new idea: Let people collect Social Security benefits early to pay for time off after they have a baby.\u201cHere you have a situation where women live longer, but they tend to live both sicker and poorer because of the caregiving they do,\u201d said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit that champions women\u2019s economic security. \u201cWith this proposal, we would be asking them to borrow against the already inadequate support they receive from Social Security.\u201d Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a supporter of the idea, said it would provide women with more financial security by encouraging them to stay in the work force after they have children. \u201cI think about those women that will leave the work force because that\u2019s their only option, and this provides them a way to take some time off, spend time devoted to their family and then return,\u201d she said. Three Republican senators \u2014 Ms. Ernst, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 announced this month that they supported the Social Security proposal, though they were still researching it and had not yet started writing a bill. Millions of retirees rely on modest checks from the program, which was created from a bill signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. Treating Social Security as something that can be borrowed against suggests that it can be treated as an individual account rather than a social insurance program. That could open the door to privatizing the accounts, some experts said, an idea that was floated during George W. Bush\u2019s administration. The proposal would also begin to reshape Social Security into something more akin to 401(k) accounts: Account holders can borrow against their 401(k), or even drain it in a financial emergency (albeit with a penalty), leaving them with less savings for retirement.Social Security, in contrast, cannot be touched and is often viewed as the last standing leg in the three-legged stool of retirement, when personal savings are not enough and pensions are increasingly rare. The size of the benefit would be calculated borrowing a formula from Social Security. A 26-year-old woman earning $31,000, for example, might receive roughly $1,175 a month in Social Security parental benefits, which replaces about 45 percent of her income, for up to 12 weeks. The proposal says that a parent\u2019s Social Security check would be delayed, not cut, to offset the amount gained during the paid leave. Yet many workers do not have a choice. And while life expectancies have increased, better-paid and more educated people tend to live longer than those who earn less. As of now, the proposal covers new parents but not workers who are recovering from an illness or need to care for other family members. It also does not provide job security for people who take leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act does both those things, but the leave is unpaid, and only about half of workers qualify for it.

All citizens of good conscience should call their representatives and senators \u2014 local, state and national \u2014 and demand legislation banning assault rifles and ammunition.If that doesn\u2019t work, in November vote for those who will end the control of the gun and ammunition manufacturers over the National Rifle Association and the control of both over our legislators. We need gun reform and campaign finance reform.We no longer need \u201ca well regulated militia\u201d or a citizen army. We have a very powerful military to protect us. Along with federal, local and state law enforcement, we are well beyond the need for militias.We have power as citizens. We have the vote. If we don\u2019t use this power, we have nobody to blame for the senseless violence other than ourselves.To the Editor:With several school shootings already in 2018, when will supporters of free access to assault weapons recognize their choice? They can protect their children or protect their guns. It is long past time to end this uniquely American tragedy.To the Editor:The saddest fact in all of this is that nothing will change. After all of the investigations into motives, investigations of the personality of the killer, looking at his postings on social media, talking to his friends and relatives, the one thing that will be ignored is that weapons designed exclusively for warfare, weapons whose specific purpose is to inflict as much damage to humans in as short a time as possible, are so readily available to the public.As long as our elected representatives blindly do the bidding of the National Rifle Association, such shootings will continue. It should be apparent that the real government of the United States isn\u2019t Congress, the presidency or the judiciary. It is the N.R.A., and changing that is a challenge no one wants to take on, regardless of how many Americans are slaughtered.To the Editor:We are steadily conditioning schoolchildren to be afraid that they will be murdered at school.How can children pay attention to learning when their minds are preoccupied by the fear of school attacks?What might we say about a society that values gun availability ahead of children\u2019s well-being?STANLEY FROUD, NEW YORKTo the Editor:I\u2019m tired, outraged and angry. The only way to fight fire with fire is to band together and establish a National Gun Safety Association as a counterweight to the National Rifle Association.Plenty of people like me support the Second Amendment, but millions of us also recognize the difference between a musket and an AK-47 or an AR-15, used by the Florida gunman.I promise to become the first card-carrying member of the National Gun Safety Association and will proudly display my bumper sticker.To the Editor:How about legislation requiring the buyers of semiautomatic rifles to obtain liability insurance? The insurance companies would profit from issuing the policies, but for their own financial protection, would carefully vet the applicants, declining to insure those who are inappropriate owners of such weapons, like the Florida shooter.How about limiting sales of bullets so that an individual cannot possess multiple magazines at one time? How about putting our heads together and solving this?To the Editor:While millions express horror about gun violence in this country, gun owners remain silent. Because if you do stand up and speak against gun violence, you might be seen as \u201cone of them\u201d \u2014 anti-gun folks who just don\u2019t get the Second Amendment.You, responsible gun owners, are the only voice left that can make a difference, the only ones who can put a stop to the madness. But you need to be outraged and not afraid to show it. You need to speak out, and you need to admit reality.You need to know that in doing so, you will not be less of a person, but more because admitting your outrage against children being shot in school shows that you are more.You will not appear weaker, but stronger, because standing up for what is right takes strength and courage, especially for gun owners like you who fear that speaking up will somehow diminish you in the eyes of other gun owners. It won\u2019t.To the Editor:If Sandy Hook did not change the minds of Republicans about an automatic weapon ban, the Florida shooting will certainly have no effect. Our only hope is for the Democratic Party to put forth a presidential candidate who fearlessly and relentlessly champions an assault weapon ban. The Democrats had better get it right this time. They have a lot to make up for.CARA SCHIRRMEISTER, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Time to do something serious about guns. Time to get some momentum on the scourge of gun deaths. Suggestion: What if celebrities and other public figures publicly turned in their guns? Imagine the impact. The moral courage could start a movement. It\u2019s time.To the Editor:You can keep your thoughts and prayers. Those of us who want to be safe at school, church, the movie theater, nightclubs and elsewhere in public apparently don\u2019t matter to lawmakers who continue to take the National Rifle Association\u2019s money and vote against common-sense gun laws.We need but will not get mandatory background checks, bans on automatic weapons, and prohibitions on where guns can be carried.My home state of Georgia has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country. Last year, Georgia lawmakers voted to allow open carry on college campuses. Mix immaturity, impulsivity and possibly alcohol or drugs. It\u2019s only a matter of time.Who is going to pay for the carnage caused by guns: medical bills for maimed victims, therapy for families and bystanders who\u2019ve been traumatized for life, loss of income for the injured and their families, funeral expenses, rebuilding of schools deemed too tainted to be used again?I propose that those who own automatic weapons should pay a stiff upfront tax at least the cost of the weapon as well as a yearly use tax. The money could go to fund the cost of the ever more frequent incidents of violence.SUSAN VENEZIA, JOHNS CREEK, GA.To the Editor:How many dead are required before Congress will give up the donations from the gun lobby and save the lives of innocent children, men and women?By failing to act, they are selling death. They should be ashamed.GEORGE CONTARSY, LAS VEGASAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Infrastructure Plan Is Light on Federal Funds, and Details", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s long-awaited plan for overhauling the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure includes spending $200 billion in federal money over the next decade to spur an additional $1.3 trillion in spending from cities, states and private companies on major projects, White House officials said on Wednesday, a formula that faces long odds on Capitol Hill.The increased infrastructure spending would be offset by unspecified budget cuts. Officials would not detail where those cuts would come from, or how the proposal would effectively leverage at least $6.50 in additional infrastructure spending for every dollar spent by the federal government, a ratio many infrastructure experts consider far-fetched. The officials said Mr. Trump would leave it up to Congress \u2014 where there is little consensus about how to pay for such a plan \u2014 to figure out the details, giving lawmakers wide latitude in creating what would need to be a bipartisan bill against the backdrop of the midterm elections.Asking a polarized Congress to hash out a complex and contentious plan could complicate an already steep climb for a proposal that was a pillar of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. That difficulty was underscored by a cool reception for Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal from Democrats and labor groups, longtime champions of boosting infrastructure spending, on Wednesday.\u201cThat\u2019s not a plan. That\u2019s a hope,\u201d said Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has lobbied for a large infrastructure bill. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of pathetic.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, one of several Democrats up for re-election this year in states Mr. Trump won, said Democrats were still waiting for the president to deliver on a campaign pledge to pour $1 trillion into rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cAccounting gimmicks don\u2019t build bridges,\u201d Mr. Brown said.An ambitious infrastructure program has been a frequent theme of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda since he took office. But despite repeated promises by White House officials and the president himself that such a plan was just weeks away, a detailed proposal has yet to be made public.An administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump would be open to virtually any bipartisan proposal from Capitol Hill that met his criteria of generating a total of $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending, speeding the process of permitting projects and making a significant investment in rural communities, preferably including broadband.The hands-off approach is similar to the one the White House pursued with its tax cut, in which the president laid out broad parameters and drew senior lawmakers into the process of determining the details. But such a process faces long odds on infrastructure, given that Republicans are far less united on the issue and the president will not be able to rely on unified partisan support to force through a plan over the objections of Democrats.Passing a plan through a polarized Congress, in an election year, will require \u201cstrong presidential leadership, a bipartisan effort by leaders in both parties and bringing together the broad constituency of stakeholders who will push their lawmakers to get something done,\u201d said Ed Mortimer, the chamber\u2019s executive director of transportation infrastructure. \u201cThat\u2019s how we take advantage of this opportunity to do something transformational.\u201dDemocrats say the White House has not seriously courted their input. Several Senate Democrats and their aides noted that the administration appeared to be rejecting their longstanding call for much more federal spending. \u201cUnless we get real dollars, we will not build the infrastructure we need,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader.White House officials said they had met with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, including members of key committees that oversee infrastructure policy. They also said they spent months meeting with mayors and state officials to determine infrastructure needs throughout the country and the funding streams available to finance them. They concluded that a larger package than Mr. Trump had initially proposed was necessary and feasible.Administration officials say an increase in federal funds would unleash a wave of spending from cities, states and the private sector, the result of unspecified incentives in the plan. But many local and state officials have expressed concern in recent days that the administration\u2019s faith in that potential effect is misplaced. Some Democrats and progressive groups have branded the plan a \u201cscam,\u201d meant to reward wealthy investors and gut environmental regulations under the guise of a job-creating, economy-juicing initiative, and said it would not prove sufficient to meet America\u2019s need to improve roads, bridges, communications and other infrastructure.The idea that a $200 billion federal investment would drive $1.5 trillion in total spending is \u201cthe great hocus-pocus,\u201d said Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no evidence for that.\u201dWhite House officials dismiss such concerns, arguing that many aspects of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including the Federal Aviation Administration and the inland waterways system \u2014 have built-in revenue streams that can finance improvements and save money, and that the new tax law preserved incentives to finance projects. But many lawmakers privately worry that relying on such mechanisms will not be sufficient to ensure that resources flow to areas that need them most.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers also disputed the notion that expediting permitting for projects could harm the environment.White House officials did not rule out an alternative funding mechanism proposed by Congress, including a possible gas tax increase. Mr. Trump, the senior administration official said, would like to see a higher federal contribution to the plan but said the administration was being realistic about those chances.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "So It\u2019s Your First Market Hiccup. What Should You Do Now?", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyWe\u2019ve been here before. Stocks can fall fast and bounce back hard, even if they haven\u2019t moved all that much or that quickly in recent years.And now, after watching the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fall by several percentage points since Thursday and bounce some of the way back on Tuesday, you have a different kind of fear: that all the stock market riches have been won already or that your emotions will get the best of you amid all of the volatility. It\u2019s tempting to sell what you have as quickly as possible to make that feeling go away.But before you do, take a deep breath and ask yourself these six questions.Watching the overall market numbers move up and down on television or the internet can be addictive. Even if your net worth is low, when the market goes up and down by a few percentage points in a day, there can be sizable dollar amounts at stake.But part of what you\u2019re trying to do here is avoid making panicked decisions. Big red or green arrows or commentators with raised voices generally don\u2019t induce calm. Also, those talking heads know nothing about you and why you invested in the first place. So don\u2019t base your actions on their pontificating and pronouncements.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in the first half of your career. You probably invested in stocks because over the very long haul, they deliver better returns than the other investment choices that are easily available to you at an online brokerage firm or through your workplace retirement plan.When you buy stocks, you\u2019re purchasing tiny little pieces of the profits that our capitalist system generates. Nothing about the events of the last few days suggests that the system is under siege. Quite the contrary: The markets may be spooked in part by the fact that the economy is humming along so nicely that companies will have to pay more for workers. That can hurt the profits that help drive stock prices and also lead to inflation.The small overall decline in the stock market over the past few days pales in comparison with the large gains over the past few years. So hopefully you\u2019re still on schedule to meet your goals, absent any big health or job changes.This moment of checking your gut, however, is as good a time as any to consider whether you have the right proportion of your money in stocks versus other options like cash, bonds or real estate that don\u2019t experience this kind of volatility or may not rise or fall in tandem with stocks. In other words, are you taking too much risk? Or too little? If so, buy or sell some stocks accordingly \u2014 not because of what the stock market will or will not do next but because you are or are not on track to pay for the things you want to buy someday.Let me answer that one for you: No. Perhaps you got lucky with some individual stocks as a teenager or used what you learned in finance class to buy just the right mutual fund at exactly the right time.Congratulations! But you\u2019re almost certainly more lucky than you are smart. Professionals rarely do so well over 50 years that their decisions about when to get in and out of a stock lead to better performance than they might have achieved by just putting money into an index fund that buys every stock in a particular category. And you can\u2019t know ahead of time whether you are that rare breed of market genius.Any decline hurts, even if it\u2019s only on paper and you don\u2019t plan on selling for decades. But consider everything else that might happen over that many years.You will (hopefully) pay down your student loan debt. You will (hopefully) get promotions and raises or start a company that will increase your income. You will buy a home, and its value will probably go up over time, or at least match inflation. Or you\u2019ll rent and draw dividends from the freedom and flexibility that brings you.In other words, you are not the stock market. There is so much more to your net worth (and, hopefully, self worth) than a bouncing S.&P. 500 chart. Check in with your life, and if it\u2019s better than it was a year or five years ago, think about that if the stock market keeps falling.Some of us (O.K., me, although I do a good job of hiding it in my columns) are more anxiety-prone than others. And maybe there is only so far we can go toward suppressing those feelings.Advertisement"}
