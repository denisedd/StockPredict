{"Headline": "The WeWork Manifesto: First, Office Space. Next, the World.", "Date": "2018-02-17", "News": "The brash, ambitious founders of WeWork, a global network of shared office spaces, want nothing less than to transform the way we work, live and play.Supported byOn a cold February morning at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the skeleton of a modern 15-story building was rising from a muddy construction site along the East River. As long and as tall as a cruise ship, the sleek glass structure loomed above rusty, century-old dry docks, serving notice to the industrial neighborhood that the new economy was coming.When Dock 72 is completed this year, if the aggressive timeline holds, it will represent the fullest expression of Mr. Neumann\u2019s expansive vision to date. There will be an enormous co-working space, a luxury spa and large offices, for other companies like IBM and Verizon, that are designed and run by WeWork. There will be a juice bar, a real bar, a gym with a boxing studio, an outdoor basketball court and panoramic vistas of Manhattan. There will be restaurants and maybe even dry cleaning services and a barbershop.It will be the kind of place you never have to leave until you need to go to sleep \u2014 and if Mr. Neumann has his way, you\u2019ll sleep at one of the apartments he is renting nearby.It\u2019s an all-encompassing sort of ambition, and Mr. Neumann is the brash and idealistic pitchman. Simply by encouraging strangers to share a beer at the office, he argues, WeWork can heal our fractured society.\u201cHow do you change the world?\u201d Mr. Neumann asked in a recent interview. \u201cBring people together. Where is the easiest big place to bring people together? In the work environment.\u201dIt may sound simplistic, but around the globe, companies are buying whatever it is that Mr. Neumann and his co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, are selling. WeWork has rapidly expanded to 20 countries, assembled a formidable executive team and attracted some 200,000 members. Big companies like JPMorgan Chase and Siemens are signing on as tenants, and revenues are growing fast, expected to top $2.3 billion this year.A company ostensibly about co-working now employs yoga instructors, architects, teachers, environmental scientists, software engineers, molecular biologists and social psychologists.Is it all a bit much for a young company still trying to build out its core business? \u201cI\u2019ve made that argument,\u201d said Bruce Dunlevie, a WeWork board member and partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. But, he said, \u201cgreat entrepreneurs like Adam don\u2019t listen to guys like me.\u201dAs WeWork expands in all directions, it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model. Critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage \u2014 leasing a space, spiffing it up, then subleasing it out to other tenants. The company owns hardly any properties, giving it precious few hard assets. Its growth projections strike many as unattainable, and it has missed expectations before. A number of upstarts loom as potential competitors, seeking to replicate WeWork\u2019s success. And many WeWork tenants are unproven start-ups that could quickly fold.IWG, a publicly traded co-working company that has more members and more real estate than WeWork, is valued at just $2 billion. Yet Mr. Neumann has convinced investors that WeWork is worth 10 times that figure.\u201cAdam\u2019s explanation for the valuation of WeWork speaks for itself,\u201d said Chris Kelly, co-founder and president of Convene, a company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms. \u201cThis is not an Excel spreadsheet calculation. He believes there\u2019s an energy behind the brand, and he\u2019s gotten people to invest at that valuation. He has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms.\u201dIndeed, to assess WeWork by conventional metrics is to miss the point, according to Mr. Neumann. WeWork isn\u2019t really a real estate company. It\u2019s a state of consciousness, he argues, a generation of interconnected emotionally intelligent entrepreneurs. And Mr. Neumann, with his combination of inspiration and chutzpah, wants to transform not just the way we work and live, but the very world we live in.It\u2019s an audacious, perhaps delusional plan for a company that made its mark by building communal desks and providing refreshments. And so far, it seems to be working.Mr. Son, WeWork\u2019s largest investor, is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come, making his multibillion-dollar investment a veritable bargain.The notion that white-collar workers might actually like their offices is a relatively new one. From the countinghouses of industrial England to the skyscrapers of 1980s Manhattan, offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space, often with row upon row of unglamorous desks.\u201cThe only kind of model that anyone had for laying out a large workplace was a factory,\u201d said Nikil Saval, author of \u201cCubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.\u201d \u201cSo the office was made to resemble an assembly line.\u201dThis dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest, at least for some, during the dot-com bubble. Tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and Ping-Pong tables, making work spaces less formal. Free food became commonplace.Raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream, and today, more and more employees \u2014 especially millennials \u2014 expect enlightened, unconventional offices.Enter WeWork. With people bouncing between employers, jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely, the demand for co-working was suddenly real, and ready to be monetized. Mr. Neumann, who grew up on a kibbutz in Israel, had an epiphany: Bring the communal vibe to the office.Soon he and a friend \u2014 Mr. McKelvey, an equally tall Oregonian who grew up on a collective and was working as an architect \u2014 founded an eco-friendly co-working space in Brooklyn. They sold it, but they quickly turned around and started WeWork in 2010.\u201cMe and Miguel have this common ground,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cWe both grew up in very close communities.\u201dWeWork didn\u2019t invent co-working spaces, of course. IWG, better known as Regus, has been around for decades. But Mr. Neumann and Mr. McKelvey quickly hit upon a recipe that drew throngs of start-ups: an industrial chic aesthetic, some big common areas with comfy couches, free beer and piped-in pop music.Individuals pay as little as $45 a month for occasional access to a desk in a common area. Start-ups can pay a few thousand dollars for a private room on a month-to-month basis, and some big companies pay millions of dollars a year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations.It\u2019s a formula that has caught on from New York to Tel Aviv to Shanghai. In New York alone, WeWork has 49 spaces, most of them nearly full. At the WeWork in Harlem, dance companies share space with hair care start-ups in a common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians. At a WeWork in TriBeCa, fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in a spartan space decorated with neon lighting.For WeWork to really succeed in changing the way we all work, it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees. The strategy is an odd reversal for WeWork, which made its name catering to freelancers and start-ups.The Weather Channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous WeWork in Midtown Manhattan. Barbara Bekkedahl, who runs the group, said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish.But Ms. Bekkedahl had a complaint, too, one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space. She suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lacking.\u201cAs a TV sales team, we groom and dress for outside sales,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the techie and start-up types housed at WeWork aren\u2019t facing customers all day, so don\u2019t always have the same standards.\u201dGripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down WeWork\u2019s business with corporate clients, especially if Mr. Neumann makes good on his promise to save them money. Because WeWork is building out so much space and buying so much furniture, Mr. Neumann says, he can renovate and operate an office for a fraction of the cost that companies would normally spend.\u201cWe have economies of scale,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll cut your operational costs between 20 to 50 percent.\u201dIt might seem like another instance of Mr. Neumann\u2019s talking a big game but for the fact that more and more companies \u2014 GE, HSBC, Salesforce and Microsoft among them \u2014 are signing on.For years now, big companies have outsourced payroll processing, janitorial services and security. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to a company like WeWork.\u201cWe only have 200,000 members,\u201d Mr. McKelvey, 43, said. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. We need to have two million and then 20 million.\u201dBankers and lawyers poured out of skyscrapers and made for the suburbs on a recent Monday night in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. But at 110 Wall Street, a building controlled entirely by WeWork, the party was just getting started.Last year, this 1960s-era office tower was converted into a mixed-use development of Mr. Neumann\u2019s design. There is a co-working space. On the ground floor are trendy restaurants including Westville, Fuku, Momofuku Milk Bar and a bar called the Mail Room.And then there is a WeLive: a complex of about 200 fully furnished apartments rented out on a short-term basis. Tenants get the signature WeWork aesthetic of unpolished wood and wrought iron, as well as various perks. There are hot tubs on the terrace. There are arcade games and a pool table in the laundry room. There are a chef\u2019s kitchen and a communal dining room. At a bar on a residential floor, a happy hour was brewing and free Tempranillo was flowing.The brothers are all in: They live in WeLive, work in the adjacent WeWork space and exercise at WeWork\u2019s nearby gym, Rise.\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d Jake DeCicco said. \u201cYou just roll out of bed, go down the elevator and get to work.\u201dHad Mr. Neumann been there to share a beer, those words would have been music to his ears. He believes that creating a work and living environment where people mingle is in fact a world-changing innovation. Each WeWork has a \u201ccommunity manager\u201d who keeps tabs on members, makes introductions and organizes social activities.If more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water, the thinking goes, they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another\u2019s socially responsible start-ups, and then the world will be a better place.\u201cOnce you choose to enter a WeWork, you choose to be part of something more \u2018we\u2019 than \u2018me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cPeople start coming together. They\u2019ll see each other in the elevator, they talk in the stairways. There\u2019s a thousand other things they do.\u201dElevators. Stairways. Hardly world-changing innovations. But WeWork takes extra steps to encourage fraternization. Like beer kegs that never run dry.More than most companies, WeWork promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue. Posters on the wall encourage people to have a drink. There are wine tastings at WeLive. Company parties feature top-shelf liquor. Mr. Neumann has a well-known penchant for tequila, and a well-stocked bar is prominent in his office.On a recent Tuesday at 4:07 p.m., the community manager of a WeWork in Midtown Manhattan sent an email reading: \u201cIt\u2019s time to get your creative juices flowing! Join us on the 5th floor to drink some wine & paint a beautiful picture.\u201d Just after noon on Valentine\u2019s Day, there was an invitation to share wine and cake in the common area.But so far nothing \u2014 not alcohol, labor disputes, questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity \u2014 has managed to alter the company\u2019s trajectory.\u201cWe\u2019re a disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on a day-to-day basis,\u201d said Mr. Dunlevie of Benchmark. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenon.\u201dIn September, WeWork will open its most ambitious project to date: a kindergarten. It may also be the effort that tests whether WeWork is flying too close to the sun.The creation of Mr. Neumann\u2019s wife, Rebekah, 39, the school is known as WeGrow. When it opens, it promises a well-designed space with a curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for 3-year-olds on up.WeGrow fits neatly into Mr. Neumann\u2019s expansive vision for creating a generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs. But the risk-reward calculus is different when starting a school.WeGrow won\u2019t scale as rapidly as WeWork has, so the financial upside is limited. Yet should something go wrong, the fallout could be devastating: It\u2019s one thing to be responsible for the internet going out or paper running low at the communal printer. It\u2019s another thing to take responsibility for the health and development of someone\u2019s child.\u201cWe all understand how complicated and regulated school is compared to the simpler business that we are already in,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cBut we decided we\u2019re going to go into education. If you really want to change the world, change kids when they\u2019re 2.\u201dAs he proselytized, Mr. Neumann was sitting on an enormous leather couch in his Chelsea office, which is bigger than many New York City apartments. It included a conference table, a video conferencing setup, several desks, a bar, spreads of food, a Peloton exercise bike, a climbing machine, a boxing bag hanging from the ceiling, a gong, an antechamber where assistants work and a private bathroom.\u201cIt\u2019s going to work,\u201d Mr. Neumann continued. \u201cIs it going to be perfect? Definitely not. Are we going to make mistakes? A hundred percent. Are we going to be comfortable admitting those mistakes? Definitely. It\u2019s what we do here.\u201dThough such unbridled zeal can be abrasive to some, it could also be viewed as the mark of a peripatetic savant. Walter Isaacson, the biographer of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo da Vinci, counts Mr. Neumann as a friend, and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed.It can be tempting to dismiss WeWork as just another overvalued start-up that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na\u00efve investors. With little more than faddish interior design, free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers, Mr. Neumann claims to have conjured up a whole new paradigm for white-collar workers \u2014 and for education \u2014 and vows that it can change the world.It\u2019s the kind of utopian prattle that can come off as dangerously out of touch at a moment when a backlash against big tech is brewing. But if any of these potential pitfalls concern Mr. Neumann, he doesn\u2019t show it.On this, the first night of festivities, Mr. Neumann would oversee a \u201cShark Tank\u201d-like competition for socially responsible small businesses \u2014 ranging from a start-up that made customized prosthetics to a food-delivery service staffed by refugees \u2014 each vying for a $1 million prize.Earlier, Mr. Neumann had rattled off the company\u2019s achievements and outlined some of its more outsize ambitions. As the evening\u2019s performer, the Grammy-winning rapper Macklemore, waited backstage, Mr. Neumann went on an impromptu riff about how people should \u201cmake a life, not just a living,\u201d the company\u2019s aspirational motto.Mr. Neumann also stated that it was important to support social entrepreneurs. \u201cOf course that makes a lot of sense, but who\u2019s going to pay for that?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018Well, Masa might!\u2019\u201dThe line generated a laugh among the hundreds of knowing employees in the room \u2014 Mr. Son, whose nickname is Masa, was conveniently absent \u2014 but it was a tell from Mr. Neumann, a sly admission that at this point he is playing with house money.Confetti fell from the rafters. The winners cried on stage. Mr. Neumann took it all in, beaming.Even Macklemore was taken aback by all the money flying around. \u201cI was just watching it, chugging a Red Bull,\u201d he said shortly into his set, \u201cand I immediately thought, \u2018Damn, I should have got into technology.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the United States Search Data Overseas?", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorShould the United States government be able to conduct a search of your emails if they are stored on a server in another country, or does the government\u2019s right to examine digital evidence stop at the border?Both sides in the case have legitimate concerns. If the court sides with Microsoft and declines to allow searches for data stored in another country, the government will be hampered in investigating crimes like terrorism, child pornography and fraud.If the court sides with the government and rules that it may demand data stored overseas by American companies, those companies will find it much harder to do business abroad. This is because many foreigners fear that United States warrants authorizing such searches will disregard privacy protections afforded by their country. The government of Germany, a country with stringent privacy laws, has already indicated it will not use any American company for its data services if the court decides to allow searches.For the United States technology industry, the stakes are high. Last year, the worldwide public cloud services market was estimated to be a $246.8 billion business. Most of the leading companies in this sector are American: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, IBM. If other countries were to follow Germany\u2019s lead, the economic consequences could be severe.While a clarifying decision is needed in this particular case, nothing that the Supreme Court rules will solve the fundamental problem: The Stored Communications Act, a 1986 law that governs the storage and disclosure of electronic communications by third parties, is outdated. Congress needs to act to ensure that technology companies can flourish overseas while law enforcement has the right tools to gather evidence worldwide.The Supreme Court case goes back to 2013, when federal agents served a warrant on Microsoft, seeking email communications belonging to a drug trafficking suspect. Microsoft handed over the suspect\u2019s account information and address book, which sat on its servers in the United States, but refused to turn over any email content, which was stored at a data center in Ireland.Microsoft argued that the email content was outside the reach of United States law enforcement. The government countered that because Microsoft could retrieve the data in Ireland with a click of a mouse, without leaving its headquarters in Redmond, Wash., the email content was within its reach.Two lower courts agreed with the government. But in July 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York reversed the lower courts and determined that the information stored in Ireland was beyond the reach of a United States warrant.At the center of this case is the Stored Communications Act, which was written when there was no modern global internet or cloud storage. It provides Fourth Amendment safeguards to prevent unreasonable searches of electronically stored communications \u2014 but says nothing about data held abroad.The Court of Appeals concluded that the Stored Communications Act was not intended by Congress to allow searches outside the country. The ruling followed the well-established principle that American courts generally do not apply United States law beyond its borders unless Congress intended so.But at least four federal courts have since refused to follow the ruling, mostly for practical, technology-driven reasons. The cases before those courts involved Google and Yahoo, which store data \u201cdynamically\u201d \u2014 breaking data into many small pieces and constantly shuttling it among storage centers in various countries to optimize performance and network efficiency. The text of an email might reside in Bulgaria, but the attachment in Spain.Does it make any sense to think of this email as located in a specific country overseas? As a United States District Court judge, Juan R. S\u00e1nchez, wrote in an opinion that rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, \u201cno one knows which country to ask\u201d for the data.Because Microsoft still frequently uses local-based storage, the Supreme Court case, though important, is of limited significance. The court has an opportunity to clarify the scope of the Stored Communications Act with respect to data stored \u201cstatically\u201d outside the United States. (When signing up for service, a Microsoft user indicates his or her country of residence and Microsoft usually stores the user\u2019s data in a nearby data center.) But the case does not address the more general question of the legal standards that govern information that crosses borders \u2014 and in particular, data stored \u201cdynamically.\u201dOnly Congress can address that larger question, by writing an urgently needed new law. (Even the Second Circuit appealed to Congress to step in.) The International Communications Privacy Act, introduced last term in Congress, is a good place to start. It provides a framework by which United States law enforcement can obtain communications of both United States and foreign citizens, consistent with the privacy protections afforded by international law.The guiding principle should be that the reach of any new law is defined by the citizenship and geographical location of the individual whose data the government seeks, rather the physical location of the data. This would allow for the right balance between global privacy rights and the needs of United States law enforcement.No matter how the Microsoft case is decided, if Congress fails to act, we will continue to have a legal system that inadequately governs the vast stores of electronic data that move seamlessly across international borders.Craig A. Newman is a lawyer at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Businesses Look at Washington and Say, \u2018Never Mind, We\u2019ll Do It\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisCan private businesses solve public policy problems better than the government? It\u2019s a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House.There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success \u2014 a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school \u2014 there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be.In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dJoining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care?In announcing they would try, they delivered an implicit rebuke of the complex and costly American health care system, suggesting that the best minds in business could do better.\u201cCompanies are now thinking much more about how to solve larger social problems,\u201d said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. \u201cWhen Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, three leaders in their industries, looked around, they realized that health care is a big issue facing them all.\u201dTheir efforts stem from a feeling that, with partisan bickering and constant campaigning consuming Washington, the onus is on businesses to fill the void left by an ineffective government.The notion that big business might shape government policy is nothing new, of course. Lobbyists have been working to sway lawmakers for decades, and the corporate world was an influential force in the tax overhaul passed last year.Yet for the most part, these efforts were narrowly aligned with a company\u2019s self-interest, usually in the form of lowering taxes and loosening regulations. And rarely have business leaders tried to assume operational control of a government function, let alone something as complex and unwieldy as health care.In recent years, however, more chief executives have begun speaking out on issues that at first glance have little to do with the bottom line, including immigration policy, climate change and gay rights.\u201cThe lack of leadership on the national political level has left this vacuum,\u201d said Kathleen Clark, a professor at the Washington University Law school. \u201cFortunately, there are some business leaders who see that there\u2019s a role for them to play.\u201dThe most vivid expression of this new willingness to speak out came last summer after white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Trump equivocated in his response to the violence.Chief executives may seem like unlikely ethical leaders; Wells Fargo, Equifax, Uber and many more companies have faced questions from Congress about practices that have harmed consumers and in some instances cost taxpayers billions of dollars.But companies have also been wading into moral debates for decades. General Motors and Pepsi pulled out of South Africa during the apartheid era. Apple, Disney and Xerox were early in extending health care benefits to gay and lesbian couples.Similar efforts by chief executives today recall \u201can earlier era of corporate statesmanship,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a fellow at New America, a research and policy institute. \u201cA lot of these business leaders viewed a business as having a somewhat broader public mission.\u201dNow, he said, thanks to \u201cthe rise, over the last 15 years, of the importance of social responsibly and social mission, there is a broad movement in business.\u201dEven Amazon\u2019s much-publicized efforts to select a city for a second headquarters could, in a roundabout way, influence local policymakers. Given that the company is unlikely to set up shop in a state with socially conservative laws that might alienate some employees, \u201cAmazon could have an effect not just on prices but on what legislators pass,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.George Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has been promoting democratic ideals around the globe. And Mr. Zuckerberg, through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, is working on ambitious long-term projects involving science, education and justice.There is a big difference, though, between supporting social causes and research and operating a sprawling public works system. Critics will contend that some of these efforts smack of arrogance, and that businesses ought to stay in their lane and focus on offering excellent products and services, not meddle in public policy.\u201cThere is this hubris, thinking that they can do it better,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.There is also a certain irony to the fact that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan said the new company they had formed would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dThe profit motive, after all, is what leads to efficiency and innovation, according to conventional business school wisdom. Operating as a nonprofit \u201cflies in the face of the logic of the capitalist economy,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.It most likely will take years to determine if the three companies can make good on their promise of building a better health care system. Even if they succeed, the rewards may be limited to their employees \u2014 a large figure, but a small portion of the American work force.Nonetheless, the companies\u2019 push is among the most audacious efforts by the private sector to date, and Mr. Dimon did not shy away from the scope of their ambition.\u201cThe three of our companies have extraordinary resources,\u201d he said on Tuesday when the initiative was announced. \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facial Recognition Is Accurate, if You\u2019re a White Guy", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacial recognition technology is improving by leaps and bounds. Some commercial software can now tell the gender of a person in a photograph.When the person in the photo is a white man, the software is right 99 percent of the time.But the darker the skin, the more errors arise \u2014 up to nearly 35 percent for images of darker skinned women, according to a new study that breaks fresh ground by measuring how the technology works on people of different races and gender.These disparate results, calculated by Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, show how some of the biases in the real world can seep into artificial intelligence, the computer systems that inform facial recognition.In modern artificial intelligence, data rules. A.I. software is only as smart as the data used to train it. If there are many more white men than black women in the system, it will be worse at identifying the black women.One widely used facial-recognition data set was estimated to be more than 75 percent male and more than 80 percent white, according to another research study.The new study also raises broader questions of fairness and accountability in artificial intelligence at a time when investment in and adoption of the technology is racing ahead.Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending.Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far.\u201cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail \u2014 to make them socially accountable,\u201d said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah.Sorelle Friedler, a computer scientist at Haverford College and a reviewing editor on Ms. Buolamwini\u2019s research paper, said experts had long suspected that facial recognition software performed differently on different populations.\u201cBut this is the first work I\u2019m aware of that shows that empirically,\u201d Ms. Friedler said.Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long.But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again. Only when she put on a white mask did the software recognize hers as a face.By then, face recognition software was increasingly moving out of the lab and into the mainstream.\u201cO.K., this is serious,\u201d she recalled deciding then. \u201cTime to do something.\u201dSo she turned her attention to fighting the bias built into digital technology. Now 28 and a doctoral student, after studying as a Rhodes scholar and a Fulbright fellow, she is an advocate in the new field of \u201calgorithmic accountability,\u201d which seeks to make automated decisions more transparent, explainable and fair.She found them all wanting.To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark-skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents.The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race.Then, each company\u2019s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft\u2019s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM\u2019s and Megvii\u2019s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males.Ms. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies. IBM said in a statement to her that the company had steadily improved its facial analysis software and was \u201cdeeply committed\u201d to \u201cunbiased\u201d and \u201ctransparent\u201d services. This month, the company said, it will roll out an improved service with a nearly 10-fold increase in accuracy on darker-skinned women.Microsoft said that it had \u201calready taken steps to improve the accuracy of our facial recognition technology\u201d and that it was investing in research \u201cto recognize, understand and remove bias.\u201dMegvii, whose Face++ software is widely used for identification in online payment and ride-sharing services in China, did not reply to several requests for comment, Ms. Buolamwini said.Ms. Buolamwini is releasing her data set for others to build upon. She describes her research as \u201ca starting point, very much a first step\u201d toward solutions.\u201cThere is a battle going on for fairness, inclusion and justice in the digital world,\u201d Mr. Walker said.\u201cWe\u2019d have a lot more introspection and accountability in the field of A.I. if we had more people like Joy,\u201d said Cathy O\u2019Neil, a data scientist and author of \u201cWeapons of Math Destruction.\u201dTechnology, Ms. Buolamwini said, should be more attuned to the people who use it and the people it\u2019s used on.\u201cYou can\u2019t have ethical A.I. that\u2019s not inclusive,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd whoever is creating the technology is setting the standards.\u201dBecause of an editing error, two picture captions with an earlier version of this article misstated the number of photos used by researchers to study artificial intelligence software\u2019s accuracy in identifying two groups of people by gender. There were 385 photos of lighter-skinned men, not 296, and 296 of lighter-skinned women, not 385.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Give A.I. the Gift of Gab, Silicon Valley Needs to Offend You", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "Advertisement\nTay said terrible things. She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free \u2014 at least for now.These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. \u201cOuch, that\u2019s not good,\u201d it might say. \u201cHope your ankle feels better soon.\u201d If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company\u2019s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man \u2014 unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.Microsoft\u2019s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. \u201cIt is a problem if we can\u2019t get this in front of real users \u2014 and have them tell us what is right and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints \u2014 and bad press \u2014 Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines \u2014 easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted \u201cchatbots\u201d that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.\u201cIt is more powerful,\u201d said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. \u201cBut it is more dangerous.\u201dIt may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type \u201cwinne tonight drink resttaurant,\u201d it might respond with: \u201ci\u2019m not a fan of wine.\u201d  It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.When Microsoft\u2019s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue. In this case, the system knows enough about the world to identify Adele as a singer.ResponseRankshe's a singer1i don't know who adele is.2she is a singer3lana del rey4i don't know who she is but she is a singer5i don't know who she is but she's a singer6i don't know, i'm not a fan of adele7lana del ray8i don't know who she is, she's a singer9who is adele10i don't know who she is. she's a singer11i don't know who she is but she's a good singer12i don't know who she is. i'm not a fan of adele13i don't know who she is but she is a very good singer14i don't know who she is. she is a singer15i don't know her name. she's a singer16i don't know her name, she's a singer17she's not a singer18i don't know, i've never heard of her before19you don't know her20i don't know her name21i don't know, i've never heard of her22katy perry23i don't know who she is but i don't know her name24i don't really know who she is but i don't know her name25But researchers must also deal with the unexpected. Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude \u2014 or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems \u2014 general dialogue \u2014 is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. \u201cThere is a huge technical barrier here. We really don\u2019t know how to build a personal assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.\u201dIn the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.\u201cWe need people to forgive us when we screw up,\u201d he said. \u201cPushing forward is going to involve some screw-ups.\u201dChat animations are based on data from Microsoft and draw from 50 possible responses for each interaction.Illustrations by Minh UongAdvertisement"}

Google hopes to build a new business around the chips, called tensor processing units, or T.P.U.s.\u201cWe are trying to reach as many people as we can as quickly as we can,\u201d said Zak Stone, who works alongside the small team of Google engineers that designs these chips.And these days, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are not just big internet companies. They are big hardware makers.Right now, Google\u2019s new service is focused on a way to teach computers to recognize objects, called computer vision technology. But as time goes on, the new chips will also help businesses build a wider range of services, Mr. Stone said.At the end of last year, hoping to accelerate its work on driverless cars, Lyft began testing Google\u2019s new chips.Using the chips, Lyft wanted to accelerate the development of systems that allow driverless cars to, say, identify street signs or pedestrians. \u201cTraining\u201d these systems can take days, but with the new chips, the hope is that this will be reduced to hours.\u201cThere is huge potential here,\u201d said Anantha Kancherla, who oversees software for the Lyft driverless car project.T.P.U. chips have helped accelerate the development of everything from the Google Assistant, the service that recognizes voice commands on Android phones, to Google Translate, the internet app that translates one language into another.They are also reducing Google\u2019s dependence on chip makers like Nvidia and Intel. In a similar move, it designed its own servers and networking hardware, reducing its dependence on hardware makers like Dell, HP and Cisco.This keeps costs down, which is essential when running a large online operation, said Casey Bisson, who helps oversee a cloud computing service called Joyent, which is owned by Samsung. At times, the only way to build an efficient service is to build your own hardware.\u201cThis is about packing as much computing power as possible within a small area, within a heat budget, within a power budget,\u201d Mr. Bisson said.Typically, engineers train these algorithms using graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which are chips that were originally designed for rendering images for games and other graphics-heavy software. Most of these chips are supplied by Nvidia.In designing its own A.I. chips, Google was looking to exceed what was possible with these graphics-oriented chips, speed up its own A.I. work and lure more businesses onto its cloud services.At the same time, Google has gained some independence from Nvidia and an ability to negotiate lower prices with its chip suppliers.\u201cGoogle has become so big, it makes sense to invest in chips,\u201d said Fred Weber, who spent a decade as the chief technology officer at the chip maker AMD. \u201cThat gives them leverage. They can cut out the middleman.\u201dThis does not mean that Google will stop buying chips from Nvidia and other chip makers. But it is altering the market. \u201cWho\u2019s buying and who\u2019s selling has changed,\u201d Mr. Weber said.Over the years, Google has even flirted with the possibility of designing its own version of the chips it buys from Intel.Mr. Weber and other insiders question whether Google would ever do this, just because a C.P.U. is so complex and it would be so much more difficult to design and maintain one of these chips. But at a private event in San Francisco last fall, David Patterson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who now works on chip technologies at Google, was asked if the company would go that far.\u201cThat\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a nice problem to have.Neglected in the public discussion is yet another strategy, with large potential benefits for every company and for the nation as a whole: investing in human capital. Lost in the noise was Boeing\u2019s announcement that it will spend $100 million on work force development, training and education, and Disney\u2019s investment of $50 million to cover tuition payments for its hourly employees.Until recently, most corporate training programs focused on communicating company policies, building the company\u2019s \u201cculture\u201d and complying with legal mandates to provide instruction on sexual harassment, nondiscrimination and industry-specific regulatory requirements. Company leaders and promising younger executives were often given access to high-quality executive education programs.But most employees looking to upgrade their skills and qualifications had to go back to school. Those who remained on the job while attending classes part time could get up to $5,250 annually in tax-free tuition reimbursement from their employer. Most large companies have maintained such programs for decades, but less than 1 percent of the work force participates.Today, thanks to online technology, there has been stunning improvement in both the quantity and quality of learning opportunities available to employees. The largest platforms offer thousands of courses from more than 200 of the world\u2019s best universities, as well as state-of-the-art content from top technology companies. Many Fortune 500 companies are testing the use of such courses to develop the skills of their employees, and a few have begun large-scale deployment, offering customized courses to help employees gain competency in emerging fields such as big data, machine learning, deep learning and the internet of things.Less esoteric subjects \u2014 like digital marketing, project management, and managing people and teams \u2014 have also proved popular among employers. These courses typically cost less than 10 percent of what it would cost to take the same courses in a face-to-face, on-campus setting.The tax cut has given companies an opportunity to invest in the future.

{"Headline": "The Case Against Google", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "FeatureCritics say the search giant is squelching competition before it begins. Should the government step in?Supported byIn the years that followed, those overlapping enthusiasms led to cohabitation, a raucous wedding and parallel careers at big technology firms. The thing is, though, when you\u2019re young and geeky and fall in love with someone else young and geeky, all your nerdy friends want you to set them up on dates as well. So Adam and Shivaun, who took Adam\u2019s last name after marriage, approached the problem like two good programmers: They designed a dating app.The app was known as MatchMate, and the idea was simple: Rather than just pairing people with similar interests, their software would put together potential mates according to an array of parameters, such as which pub they were currently standing in, and whether they had friends in common, and what movies they liked or candidates they voted for, and dozens of other factors that might be important in finding a life partner (or at least a tonight partner). The magic of MatchMate was that it could allow a user to mix variables and search for pairings within a specific group, a trick that computer scientists call parameterization. \u201cIt was like asking your best friend to set you up,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cSomeone who says, \u2018Well, you probably think you\u2019d like this guy because he\u2019s handsome, but actually you\u2019d like this other guy because he\u2019s not as good-looking, but he\u2019s really funny.\u2019\u2009\u201dWithin computer science, this kind of algorithmic alchemy is sometimes known as vertical search, and it\u2019s notoriously hard to master. Even Google, with its thousands of Ph.D.s, gets spooked by vertical-search problems. \u201cGoogle\u2019s built around horizontal search, which means if you type in \u2018What\u2019s the population of Myanmar,\u2019 then Google finds websites that include the words \u2018Myanmar\u2019 and \u2018population,\u2019 and figures out which ones are most likely to answer your question,\u201d says Neha Narula, who was a software engineer at Google before joining the M.I.T. Media Lab. You don\u2019t really care if Google sends you to Wikipedia or a news article or some other site, as long as its results are accurate and trustworthy. But, Narula says, \u201cwhen you start asking questions with only one correct answer, like, Which site has the cheapest vacuum cleaner? \u2014 that\u2019s much, much harder.\u201dFor search engines like Google, finding that one correct answer becomes particularly difficult when people have numerous parameters they want satisfied: Which vacuum cleaner is cheapest but also energy-efficient and good on thick carpets and won\u2019t scare the dog? To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.Soon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?As far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.Froogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201dAdam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.The Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.In a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.At the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.In its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201dStandard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201dIn 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201dThe Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.For decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.Consider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.What eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.The Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.\u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201dGoogle executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.One way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201dLeft unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.Shivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.As the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.But they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.Then there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201dThe more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201dTradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)Shivaun and Adam filled notepads with the names of companies that had complained about Google\u2019s tactics \u2014 eJustice, a vertical-search engine for legal information; NexTag, the fellow price-comparison site; BDZV, a group of German newspapers. They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.\u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.Google responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201dThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.Along the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.Even when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.By the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201dReback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201dIn public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.In the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.And most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201dMicrosoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.Or consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201dIt was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.The implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.\u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201dSome legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201dThose are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.Rather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.Put differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.For the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201dOne of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The heads of Citi and Goldman took home healthy pay raises last year.\u2022 Qualcomm didn\u2019t categorically say no to Broadcom\u2019s latest offer.\u2022 What financial regulation could look like post-Brexit.\u2022 Look who bet big on a pick-up in volatility...Peter Thiel.\u2022 R.I.P., BTFD?\u2022 Kraft Heinz is due for a big deal.\u2022 U.S. Bancorp\u2019s big fine.The good times that returned to Wall Street after President Donald Trump got elected are now flowing into the pockets of the big banks\u2019 C.E.Os:Are those paydays justified?Let\u2019s take Mr. Corbat.Citigroup\u2019s stock rose 25 percent in 2017, a lot more than the 16 percent posted by the KBW Bank Index. Investors piled into bank stocks because of expectations of stronger economic growth, and also because they expected the Trump administration to loosen banking regulations.Citi\u2019s underlying businesses improved last year. The bank also got through the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests in 2017 without objections from the regulator, something it had struggled to do in previous years.The message from Citi\u2019s board seems to be that, since the bank\u2019s performance is now much closer to that of its peers, Mr. Corbat\u2019s pay also needs to be in the vicinity of his counterparts on Wall Street.But on other yardsticks, the awards can seem highCiti may be doing better than in the past, but its return on equity, a metric that shows a bank\u2019s return on its capital, was only 6.6 percent last year. Bank of America\u2019s was 6.7 percent. Both are well below the 10 percent earned at JPMorgan.And the makeup of the compensation mattersC.E.O.s\u2019 compensation is made up of different types of pay:\u2022 Cash salaries and cash bonuses\u2022 Stock-based bonuses that are paid out over the coming years, and whose value is, to differing degrees, dependent on how the company performs in the future.The theory: The more performance-related pay, the more accountable the executive is.Investors should keep an eye on the amount of performance share units (P.S.U.s) that are included in a comp package, since these are usually the type of stock award that are most at risk of a decline in value if a bank underperforms by certain yardsticks.Bank of America and Citi would likely assert that the rest of their stock-based awards are also somewhat dependent on the performance of the bank. But shareholders might be happier if all the stock bonus were in P.S.U.s.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 The decision starts a maximum 75-day clock for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, to decide whether to approve or oppose the deal, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Chinese investors have faced heightened scrutiny from Cfius. Since president Trump took office, a half a dozen Chinese deals have fallen apart because of concerns raised by CFIUS, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Raising the breakup fee for antitrust reasons beyond $8 billion. That amount, which represents an already high 6.6 percent of the total deal price, still isn\u2019t high enough for Qualcomm. \u201cA breakup fee in the range proposed by Broadcom does not come close to compensating for those risks,\u201d Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm\u2019s chairman, writes in a letter to Broadcom\u2019s chief, Hock Tan.\u2022 Make unspecified other commitments meant to assuage antitrust regulators.\u2022 Clarify what Broadcom\u2019s intentions are for Qualcomm\u2019s big licensing business.More from Mr. Jacobs\u2019s letter:Our board is open to further discussions with Broadcom to see if a proposal that appropriately reflects the true value of Qualcomm shares, and ensures an appropriate level of deal certainty, can be obtained.If the two sides can\u2019t reach an agreement, then matters may come down to a vote on Qualcomm\u2019s board on March 6. Remember that Broadcom is seeking six of 11 board seats, down from its initial target of unseating all directors.\u2014 Michael de la MercedBritain\u2019s government is often criticized for not clearly communicating the type of deal it wants to strike with the European Union as it prepares to leave the bloc.The dilemma Britain faces.Post-Brexit, Britain\u2019s banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them to operate in any E.U. country with few restrictions. Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks to do business in the E.U. if they operated under regulations that were equivalent to those in the bloc. But this arrangement has drawbacks. It does not cover important types of financial activities, and British banks may have to comply with any changes to regulation that the E.U. introduces.Hence the new plan.The scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed to address those problems. It would allow both sides leeway to strike their own rules once they\u2019ve agreed on their main objectives. And it suggests that a monitoring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set up.Will the E.U. agree to the plan?The bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation. Certain politicians in the E.U. may argue Britain is trying to retain the privileges of the single market while discarding the duties that come with it. Still, some of Europe\u2019s leaders, banks and businesses may support the plan, in the belief that it will minimize disruption and allow the City of London to continue to play a big role in financing the strong economic expansion taking place in Europe.\u2014Peter EavisPeter Thiel.Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Thiel Macro, which invests Mr. Thiel\u2019s fortune, held put options on 1.9 million shares of ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures as of Dec. 31. The investment is designed to pay off if the VIX rises.It\u2019s unclear whether the fund had maintained those positions through last week. But if it had, he would have reaped a big windfall.Investors piled into bets that volatility would continue to decline last year. And those wagers paid off as the VIX spent 2017 trading at historically low levels. But volatility has picked up this year. After trading below 10 to start the year, the VIX spiked to above 37 during the selloff last week. It finished Friday at 19.The law firm Royds Withy King says it has seen a flurry of cases recently involving disputes over cryptocurrency holdings, one of which was recently valued at $1.4 million.The firm said it is currently working on three separate high-value divorce cases where spouses are seeking the disclosure and a potential share of cryptocurrency assets.Off the top of our heads, we\u2019d think that issues would include a) the reporting, or lack thereof, of holdings and b) the value of any digital money portfolios.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore from Julie Edde, Bei Hu and Suzanne Woolley of Bloomberg:\u201cThere\u2019s sort of, \u2018Everybody should buy a dip,\u2019 which has become folklore in the markets now.

{"Headline": "Must Tech Firms Provide Data Held Abroad? Justices Struggle to Apply 1986 Law", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe case turned on the meaning of a 1986 law, enacted before the dawn of the big-data era, and several justices said it provided them with very limited guidance.In 1986, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, no one had ever heard of cloud computing. \u201cThis kind of storage didn\u2019t exist,\u201d she said.That suggested, she said, that Congress rather than the courts should act to define the limits of privacy in the digital era.\u201cIf Congress takes a look at this, realizing that much time and innovation has occurred since 1986, it can write a statute that takes account of various interests,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said. \u201cIf Congress wants to regulate in this brave new world, it should do it.\u201dBut Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the court must act. \u201cIt would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in the interim, something has to be done.\u201dThe case, United States v. Microsoft, No. 17-2, has been closely watched by the technology industry, which sometimes has a testy relationship with the Justice Department.The dispute arose from a federal drug investigation in which prosecutors sought the emails of a suspect stored in a Microsoft data center in Dublin. They said they were entitled to the emails because Microsoft is based in the United States. The suspect\u2019s nationality has not been made public.A federal magistrate judge in New York granted the government\u2019s request to issue a warrant for the data under the 1986 federal law, the Stored Communications Act. A federal district judge agreed.Microsoft challenged the warrant, arguing that prosecutors could not force it to hand over customer emails stored abroad.Michael R. Dreeben, a deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the appeals court\u2019s decision \u201chas caused grave and immediate harm to the government\u2019s ability to enforce federal criminal law.\u201dThe two sides agreed on Tuesday that the 1986 law does not apply abroad, but they differed about whether requiring Microsoft to retrieve the data from the United States violated it.Mr. Dreeben said the focus of the statute was on a company\u2019s ability to obtain data with the click of a mouse in the United States. E. Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Microsoft, said the law was focused on where the information is held.\u201cIf you look at this statute, the focus is on the storage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the Stored Communications Act. At the most basic level, that\u2019s what the focus is.\u201dChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said he did not understand why anything should turn on Microsoft\u2019s business decision to store data abroad. \u201cIt\u2019s not the government\u2019s fault that it\u2019s located overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect the government doesn\u2019t care.\u201dThe chief justice said the company could make protecting all data from the federal government a selling point. \u201cThere is nothing under your position,\u201d he told Mr. Rosenkranz, \u201cthat prevents Microsoft from storing United States communications, every one of them, either in Canada or Mexico or anywhere else.\u201dMr. Rosenkranz said that was theoretically possible, \u201cbut it would never happen.\u201d He said Microsoft\u2019s products work faster when data is stored near its customers.But Chief Justice Roberts said he was troubled by the prospect that \u201can email from me to somebody on the other side of the building that is going to be stored somewhere else would be protected from disclosure.\u201dMr. Rosenkranz said there was another reason to shield the data. International relations, he said, requires respect for local privacy laws.\u201cNo one disputes that countries across the world believe that they have the sovereignty and the sovereign right to pass their own laws governing the access to emails stored on their soil,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here we are reaching into their lands and imposing our U.S. position on who gets access to emails on their soil.\u201dMr. Dreeben disputed that. \u201cThere is not an international problem here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is largely a mirage that Microsoft is seeking to create.\u201dHe added that there is a fundamental misconception about the dispute. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case about privacy,\u201d he said, as the government must satisfy a high burden to obtain the data it seeks.\u201cThe government has the gold standard of an instrument to address privacy interests here: a probable-cause-based warrant issued by a judge that describes with particularity what we want,\u201d Mr. Dreeben said. \u201cThat is the hallmark in our domestic system of how privacy interests are addressed.\u201dA ruling upholding the warrant, Microsoft has warned, would embolden foreign countries to seek the emails of Americans stored in the United States. The Justice Department\u2019s position poses a threat to technology companies, Microsoft has said, by requiring them to choose between complying with a warrant and disobeying foreign laws.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Crazy Idea for Funding Local News: Charge People for It", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe plan, for any would-be entrepreneur brave enough to try it, goes like this: Hire some very good journalists; just one or two are O.K. to start. Turn them loose on a large metropolitan area \u2014 try San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston or any other city going through waves of change, and whose local press has been gutted by digital disruption.Have your reporters cover stuff that no one else is covering, and let them ignore stuff that everyone else is covering. Don\u2019t do movie reviews, stock market analysis, Super Bowl coverage or anything else that isn\u2019t local. Instead, emphasize coverage that\u2019s actionable, that residents deem necessary and valuable for short- and long-term planning \u2014 especially an obsessive focus on housing and development, transportation, education and local politics.Package it all in a form that commands daily attention \u2014 probably a morning email newsletter \u2014 and sprinkle it with a sense of community, like offline and online networking events for readers.How will you fund all of this? This is the most important part: Shun advertising. Instead, ask readers to pay for it with real money \u2014 $5 or $10 a month, or perhaps even more. It will take time, but if you build it right, you just might create the next great metropolitan news organization.This plan may sound simplistic, almost like a joke. Wait, Sherlock, your big idea is to create a really good product and charge people money for it? Haven\u2019t people tried this before?Less than you might think. The short history of digital media is lousy with advertising, which promotes all the wrong incentives for online news \u2014 volume over curation, aggregation over original coverage, speed over accuracy.Yet few entrepreneurs have jumped on the subscription bandwagon for local news. The reluctance makes sense; local markets are by definition small, and journalism is expensive.But after studying Ms. Lessin\u2019s and Mr. Thompson\u2019s methods, I suspect there\u2019s a market for subscription-based local coverage. Someone just has to build it.How? Consider Ms. Lessin\u2019s plan for The Information, the tech news service she started in 2013 after spending eight years at The Wall Street Journal. Back then, online subscriptions seemed antiquated; many companies had experimented with charging users, but most had failed to win large numbers of subscribers, and the big money in media was in ad-supported sites aiming for rapid expansion through viral traffic.\u201cPeople thought no one would pay for news, especially tech news,\u201d Ms. Lessin told me last month. \u201cThe problem was the news business hadn\u2019t been focused on a key question: How do I deliver a differentiated product that people would pay for?\u201dHer idea for differentiation was to charge a lot for The Information \u2014 a subscription is $399 a year, close to what The Wall Street Journal charges for print delivery \u2014 but she would offer readers quality instead of volume.The Information publishes just two or three stories a day, often scoops and analysis, including a handy daily roundup of the most important stories in tech that day.Mr. Thompson\u2019s overhead is low: He is the only writer of Stratechery, which has become required reading among tech executives and many others in the industry. He declined to divulge any subscriber numbers, other than to say he\u2019s doing very well.A high-priced subscription site may well have a natural audience ceiling. Ms. Lessin declined to divulge her subscriber base but said it was \u201csignificantly north of 10,000,\u201d which is lower than the audience for many ad-based digital publications.Sure, there are reasons to be skeptical that this model could work in local news. Many subscribers to The Information and Stratechery think of the publications as a business expense \u2014 they work in tech or finance, wealthy industries that will pay just about anything for business intelligence.Yet there are striking overlaps between what those publications do and what a subscription-based local news start-up would look like. For one thing, a lot of those wealthy people also live in undercovered urban and suburban areas; if they\u2019re paying for news about tech, wouldn\u2019t they also pay for in-depth investigations into their kids\u2019 school district, their city\u2019s mayoral race or the traffic clogging their commute?There\u2019s also the opportunity to pay for a sense of community. The Information \u2014 through the Slack chat service, conference calls and in-person meet-ups \u2014 constantly brings subscribers together to talk about the industry. A local news start-up could do the same, selling not just news but a sense of belonging.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the subscription news business, you\u2019re not selling articles,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Why do they pay?\u201cNews happens in tech every day, and I do the thinking for them,\u201d he said. A subscription-based local news business would offer the same value: \u201cYou\u2019re selling people a feeling of being informed, of being good citizens \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re selling.\u201dNow we just need someone to build it.Advertisement"}

The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge.

Over time, that could sully the company\u2019s image.AlphabetCritics cornerJennifer Saba of Breakingviews:Alphabet is stuck at the letter G. The holding company of Google was created to safeguard against conventionality and let moonshot ideas, like self-driving cars, flourish. Almost three years in, it\u2019s basically still just Google. Which means, in turn, that the A in Alphabet stands mainly for advertising.It wouldn\u2019t hurt Alphabet to put more energy into revenue sources that don\u2019t start with a G.Why now\u2022 Walt Disney\u2019s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.Critics cornerTara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly:\u201cCBS isn\u2019t safe from the industry\u2019s broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom won\u2019t provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities.

She combines technical expertise with great care for her colleagues.\u201dAnd here\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi:\u201cHe helped Airbnb establish a rigorous financial discipline, aided our expansion into new businesses including into luxury rentals, which is now one of our core businesses, and helped us develop new and innovative ways to grow Airbnb and our businesses.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSome of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook.Facebook\u2019s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe.The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook\u2019s future growth. The company\u2019s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe\u2019s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States\u2019, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.That\u2019s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin\u2019s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg.The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday.More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex.\u201cThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,\u201d said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. \u201cIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.\u201dThe digital money flyaroundDetails, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point.The contextWhile a potential joint venture between Alphabet and Aramco isn\u2019t necessarily connected to the latter company\u2019s IPO, if a deal is struck before the offering, advisers to the company could pitch the pact as a way for investors to bake in technology valuations.It isn\u2019t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company \u2014 and therefore command a higher multiple \u2014 but it\u2019d be interesting to see bankers make that argument.\u2014 Stephen GrocerFrom the release:\u201cI am excited to join NEA because they understand how to work with visionary entrepreneurs to build successful technology and health care enterprises,\u201d Immelt said. \u201cI have a passion for these sectors and I am eager to work with NEA and its partners to develop great businesses, nurture talented leaders and grow diverse teams.\u201dand:\u201cJeff is deeply knowledgeable about the complex global innovation landscape we\u2019re operating in today and he understands how businesses must evolve to compete and win in that environment, particularly across industrial and medical technologies,\u201d said Scott Sandell, Managing General Partner, NEA.(Worth noting: Mr. Immelt\u2019s successor at G.E. is struggling to turn that company around. See below.)\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s where our colleague Peter Eavis says investors should focus:Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Today\u2019s a big day for tech earningsThe Treasury secretary argued that the cuts would eventually pay for themselves, but conceded that it wouldn\u2019t happen this year.The policy flyaroundAnalysts\u2019 takes:\u2022 Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch write, \u201cThis shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.\u201d\u2022 Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \u201cIn short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell\u2019s first press conference.\u201d\u2022 Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton said, \u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation.\u201dAnalysts over at Deutsche Bank think so.

In addition to Mr. Trump, they address topics like why they team up with corporations and whether they\u2019re imposing their values on other cultures.While the mood in many parts of the world seems to have darkened, Mr. and Ms. Gates say in their letter that they remain militantly optimistic about global progress.\u201cThe headlines are filled with awful news,\u201d they write in the letter. \u201cEvery day brings a different story of political division, violence or natural disaster. Despite the headlines, we see a world that\u2019s getting better.\u201dThey expanded on some of those themes and fielded questions about other topics in the recent interview. It was held at bgC3, a company that oversees many of Mr. Gates\u2019s independent projects, including for-profit investments in clean energy.But when asked about the growing criticism that big technology companies like Facebook and Twitter have faced over their role in spreading misinformation, Mr. Gates said he hadn\u2019t \u201cseen great solutions,\u201d though \u201cI\u2019m hopeful they\u2019ll come.\u201d\u201cThe whole tech world should look at these criticisms, look at these effects, you know, try to make sure that without giving up what\u2019s good about that, that we can reduce some of it,\u201d he said.When asked if the national reckoning over sexual harassment had affected her investments through Pivotal, Ms. Gates said that it hadn\u2019t so far, but that it had encouraged her to use her voice to encourage more women to speak out.\u201cI want to make it O.K. for women to talk about their real experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a long time coming that the sexual harassment stuff worldwide comes out.\u201dMs. Gates has made family planning a focus of her work with the foundation. She said the Trump administration\u2019s decision last year to expand a ban prohibiting American aid to any health organizations that provide or discuss abortion in family planning had caused \u201cchaos\u201d in the field \u2014 forcing them to stall their work as they figured out how to adhere to the rules.And in their annual letter, Ms. Gates, 53, is blunt in her view of the way Mr. Trump communicates.\u201cI wish our president would treat people, and especially women, with more respect when he speaks and tweets,\u201d she writes.A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Gates, 62, said he was particularly worried about Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to cut foreign aid, which the Gates Foundation considers critical in the global battle against disease and poverty. He said that he was reassured that Congress had so far resisted the president\u2019s demands to cut aid and that he and his wife had increased their visits to Republican members of Congress to stress the importance of maintaining the aid budget.\u201cAlthough we disagree with this administration more than the others we\u2019ve met with, we believe it\u2019s still important to work together whenever possible,\u201d he writes in the letter. \u201cWe keep talking to them because if the U.S. cuts back on its investments abroad, people in other countries will die, and Americans will be worse off.\u201dOne of the questions in the letter is about what happens when the two of them disagree. Mr. Gates wrote, \u201cWhen I get really enthusiastic about something, I count on her to make sure I\u2019m being realistic.\u201dMs. Gates said they tended to avoid hashing out their disagreements in front of bigger groups at the foundation, saving them for private discussions, which they have on walks.\u201cHaving a little bit of grist in the system is actually a good thing,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Settling With Uber, Waymo Faces Bigger Challenges", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow for Waymo, which grew out of Google\u2019s seminal autonomous vehicle project and is nearly a decade into an effort that aims to change the very nature of transportation, a much bigger fight looms outside the courtroom.Waymo\u2019s competition extends well beyond Uber \u2014 and a good part of that competition is directed by engineers it used to employ. Much of the artificial intelligence technology that has come out of Waymo\u2019s work and from research run by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is now available from other sources, making it easier for companies, even start-ups, to compete.\u201cWaymo may have a technical advantage,\u201d said Jason Doran, who helped run the delivery service Sidecar and joined General Motors when the carmaker acquired the start-up. \u201cBut they have to figure out a business model.\u201dIt is not uncommon for a tech pioneer to miss out on becoming the company that cashes in on the technology it has been working on. The industry is littered with stories of people with a great idea that someone else turned into a great business.The concept for the databases used by most of the world\u2019s big corporations came out of IBM. But another company, Oracle, turned that software into a big business. Researchers at the Silicon Valley lab of Xerox famously pioneered the technology that went into many of Apple\u2019s computers.And executives at Alphabet would certainly remember that Google was hardly the first internet search engine. It was just better than anything that came before it.Other than an ownership stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, that came with settling the lawsuit, Waymo has not made substantial money from those years of research.That is worth noting, because so many of the companies competing with Waymo are relying on the brainpower of its former employees. Dave Ferguson, a former Waymo engineer, oversees a start-up called Nuro, which is building a driverless car for shipping and delivering goods. Chris Urmson, a longtime Waymo engineer, is the chief executive of a start-up called Aurora. Brian Salesky, a third Waymo engineer, is now at Argo, an autonomous vehicle start-up backed by $1 billion in funding from Ford Motor.The question was whether he took trade secrets with him. Waymo accused Uber of conspiring with Mr. Levandowski to steal its trade secrets and feed them into a driverless car project already underway inside the ride-hailing company. With Friday\u2019s settlement, Uber has promised that its cars will operate without the help of Waymo\u2019s intellectual property.There are other issues for Waymo. Unlike Ford, General Motors or Toyota, Waymo does not manufacture and sell cars. Unlike Uber and Lyft, it does not operate a vast ride-hailing services where it could readily deploy vehicles equipped with its own self-driving technology.As the big automakers and the ride-hailing companies accelerate their self-driving projects, Waymo may need to find a way of inserting itself into these efforts or to build and operate a new self-driving service of its own.\u201cThere\u2019s the self-driving tech. But you also have to scale that tech. And you have to offer a service that people really want to use,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cYou have to get all of that right.\u201dWaymo executives were not available for interviews for this article. John Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, is scheduled to speak on Monday evening at a conference on artificial intelligence hosted by The New York Times.\u201cWaymo has the partnerships and technology needed to launch the world\u2019s first self-driving service this year,\u201d a Waymo spokesman said in a statement, pointing to how the company has fully self-driving cars on some public roads, has secured vehicles from Fiat Chrysler and has partnered with Avis, AutoNation, Lyft and others. \u201cAfter years of research and development, Waymo is now focused on operations and deployment.\u201dWhen Waymo was still operating under Google, its head start in this race was obvious. Google began testing its self-driving prototypes on public roads in 2010, and this is what set off so many other efforts.\u201cThis is profoundly important,\u201d said Mr. Urmson of Aurora, which is supplying self-driving technology to Volkswagen, Audi and Hyundai. \u201cWe can build on top of that revolution.\u201dThese techniques are spreading across the industry. And anyone can immediately tap into enormous amounts of computing power through cloud services operated by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and, yes, Google.Many car manufacturers believe they will eventually catch up because they can deploy so many more cars equipped with sensors that can record real-world activity.\u201cWhat the car companies have is the potential to harvest more data than anyone else,\u201d Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, the Silicon Valley research and development operation created by the Japanese car company, said in an interview last fall. \u201cIt may be this that matters the most.\u201dWaymo is unlikely to manufacture its own cars. But it may end up running its own self-driving service. Alphabet recently led a $1 billion investment in Lyft, and it could deploy its driverless cars through this existing ride-hailing option. Waymo is also running a private trial of its cars near Phoenix, and it has long hinted that it will offer some sort of undefined public service in the area.Operating this kind of service is no small thing, and some question whether Waymo is equipped to do so. \u201cThis is where the Ubers and the Lyfts have an advantage,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.He cautioned that the departures from Waymo may have an unintended consequence for the entire industry: Many smart people are needed in the same place to figure things out.\u201cYou need to have a lot of the best minds together to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my fears is that we have spread the field a little thin. As a result, we have actually slowed down the speed with which we can solve this problem.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dropbox Files for I.P.O., and Other \u2018Unicorns\u2019 Are Watching", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, it has long been a guessing game about which of the most richly valued technology start-ups would be next to test the public markets.While Dropbox may not have the glamour of a ride-hailing app like Uber or a streaming music service like Spotify \u2014 both of which are likely initial public offering prospects \u2014 the company is in the same broad group known as \u201cunicorns,\u201d which are start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by the private investors that have so far funded their growth. How Dropbox fares as it goes public could help determine whether other unicorns follow suit.Still, the public offering market has gotten off to a fast start this year, with some 34 companies raising $11.87 billion in the public markets to date, according to Dealogic, a data provider. This comes despite a bout of stock market volatility this month that briefly sent the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down more than 10 percent from its high in late January.\u201cWe\u2019ve been hoping that 2018 and 2019 would be the big year for tech and the unicorn class,\u201d said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, a firm that provides data on the public offering market. \u201cDropbox is definitely going to be a milestone.\u201dGoldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank are among the banks underwriting Dropbox\u2019s offering. A spokeswoman for Dropbox declined to comment.Since then, Dropbox, which is based in San Francisco, has grown into one of the leading file-syncing services, though it faces stiff competition from Google, Microsoft and others. In its filing, Dropbox said it had more than 500 million registered users, more than 11 million of whom paid for the service.Last year, the company lost $112 million, compared with $210 million the previous year. Its revenue rose to $1.11 billion last year from $845 million the year before.Whether Dropbox can support a high valuation in the stock market is unclear. Its closest point of comparison, a Silicon Valley storage company called Box, has a market capitalization of about $3.2 billion on annual revenue of about $400 million.Dropbox said in its filing that it expected its expenses to rise, and it said its revenue growth rate had slowed.Still, when it goes public, Dropbox will be an important moment, including for early investors \u2014 such as venture capitalists \u2014 who have pumped billions of dollars into an array of tech ventures and expect a return when the companies reach the stock market.Sequoia Capital, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm, is the largest institutional shareholder in Dropbox, with about 23 percent of its shares, and another investment firm, Accel, holds just over 5 percent, according to the company\u2019s filing.The biggest owners of Dropbox stock are its founders. Mr. Houston, 34, holds about 25 percent of the company\u2019s shares, and Mr. Ferdowsi, 32, holds just under 10 percent.At M.I.T., Mr. Houston, who belonged to the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, would head to the roof of the fraternity\u2019s building and sit on a folding nylon chair reading business and marketing books.\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to get my M.B.A. on the roof of Phi Delta Theta, but that\u2019s what happened,\u201d he said, speaking to M.I.T.\u2019s graduating class in 2013.Mr. Houston took a year off after his sophomore year and started an SAT prep company called Accolade with his former high school teacher Andrew Crick. The start-up did not work out, and Mr. Houston went back to school. After graduating, he repeatedly forgot to carry his USB memory sticks and said that inspired him to try to store files in the cloud.So he tapped Mr. Ferdowsi, still a student at M.I.T., to be his co-founder. The team received funding from Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley start-up incubator, becoming one of the firm\u2019s most successful investments.On Friday, in a founders\u2019 letter that accompanied their filing, Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi wrote about how they started Dropbox with the idea \u201cthat life would be better if our most important information lived in the cloud.\u201dAs their business has grown and more people have adopted their technology, Dropbox\u2019s mission has now become \u201cabout keeping people in sync \u2014 connecting people and their most important information,\u201d the duo wrote.Nellie Bowles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Criminals Hide Their Data Overseas", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsAmerican efforts to investigate crime and terrorism are increasingly impeded by a lack of access to data stored outside the country, even when it is held by companies subject to United States jurisdiction. Britain and other allied foreign governments face similar problems. All too often, officials in one country investigating a serious crime with victims in that very same country cannot get data they need simply because it is on a server halfway across the world. The internet is moving fast, and our legal constructs are not keeping up. This leaves tech companies in the difficult position of having to withhold information that could protect public safety.To make matters worse, a case at the United States Supreme Court could leave our governments and others with no effective way to obtain vital evidence of serious crimes. Oral arguments are scheduled for Feb. 27 in that case, which asks whether Microsoft may comply with a United States warrant to disclose information related to an American crime stored on a cloud server in Ireland. Microsoft argues that it cannot.Fortunately, there is a legislative solution to this problem that advances a model that empowers law enforcement. The Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Democratic senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Chris Coons of Delaware, and members of the House have proposed legislation that would clarify the legal authority of the United States to obtain data stored in another country, and would authorize special agreements to resolve potential conflicts of law. The bill would authorize the attorney general to enter into such agreements, but only with allies that respect privacy and protect civil liberties, and that have records of promoting and defending due process. The first one would be with Britain, which already has the authority to enter into such a pact.These agreements would not apply to foreign judicial orders directed at American citizens, or anyone in the United States, for that matter. Instead, the bill would promote swift justice among nations that share a common commitment to the rule of law, while protecting the privacy and safety of our citizens. The prime minister has stressed the great importance of the legislation to British authorities investigating criminal and terrorist activity. One of us, Paddy McGuinness, has testified before both houses of Congress to make the case for this change. President Trump adopted this priority upon taking office as part of his call for lawful access to information.In addition to improved law enforcement, this model advances American leadership in cybersecurity. American and British innovation created the internet, and United States-based companies dominate the online landscape. With that central role in the internet comes a responsibility to work with partners that share our values to support their safety and security. Any nation motivated to enter into an agreement with the United States will have to meet American standards of due process and ensure a commitment to the rule of law, not authoritarian whim.Some have argued that it is improper for the United States government to assert the authority to compel disclosure of data stored abroad. But Britain is one of many nations that already asserts this authority. The proposed law would not only put the United States on a par with these other nations but would also do so on its terms.Others argue the bill unwisely provides the American and British governments new powers to obtain private information. The reality is that courts in both governments already have the authority to compel a service provider to comply with a warrant, and we have a longstanding, but slow, treaty process for enforcing cross-border warrants. The Cloud Act considers these issues and provides thoughtful and swifter solutions. Neither government will issue a warrant without judicial approval.We can build an international system in which rights-respecting countries can have access to the data they need to investigate serious crimes regardless of where companies choose to store it. This legislation is the first step.The authority is critical. With it, law enforcement officials in the United States, Britain and other countries with similar due-process standards would be empowered to investigate people suspected of terrorism and serious crimes like murder, human trafficking and the sexual abuse of children, regardless of where the suspects\u2019 data happens to be stored. Obtaining access to overseas data held by companies subject to our jurisdiction is entirely consistent with our treaty obligations and international norms. With this legislation, our countries can meet these longstanding obligations, and meet them faster.The longer it takes to address this problem, the more our mutual public safety and national security will be undermined by the current legal obstacles to disclosure of data across borders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon to Test a New Delivery Service for Sellers", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon is planning to test a program this year that would replace some delivery services now done by United Parcel Service and FedEx.Under the new service, known inside the company variously as Ship With Amazon and Shipping With Amazon, company couriers would pick up products from businesses that sell goods through the internet retailer and deliver that merchandise to Amazon warehouses. Now, those goods are delivered to the warehouses by UPS, FedEx and other companies.Amazon\u2019s test, which could start in several months, will probably include only a handful of independent Amazon sellers in Los Angeles. Eventually, the test could encompass more delivery services handled by established carriers. A person briefed on the program, who asked for anonymity because the plans are confidential, provided details about the project.When asked about the program, Amazon said in a statement, \u201cWe\u2019re always innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on Amazon to create faster, lower-cost delivery choices.\u201dIn the initial trial of the service, the person briefed on the plan said, Amazon will still rely on its current network of couriers, like UPS, FedEx and the Postal Service, to get orders from its warehouses to customers.Depending on how the test goes, though, the service could expand to include more sellers in more areas and allow sellers that do not store their inventory in Amazon warehouses to ship orders entirely through Amazon\u2019s own delivery network, bypassing other carriers. In the long term, Amazon could also make the service available to merchants that sell on sites besides Amazon.Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, declined to comment about Amazon\u2019s plans or whether the company\u2019s shipping volume with UPS had changed. He pointed out, however, that UPS reported 8 percent revenue growth and a 4.5 percent increase in package volume in the United States last year.\u201cUPS continues to support Amazon and all other valued customers,\u201d he said.Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, compared what Amazon was doing in shipping to what it had done in the corporate technology market with Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. Slowly over time, Amazon has added more and more features to the service, but they are still well short of the offerings from established providers like Microsoft.\u201cI think Amazon is going to find different areas within the logistics and transportation space where it can be maybe more effective or efficient than what FedEx and UPS can do,\u201d Mr. Sebastian said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trying to establish a full competitor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It outlined the Chinese government\u2019s aggressive plan to treat A.I. like the country\u2019s own version of the Apollo 11 lunar mission \u2014 an all-in effort that could stoke national pride and spark agenda-setting technology breakthroughs.\u201cIt is remarkable to see how A.I. has emerged as a top priority for the Chinese leadership and how quickly things have been set into motion,\u201d said Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security who helped translate the manifesto and follows China\u2019s work on artificial intelligence. \u201cThe U.S. plans and policies released in 2016 were seemingly the impetus for the formulation of China\u2019s national A.I. strategy.\u201d\u201cWe are still waiting on the White House to provide some direction\u201d on how to respond to the competition, said Tim Hwang, who worked on A.I. policy at Google and is now the director of the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative, a new organization created by the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and others to fund ethical research in artificial intelligence.American companies like Amazon and Google have done more than anyone to turn A.I. concepts into real products. But for a number of reasons, including concerns that the Trump administration will limit the number of immigrant engineers allowed into the United States, much of the critical research being done on artificial intelligence is already migrating to other countries, including tech hot spots like Toronto, London and Beijing.To China\u2019s growing tech community, driving the industry\u2019s next big thing \u2014 a mantra of Silicon Valley \u2014 is becoming a tantalizing possibility.\u201cThanks to the size of the market and the rapid experimentation, China is going to become one of the most powerful \u2014 if not the most powerful \u2014 A.I. countries in the world,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft and Google executive who now runs a prominent Chinese venture capital firm dedicated to artificial intelligence.The 2016 A.I. reports were shepherded by President Barack Obama\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy.The O.S.T.P., which has overseen science and technology activities across the federal government for more than four decades, is now run by the deputy chief technology officer Michael Kratsios. He had worked as a Wall Street analyst before serving as chief of staff for an investment fund run by Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist who supported Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential run. The administration has yet to name an office director or fill four other assistant posts.In a recent interview, Mr. Kratsios was adamant that any concerns over the administration\u2019s approach to A.I. were unfounded.\u201cArtificial intelligence has been a priority for the Trump administration since Day 1,\u201d he said. Mr. Kratsios added that the administration was particularly concerned with the development of A.I. in national security and as a way of encouraging economic prosperity.Many staff members in Mr. Kratsios\u2019s office are exploring issues related to artificial intelligence, he said. Mr. Kratsios also meets with a committee, set up by the Obama administration, that coordinates A.I. policy across the government.\u201cThe key thing to remember is that the front line of A.I. policy is at the agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House is a convener and a coordinator.\u201dIn an echo of plans laid out by the Obama administration, China\u2019s government said it intended to significantly increase long-term funding for A.I. research and develop a much larger community of A.I. researchers.There are several ways to do that, according to the Obama administration and China. First, educate more students in these technologies. Second, recruit experts from other countries.At the same time, both policy statements urged companies to share more technology and data. Huge pools of data are need to \u201ctrain\u201d A.I. systems, and in the United States much of this is locked up inside companies like Facebook and Google. Mr. Lee said China already has an enormous advantage here because its large population will generate more data and its companies are more willing to share.Artificial intelligence has been a focus of Chinese technologists for some time. By 2013, China was already producing more research papers than the United States in the area of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the main technology driving the rise of A.I., according to the Obama reports. Deep learning, which allows machines to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, is one of the main technologies driving the rise of artificial intelligence.It is unclear how much China as a whole is spending. But one Chinese state has promised to invest $5 billion in A.I., and the government of Beijing has committed $2 billion to an A.I. development park in the city. South Korea has set aside close to $1 billion of its own. Canada, already home to many of the top researchers in the field, has also committed $125 million to, in part, attract new talent from other countries.It is also difficult to say just how much the government of the United States is spending. Government organizations like the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation continue to fund new research in universities and the private sector. According to an O.S.T.P report, the federal government spent about $1 billion a year in 2015. The Trump administration says that spending jumped to $3 billion in 2017. But the current administration said that was not an apples-to-apples comparison to the 2015 tally, because it was not certain how the Obama administration made it calculations.\u201cWe may have a bunch of small initiatives inside the government that are doing good, but we don\u2019t have a central national strategy,\u201d said Jack Clark, a former journalist who now oversees policy efforts at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab co-founded by Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is confusing that we have this technology of such obvious power and merit and we are not hearing full-throated support, including financial support.\u201d\u201cThey are headed in precisely the wrong direction,\u201d said Thomas Kalil, who led O.S.T.P\u2019s Technology and Innovation Division under President Obama. \u201cThat is particularly concerning given that China has identified this as a strategic priority.\u201dGoogle operates another important lab in Montreal. Its London lab, DeepMind, may be home to more top-notch A.I. researchers than any other lab on earth. And Google recently unveiled new labs in both Paris and Beijing. Facebook, after creating its own lab in Canada, recently pumped 10 million euros, or more than $12 million, into its existing operation in Paris. And Amazon is opening a lab in Germany.Inside these facilities, researchers still create technology for their American employers. As the labs grow and the products get better, some employees can be expected to leave to start their own companies and hire their own employees.Google\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s work in China has already led to Chinese start-ups like Malong, which is building image recognition systems, and a major A.I. investment fund run by Mr. Lee.\u201cWhen it is close to you, something like Microsoft Research has real economic value,\u201d said Mr. Clark, of OpenAI.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

The United States, the world\u2019s largest economy, is in its ninth year of growth. Europe, China and Japan are expanding as well.There were tears aplenty from Federer, who, after nearly five years without a major title, made a remarkable late-career run, with three Grand Slams in 12 months.\u201cThe fairy tale continues, for us, for me,\u201d he said, looking toward his team and family in the players\u2019 box.It\u2019s like a Humane Society with handcuffs and badges. This Dutch police force rescues dogs left on snowy balconies, comforts sick seals stranded on the beach, and handles cases of abuse and neglect. The work is a mix of animal protection and human social services.Mr. Gates, the Microsoft entrepreneur-turned-philanthropist, and Mr. Pinker, who wrote \u201cThe Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,\u201d got together for some pizza and a lively discussion about ensuring humanity\u2019s progress and giving back to the world.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, reportedly the largest private foundation in the United States, focuses on improving health in developing countries and expanding opportunities for the poor in America.Mr. Gates is also on a quest to invent a toilet that can be used in places without reliable plumbing.With 1,182 students enrolled \u2014 that\u2019s almost one in four Yale undergraduates \u2014 Psychology and the Good Life is the most popular class in the university\u2019s 316-year history.The goal of the course is to teach students how to lead a happier, more satisfying life, one that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to involve prestigious internships or high-paying jobs. The final assessment is based on a personal self-improvement project.Surprisingly, there\u2019s never been a Jamaican synchronized swimming team in the Olympics. But five young athletes (who call themselves the Island Aquatics Synchro Club) are being coached by a Russian two-time gold medalist.Joydayne Whyte, 9, one of the swimmers, was 3 when she first watched Olympic synchronized swimming. She was fascinated with the graceful movements and colorful suits.\u201cI want to do that!\u201d she told her mother.Mr. Ruser didn\u2019t expect his tweet about the fitness app to gain much traction, but the news soon echoed across the internet, alarming security experts. The Pentagon is reviewing the matter.\u201cHe\u2019s obviously got some seriously great skills,\u201d said Danielle Cave, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. \u201cIt would be crazy for groups in this space not to nab somebody like that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
