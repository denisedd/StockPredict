{"Headline": "Gay Mardi Gras in Sydney Goes Corporate, Clashing With Activist Roots", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 They were there for the Sissy Ball, a vogue-style dance-off that was last weekend\u2019s contribution to the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, a two-week gay pride festival that will culminate in a parade this Saturday.But as dozens of gay and transgender dancers popped and sashayed on the catwalk before a cheering crowd, the ball\u2019s M.C. reminded everyone what made the bash possible.\u201cShout out to Red Bull!\u201d he yelled.Red Bull, the energy drink producer, is one of dozens of companies sponsoring and participating in Mardi Gras this year. Others include Netflix, Absolut, Airbnb and Tinder. The retail bank ANZ has decorated automated teller machines around Sydney, which it calls \u201cGAYTMs.\u201dOrganizers see corporate involvement as a sign of increased acceptance, an acknowledgment of gays\u2019 spending power and necessary to keeping the festival alive and growing. But critics contend that corporatizing the event risks losing its activist roots and community spirit.\u201cThe sad thing is, the big companies got in,\u201d said Daniel Matatahi, founder of Gay Sydney Australia, which was excluded despite marching for the past three years. \u201cNetflix! How the hell did they get in? They have money. They\u2019ve never been part of our community, never.\u201dBut that acceptance did not come easily.The first Mardi Gras took place in Sydney in 1978. Gays and lesbians, many of them out publicly for the first time, took to the streets for a pride parade. Police officers surrounded the marchers and arrested 53 people, in some cases using excessive force.\u201cWe were not supposed to be seen, we were expected to hide who we were,\u201d said Mark Gillespie, 65, reflecting on that first parade.For him, political activism, not mainstream acceptance, is at the core of the event.But today, Mardi Gras is a hugely popular \u2014 and visible \u2014 staple on Sydney\u2019s cultural calendar. There are family-friendly carnivals, a film festival and a sold-out after-party headlined by Cher.About 300,000 people are expected to attend this year\u2019s parade.Back then, corporations \u201cdidn\u2019t want to know us,\u201d said Tracey Atkinson, 60. \u201cNow we\u2019re the darlings of the free world.\u201dThe legalization of same-sex marriage last year put gays further in the spotlight, and advertisers are hoping to capitalize on that exposure. But more than just a onetime marketing play, businesses are increasingly aware of the gay community\u2019s consumer power and directing advertising toward it.A 2016 study by the marketing agency Out Now estimates the annual spending power of Australia\u2019s L.G.B.T. community at more than 73 billion Australian dollars, or $57 billion American dollars. Australian same-sex couples are likely to have higher personal incomes than those in heterosexual relationships, according to the 2016 census.\u201cMardi Gras is a community initiative, and it\u2019s a wonderful way to raise awareness and celebrate,\u201d said Vanessa Hicks, a spokeswoman for Vodafone Australia, the mobile phone network sponsoring the event. \u201cFor us as a business, we see this as a natural way to connect with that environment.\u201dThe event\u2019s organizer says corporate interest is a sign of progress and acceptance. In order to participate, said Terese Casu, the Mardi Gras chief executive, businesses are required to have their own inclusion and diversity initiatives in place.\u201cThe work that corporations are doing is not token,\u201d Ms. Casu said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely authentic and it\u2019s genuine, and if it isn\u2019t, they\u2019re not with Mardi Gras.\u201dOne of those grant recipients, Giti Datt, 33, is marching in the parade for the first time. Her float\u2019s theme is a gay Indian wedding.\u201cI was just crying and shaking,\u201d Ms. Datt said of learning that her float would be included in the parade. \u201cI think we have an opportunity to be visible. And that\u2019s a way that we can change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As the Streaming Wars Heat Up, Ryan Murphy Cashes In", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe battle between the Hollywood establishment and the streaming-media giants has caused big changes in the entertainment industry in recent months, driving up the prices of major stars and series producers while leaving traditional companies in danger of losing relevance.Mr. Murphy was in an ideal bargaining position not only because he possesses a fecund imagination able to spin out one successful series after another, but because Apple and Amazon have lately proved themselves willing to spend their way into rivalries with the old-line movie studios and television networks.Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, \u201cThe goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201dThat statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes.Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos\u2019s signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood.\u201cWhat Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there\u2019s a new template in town,\u201d Ms. Walden said. \u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator.\u201dRick Rosen, the head of TV at the agency WME, said it had become clear that Netflix was now able to outspend the companies that had been around since the early days of the movie business.\u201cAs a representative of talent, if you have top-top talent, you must talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d be negligent if you didn\u2019t. Top talent wants to pitch to Netflix.\u201dAnother competitor in the expanding streaming industry, Hulu \u2014 which is available only in the United States \u2014 has gained momentum recently with original series like the much-decorated \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and now has 17 million subscribers. While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters.With the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts.The mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry \u2014 one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space.\u201cWere the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,\u201d said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. \u201cIf the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us.\u201dMr. Murphy declined to comment for this article.Disney \u2014 a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger \u2014 has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney\u2019s own television studio has not been a reliable supplier.The day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network\u2019s long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d) and Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d).\u201cWith more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,\u201d he said.The money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: \u201cWhen this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I\u2019m interested in that and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201dThe Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year \u2014 and when the streaming services are spending in manic style.And it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right.The question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion \u2014 a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said.Advertisement"}

It fulfilled her dream of working with Hoffman (he died in 2014), and her co-stars were Ellen Burstyn and Michael Shannon. The result, she said, was \u201cincredible.\u201dThere was also the fact that her new series required her to move away from the New York theater scene to Los Angeles, where she remains.\u201cI felt a little trepidatious to do another play because it had been such an important experience for me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then enough time passed, and I got a little less precious.\u201dKate is feeling the heat: Washingtonian magazine has just released its list of top D.C. gay power couples under 45, and on it are Kate\u2019s ex-girlfriend Lauren (Aya Cash) and her wife.Why the return to theater?I wanted to challenge myself again. I wanted the rigor of having to be word perfect, of not being able to pull the panic button and say \u201cCut!\u201d When we did our first full run-though, something went wrong, and I instinctively looked over to Tommy [Kail], the director, like, \u201cMake it stop!\u201d Then I realized there\u2019s no stopping. So I\u2019ve been cherishing both the sheer terror and the pleasure of letting it fly when you know so well what you\u2019re doing.\u201cKings\u201d is eye-opening to those of us who don\u2019t know much about lobbying. I\u2019ve learned about broadening a bill to death, in which a lawmaker can publicly say they support something while privately reassuring the lobbyists and super PACs that they won\u2019t vote for it. That concept \u2014 of saying, \u201cI support this, but this bill doesn\u2019t go far enough, and I don\u2019t want to lose out on an opportunity for more comprehensive legislation down the line\u201d \u2014 I am now going to regard with suspicion.I left Juilliard feeling like I didn\u2019t know how to act onstage anymore. I felt so criticized and wasn\u2019t sure that I could do it. But they didn\u2019t teach us on-camera acting, so I didn\u2019t feel like they had told me I couldn\u2019t act on camera, and I gravitated toward movies and TV. I think I had to go away, find my confidence again as an actor, and then be able to come back.Are you one of their success stories now?I haven\u2019t gone back to the school so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a dart board in the office or they\u2019re proudly claiming me as one of their loves.You seem the antithesis of Mickey in \u201cLove,\u201d with her sex and substance addictions. The dynamic between Mickey and her father [a dysfunctional alcoholic] was shockingly similar to my father even though the writers didn\u2019t know anything about my dad. I\u2019m a very tightly wound person who\u2019s tried to have control and decided never to drink or do drugs, and that was my response to a father like that. And Mickey wound up imitating the behaviors of that parent. So maybe the behaviors are different but the drivers \u2014 the anxieties, the fear, the pain \u2014 are the same.What is that dynamic with your father like?[Begins to cry] Well, he passed away. [Long pause] So mine is a closed chapter. The gift that the show gave me was when I tried to perhaps see things from my father\u2019s perspective for the first time. And that empathy has been an amazing thing in my life because it allows you to let go of a lot. It was surreal to work on that episode and say, \u201cI love you, Dad,\u201d which is something I can\u2019t ever say in real life again. It\u2019s been an emotional time for many actresses because of the #MeToo revelations. Do you have a #MeToo story?O.K., do you want me to cry again? I had moments years ago where I spoke up and was not listened to. And I tried to then take it to people in positions of power and was told that it was my problem to deal with. So it\u2019s been incredibly painful because I\u2019m allowing myself all those feelings for the first time. But if I allow myself the possibility that this is a moment of real and lasting change, then maybe I can let go of some of that cynicism and hurt and hopelessness.Oh my God, anything is possible right? But I\u2019m used to finding out news about the show from other people. So I\u2019m sure, like, you will tell me.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Tale of Two Netflix Coming-of-Age Comedies", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookEach show centers on a pair of high school outsiders, a boy and a girl, each of whom has one absent parent. (In the 10-episode American series \u201cEverything,\u201d the boy\u2019s father and the girl\u2019s mother are gone; in the eight-episode British \u201cEnd,\u201d it\u2019s the other way around.) The missing moms are dead, the missing dads are deadbeats. Each show plays teasing games of will-they-or-won\u2019t-they, finding endless last-minute ways to forestall kisses or worse. Each boy gallantly takes full responsibility for a crime the corresponding girl was complicit in.But no matter how many standard features of the teenage comedy the two series share, they\u2019re as different as night and day, and there\u2019s no question which one\u2019s the dark one. Here\u2019s a hint: In \u201cEverything,\u201d the boy takes the rap for pulling a fire alarm in the school gym. In \u201cEnd,\u201d the boy takes the rap for an extremely bloody killing committed with a hunting knife.It\u2019s worth noting here that \u201cEnd,\u201d which is jarring, aggressively morbid and by far the better of the two shows, was originally made for good old broadcast television \u2014 it was shown on Britain\u2019s Channel 4 last year before arriving on Netflix in January.\u201cEverything\u201d was made directly for Netflix (it was created by Ben York Jones and Michael Mohan), but it doesn\u2019t make much use of the license that allows, beyond some strong language. Though perhaps if it were on American broadcast TV, it wouldn\u2019t include the implicit joke of setting its story in an Oregon town called Boring and naming the high school sports teams the Beavers.Luke (Jahi Di\u2019Allo Winston), is the ringleader of a trio of freshman nerds and an aspiring filmmaker. (He\u2019s first seen pedaling his bicycle through the small-town streets, the ur-image of the post-Spielberg coming-of-age story.) He falls hard for a girl, Kate (Peyton Kennedy), who has her own reasons for feeling alienated, and their relationship plays out during the making of a school film that brings together the losers and the cool kids.James (Alex Lawther) is a self-diagnosed psychopath who once submerged his own hand in a deep-fat fryer and now occupies himself killing small animals. Alyssa (Jessica Barden) is a load, pure and simple \u2014 angry, bored, sullen, alienated from everything and everyone. She\u2019s drawn to James because he\u2019s even more nihilistic than she is; he lets her tag along because he\u2019s decided it\u2019s time to start killing humans, and she\u2019ll make an easy victim.Those feelings change, as they must, while the pair cruise the country in a stolen car, skipping out on bills, shoplifting, squatting in an empty house and occasionally stumbling into more serious and violent misadventures. Each works hard to maintain a cool indifference, but Ms. Covell gives them voice-over narrations that expose their doubts and longings, and remind us that they\u2019re just kids who got in over their heads.That\u2019s the real difference between the shows. (Though \u201cEnd\u201d has the edge in writing, acting \u2014 especially by Ms. Barden \u2014 and ambition.) In the American series, the children are drawn as miniature adults, putting up with their embarrassing but well-meaning parents. The British series portrays children as children, negotiating the frightening process of growing up among adults who are likely to be indifferent at best, predatory at worst. It\u2019s eternal childhood versus childhood\u2019s end. Either way, Netflix has you covered.Advertisement"}

And the Rhode Island-based noise rock band Lightning Bolt is famed for concerts that often occur in tiny, clandestine spaces, where a crush of jittery bodies surround the band on all sides.Brian Chippendale, its drummer, plans to lean into the strange contrast between this performance space and his scrappier ventures: He and the bass guitarist Brian Gibson will devise an improvised and likely more sedate set to match the mood from those seated in the plush red seats.\u201cI think the scene will most definitely be off in some way; I don\u2019t mind that,\u201d Mr. Chippendale said. The band is prepared to find its own source of energy rather than depend on a rowdy crowd, he added. \u201cWe\u2019re just this little band that drove over in our rickety van, and we\u2019re battling it out in the belly of the beast. I could conjure up some \u2018Moby Dick\u2019 scenario to get energized.\u201dHe also plans to draw inspiration from the video projections, which will be created by the artists Peter Burr and Sabrina Ratt\u00e9 from the Undervolt & Co. arts collective. Using digital and analog equipment, they will take turns mixing videos on the fly to match the music\u2019s mood; Ms. Ratt\u00e9\u2019s work is often characterized by serene, colorful undulations, while Mr. Burr opts for twitchy, near-seizure-inducing patterns.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted my work to be scalable: You can rock out a basement, but can also rock out the MoMA or a multiplex in Times Square,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Festivalgoers will be given wristbands in the lobby to differentiate themselves from the rest of the crowd. But the culture clash is sure to be startling: curious tourists and couples on a date night mixing with devout jazz heads, punks and artists venturing to the heart of the city.\u201cMaybe for an hour, it\u2019ll feel like there\u2019s some kind of zombie apocalypse, and this is the only place left,\u201d Mr. Chippendale said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified a musical group performing in 2016.

{"Headline": "\u2018Black Panther\u2019 Brings Hope, Hype and Pride", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight,\u201d a dapper T\u2019Challa, the prince of Wakanda, says upon meeting Natasha Romanova, a.k.a. the Black Widow, in \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201d A few scenes later, a recently orphaned and vengeful T\u2019Challa, swapping his bespoke blue suit for a full-body bulletproof one, reappears as a new Marvel movie superhero.What has audiences so eager this time is in part the combination of an auteur African-American director (Ryan Coogler of \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cCreed\u201d), a heavyweight cast (Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker) and a soundtrack co-produced by a rap superstar (Kendrick Lamar), all working on one of the most popular franchises in Hollywood. But the excitement has also been fueled by the origin story of the African superhero.Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, Black Panther was the first black superhero in mainstream comics, making his debut in Marvel\u2019s Fantastic Four No. 52 in 1966. He went on to appear in Avengers titles and took his first star turn in Jungle Action No. 5 in 1973. He had his ups and downs: his own series largely penned by Kirby, a cancellation in 1979 and a return in the 1980s. From 2005 to 2009, he was the subject of another series, this one written by the filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (\u201cMarshall\u201d). In 2016, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote a new series of comic books, while Joe Robert Cole and Mr. Coogler worked on the script.\u201cWakanda is a kind of black utopia in our fight against colonialism and imperial control of black land and black people by white people,\u201d said Deirdre Hollman, a founder of the annual Black Comic Book Festival at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. \u201cTo the black imagination, that means everything. In a comic book, it is a reality, and through a major motion picture, it\u2019s even more tangibly and artistically a reality that we can explore for ourselves. There\u2019s so much power that\u2019s drawn from the notion that there was a community, a nation that resisted colonization and infiltration and subjugation.\u201dIn this sense, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is as much an alternative to our contemporary racial discourse as it is a throwback, not only a desire for what could have been but also a nostalgia for what we once had. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that this movie appears precisely in a moment in which our politics seems inescapable,\u201d Mr. Gray said, adding later that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d should be understood in a political context in which both the legal gains of the civil rights movement and the interracial optimism of the Obama era have been undermined.Simply going to the movie can be interpreted as a small gesture of protest and a grand expression of cultural pride.\u201cBlack Panther\u201d has already become a kind of shared language. \u201cLast week I was at the mall when another black dude passed by me,\u201d Mr. Bernardin said. \u201cWe gave each other a nod, and he said, \u2018Black Panther\u2019s\u2019 in a month, yo.\u2019 That was his version of \u2018what\u2019s up,\u2019 his way of marking of time.\u201dIn addition to fans wearing custom-made Black Panther costumes and African-inspired haute couture to the premiere last month, African-American civic groups and others are buying out movie theaters so African-American children can experience the film with one another.In Oakland, Calif., LaDawn James Williams originally intended to fly to New York to see it with her college friends from Howard University. Instead she plans to host a \u201cBlack Panther\u201d screening for her local chapter of Jack and Jill of America. She, her husband, and their 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son will watch it with more than 90 other African-American families in a private viewing.\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to take the mask off,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really subtle, but we\u2019re going to get certain things about the movie and its language that only we know. So I want this to be something we do together: my family, my chapter and my community.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Seven Seconds,\u2019 a Grim Account of Whose Lives Matter", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSeven Seconds\u201d is a crime story in which you know immediately who did it. Pete Jablonski (Beau Knapp), a Jersey City police officer, is driving through a park on the way to the hospital to meet his pregnant wife, when he hits something. Or someone, it turns out: There\u2019s a bicycle in the snow, and a trail of blood.In shock, Pete calls Michael DiAngelo (David Lyons), his sergeant in his narcotics unit, who finds the victim: an African-American teenage boy. They have to cover it up, DiAngelo says. Otherwise, he adds, Pete will be crucified, payback for \u201cFerguson, Chicago, Baltimore \u2014 every white cop who ever killed a black kid.\u201dThe boy is in a deep coma. We never hear him speak, see only a few glimpses of him taking his last bike ride. But we hear his name again and again: Brenton Butler, which hangs over the story like others \u2014 Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray \u2014 that have become totems and rallying cries.These are timely questions emerging from a too familiar tragedy, even if \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d is ultimately not as well executed as it is well intentioned.The new series, arriving on Netflix on Friday, shares with \u201cThe Killing\u201d a brooding tone and a concern with the ripple effects of violence. But it\u2019s an anthology series, in which each season tells a complete story. This helps focus the cat-and-mouse procedural at this season\u2019s center.The case falls to K. J. Harper (Clare-Hope Ashitey), a prosecutor who makes a politically convenient point for her boss because she\u2019s African-American, and Detective Joe Rinaldi (Michael Mosley), known as Fish, who begins to realize that the cover story doesn\u2019t add up.As evidence starts to point toward the brutal, corrupt narcotics unit (shades of \u201cThe Shield\u201d), K. J. \u2014 already haunted by a past case that had a disastrous effect on a family with children \u2014 dulls the stress with booze and karaoke. Fish, a newcomer to the department with his own troubled past, relishes the animosity of his fellow police officers almost masochistically.K. J. and Fish have an eccentric rapport that will be familiar to fans of \u201cThe Killing.\u201d Ms. Sud has a feel for creating broken characters whose pieces somehow work better in combination.But \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d has ambitions far beyond telling a procedural story, and that\u2019s where it becomes the most dour and heavy-handed.While the season runs 10 episodes, several over an hour, most of the supporting characters grow no deeper the longer we spend with them. The police are all chest-thumping aggression and \u201cwe take care of our own\u201d machismo, with the exception of Pete, who\u2019s trapped between guilt and fear.Regina King, also a co-star of \u201cAmerican Crime,\u201d is devastating as Brenton\u2019s mother, Latrice, who spirals into loss, desperation and rage at the system\u2019s indifference. But they\u2019re all that defines her; so many of the characters here seem more like personifications of suffering or dysfunction than like people.But there\u2019s a purity of dark vision driving the series, if you\u2019re willing to take it without sweetener. There\u2019s a legal term that comes up in the investigation, \u201cdepraved indifference\u201d: inaction so egregious that it amounts to murder. \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d suggests that there\u2019s plenty of such guilt to go around, well beyond the suspects in the case.The black hit-and-run victim, for instance, is immediately assumed to have gang connections. But later, a drug-addicted white girl from a rich suburb is let off for shoplifting by a store manager who says: \u201cShe was from a good home. I figured I\u2019d give her a break.\u201dUltimately, that\u2019s what \u201cSeven Seconds,\u201d however imperfectly, is about: who gets a break and who gets broken.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Programmed for Kids, This Film Festival Has Adults Lining Up, Too", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Merlijn and Sils, Dutch boys who are 11 and 10, meet Afghan and Syrian youths while visiting a refugee camp in Greece, the children seem to have nothing in common.

By the time the Dutch leave \u2014 the boys\u2019 mothers are camp volunteers \u2014 the two groups have forged a surprisingly trusting and tender bond.\u201cThe core nature of the festival is about this kind of wonderful chaos,\u201d Maria-Christina Villase\u00f1or, its programming director, explained in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely very calculated curating and programming, but it\u2019s also bringing so many different kinds of storytelling and image-making together.\u201d The aim is diversity, not only in films but also among their makers: About half this year are female.\u201cIt\u2019s the second year we\u2019re finding these real strong works by women that are kind of leveling the playing field,\u201d Ms. Villase\u00f1or said.\u201cWe encourage girls to break boundaries,\u201d Nina Guralnick, the festival\u2019s executive director, said. The next step, she added, was \u201cto take that same concept and apply it to boys.\u201d\u201cWe thought it would be interesting to work with a festival that doesn\u2019t focus on kids\u2019 programming,\u201d Ms. Villase\u00f1or said, but that yielded distinctive animation. The program is likely to attract a reliable festival demographic: grown-ups, particularly animation fans, who attend without children.\u201cIn video games, you\u2019re cast as the main character,\u201d Mr. Billington said in a telephone interview. \u201cHere, you had to feel you were participating in someone else\u2019s story.\u201d The solution was to cast the viewer as the imaginary friend of Lucy, the \u201cWolves\u201d protagonist. That friend can then discover the critical clue Lucy needs to prove the wolves\u2019 presence. But if the viewer doesn\u2019t participate, the story still continues. \u201cThat felt very \u2018not game\u2019 and more movie,\u201d Mr. Billington said.But if the festival has an overarching theme, it\u2019s what its promotional materials describe as \u201cFind Your Story.\u201d \u201cWe want kids to see onscreen that there are so many different ways to tackle problems or to behave or to be, and they get to pick,\u201d Ms. Guralnick said.Having aimed for a traditional documentary, \u201cwe decided to just embrace fiction,\u201d Mr. Kopp said in a telephone interview, \u201cand we trusted fiction to bring us a truth in a way that a conventional documentary wouldn\u2019t.\u201dThe Dutch director Mischa Kamp\u2019s buoyant musical \u201cSing Song\u201d also uses imaginary characters to illuminate a complicated reality. It focuses on Jasmine, a 16-year-old Dutch girl born in Suriname. She earns a spot in a singing competition there, but her greater objective is to locate her mother, whom her father will not discuss. Ms. Kamp said by phone that she wanted to portray the immigrant experience, but also to show \u201cthis connection between who you are and where you are from.\u201dSuch works illustrate a paradox at the heart of this enterprise: Sometimes you need to go to a children\u2019s film festival to see something truly grown-up.Advertisement"}

Their stout refusal to give up recalls the well-to-do characters in William Wyler\u2019s \u201cMrs. Miniver,\u201d whose cushy lives in a village outside London are ruptured by encroaching German forces.In \u201cDarkest Hour,\u201d Wright and his screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, granted themselves the poetic license to imagine a scene in which Churchill rides the tube, where he surveys ordinary Londoners about staying in the war.

But \u201cMrs. Miniver\u201d depicts another aspect of the home front in this story of a decent, loving family that shows courage and resilience when duty calls. The father (Walter Pidgeon) adds his boat to the evacuation effort at Dunkirk, the mother (Greer Garson) squares off with a German pilot who crash-lands in her garden, and their son (Richard Ney) leaves his fianc\u00e9e behind to enlist in the Royal Air Force. Tragedy inevitably arises, but the family and community stand firm, even when surrounded by wreckage.Wyler went on to make the definitive coming-home drama, \u201cThe Best Years of Our Lives,\u201d four years later.

For all of Wright\u2019s cinematic brio, \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d takes place almost wholly in tight quarters, to the point where a side journey to the London Underground feels like a respite.

But while Sokurov maintains the extreme austerity of his previous work, \u201cThe Sun\u201d allows for blessed moments of culture-clash humor, as when Hirohito meets a boorish Gen.

In this hugely underrated gothic horror film from Francis Ford Coppola, Oldman is transformed from a dashing 15th century conqueror to a centuries-old creature of the night, but the effects don\u2019t smother a performance that\u2019s suffused with bloody terror and romantic woe.Much has been made of the four-hour makeup sessions that turned the gaunt Oldman into a jowly Churchill, but it\u2019s not as if Oldman hadn\u2019t put in the time before.

Oldman is the standout in an unsteady ensemble, and he\u2019s supported by Coppola\u2019s ravishing visual conceit, which flashes back to early cinema through Michael Ballhaus\u2019s old-fashioned in-camera effects and looks forward with Eiko Ishioka\u2019s avant-garde costume design.Past Draculas like Max Schreck in F.W.

Director Tom Hooper never met a wide-angle shot he couldn\u2019t frame distractingly, but the back-and-forth between Firth and Rush bristles with tension and wit.The heart of the film is the relationship between King George, known informally as \u201cBertie,\u201d and Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian who has experience in ironing out speech defects but no formal or medical expertise.

Natasha Singer, a technology reporter for The Times in New York, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.You report on digital privacy, health and education technology. What are your most important tools for doing your job? For people who would rather not reach me through my corporate Gmail account at The Times, I use ProtonMail, an encrypted email service. I also use Signal, an encrypted text messaging and calling service. And I do some online research through Tor, a browser that masks your online address so sites can\u2019t track your physical location. I also use DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn\u2019t store your search history.My wariness of tracking developed when I was a cub reporter in Moscow. On one of my first stories there, I invited a Russian legislator, who was a democracy advocate, to lunch at a restaurant near the Kremlin. She arrived and immediately started combing through a vase of flowers on the table, checking for government listening devices. After that, I often interviewed Russian democracy activists during walks in local parks and forests.It made an impression on me that even the mere idea of being surveilled can chill people\u2019s behavior.Now I view privacy not so much as the ability to keep your personal details away from prying government agencies or companies. Privacy is the right to choose which entities access information about you, control how those entities use your data, check the fairness of data-based decisions made about you, and correct errors.One tool I use on my laptop is Disconnect, a service that shows you the third parties tracking you on every site. When I was reading articles this morning about the Trump administration, Disconnect counted 78 advertising networks, analytics services and others tracking me on HuffPost; 24 trackers on The New York Times site, and 19 on The Washington Post.What could be better about some of these tools?ProtonMail can be cumbersome. The service encrypts your emails before they reach the ProtonMail server. As a result, you can\u2019t search the texts of your emails for keywords if you use the free service. You can search only the subject lines.It\u2019s a constant reminder that ceding to online surveillance is much more frictionless than trying to limit it.Even small user-interface changes could make a big difference. Imagine if the default setting for streaming video services wasn\u2019t autoplay.On a larger level, we\u2019ve seen over the past year how some Big Tech companies initially refused to take responsibility for the spread of fake news and other side effects of their innovations. In that context, platforms that nudge children and adults to stay online are merely one symptom of a much bigger problem.There\u2019s huge hype around the idea that tech can improve education. Same goes for health.So far, however, there\u2019s not much rigorous evidence that learning apps on their own improve students\u2019 educational results. Likewise, there is little hard evidence that health apps by themselves reduce disease.Still, I\u2019m optimistic about the potential for software in health.That\u2019s partly because a few tech companies are participating in rigorous studies, called randomized controlled trials. In these studies, researchers randomly select some volunteers to try a new intervention. By comparing the results in the treated and untreated groups, researchers could identify apps that do make significant health contributions.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your daily life? Right now, my family is on a bit of a Brit TV binge. We just watched the second season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d the fictional series on Queen Elizabeth II, and \u201cThe Coronation,\u201d a glowing documentary featuring the real QE2. And we raced through \u201cPrime Suspect: Tennison,\u201d the prequel to the classic TV police procedural that starred Helen Mirren.Are you doing anything unusual to limit the spread of your data?It may seem quaint, but I still relish the idea that people in a democratic society have the right to be anonymous in public. I think Americans should be able to attend political protests or drive to the grocery store in our pajamas without being recognized by government agencies or companies.Advertisement"}

First they\u2019ll toy with her, then they\u2019ll recruit her into their ranks, where of course the abuse will continue, because that\u2019s just what they do. Cady, in her na\u00efvet\u00e9, starts out as a double agent, joining the Plastics so she can report back to her sardonic rebel friends, Janis (Barrett Wilbert Weed, in the Lizzy Caplan role) and Damian (Grey Henson). Then her motivations begin to change.The stage iteration of \u201cMean Girls\u201d does have one big bummer about it: Ms. Fey will not be reprising her film role as the beleaguered teacher Ms. Norbury. (On the plus side, that means the terrific Kerry Butler can play the part.) But Broadway has waited a long time for Ms. Fey\u2019s talent. At last she\u2019s almost here.

JON CARAMANICACrossing Genres and ErasThese masterworks bring ample evidence of Robbins\u2019s wide assortment of contrasting gifts: understatement and cartoon fun; the innocence and ebullience of adolescence and nostalgic evocation of community and folk vitality; his love of lyrical naturalness and semidetached attitude to academic ballet. No committed dancegoer should live without knowing these works. No lover of New York culture either: He made them all in and for this city.How marvelous that this genius, who burst into creative life with the immediately sensational comedy \u201cFancy Free,\u201d kept stretching himself over the decades.

{"Headline": "Comedian Going to White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. What About Trump?", "Date": "2018-02-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A comedian has agreed to tell jokes at this year\u2019s White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner.Now the question is whether President Trump will show up to hear the punch lines.Michelle Wolf, a stand-up comic and frequent contributor to \u201cThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah,\u201d will be the featured entertainer at the annual gathering on April 28, the association announced on Thursday, taking on one of the most prominent \u2014 and perilous \u2014 gigs in comedy.Long a high point of the Washington social calendar, the correspondents\u2019 dinner typically offers journalists and presidents a chance to roast one another on live television in a celebrity-packed ballroom.But Mr. Trump, not one to encourage comity with the White House press corps, skipped last year\u2019s proceedings, the first president to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1981. (Mr. Reagan, who had recently survived an assassination attempt, called in from his hospital bed.) And the White House said this week that Mr. Trump had not yet made a decision about this year.Either way, Ms. Wolf, 32, has her work cut out for her.The coziness of the event \u2014 where reporters hobnob with the politicians they cover \u2014 can be awkward, too, leading some journalists to stifle their laughter, lest they be caught on camera appearing too gleeful at the president\u2019s expense.Margaret Talev, a White House reporter for Bloomberg News who is president of the correspondents\u2019 association, said that Ms. Wolf\u2019s \u201ctruth-to-power style makes her a great friend to the W.H.C.A.\u201d\u201cHer Pennsylvania roots, stints on Wall Street and in science, and self-made, feminist edge make her the right voice now,\u201d Ms. Talev said in a statement.If Mr. Trump attends the April dinner, it could create a far more charged dynamic in the room.The president rarely holds back in his searing attacks on the journalists who cover him, but might he temper his style in a more formal setting? An answer of sorts could come in early March when the president makes his first appearance at another of Washington\u2019s major roasts: the white-tie Gridiron Club gala.The Gridiron, organized by an elite club of Washington journalists, is a more genteel version of the correspondents\u2019 dinner, featuring skits and jokes performed by reporters and lawmakers. Outside comics are not invited, and the event is not expected to be televised.Mr. Trump\u2019s displeasure that evening has since been cited as a prime motivator for his subsequent presidential run.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Night of the Living Dead\u2019: Zombies Restored to Their Full Beauty", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingOn Feb. 13, just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day, the Criterion Channel on FilmStruck debuted \u201cNight of the Living Dead,\u201d George A. Romero\u2019s 1968 horror classic. The posting is notable for several reasons.For another, this is the second time Criterion has put up a film on the site the same day as its release on physical media, in this case a two-disc Blu-ray on the Criterion Collection label. (The first time this happened was with \u201cDesert Hearts,\u201d released and posted last November.)Some skeptics online who haven\u2019t seen the restoration ask \u201chow good can the new version look?\u201d After all, \u201cLiving Dead\u201d is one of the original low-budget horror movies that morphed into a classic. The answer lies in part with just how bad the versions you can watch on Amazon Prime look. There\u2019s one with a \u201cFisher Klingenstein Films\u201d logo before the opening shot. The image is blurry, with the whites far too bright, washed-out and lacking in detail. A \u201c50th Anniversary\u201d edition, touting the movie as \u201cNow Available in 1080p High-Definition-2K HD transfer from a rare film print\u201d may well be as advertised. Yet however \u201crare\u201d the print from which the version was scanned, it wasn\u2019t in very good shape. A lot of scratches and blotches, and overly high contrasts that deepen the blacks into nothingness while distorting the whites. We shall not even speak of the colorized version.These various iterations exist because the movie\u2019s original distributor failed to copyright it. Once it went into the public domain, anyone with a print of the movie could distribute it anywhere, produce video versions, and more, free. The creators of the movie didn\u2019t make any money. The Film Foundation and MoMA allowed Image Ten, the original company behind the film, founded by the director, Mr. Romero, the producing brothers Gary and Russell Streiner, and the writer John Russo, among others, to register a copyright for this restoration. And Janus Films and its sister company Criterion licensed the movie from Image Ten. So this is the only edition of the film that yields revenue to all its original creators.And it does, in fact, look amazing. \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d broke new horror ground with its story of a group of strangers trying to work together to fend off a mysterious attack by risen corpses determined to feast on the living. Its influence is felt on just about every zombie movie since. Yes, it was a low-budget picture, but it was made by artists who knew what they were doing.The restoration doesn\u2019t make the movie look slick, but it gets the true, sharp contrasts of the cinematography. This imbues much of the movie with what was then recognized as a documentary-style realism, which bolsters the emotional power of the tale. When I interviewed Mr. Romero about the restoration, he said, with affection in his voice: \u201cThe movie\u2019s pimples do show. There\u2019s a copy of the script visible in one of the frames! I won\u2019t tell where. It will be a little challenge for the fans to spot it.\u201dOn a recent viewing of the restoration, I was able to spot it \u2014 although for a while I didn\u2019t think I would, so engrossed was I, even after probably dozens of viewings. I won\u2019t reveal its exact whereabouts, except to say it\u2019s after the movie\u2019s 75-minute mark.And the FilmStruck/Criterion Channel presentation also offers some supplements that are on the Blu-ray package. There\u2019s a nearly half-hour video featuring the filmmakers Frank Darabont, Guillermo del Toro and Robert Rodriguez, expounding on the movie\u2019s influence. You can also watch \u201cNight of Anubis,\u201d a 16-millimeter \u201cwork print\u201d of \u201cLiving Dead\u201d under a different title. It\u2019s raggedy looking and only minimally different in content to the finished film, but it\u2019s of interest to fans who want to peer into the filmmakers\u2019 process; Russell Streiner, one of the film\u2019s producers, who also plays the memorable role of Johnny, who has the car keys, gives a thorough introduction to the supplement.So yes \u2014 the FilmStruck/Criterion Channel \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d is the one to see. And it is, in the parlance of Criterion, \u201cdirector approved\u201d \u2014 Mr. Romero, who died in July 2017, did sign off on this version. You will not be disappointed to see the movie as he intended.Advertisement"}

But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval.However, Fox\u2019s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast\u2019s opportunity.Whom to thank for the Comcast bidCritics\u2019 cornerMarket reactionComcast investors don\u2019t seem pleasantly surprised. Shares of Comcast are down 5.2 percent. Sky\u2019s stock popped nearly 20 percent and is now trading above Comcast\u2019s offer.When Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval.Congress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit.A tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump.\u201cIn gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.\u201d(F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.)Update from the hearingIn this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond.He followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: \u201cFiscal policy changes can have an effect.\u201d He also said: \u201cWe really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. \u201cWe don\u2019t do fiscal policy at the Fed,\u201d he said.\u2014 Peter EavisThe details\u2022 \u201cRing has raised $209 million so far and was last valued at $760 million, according to Pitchbook.\u201d\u2022 Amazon\u2019s Alexa Fund, which invests in startups that make Alexa compatible devices, was an investor.\u2022 Amazon plans to have Ring operate as a separate business, much as Zappos and Twitch do.Ms. Bartiromo, then, followed up with:Mr. Schultz is one of a number of business executives and celebrities long speculated to be considering a run for president in 2020. The list has included Oprah Winfrey, Mark Cuban, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Bob Iger of Disney and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.On other topicsThe tweet from Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia, Delta\u2019s home state, shows that it isn\u2019t easy for companies to find a balance between those who want corporate America to push for more gun control and those who think conservatives are being unfairly maligned.The policy flyaroundIf Cfius intervenes, it would sidestep Broadcom\u2019s move to relocate its headquarters to the U.S., which critics said was aimed in part at preventing such a review. (Broadcom\u2019s C.E.O., Hock Tan, said the redomiciling would happen even if the deal didn\u2019t go through.)More from Diane Bartz of Reuters:Part of the CFIUS\u2019 current concern, which is echoed in Cornyn\u2019s letter, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm\u2019s 11-member board.That\u2019s what Larry Hutcher, a corporate lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said of the last-minute turmoil that sank an investor group\u2019s bid for The Weinstein Company and led the embattled studio to plan a corporate bankruptcy filing.Beijing\u2019s takeover of the troubled Anbang Insurance Group is another sign that deal making by that country\u2019s moguls is slowing to a halt. It\u2019s not just the Chinese government\u2019s fears of overspending by homegrown businesses, but also growing skepticism from officials in the United States and elsewhere.\u201cRegulators will naturally be somewhat concerned by the reality that often there is an asymmetry of information about the Chinese firms operating internationally,\u201d said Jeremy Stevens, an economist for Standard Bank Group in Beijing. \u201cThis event further underlines this truth,\u201d he added.The China flyaroundTakeaway: the SEC did indeed informally indicate to Circle that regulators would \u201cnot pursue any enforcement action for prior activity\u201d at Poloniex as long as Circle cleans up Poloniex and turns it into a regulated exchange.The SEC seems to be saying here that it\u2019s okay if you broke the rules, as long as you get acquired by a legitimate player before we crack down on you.The virtual currency flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Teenagers Are Learning From Online Porn", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "FeatureAmerican adolescents watch much more pornography than their parents know \u2014 and it\u2019s shaping their ideas about pleasure, power and intimacy. Can they be taught to see it more critically?Supported byBut around 10th grade, it began bothering Drew, an honor-roll student who loves baseball and writing rap lyrics and still confides in his mom, that porn influenced how he thought about girls at school. Were their breasts, he wondered, like the ones in porn? Would girls look at him the way women do in porn when they had sex? Would they give him blow jobs and do the other stuff he saw?Drew, who asked me to use one of his nicknames, was a junior when I first met him in late 2016, and he told me some of this one Thursday afternoon, as we sat in a small conference room with several other high school boys, eating chips and drinking soda and waiting for an after-school program to begin. Next to Drew was Q., who asked me to identify him by the first initial of his nickname. He was 15, a good student and a baseball fan, too, and pretty perplexed about how porn translated into real life. Q. hadn\u2019t had sex \u2014 he liked older, out-of-reach girls, and the last time he had a girlfriend was in sixth grade, and they just fooled around a bit. So he wasn\u2019t exactly in a good position to ask girls directly what they liked. But as he told me over several conversations, it wasn\u2019t just porn but rough images on Snapchat, Facebook and other social media that confused him. Like the GIF he saw of a man pushing a woman against a wall with a girl commenting: \u201cI want a guy like this.\u201d And the one Drew mentioned of the \u201cpain room\u201d in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d with a caption by a girl: \u201cThis is awesome!\u201dWatching porn also heightened Q.\u2019s performance anxiety. \u201cYou are looking at an adult,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe guys are built and dominant and have a big penis, and they last a long time.\u201d And if you don\u2019t do it like the guys in porn, Drew added, \u201cyou fear she\u2019s not going to like you.\u201dLeaning back in his chair, Drew said some girls acted as if they wanted some thug rather than a smart, sensitive guy. But was it true desire? Was it posturing? Was it what girls thought they were supposed to want? Neither Q. nor Drew knew. A couple of seats away, a sophomore who had been quiet until then added that maybe the girls didn\u2019t know either. \u201cI think social media makes girls think they want something,\u201d he said, noting he hadn\u2019t seen porn more than a handful of times and disliked it. \u201cBut I think some of the girls are afraid.\u201d\u201cIt gets in your head,\u201d Q. said. \u201cIf this girl wants it, then maybe the majority of girls want it.\u201d He\u2019d heard about the importance of consent in sex, but it felt pretty abstract, and it didn\u2019t seem as if it would always be realistic in the heat of the moment. Out of nowhere was he supposed to say: Can I pull your hair? Or could he try something and see how a girl responded? He knew that there were certain things \u2014 \u201cbig things, like sex toys or anal\u201d \u2014 that he would not try without asking.\u201cI would just do it,\u201d said another boy, in jeans and a sweatshirt. When I asked what he meant, he said anal sex. He assumed that girls like it, because the women in porn do.\u201cI would never do something that looked uncomfortable,\u201d Drew said, jumping back into the conversation. \u201cI might say, \u2018I\u2019ve seen this in porn \u2014 do you want to try it?\u2019\u2009\u201dIt was almost 4 p.m., and the boys started to gather their backpacks to head to a class known as Porn Literacy. The course, with the official title The Truth About Pornography: A Pornography-Literacy Curriculum for High School Students Designed to Reduce Sexual and Dating Violence, is a recent addition to Start Strong, a peer-leadership program for teenagers headquartered in Boston\u2019s South End and funded by the city\u2019s public-health agency. About two dozen selected high school students attend every year, most of them black or Latino, along with a few Asian students, from Boston public high schools, including the city\u2019s competitive exam schools, and a couple of parochial schools. During most of the year, the teenagers learn about healthy relationships, dating violence and L.G.B.T. issues, often through group discussions, role-playing and other exercises.But for around two hours each week, for five weeks, the students \u2014 sophomores, juniors and seniors \u2014 take part in Porn Literacy, which aims to make them savvier, more critical consumers of porn by examining how gender, sexuality, aggression, consent, race, queer sex, relationships and body images are portrayed (or, in the case of consent, not portrayed) in porn.Besides, there\u2019s a decent chance your parents don\u2019t think you are watching porn. Preliminary analysis of data from a 2016 Indiana University survey of more than 600 pairs of children and their parents reveals a parental na\u00efvet\u00e9 gap: Half as many parents thought their 14- and 18-year-olds had seen porn as had in fact watched it. And depending on the sex act, parents underestimated what their kids saw by as much as 10 times.What teenagers see on Pornhub depends partly on algorithms and the clips they\u2019ve clicked on in the past. Along with stacks of videos on the opening page, there are several dozen categories (\u201cteen,\u201d \u201canal,\u201d \u201cblonde,\u201d \u201cgirl on girl,\u201d \u201cebony,\u201d \u201cmilf\u201d) that can take them to more than six million videos. The clips tend to be short, low on production value, free and, though Pornhub tries to prevent it, sometimes pirated from paid sites. Many of the heterosexual videos are shot from the male point of view, as if the man were holding the camera while he has sex with a woman whose main job, via oral sex, intercourse or anal sex, is to make him orgasm. Plot lines are thin to nonexistent as the camera zooms in for up-close shots of genitals and penetration that are repetitive, pounding and \u2014 though perhaps not through the eyes of a 14-year-old \u2014 banal. (There are alternative narratives in L.G.B.T. and feminist porn, and studies show that for gay and bisexual youth, porn can provide affirmation that they are not alone in their sexual desires.)We don\u2019t have many specifics on what kids actually view, in large part because it\u2019s extremely difficult to get federal funding for research on children and pornography. A few years ago, frustrated by the dearth of large, recent United States studies, Rashida Jones, Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus, creators of the 2017 Netflix documentary series \u201cHot Girls Wanted: Turned On,\u201d about technology and porn, paired with several foundations and philanthropists to fund a national survey about porn viewing, sexual attitudes and behaviors. As part of the survey, led by Debby Herbenick, a professor at the Indiana University School of Public Health and director of the university\u2019s Center for Sexual Health Promotion, along with her colleague Bryant Paul, 614 teenagers ages 14 to 18 reported what their experiences were with porn. In preliminary data analysis from the study (Herbenick is submitting an academic paper for publication this year), of the roughly 300 who did watch porn, one-quarter of the girls and 36 percent of the boys said they had seen videos of men ejaculating on women\u2019s faces (known as \u201cfacials\u201d), Paul says. Almost one-third of both sexes saw B.D.S.M. (bondage, domination, sadism, masochism), and 26 percent of males and 20 percent of females watched videos with double penetration, described in the study as one or more penises or objects in a woman\u2019s anus and/or in her vagina. Also, 31 percent of boys said they had seen \u201cgang bangs,\u201d or group sex, and \u201crough oral sex\u201d (a man aggressively thrusting his penis in and out of a mouth); less than half as many girls had.The Indiana University national survey of teenagers asked about other sex behaviors as well. Though the data have not been fully analyzed, preliminary findings suggest that of the teenagers who had had sex, around one-sixth of boys said they had ejaculated on someone\u2019s face or choked a sex partner. The survey didn\u2019t define choking, but the high school and college-age students I spoke to referred to it as anything from placing a hand gently on a partner\u2019s neck to squeezing it.We don\u2019t have longitudinal data on the frequency of ejaculating on a girl\u2019s face or choking among American teenagers to know whether either practice is more common now. And, as David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, told me, fewer teenagers have early sex than in the past (in a recent study, 24 percent of American ninth graders had sex; in 1995 about 37 percent had), and arrests of teenagers for sexual assault are also down. But you don\u2019t have to believe that porn leads to sexual assault or that it\u2019s creating a generation of brutal men to wonder how it helps shape how teenagers talk and think about sex and, by extension, their ideas about masculinity, femininity, intimacy and power.Over the year in which I spoke to dozens of older teenagers at Start Strong and around the country, many said that both porn and mainstream media \u2014 everything from the TV show \u201cFamily Guy\u201d (which references choking and anal sex) to Nicki Minaj\u2019s song \u201cTruffle Butter\u201d (with an apparent allusion to anal sex followed by vaginal sex) to the lyrics in Rihanna\u2019s \u201cS&M\u201d (\u201cSticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me\u201d) \u2014 made anal and rough sex seem almost commonplace. Drew told me he got the sense that girls wanted to be dominated not only from reading a few pages of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d but also from watching the movie \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith,\u201d with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. \u201cShe\u2019s on the table, and she\u2019s getting pounded by him. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve seen growing up.\u201dIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that some adolescents use porn as a how-to guide. In a study that Rothman carried out in 2016 of 72 high schoolers ages 16 and 17, teenagers reported that porn was their primary source for information about sex \u2014 more than friends, siblings, schools or parents.\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to learn about sex,\u201d the suburban boy told me. \u201cAnd porn stars know what they are doing.\u201d His words reflect a paradox about sex and pornography in this country. Even as smartphones have made it easier for teenagers to watch porn, sex education in the United States \u2014 where abstinence-based sex education remains the norm \u2014 is meager. Massachusetts is among 26 states that do not mandate sex ed. And a mere 13 require that the material be medically and scientifically accurate. After some gains by the Obama administration to promote more comprehensive sex ed, which includes pregnancy prevention, discussions of anatomy, birth control, disease prevention, abstinence and healthy relationships, the Trump administration did not include the program in its proposed 2018 budget; it also has requested increased funding for abstinence education. Easy-to-access online porn fills the vacuum, making porn the de facto sex educator for American youth.In the first class, Daley led an exercise in which the group defined porn terms (B.D.S.M., kink, soft-core, hard-core), so that, as she put it, \u201ceveryone is on the same page\u201d and \u201cyou can avoid clicking on things you don\u2019t want to see.\u201d The students also \u201cvalues voted\u201d \u2014 agreeing or disagreeing about whether the legal viewing age of 18 for porn is too high, if working in the porn industry is a good way to make money and if pornography should be illegal. Later, Daley held up images of a 1940s pinup girl, a Japanese geisha and Kim Kardashian, to talk about how cultural values about beauty and bodies change over time. In future classes, they would talk about types of intimacy not depicted in porn and nonsexist pickup lines. Finally, Daley would offer a lesson about sexting and sexting laws and the risks of so-called revenge porn (in which, say, a teenager circulates a naked selfie of an ex without consent). And to the teenagers\u2019 surprise, they learned that receiving or sending consensual naked photos, even to your boyfriend or girlfriend, can be against the law if the person in the photo is a minor.Now, in the third week of class, Daley\u2019s goal was to undercut porn\u2019s allure for teenagers by exposing the underbelly of the business. \u201cWhen you understand it\u2019s not just two people on the screen but an industry,\u201d she told me, \u201cit\u2019s not as sexy.\u201dTo that end, Daley started class by detailing a midlevel female performer\u2019s salary (taken from the 2008 documentary \u201cThe Price of Pleasure\u201d): \u201cBlow job: $300,\u201d Daley read from a list. \u201cAnal: $1,000. Double penetration: $1,200. Gang bang: $1,300 for three guys. $100 for each additional guy.\u201d\u201cWow,\u201d Drew muttered. \u201cThat makes it nasty now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing for being penetrated on camera,\u201d another boy said.Then, as if they had been given a green light to ask about a world that grown-ups rarely acknowledge, they began peppering Daley, Rothman and Alder with questions.\u201cHow much do men get paid?\u201d one girl asked. It is the one of the few professions in which men are paid less, Rothman explained, but they also typically have longer careers. How long do women stay in their jobs? On average, six to 18 months. How do guys get erections if they aren\u2019t turned on? Often Viagra, Rothman offered, and sometimes a \u201cfluffer,\u201d as an offscreen human stimulator is known.Daley then asked the teenagers to pretend they were contestants on a reality-TV show, in which they had to decide if they were willing to participate in certain challenges (your parents might be watching) and for how much money. In one scenario, she said, you would kneel on the ground while someone poured a goopy substance over your face. In another, you\u2019d lick a spoon that had touched fecal matter. The kids debated the fecal-matter challenge \u2014 most wouldn\u2019t to do it for less than $2 million. One wanted to know if the goop smelled. \u201cCan we find out what it is?\u201d asked another.Then Daley explained that each was in fact a simulation of a porn act. The goopy substance was what\u2019s called a \u201cbaker\u2019s dozen,\u201d in which 13 men ejaculate on a woman\u2019s face, breasts and mouth.\u201cWhat?\u201d a girl named Tiffany protested.The second scenario \u2014 licking the spoon with fecal matter \u2014 was from a porn act known as A.T.M., in which a man puts his penis in a woman\u2019s anus and then immediately follows by sticking it in her mouth.\u201cNo way,\u201d a 15-year-old boy said. \u201cCan\u2019t you wash in between?\u201dNope, Daley said.\u201cWe don\u2019t question it when we see it in porn, right?\u201d Daley went on. \u201cThere\u2019s no judgment here, but some of you guys are squeamish about it.\u201d\u201cI never knew any of this,\u201d Drew said, sounding a bit glum.Daley went on to detail a 2010 study that coded incidents of aggression in best-selling 2004 and 2005 porn videos. She noted that 88 percent of scenes showed verbal or physical aggression, mostly spanking, slapping and gagging. (A more recent content analysis of more than 6,000 mainstream online heterosexual porn scenes by Bryant Paul and his colleagues defined aggression specifically as any purposeful action appearing to cause physical or psychological harm to another person and found that 33 percent of scenes met that criteria. In each study, women were on the receiving end of the aggression more than 90 percent of the time.)\u201cDo you think,\u201d Daley said, standing in front of the students, \u201cwatching porn leads to violence against women? There\u2019s no right or wrong here. It\u2019s a debate.\u201dKyrah, a 10th-grade feminist with an athlete\u2019s compact body and a tendency to speak her opinions, didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIn porn they glamorize calling women a slut or a whore, and younger kids think this is how it is. Or when they have those weird porn scenes and the woman is saying, \u2018Stop touching me,\u2019 and then she ends up enjoying it!\u201dTiffany, her best friend, snapped her fingers in approval.\u201cYes and no,\u201d one guy interjected. \u201cWhen a man is choking a woman in porn, people know it is not real, and they aren\u2019t supposed to do it, because it\u2019s violence.\u201d He was the same teenager who told me he would just \u201cdo\u201d anal sex without asking a girl, because the women in porn like it.For years, Gallop has been a one-woman laboratory witnessing how easy-to-access mainstream porn influences sex. Now in her 50s, she has spent more than a decade dating 20-something men. She finds them through \u201ccougar\u201d dating sites \u2014 where older women connect with younger men \u2014 and her main criterion is that they are \u201cnice.\u201d Even so, she told me, during sex with these significantly younger nice men, she repeatedly encounters porn memes: facials, \u201cjackhammering\u201d intercourse, more frequent requests for anal sex and men who seem less focused on female orgasms than men were when she was younger. Gallop takes it upon herself to \u201cre-educate,\u201d as she half-jokingly puts it, men raised on porn. Some people, of course, do enjoy these acts. But speaking of teenagers in particular, she told me she worries that hard-core porn leads many girls to think, for example, that \u201call boys love coming on girls\u2019 faces, and all girls love having their faces come on. And therefore, girls feel they must let boys come on their face and pretend to like it.\u201dThough none of the boys I spoke to at Start Strong told me they had ejaculated on a girl\u2019s face, Gallop\u2019s words reminded me of conversations I had with some older high-schoolers in various cities. One senior said that ejaculating on a woman\u2019s face was in a majority of porn scenes he had watched, and that he had done it with a girlfriend. \u201cI brought it up, or she would say, \u2018Come on my face.\u2019 It was an aspect I liked \u2014 and she did, too.\u201dAnother noted that the act is \u201ctalked about a lot\u201d among guys, but said that \u201ca girl\u2019s got to be down with it\u201d before he\u2019d ever consider doing it. \u201cThere is something that\u2019s appealing for guys. The dominance and intimacy and that whole opportunity for eye contact. Guys are obsessed with their come displayed on a girl.\u201dMany girls at Start Strong were decidedly less enthusiastic. One senior told me a boyfriend asked to ejaculate on her face; she said no. And during a conversation I had with three girls, one senior wondered aloud: \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t want a facial? What are you supposed to do? Friends say a boy cleans it with a napkin. A lot of girls my age like facials.\u201d But a few moments later, she reversed course. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think they like it. They do it because their partner likes it.\u201d Next to her, a sophomore added that when older girls talk among themselves, many say it\u2019s gross. \u201cBut they say you gotta do what you gotta do.\u201d And if you don\u2019t, the first girl added, \u201cthen someone else will.\u201dDrew had firsthand experience with what he had seen in porn not translating into actual pleasure. The first time he had sex, he thought he was supposed to exert some physical control over his girlfriend. But the whole thing felt awkward, too rough and not all that fun. And things that looked easy in porn, like sex while taking a shower or mutual oral sex, didn\u2019t go so well.At one point during sex, Drew\u2019s girlfriend at the time, who was a year older and more experienced, asked him to put his hand around her neck during sex. He did it, without squeezing, and though it didn\u2019t exactly bother him, it felt uncomfortable. Drew never asked if she got the idea from porn, but it made him wonder. Had she also picked up other ways of acting? \u201cLike, how do you really know a girl has had a good time?\u201d he said one afternoon, musing aloud while sitting with some friends before Porn Literacy class. \u201cMy girlfriend said she had a good time,\u201d he went on. \u201cShe was moaning. But that\u2019s the thing: Is it fake moaning?\u201dEven if you know porn isn\u2019t realistic, it still sets up expectations, one senior told me. In porn, he said, \u201cthe clothes are off, and the girl goes down on the guy, he gets hard and he starts having sex with her. It\u2019s all very simple and well lit.\u201d Before he had sex, porn had supplied his images of oral sex, including scenes in which a woman is on her knees as a man stands over her. At one point, he thought that\u2019s how it might go one day when he had sex. But when he talked with his girlfriend, they realized they didn\u2019t want to re-enact that power dynamic.Aside from some private schools and innovative community programs, relatively few sex-ed classes in middle and high school delve in detail into anatomy (female, especially), intimacy, healthy relationships, sexual diversity. Even more rare are discussions of female desire and pleasure. Porn taught A. the basics of masturbation. And porn served as her study guide when she was 16 and was the first among her friends to have sex. She clicked through videos to watch women giving oral sex. She focused on how they moved during sex and listened to how they moaned. She began shaving her vulva (\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone in porn have sex with hair on it\u201d).Porn is \u201cnot all bad,\u201d said A., who was frank and funny, with a slew of advanced-placement classes on her transcript and a self-assured manner that impresses adults. \u201cI got my sexual ways from porn, and I like the way I am.\u201d But what she learned from porn had downsides too. Because she assumed women\u2019s pleasure in porn was real, when she first had intercourse and didn\u2019t have an orgasm, she figured that was just how it went.For A., it wasn\u2019t enough to know that porn was fake sex. She wanted to understand how real sex worked. Rothman and her team did consult a sex educator while they were writing the Porn Literacy curriculum but decided to include only some basic information about safe sex. It came in the form of a \u201cPorn Jeopardy\u201d game during one class. The teenagers, clustered in teams, chose from four categories: S.T.D./S.T.I.s, Birth Control, Teen Violence/Sexual Assault and Porn on the Brain.\u201cS.T.I.s/S.T.D.s for $300,\u201d one student called out.\u201cWhy is lubrication important for sex?\u201d Alder asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s lubrication?\u201d Drew asked.\u201cIt\u2019s lube,\u201d another teenager said, in an attempt to explain.\u201cIs lubrication only the little tube-y things?\u201d a girl with long black hair asked. \u201cOr can it be natural?\u201d\u201cI never learned this before,\u201d Drew announced to the class after it was mentioned that lubrication decreased friction, increased pleasure and could reduce the risk of tearing and therefore of S.T.I.s and S.T.D.s. Drew\u2019s only sliver of sex ed was in sixth grade with the school gym teacher, who sweated as he talked about sex, \u201cand it was all about it being bad and we shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201dAs if to rectify that, Alder offered a quick anatomy lesson, drawing a vulva on the whiteboard and pointing out the clitoris, the vagina, the urethra. \u201cThis is called a vulva,\u201d she said. Alder repeated the word slowly and loudly, as if instructing the students in a foreign language. It was both for humor and to normalize a word that some of them may have been hearing for the first time. \u201cThis is the clitoris,\u201d Alder went on. \u201cThis is where women get most pleasure. Most women do not have a G spot. If you want to know how to give a woman pleasure, it\u2019s the clitoris.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d Rothman said quietly. Alder had just inched across a line in which anatomy rested on one side and female desire and pleasure on the other. It was a reminder that as controversial as it is to teach kids about pornography, it can be more taboo to teach them how their bodies work sexually. \u201cThe class is about critically analyzing sexually explicit media,\u201d Rothman told me later, \u201cnot how to have sex. We want to stay in our narrow lane and not be seen as promoting anything parents are uncomfortable with.\u201d Daley added: \u201cI wish it were different, but we have to be aware of the limitations of where we are as a society.\u201dThe most recent sex-education guidelines from the World Health Organization\u2019s European office note that educators should include discussions about the influence of pornography on sexuality starting with late elementary school and through high school. The guidelines don\u2019t, however, provide specific ideas on how to have those conversations.In Britain, nonprofit organizations and a teachers\u2019 union, along with members of Parliament, have recommended that schools include discussions about the influence of porn on how children view sex and relationships. Magdalena Mattebo, a researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden who studies pornography and adolescents, would like porn literacy mandated in her country. \u201cWe are a little lost in how to handle this,\u201d Mattebo told me.More than 300 schools, youth and community groups and government agencies in Australia and New Zealand use components of a porn-education resource called \u201cIn the Picture\u201d that includes statistics, studies and exercises primarily for teenagers. It was created by Maree Crabbe, an expert on sexual violence and pornography education, who lives near Melbourne, Australia. As she put it during a United States training program for educators and social workers that I attended in 2016: \u201cWe want to be positive about sex, positive about masturbation and critical of pornography.\u201d One key component of the program is often neglected in porn literacy: providing training to help parents understand and talk about these issues.Last year, a feminist porn producer, Erika Lust, in consultation with sex educators, created a porn-education website for parents. The Porn Conversation links to research and articles and provides practical tips for parents, including talking to kids about the ways mainstream porn doesn\u2019t represent typical bodies or mutually satisfying sex and avoiding accusatory questions about why your kid is watching porn and who showed it to them. \u201cWe can\u2019t just say, \u2018I don\u2019t like mainstream porn because it\u2019s chauvinistic,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Lust, whose films feature female-centered pleasure. \u201cWe have given our children technology, so we need to teach them how to handle it.\u201d But she takes it a step further by suggesting that parents of middle- and high-schoolers talk to their teenagers about \u201chealthy porn,\u201d which she says includes showing female desire and pleasure and being made under fair working conditions. I asked Lust if she would steer her daughters in that direction when they are older (they are 7 and 10). \u201cI would recommend good sites to my daughters at age 15, when I think they are mature enough. We are so curious to find out about sex. People have doubts and insecurities about themselves sexually. \u2018Is it O.K. that I like that, or this?\u2019 I think porn can be a good thing to have as an outlet. I\u2019m not scared by explicit sex per se. I\u2019m afraid of the bad values.\u201dTristan Taormino, another feminist porn filmmaker and author, speaks frequently on college campuses and produces explicit sex-ed videos for adults. \u201cThe party line is we don\u2019t want teenagers watching our videos,\u201d she says, noting they are rated XXX. \u201cBut do I wish teenagers had access to some of the elements of it?\u201d In addition to seeing consent, she said, \u201cthey would see people talking to each other, and they\u2019d see a lot of warm-up. We show lube, we show sex toys.\u201dThat may be more than most parents, even of older teenagers, can bear. But even if parents decided to help their teenagers find these sites, not only is it illegal to show any kind of porn \u2014 good or bad \u2014 to anyone under 18, but, really, do teenagers want their parents to do so? And which ones would parents recommend for teenagers? \u201cUnlike organic food, there\u2019s no coding system for ethical or feminist porn,\u201d Crabbe notes. \u201cThey might use condoms and dental dams and still convey the same gender and aggression dynamics.\u201d Also, \u201cgood porn\u201d isn\u2019t typically free or nearly as accessible as the millions of videos streaming on mainstream sites.Al Vernacchio, a nationally known sexuality educator who teaches progressive sex ed at a private Quaker school outside Philadelphia, believes the better solution is to make porn literacy part of the larger umbrella of comprehensive sex education. Vernacchio, who is the author of the 2014 book \u201cFor Goodness Sex: Changing the Way We Talk to Teens About Sexuality, Values, and Health,\u201d is one of those rare teenage-sex educators who talks directly to his high school students about sexual pleasure and mutuality, along with the ingredients for healthy relationships. The problem with porn \u201cis not just that it often shows misogynistic, unhealthy representations of relationships,\u201d Vernacchio says. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn relationship skills from porn, and if you are looking for pleasure and connection, porn can\u2019t teach you how to have those.\u201dCrabbe notes one effective way to get young men to take fewer lessons from porn: \u201cTell them if you want to be a lazy, selfish lover, look at porn. If you want to be a lover where your partner says, \u2018That was great,\u2019 you won\u2019t learn it from porn.\u201d And parents should want their teenagers to be generous lovers, Cindy Gallop argues. \u201cOur parents bring us up to have good manners, a work ethic. But nobody brings us up to behave well in bed.\u201dTo prepare his students to be comfortable and respectful in sexual situations, Vernacchio shows photos, not just drawings, of genitalia to his high-schoolers. \u201cMost people are having sex with real people, not porn stars, and real bodies are highly variable. I would much rather my students have that moment of asking questions or confusion or even laughter in my classroom rather than when they see their partner\u2019s naked body for the first time.\u201d He, along with Debby Herbenick, who is also the author of the 2012 book \u201cSex Made Easy: Your Awkward Questions Answered for Better, Smarter Amazing Sex,\u201d advocate that adolescents should understand that most females don\u2019t have orgasms by penetration alone, and that clitoral stimulation often requires oral sex, fingers and sex toys. As she notes: \u201cIt\u2019s part of human life, and you teach it in smart, sensitive ways.\u201dA., the young woman who said she had never seen an image of a penis until she watched porn, resisted the idea that porn was uniformly bad for teenagers. \u201cAt least kids are watching porn and not going out and getting pregnant,\u201d she said. But recently, she told me that she\u2019d given up watching it altogether. She disliked looking at women\u2019s expressions now, believing that they probably weren\u2019t experiencing pleasure and might be in pain. When Drew watched porn, he found himself wondering if women were having sex against their will. As another student said with a sigh: \u201cNicole and Jess ruined porn for us.\u201dIn the months after the class, A. had created a new mission for herself: She was going to always have orgasms during sex. \u201cAnd I did it!\u201d she told me. It helped that she had been in a relationship with a guy who was open and asked what she liked. But even if Porn Literacy didn\u2019t go into as many details about sex as she would have liked, \u201cin this indirect way, the class shows what you deserve and don\u2019t deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cIn porn, the guy cares only about himself. I used to think more about \u2018Am I doing something right or wrong?\u2019\u2009\u201d Porn may neglect women\u2019s orgasms, but A. wasn\u2019t going to anymore.Drew, who had once used porn as his main sex educator, was now thinking about sex differently. \u201cSome things need to come to us naturally, not by watching it and seeing what turns you on,\u201d he told me. The discussions about anatomy and fake displays of pleasure made him realize that girls didn\u2019t always respond as they did in porn and that they didn\u2019t all want the same things. And guys didn\u2019t, either. Maybe that porn clip in which the nice, tender guy didn\u2019t excite the girl was wrong. What Drew needed was a girl who was open and honest, as he was, and with whom he could start to figure out how to have good sex. It would take some time and most likely involve some fumbling. But Drew was O.K. with that. He was just starting out.Maggie Jones is a contributing writer for the magazine and teaches writing at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s M.F.A. program.

Let\u2019s review the week\u2019s tech news.All this got me wondering: What\u2019s the point of cable TV anymore?For a time, cutting the cord was one of those hipster affectations that came with sacrifices. A kind of asceticism was implied in the name. The cord, the familiar cable bundle of yore, required paying a whole lot for a bunch of bad TV you\u2019d never watch, just so you could have very convenient access to the handful of shows you sometimes did watch.Then along came DVDs and the internet, and now you could unbundle \u2014 you\u2019d pay a lot less for just the things you really wanted to see, provided you were O.K. hazarding some minor inconveniences.But as Netflix keeps driving trucks of money to TV\u2019s top producers \u2014 it plans to spend $8 billion on new content this year \u2014 the script has flipped. More and more, it\u2019s the people who haven\u2019t cut the cord who are missing out. Today, if you subscribe just to regular TV and don\u2019t bother with Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other online services, you\u2019re missing some of TV\u2019s biggest and most acclaimed shows. Plus, you\u2019re paying more.Cable subscriptions have been declining for years, and last year the decline accelerated. But the YouTube expansion shows that cutting the cord keeps getting easier, and the Netflix deal shows how non-cable services keep getting more attractive. This suggests an even faster pace of decline for cable. The bottom is going to fall out of the market, probably very soon.Chrome, Google\u2019s popular web browser, can now block ads. This seems weird because Google is the internet\u2019s largest advertising company. So how does an advertising company design ad-blocking software? Very, very carefully, it turns out, in a process rife with conflicts.So Google\u2019s new ad blocker is designed to block some ads, not all of them. The software will eliminate a dozen types of ads that the company deems intrusive or disruptive. But most ads, including most from Google, would skate through just fine.It\u2019s an interesting fight, but it may also be an irrelevant one. What\u2019s unclear is whether Google\u2019s limited ad blocker will stem the rising popularity of more restrictive ad blockers. For many people who hate online ads, it could already be too late for half measures.The New York Times\u2019s tech reporting team is gathering in San Francisco this week for a team-building offsite.

{"Headline": "Children\u2019s Book Industry Has Its #MeToo Moment", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe loudest boom landed Thursday afternoon when Random House said it would not publish any future books by James Dashner, the author of \u201cThe Maze Runner,\u201d a top-selling dystopian science fiction series that was turned into a film trilogy.Mr. Dashner has been working on his first novel directed at adults, \u201cThe Waking,\u201d which had been acquired by Ballantine Books, an imprint of Random House.The industry\u2019s sudden reckoning with the #MeToo movement primarily involved complaints that a long list of prominent writers and editors exploited their power and position at keystone industry events to make sexual advances, particularly toward female authors hoping to further their careers.Some of the accused included well-known writers whose books are found on recommended reading lists at school and library shelves across the country. Among them were Mr. Dashner and Jay Asher, the author of \u201cThirteen Reasons Why,\u201d which was recently made into a Netflix series.The controversy arose at an awkward moment for the industry, which had gathered Monday at the American Library Association\u2019s midwinter meeting in Denver to announce its most coveted awards for children and young adult literature, including the John Newbery and Randolph Caldecott Medals.That afternoon, Lin Oliver, the executive director of the Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators, announced in a statement that Mr. Asher and David Diaz, a prizewinning illustrator, had left the organization for violating its \u201ccode of conduct in regard to harassment.\u201dMr. Asher released a statement through a spokeswoman, Tamara Taylor, calling the society\u2019s description of his departure \u201ccompletely false\u201d and demanding a retraction from Ms. Oliver. Mr. Asher said he was a member in good standing but voluntarily agreed to skip the society\u2019s conferences \u201cin response to hurt feelings of a group of authors with whom he had consensual relationships that ended poorly.\u201dMr. Asher said none of the accusations against him involved harassment. He added that the women involved were all his \u201cpeers,\u201d and that some had pursued him.\u201cI didn\u2019t honor and fully understand boundaries and power dynamics,\u201d he said, and offered an apology and pledged to amend his behavior.Soon after, Random House parted ways with him.As for Mr. Diaz, he temporarily left the Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers a few years ago after a woman complained to the leadership that he had made her feel uncomfortable. He completed a training course about sexual harassment and was put on a yearlong probation.Mr. Diaz said the training had taught him that what he had considered innocent flirtation was perceived much differently.\u201cDon\u2019t call anyone \u2018honey,\u2019 don\u2019t touch anyone, don\u2019t engage in any kind of flirtatious manner,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd after training I understood my only purpose is to talk about books and the craft of making books.\u201dThen, after the #MeToo movement caught fire, the writer Ishta Mercurio-Wentworth told Ms. Oliver of an incident that occurred six years earlier, when Mr. Diaz had touched her hair, said, \u201cYou\u2019re kinky, aren\u2019t you,\u201d and then walked away. Mr. Diaz then sent her an apology.\u201cI do think his response was the appropriate response, and I appreciated that,\u201d Ms. Mercurio-Wentworth said, citing \u201chis honesty and humility.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Diaz said he had felt pressured to resign from the board of the books society.Some of the complaints made public dealt with what women called \u201ccreepy\u201d comments, remarks about their bodies and persistent sexual advances in a work setting or at work-related events.Martha Brockenbrough, an author, said such behavior made it more difficult for women to succeed.\u201cThink about all of the books that haven\u2019t been created by the women who have been driven away, or silenced, or just reduced in spirit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes a lot of courage, focus and discipline to write a book, so when you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable, it\u2019s harder to create.\u201dGarren Hochstetler, the director of Valley Public Library in Valley, Neb., said he planned to buy more books from the authors speaking out about sexual misconduct, starting with an order next week.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing big, but we\u2019re just trying to do a little something where we can,\u201d he said.The flood of allegations was \u201can eye opener, especially for men in the community who were not aware this was happening,\u201d said Gwenda Bond, a writer.For a grass-roots effort, Ms. Bond urged colleagues to sign on to an anti-harassment code of conduct and garnered more than 1,000 signatures.\u201cStories are our business, and stories are really important,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is the moment in the story where the bad guys go down.\u201dOther writers and editors, though, cautioned against lumping in violence, rape and abuse with inappropriate comments and come-ons.\u201cThere needs to be a level of degree and distinction,\u201d Mr. Diaz said, adding that he has been scrupulous about his behavior since the training.\u201cI was stunned, and thought that of course this can\u2019t be me, it\u2019s someone who\u2019s messing with me,\u201d he said.But then a longtime female friend contacted Mr. Cole and reminded him of when he made repeated, aggressive advances until she demanded he stop.\u201cAnd then of course my stomach went into knots, thinking about who else felt this way, and that I had clearly been doing this all this time thinking it was O.K.,\u201d he said.In his blog post, he pledged to donate $500 to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which provides support for victims of sexual harassment, assault or abuse. He said he hoped his posting would convey to victims that \u201calthough they feel like they\u2019re crazy, that they\u2019re overreacting, they\u2019re not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Crazy Idea for Funding Local News: Charge People for It", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe plan, for any would-be entrepreneur brave enough to try it, goes like this: Hire some very good journalists; just one or two are O.K. to start. Turn them loose on a large metropolitan area \u2014 try San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston or any other city going through waves of change, and whose local press has been gutted by digital disruption.Have your reporters cover stuff that no one else is covering, and let them ignore stuff that everyone else is covering. Don\u2019t do movie reviews, stock market analysis, Super Bowl coverage or anything else that isn\u2019t local. Instead, emphasize coverage that\u2019s actionable, that residents deem necessary and valuable for short- and long-term planning \u2014 especially an obsessive focus on housing and development, transportation, education and local politics.Package it all in a form that commands daily attention \u2014 probably a morning email newsletter \u2014 and sprinkle it with a sense of community, like offline and online networking events for readers.How will you fund all of this? This is the most important part: Shun advertising. Instead, ask readers to pay for it with real money \u2014 $5 or $10 a month, or perhaps even more. It will take time, but if you build it right, you just might create the next great metropolitan news organization.This plan may sound simplistic, almost like a joke. Wait, Sherlock, your big idea is to create a really good product and charge people money for it? Haven\u2019t people tried this before?Less than you might think. The short history of digital media is lousy with advertising, which promotes all the wrong incentives for online news \u2014 volume over curation, aggregation over original coverage, speed over accuracy.Yet few entrepreneurs have jumped on the subscription bandwagon for local news. The reluctance makes sense; local markets are by definition small, and journalism is expensive.But after studying Ms. Lessin\u2019s and Mr. Thompson\u2019s methods, I suspect there\u2019s a market for subscription-based local coverage. Someone just has to build it.How? Consider Ms. Lessin\u2019s plan for The Information, the tech news service she started in 2013 after spending eight years at The Wall Street Journal. Back then, online subscriptions seemed antiquated; many companies had experimented with charging users, but most had failed to win large numbers of subscribers, and the big money in media was in ad-supported sites aiming for rapid expansion through viral traffic.\u201cPeople thought no one would pay for news, especially tech news,\u201d Ms. Lessin told me last month. \u201cThe problem was the news business hadn\u2019t been focused on a key question: How do I deliver a differentiated product that people would pay for?\u201dHer idea for differentiation was to charge a lot for The Information \u2014 a subscription is $399 a year, close to what The Wall Street Journal charges for print delivery \u2014 but she would offer readers quality instead of volume.The Information publishes just two or three stories a day, often scoops and analysis, including a handy daily roundup of the most important stories in tech that day.Mr. Thompson\u2019s overhead is low: He is the only writer of Stratechery, which has become required reading among tech executives and many others in the industry. He declined to divulge any subscriber numbers, other than to say he\u2019s doing very well.A high-priced subscription site may well have a natural audience ceiling. Ms. Lessin declined to divulge her subscriber base but said it was \u201csignificantly north of 10,000,\u201d which is lower than the audience for many ad-based digital publications.Sure, there are reasons to be skeptical that this model could work in local news. Many subscribers to The Information and Stratechery think of the publications as a business expense \u2014 they work in tech or finance, wealthy industries that will pay just about anything for business intelligence.Yet there are striking overlaps between what those publications do and what a subscription-based local news start-up would look like. For one thing, a lot of those wealthy people also live in undercovered urban and suburban areas; if they\u2019re paying for news about tech, wouldn\u2019t they also pay for in-depth investigations into their kids\u2019 school district, their city\u2019s mayoral race or the traffic clogging their commute?There\u2019s also the opportunity to pay for a sense of community. The Information \u2014 through the Slack chat service, conference calls and in-person meet-ups \u2014 constantly brings subscribers together to talk about the industry. A local news start-up could do the same, selling not just news but a sense of belonging.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the subscription news business, you\u2019re not selling articles,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Why do they pay?\u201cNews happens in tech every day, and I do the thinking for them,\u201d he said. A subscription-based local news business would offer the same value: \u201cYou\u2019re selling people a feeling of being informed, of being good citizens \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re selling.\u201dNow we just need someone to build it.Advertisement"}

As a preteen I walked the white sand beaches of Naples, Fla., where my family had moved from West Virginia. I scanned not for seashells but for the titles of paperbacks splayed on beach chairs and sandy towels. The covers were spotted with suntan oil and vibrated with the promise of occult knowledge. Mario Puzo\u2019s \u201cThe Godfather\u201d stood out. So did Judith Krantz\u2019s \u201cScruples,\u201d John Jakes\u2019s \u201cThe Bastard\u201d and Jean Auel\u2019s \u201cThe Clan of the Cave Bear.\u201d Over the next few years, like a flying ray, I pounced on copies of each.I\u2019d abandoned the books by J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis that my friends were pushing. Too woo-woo for me. I felt a stab of recognition when as an adult I read, in the playwright David Hare\u2019s memoir, the following: \u201cI couldn\u2019t give a damn who found the rabbit\u2019s foot or the magic mug, or where it was buried. The self-importance got up my nose. Anything valuable to be uncovered was likely to lie in the everyday, the specific.\u201d The valuable if strange things I would uncover, between soft covers, at too tender an age, would be about sex.The sex in the best-selling novels of the 1970s, and in the five years before and after that decade, was wilder and more insistent than it is in the popular fiction of today. You could typically boil a plot down to four salient points:1) I want it.2) How am I going to get it?3) I got it.4) How am I going to get it again?I\u2019ve not spent a great deal of time on psychiatrists\u2019 couches, but were I to hire one in earnest I suspect I\u2019d fill the initial sessions talking about my early paperback reading.You\u2019ve seen Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cGodfather\u201d movies. Have you read Puzo\u2019s novel, which was published in 1969? I was about to discover that it contains an extended subplot about a woman, Lucy Mancini, whose sex organs are so roomy that I feared someone would fall into them, as if they were an immense cannoli.Poor Lucy goes to see a leering doctor, who tells her awful things like, \u201cStop thinking in your head that you have a big box no man can love\u201d and \u201cBaby, I\u2019m going to build you a whole new thing down there\u201d and \u2014 vastly worse than the phrase \u201cstop thinking in your head\u201d \u2014 \u201cthen I\u2019ll try it out personally.\u201dSize is everything in Puzo\u2019s world. Sonny Corleone possesses a penis so titanic that his wife reports:I was an altar boy at St. Ann\u2019s Catholic Church. I began to think harder about the reasons people came to light candles.In Krantz\u2019s novel \u201cScruples\u201d (1978), there\u2019s a lot of rough sex of the \u201cplunged up into her savagely\u201d variety, even if no one calls anything macaroni. The \u201csecret smell\u201d of a man\u2019s \u201cpouchy globes\u201d was important to her characters. I wondered if I should up my hygiene game. \u201cUntil a woman has smelled a man precisely there, she thought, driftingly, she can\u2019t know him,\u201d Krantz wrote. The phrase \u201cshe thought, driftingly,\u201d can be mentally applied, by the way, to every sentence Krantz wrote.\u201cScruples\u201d alerted me to the international lesbian cabal. I suspected it was like the Shriners Club, to which my grandfather belonged, but with better fezzes. Krantz wrote about Harriet Toppingham, a fashion editor and a woman of \u201cuncompromising ugliness\u201d:\u201cThey had no means of knowing that Harriet was a member of the most hidden of all major sexual subgroups, an international network of middle-aged and powerful lesbians, women who range from the late 30s to the early 60s, women in high positions of authority or fame, all of whom know each other or know of each other, whether they live in New York, London, Paris or Los Angeles.\u201dThis passage inserted two questions into my mind: What are the other major sexual subgroups? And: How can I meet lesbians?An underrated book, among the mad pop masterpieces of the 1970s, is David Seltzer\u2019s novelization of \u201cThe Omen\u201d (1976). It\u2019s based on his own screenplay for the movie, about an adopted boy who, bad luck for everyone involved, is the Antichrist.Early on one man watches another perform a \u201cstrange and repulsive ritual\u201d \u2014 urinating onto his hands and washing his genitals with the urine. The man turns and says: \u201cTaught me this in the R.A.F. It\u2019s as good as penicillin.\u201d I tucked this information, curiously omitted from the Boy Scout Handbook, into my pocket.\u201cThe Omen\u201d explains how much people, especially men, like to hit each other. Sexual pleasure derived from beatings was a topic that would turn up again and again in these novels. In \u201cThe Omen,\u201d a missionary named Edgardo Emilio Tassone \u2014 who had \u201cthe fear of God literally beaten into him\u201d as a boy \u2014 goes to work in a \u201csoutheast corner of Africa.\u201d On Page 95, I read, squirming:\u201cHe beat them as he was beaten and came to realize that in the heat of religious ecstasy he took sexual pleasure in their pain. Among the young African converts, one came to worship him, and they shared carnal pleasure, defiling the primitive laws of Man and God. The boy\u2019s name was Tobu, of the Kikuyu tribe. When he and Tassone were found together, the boy was ceremonially mutilated, his scrotum opened and his testicles removed; the boy was forced to eat them while his warrior brothers looked on. Tassone himself barely escaped, word reaching him in Somalia that the Kikuyu had seized a Franciscan monk and skinned him alive in Tassone\u2019s stead. After skinning him, they made him walk until he finally fell dead.\u201d To this day I can stand to read, just barely, most torture scenes in novels. But I cannot read even a sentence about flaying. (\u201cLast week I saw a woman flayed,\u201d Jonathan Swift wrote in \u201cA Tale of a Tub,\u201d \u201cand you will hardly believe how much it altered her person for the worst.\u201d)Let\u2019s close with Auel\u2019s \u201cThe Clan of the Cave Bear\u201d (1980), possibly the worst novel I\u2019ve read all the way through. In it, a Neanderthal named Broud moves in on a young woman named Ayla and starts clouting her. It\u2019s a turn-on, so he keeps clouting. \u201cNever had he felt so stimulated \u2014 violence increased his passion and lust added force to his blows.\u201d He finished with a \u201cfinal agonized scream.\u201dWith a final agonized scream of my own, I put these books away. I would come to miss their exuberance if little else. My gateway drug, in terms of finding better fiction to read, was Scott Spencer\u2019s blessedly good 1979 novel \u201cEndless Love.\u201d No macaroni. No pouchy globes. No clouting. Just beautiful, hot, honest sex writing about, in his words, \u201cthat terror you experience when the possibilities of your life begin to match with the full range of your desire.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tour Marc Maron\u2019s Garage Before He and His Podcast Move", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "Supported byMr. Maron, 54, who has recorded nearly 900 episodes, will continue to produce the podcast in a new garage in a more spacious, two-floor Craftsman home 10 minutes away, but make no mistake, an era is ending.The garage itself has become as much of a character on the podcast as any of the guests. Mr. Maron has mythologized it as a magical and unlikely space, a dive alcove on a hill where guarded celebrities feel free to open up. Images of the garage show up in press photos, but it is perhaps most vivid in the imaginations of his regular listeners. On a recent morning, Mr. Maron gave me a tour of this vanishing landmark, a nostalgic trip that took an aptly dramatic detour when his mother showed up.Mr. Maron, standing near stacks of \u201cPlease Kill Me,\u201d the classic oral history of punk rock he often gives to guests, sounded slightly embarrassed to admit that he wanted a little comfort. Or at least a bathroom, so guests wouldn\u2019t have to use the one inside his home, a sticking point with girlfriends in the past. He says he\u2019s excited to start from scratch, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice the room he\u2019s leaving doubled as a shrine to his past.Along with myriad fan-made portraits, he\u2019s surrounded by photos of relatives and former loves and mementos from botched relationships (the Air Canada receipt accidentally sent to his first wife for a flight to see the woman who\u2019d become his second). There are also awards (a medal from The Harvard Lampoon) and posters from comedy specials like his HBO half-hour (\u201cI was sweaty and weird, and in retrospect it wasn\u2019t great.\u201d)Mr. Maron pointed to a baby photo, this one of his mother, Toby Maron, in a leather chair holding him, gazing at her son with a raised eyebrow. He imagined what she was thinking: \u201cHow do I do this?\u201d he said, adding, \u201cShe never figured it out.\u201dAs it happened, his mother, 76, was visiting from Florida and minutes later, she called and he told her to come on over. After arriving wearing a \u201cGLOW\u201d jacket, she sat in the guest\u2019s chair. \u201cIt\u2019s so uncomfortable, I really couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll these big people sat in that chair, it is beyond my comprehension.\u201dBefore he rebuilt his life in the garage, Mr. Maron considered ending it there. He began his podcast after his second marriage fell apart and his career was languishing. \u201cI was miserably depressed and thought if this doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll kill myself in here,\u201d he said, pointing to where he contemplated suicide, inches from where former President Barack Obama sipped tea. He has enough distance from that now to crack a joke: \u201cBut I always think about suicide, because I find it relaxing.\u201dMr. Maron said he would keep his secondhand bookshelf with the \u201cL.A. County Mental Health\u201d sticker that he never peeled off. The new place has more light and higher ceilings, but Mr. Maron emphasized that it wasn\u2019t a studio. \u201cIt\u2019s still difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still going to deal with people working on the yard outside.\u201dToward the end of the interview in his garage, Ms. Maron said she had her doubts about the move. \u201cHow does this help?\u201d he responded sharply, sounding exasperated but also clearly enjoying the comic potential of this clash. And yet, if this was a bit, she was committed to it: \u201cThis is such a special place,\u201d she said.Mr. Maron turned away from his mother and looked up in the air, this time sounding genuinely annoyed: \u201cJesus!\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an erroneous name among the celebrities Marc Maron interviewed in his garage. He interviewed Robin Williams at the actor's home in Marin Country, Calif., he did not interview him in his garage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ryan Murphy Heads to Netflix in Deal Said to Be Worth Up to $300 Million", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe streaming giant Netflix has won yet another battle against old Hollywood.On Tuesday night, Netflix announced that it had poached the hit-making producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox.The five-year deal is worth as much as $300 million, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. That would be one of the biggest deals ever made for a television producer.While the agreement will come as a disappointment to the studio where Mr. Murphy has spent most of his career, it also delivers a serious blow to the Walt Disney Company, which reached a deal in December to acquire most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion.Mr. Murphy\u2019s contract with Fox expires in the summer, and he will make the move to Netflix in July.The prolific producer behind \u201cGlee,\u201d \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d and the anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d Mr. Murphy would have been a key piece in the expanded Disney empire, and Fox executives made several attempts to keep him in the corporate family. Amazon also courted him seriously, which played a role in driving up the price for the 52-year-old writer, director and producer from Indianapolis.\u201cThe history of this moment is not lost on me,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in a statement. \u201cI am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me.\u201dThe moment was certainly right for someone like Mr. Murphy to find himself in the final months of a contract. The Hollywood economy is buzzing, with fast-moving digital disrupters taking on the studios that have been dependable providers of mass entertainment since the silent-movie era.The upshot is that proven show runners and big stars are in an enviable bargaining position.A factor in Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to join Netflix was the uncertainty brought on by the agreement between Disney and Fox. He had close working relationships with Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox; Dana Walden, the chairwoman of Fox\u2019s TV group (and the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children); and John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX network, a cable channel under the Fox banner.If the Disney-Fox deal wins governmental approval, as expected, it is not a sure thing that those executives will stay in their roles. Mr. Rice said at the Code Media conference on Tuesday that he didn\u2019t know whether he would remain with the company after the planned merger went through.The exclusive, five-year deal for the high-profile producer is yet another coup for Netflix. In addition to signing Ms. Rhimes last summer, the company has brought aboard Dave Chappelle, David Letterman, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler with lucrative deals.Mr. Murphy did not have his hands tied at Fox, which allowed him to push boundaries. And he did not lack for respect: The first season of the FX anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson,\u201d for which Mr. Murphy served as an executive producer, was a huge hit with critics and won nine Emmys. The Netflix deal, though, will allow him potentially bigger budgets and gives him the latitude to try movies, television or even documentaries.In his statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Murphy expressed his gratitude toward Netflix\u2019s chief executive officer, Reed Hastings; its chief content officer, Ted Sarandos; and its vice president for original content, Cindy Holland.\u201cI am awash in genuine appreciation for Ted Sarandos, Reed Hastings and Cindy Holland at Netflix for believing in me and the future of my company, which will continue to champion women, minorities and L.G.B.T.Q. heroes and heroines,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am honored and grateful to continue my partnership with my friends and peers at Fox on my existing shows.\u201dIn his own statement, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cRyan Murphy\u2019s series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history. His unfaltering dedication to excellence and to give voice to the underrepresented, to showcase a unique perspective or just to shock the hell out of us, permeates his genre-shattering work.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s vast slate at Fox will not disappear overnight. All future seasons of \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFeud\u201d will continue to air on FX. His procedural drama, \u201c9-1-1,\u201d which is only six weeks old and is becoming something of a sleeper hit, will continue on Fox. And his new drama about the 1980s New York vogue scene, \u201cPose,\u201d with a largely transgender cast, will proceed at FX.Mr. Murphy began his career as a journalist before moving into television script writing.

{"Headline": "Apple, Alphabet, Amazon Reported Results. Here\u2019s How They Fared: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A tale of three tech companies earnings.\u2022 CBS and Viacom are talking about getting back together.\u2022 A shake-up in Airbnb\u2019s C-suite\u2022 Why Europe matters for Facebook.\u2022 Regulators are worried that Bitcoin\u2019s price is being manipulated.\u2022 Jeff Immelt has gone from C.E.O. to V.C.\u2022 And when will Congress raise the debt ceiling?Apple reported record profit and sales, Amazon easily beat expectations, and Google-parent Alphabet posted a loss because of the new tax law.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:Apple\u2022 $61.6 billion \u2014 Revenue from iPhone sales, up 13 percent from a year earlier.Critics CornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:\u201cApple has long followed Mies van der Rohe\u2019s design precept that \u201cless is more.\u201d Now it\u2019s doing the same financially. The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge. But that\u2019s OK \u2013 persuading customers to pay more arguably requires as much genius as getting people to adopt the technology in the first place.\u201dAmazonCritics cornerRobert Cryan of Breakingviews:Amazon.com is going gangbusters. But some of the nearly $700 billion internet retailer\u2019s fastest-expanding \u2013 and most profitable \u2013 businesses could be ones that irritate users. Over time, that could sully the company\u2019s image.AlphabetCritics cornerJennifer Saba of Breakingviews:Alphabet is stuck at the letter G. The holding company of Google was created to safeguard against conventionality and let moonshot ideas, like self-driving cars, flourish. Almost three years in, it\u2019s basically still just Google. Which means, in turn, that the A in Alphabet stands mainly for advertising.It wouldn\u2019t hurt Alphabet to put more energy into revenue sources that don\u2019t start with a G.Why now\u2022 Walt Disney\u2019s deal for much of 21st Century Fox late last year has sparked much strategic rethinking across the industry. Ms. Redstone believes that CBS and Viacom need greater scale to better compete with Disney, Netflix and Amazon.Critics cornerTara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Gadfly:\u201cCBS isn\u2019t safe from the industry\u2019s broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom won\u2019t provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities. Those synergies may amount to some $500 million based on what past deals have yielded, according to Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. That could create quite a lift for CBS\u2019s earnings.\u201dBelinda Johnson is moving up. Laurence Tosi is moving out. And don\u2019t expect the company to go public this year.Airbnb has hired a search firm to find a new C.F.O. Ellie Mertz, the company\u2019s head of global financial planning, will fill in that role on an interim basis.Between the linesThe context The company lineHere\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Ms. Johnson:\u201cShe takes critical functions that might be seen as constraints in other companies, and clears a path so they can become competitive advantages and facilitate the growth of the business.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a statement from Eric Holder, the former U.S. Attorney General who has been advising the company on anti-discrimination policies:\u201cHaving worked with Belinda over the years and at Airbnb, I have been consistently impressed by her ability to anticipate issues and leverage strategic opportunities. She combines technical expertise with great care for her colleagues.\u201dAnd here\u2019s Mr. Chesky on Mr. Tosi:\u201cHe helped Airbnb establish a rigorous financial discipline, aided our expansion into new businesses including into luxury rentals, which is now one of our core businesses, and helped us develop new and innovative ways to grow Airbnb and our businesses.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedSome of the most consequential battles in the world of technology are playing out in Europe, where governments are cracking down on tech giants like Google and Facebook.Facebook\u2019s quarterly results, released Wednesday, provide crucial information for better understanding the balance of power between Silicon Valley titans and the democracies of Europe.The results clearly showed the importance of the European market to Facebook\u2019s future growth. The company\u2019s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.Facebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe\u2019s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States\u2019, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.All this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.Given how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.That\u2019s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November. To put the Bitcoin\u2019s recent slide in perspective, the cryptocurrency has lost $44 billion in market value last month, according to Bloomberg.The tumble has continued so far in February. Bitcoin is down 11 percent Thursday.More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex.\u201cThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,\u201d said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. \u201cIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.\u201dThe digital money flyaroundDetails, including when and if a deal will come to fruition, remain scant at this point.The contextWhile a potential joint venture between Alphabet and Aramco isn\u2019t necessarily connected to the latter company\u2019s IPO, if a deal is struck before the offering, advisers to the company could pitch the pact as a way for investors to bake in technology valuations.It isn\u2019t clear how setting up tech hubs could fundamentally transform an oil company into a tech company \u2014 and therefore command a higher multiple \u2014 but it\u2019d be interesting to see bankers make that argument.\u2014 Stephen GrocerFrom the release:\u201cI am excited to join NEA because they understand how to work with visionary entrepreneurs to build successful technology and health care enterprises,\u201d Immelt said. \u201cI have a passion for these sectors and I am eager to work with NEA and its partners to develop great businesses, nurture talented leaders and grow diverse teams.\u201dand:\u201cJeff is deeply knowledgeable about the complex global innovation landscape we\u2019re operating in today and he understands how businesses must evolve to compete and win in that environment, particularly across industrial and medical technologies,\u201d said Scott Sandell, Managing General Partner, NEA.(Worth noting: Mr. Immelt\u2019s successor at G.E. is struggling to turn that company around. See below.)\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s where our colleague Peter Eavis says investors should focus:Daily active users in the United States and Canada actually fell to 184 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 185 million in the third quarter of last year. But Facebook still managed to generate a huge amount of revenue from the United States and Canada. The region accounted for $6.4 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Another figure that might cause concern is the growth in capital expenditures, the money a company spends as it invests in new initiatives. Capex hit $2.26 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, a staggering 78 percent jump from the same period in 2016.Today\u2019s a big day for tech earningsThe Treasury secretary argued that the cuts would eventually pay for themselves, but conceded that it wouldn\u2019t happen this year.The policy flyaroundAnalysts\u2019 takes:\u2022 Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch write, \u201cThis shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.\u201d\u2022 Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, \u201cIn short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell\u2019s first press conference.\u201d\u2022 Diane Swonk of Grant Thornton said, \u201cEverything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation.\u201dAnalysts over at Deutsche Bank think so. They wrote in a research note yesterday:As the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), G.E. increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion.G.E. is the last survivor of the index\u2019s 12 original components from when it started in 1896, and has been in it continuously for more than 110 years.\u201cWe will be looking at how the company, from the board on down, handles the allegations,\u201d said Karen Wells, who directs the investigations and enforcement bureau at the state gambling commission.She said allegations in the settlement agreement weren\u2019t disclosed before the commission granted Wynn a license in September 2014, or at any point before The Wall Street Journal report.Shares in Wynn Resorts fell more than 3 percent yesterday.Advertisement"}

Trump might just work out as president, then takes a moment to listen to the silence of the crowd at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. \u201cYeah, I said it,\u201d he adds, in what has become something of a catchphrase for him.Wearing a simple black T-shirt and jeans, Mr. Rock, 53, made his case based not on Mr. Trump\u2019s potential, but rather on how his disastrous tenure could lead to something better, reminding the audience that the mistakes of George W. Bush led to Barack Obama. \u201cPeople overlook George Bush\u2019s contribution to black history,\u201d he joked.Whereas Mr. Chappelle escapes tricky territory through sweeping history lessons or literary flourishes, Mr. Rock builds forceful arguments that culminate in precise and memorable epigrams. \u201cPressure makes diamonds, not hugs\u201d is the pithiest defense of bullying you will hear.Mr. Rock\u2019s booming act has always been built for bigger rooms, but he goes smaller for this special, with the help of the comic Bo Burnham, whose artfully idiosyncratic direction emphasizes intimacy and studiously avoids clich\u00e9. The show begins with a casual shot of the back of Mr. Rock\u2019s head while he is chatting backstage and ends abruptly. When the star drops the microphone, Mr. Burnham fades to black before we hear the familiar sound of it hitting the floor. Crisp images of the front row of the theater, juxtaposed with smoky backdrops and ghostly lighting, make the audience appear on the same level as the performer, creating unusually striking images for stand-up comedy.In filming just the first joke \u2014 \u201cYou would think that cops would occasionally shoot a white kid, just to make it look good\u201d \u2014 Mr. Burnham shifts angles four times, but he also knows when to stop moving the camera. As Mr. Rock confesses he cheated on his wife, he goes in for the close-up and lingers.In that North Carolina show, Mr. Rock went into more detail about his affairs. That was cut from the special, leaving nothing to invite jealousy. His tone is contrite, but it also suggests he has recovered, both from porn addiction and cheating, which he says he\u2019s done with. In an hour dense with jokes, he gets serious. \u201cWhen guys cheat, we want something new,\u201d he says, still in close-up. \u201cBut you know what happens? Your woman finds out and now she\u2019s new. She\u2019s never the same again. You got new but you got a bad new.\u201dOffstage, Chris Rock is soft-spoken, thoughtful, even shy \u2014 an alter ego to the strutting superhero he becomes in his stand-up specials whose titles (\u201cBigger & Blacker,\u201d \u201cNever Scared\u201d) telegraph swagger. In the age of Trump, he has shifted to something quieter, more humble, and yet, with the same old confidence, with lessons learned at the end.Mr. Rock does not wallow in melancholy and regret over lost love.

{"Headline": "Review: David Chang in the Comfort Food Zone on Netflix", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe show would, in some ways, look at home on the Food Network. Its eight episodes take on topics as conventional as pizza, barbecue, fried chicken and Chinese cooking. The cameras pan over jars of artisanal tomato sauce and capture the squirting juices of xiao long bao. Ritualistic pronouncements of deliciousness abound, often punctuated with a certain four-letter word, and the occasional non-culinary star \u2014 Aziz Ansari, Jimmy Kimmel \u2014 drops by to both lend and borrow celebrity wattage.What Mr. Chang and the food writer Peter Meehan, his co-star and fellow executive producer, are attempting is something more ambitious, though: an extended television essay, in the form of free-associative, globe-trotting conversations about food and culture.Since this is Mr. Chang we\u2019re talking about, the conversations often take the form of arguments, and include a fair number of insults, which we\u2019re to believe are good-natured.These techniques, and a generous Netflix budget, are on display in the pizza episode, which was filmed in Brooklyn, Tokyo, New Haven, Copenhagen, Naples, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Demonstrating his trademark contrarianism, Mr. Chang praises Domino\u2019s \u2014 even donning the company vest and delivering pies \u2014 and declares New Haven and then Tokyo as the homes of the world\u2019s best pizza.The visual curlicues and the attempts to impose a larger thematic structure and narrative \u2014 there\u2019s an awful lot of tired talk about how food tells stories \u2014 don\u2019t hide the reality that there isn\u2019t a whole lot new or surprising about \u201cUgly Delicious.\u201d (The exception: the openness with which it discusses racism as a fundamental force in culinary culture.) Its primary influence, as with other food shows, will probably be to max out reservations at impossibly cool-looking restaurants like the Tokyo pizzeria Seirinkan or the locavorish Salare in Seattle.What the show is really selling is the Chang attitude and mystique, a combination of ego, exactitude, foul-mouthed rebelliousness and self-deprecatory nerdiness. With the opening of Momofuku Noodle Bar 14 years ago, he fortuitously caught the waves of both millennial casualness and fangirl-fanboy-style fetishization (of ingredients, of methods, of chefs) that swept through the restaurant business.An important part of Mr. Chang\u2019s persona at the start was his outsider status, casting stones at (or at least making withering remarks about) the bastions of haute cuisine where he had learned his trade. That became problematic as he built an international restaurant empire that recently added the 200-plus-seat Momofuku Las Vegas.And in \u201cUgly Delicious\u201d he moves with a band of insiders that includes Mr. Meehan, the superstar Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and Mr. Ansari, Mr. Chang\u2019s fellow Netflix star. It\u2019s also a boy\u2019s club. An episode about home cooking is the only one with an equal representation of women and men among the significant speaking roles. In all the others men outnumber women by 2 or 3 to 1; in the pizza episode it\u2019s 8 to 1. This may reflect the state of affairs in the food industry, but it\u2019s surprising for a series that wants to talk about diversity and representation.(African-American chefs and commentators are even less present, appearing almost exclusively in an episode about the coded meanings and cultural signifiers of fried chicken.)The show often allows Mr. Chang\u2019s rough edges to show, and sometimes its picture of him is unflattering in ways that don\u2019t seem intentional. His jibes can cross over into meanness, and his pontifications can appear oblivious, as when he compares the art of barbecue to the art of jazz in an episode focused entirely on white and Asian cooks.\u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell it all happened,\u201d Mr. Chang says, contemplating the franchise that he has become. The claim seems unlikely, and one way to see the show, with its focus on pizza and tacos and dumplings, is as a branding exercise \u2014 a pivot away from high-intensity cooking toward the ugly deliciousness of comfort food. The penultimate episode ends with him holding a plate of kimchi and Spam fried rice toward the camera. In the Chang vernacular, it looks bonkers, and you\u2019ll want to crush it.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Black Panther\u2019 Poised to Shatter a Hollywood Myth", "Date": "2018-02-15", "News": "The film is expected to take in at least $250 million worldwide this weekend, disproving the notion that movies rooted in black culture cannot be global blockbusters.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Ticket buyers around the world are poised to smash another one of Hollywood\u2019s most entrenched beliefs.\u201cOne by one, these unwritten Hollywood rules about what audiences supposedly will and will not support are falling by the wayside,\u201d said Jeff Bock, a senior analyst at Exhibitor Relations, an entertainment research firm. \u201cI think about it like a wall crumbling. In terms of \u2018Black Panther,\u2019 no studio can say again, \u2018Oh, black movies don\u2019t travel, overseas interest will be minimal.\u2019\u201dDisney, which has been on a box office tear, decided several years ago to make a concerted effort to promote diversity and equality on screen. But \u201cBlack Panther\u201d also arrives at a time when studios have started to respond to growing pressure to make their big-budget movies more inclusive, driven in part by the recent #OscarsSoWhite movement. And with audiences increasingly inclined to stay home and watch Netflix, producing movies featuring lead characters with different skin colors, genders and sexualities is proving to be good business.Attendance at theaters in North America, the world\u2019s largest movie market, dropped 6 percent in 2017, hitting a 22-year low. At the same time, studios are more reliant than ever on ticket sales. Their home-entertainment businesses \u2014 negatively impacted by the rise of streaming services \u2014 are collapsing to an alarming degree. The major studios reported an 18 percent drop in holiday home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, compared to a year earlier.\u201cHollywood can no longer afford to take any moviegoer for granted,\u201d Mr. Bock said. \u201cThat is causing them to look at underserved groups where there is pent-up demand, and the black audience is one.\u201dDisney, which spent roughly $350 million to make and market \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d remains cautious about declaring global victory, noting that the film will not arrive in crucial markets like China and Japan until next month. The movie, focused on one of Marvel\u2019s lesser-known superheroes and set in the fictional country of Wakanda, will be playing in 70 percent of the world by Friday, with its rollout having started on Tuesday in the United Kingdom.\u201cI\u2019m done living in a world where I don\u2019t get to be who I am,\u201d Nick Robinson, playing the lead role, says in the \u201cLove, Simon\u201d trailer. \u201cI deserve a great love story.\u201dStudio chiefs keep their jobs by delivering hits, and they try to do that by avoiding constructs that have fizzled in the past. For years, female superheroes were held back by the argument \u2014 a ridiculous one in the eyes of many critics \u2014 that male ticket buyers would stay home if a woman led the action. The failures of the critically derided films \u201cCatwoman\u201d in 2004 and \u201cElektra\u201d in 2005 were used as proof. As studios have become more reliant on overseas ticket sales, they have shunned movies that focus on black characters by citing lackluster foreign interest in films like \u201cDreamgirls\u201d in 2007 and Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cMadea\u201d series.Some film executives even cite \u201cGet Out\u201d as a cautionary example. That Oscar-nominated horror movie, about racism in the liberal white suburbs, collected a robust $176 million in North America but a comparatively slight $79 million overseas.Disney\u2019s willingness to withstand that kind of resistance reflects the emphasis that Robert A. Iger, the company\u2019s chief executive, has put on diverse casting and storytelling across the Magic Kingdom. As he said at Disney\u2019s most recent shareholder meeting, referring to inclusion and equality: \u201cWe can take those values, which we deem important societally, and actually change peoples\u2019 behavior \u2014 get people to be more accepting of the multiple differences and cultures and races and all other facets of our lives and our people.\u201dKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, and Alan F. Horn, Disney\u2019s movie chairman, were eager to make \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d But it was ultimately Mr. Iger who pushed the movie ahead, overruling those who worried that it would not generate adequate sales of related toys.Asked how Mr. Iger has communicated that message about diversity \u2014 in meetings? by royal decree? \u2014 Mr. Feige responded, \u201cIt\u2019s a combination.\u201dWhatever the route, the directive has been received. Disney recently released Pixar\u2019s \u201cCoco,\u201d centered on the festive Mexican holiday honoring the dead and with characters voiced by an all-Latino cast. Before that came \u201cMoana,\u201d which gave Disney a Pacific Islander princess.The new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies have been paragons of diverse casting. Coming up are live-action versions of \u201cMulan,\u201d with a mostly Asian cast, and \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d with a largely black cast. Disney\u2019s big-budget \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d directed by Ava DuVernay and starring Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Michael Pe\u00f1a and Mindy Kaling, arrives on March 9.\u201cWe wanted to make a film with a cast that looks like you,\u201d Ms. DuVernay said at a Disney fan event last year, \u201cthat looks like the real world.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of Disney\u2019s movie chairman.

{"Headline": "Save Money and Reset Your Financial Life With a Shopping Ban", "Date": "2018-02-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many of us, the beginning of the year involves cutting back: on Negronis, Nutella, Netflix, on whatever we previously overindulged in \u2014 which often includes unnecessary spending.But what about forgoing the act of shopping altogether?By 2013, Ms. Flanders had spent two austere years paying off nearly $23,000 of debt. But, rather than feeling free in the months that followed, she was dismayed by the increasing amount of money she was mindlessly spending.Determined to regain control of her finances, she eventually forbade herself to shop for an entire year. During the ban, she confronted bad habits; learned to borrow, make and mend; and found value in herself instead of the objects around her.Intrigued? Here are her tips for implementing your own shopping ban.Before you can change your habits, you must first identify them.\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand your consumption as a whole, it\u2019s hard to come up with shopping ban rules that make sense,\u201d Ms. Flanders said.\u201cFor me, if it\u2019s just numbers that are magically being updated online, I still don\u2019t understand how often I\u2019m spending money \u2014 it\u2019s just a category,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe more you write things down, the more you realize whether or not you\u2019re happy with the fact you\u2019ve spent that money.\u201dWalk around your home, determining what you have the most of \u2014 and, therefore, what you\u2019ve spent the most on. Maybe it\u2019s books. Maybe it\u2019s shoes. Maybe it\u2019s empty LaCroix cans.Then ask yourself: Do you really need more? If the answer is no (which it probably is, for everything but the LaCroix), put it on the ban list.Ms. Flanders allowed herself to shop for groceries and basic kitchen supplies, gas, cosmetics and toiletries (if she ran out), cleaning products and gifts. She also created an \u201capproved shopping list\u201d of items \u2014 like a pair of winter boots and a bed \u2014 she already knew she\u2019d need. She could still travel and occasionally eat at restaurants, and could replace anything that wore out or broke, as long as she tossed or donated the original.On the ban list? Takeout coffee, clothes, shoes, accessories, household items like d\u00e9cor and furniture, books, magazines, electronics and anything else not previously approved.While her shopping ban lasted an entire year, Ms. Flanders recommends choosing a length of time that feels \u201cmanageable\u201d to you, whether that\u2019s 30 days or six months. \u201cReally be honest with yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s rules will be completely different.\u201d\u201cThe times I thought about giving up, my best friend was great at getting me back in line,\u201d Ms. Flanders said. \u201cShe\u2019d say: \u2018You don\u2019t need to buy that \u2014 what are you working toward?\u2019\u201dMs. Flanders, for example, quickly discovered how many activities made her crave takeout coffee: firing up her computer, taking an afternoon break, running errands, going on road trips. To encourage change, she always left coffee supplies on her counter. Whenever she felt the urge to purchase a latte, she made one instead. \u201cWhen you figure out a better habit, make sure it\u2019s really accessible,\u201d she advised.When Ms. Flanders was a child, her parents did \u201calmost everything themselves.\u201d They gardened, cooked, canned and sewed. But as she grew older, she became accustomed to the speed and convenience of the era.We all can find ways to incorporate these ideas into our lives where we have the knowledge, time and access. Instead of buying a tent for your first camping trip, borrow one from a friend. Instead of hiring someone to repair your bike, watch a video and attempt to fix it yourself. You may stumble on a skill or talent you never knew you had, and bonus: You\u2019ll save money in the process.On Black Friday, Ms. Flanders succumbed to a discounted e-reader, then canceled the order a few minutes later. Rather than berating herself for \u201cfailing,\u201d which would\u2019ve given her an excuse to abandon the challenge completely, she accepted her purchase for what it was: a minuscule mistake.\u201cInstead of stressing so much about the one thing you purchased, ask yourself why it happened \u2014 what was going on in your life?\u201d Ms. Flanders said. \u201cIf the bigger goal is still something you want to work toward, learn from it and carry on. If you were successful for 364 days instead of 365, that\u2019s a huge win.\u201dThough Ms. Flanders saved almost $14,000 during her shopping ban \u2014 and even continued it for a second year \u2014 it\u2019s the life lessons she prizes most.\u201cI learned to be content with what I have,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I was always thinking some thing could improve my life.\u201d Now, she has an exact purpose for everything she buys, and it\u2019s never to fill a void.\u201cThat was the most important lesson,\u201d she said. \u201cI was finally happy enough with who I was. I realized I am this imperfect human being \u2014 as we all are \u2014 and no object was going to make me better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Australia Prefer Secrecy to Transparency?", "Date": "2018-01-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 43______But it\u2019s not exactly a subject for live television \u2014 at least not with me explaining it \u2014 so I thought I\u2019d return to the issue here in this week\u2019s newsletter.Countries like Turkey, Cambodia, China and Cuba have also made a habit of creating and enforcing laws that allow for maximum control over government information.At a time of rising nationalism worldwide, \u201cnational security\u201d has effectively become a catchall category \u2014 a legitimate concern expanded to include documents, digital communication and political issues that may not have much to do with national security.As Gaven Morris, the news director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, put it: \u201cConsistently, we\u2019ve seen overreach where governments seek to suppress information because it is embarrassing, not because there is a genuine security risk.\u201dBut there are actually several other areas of public life in Australia that make journalism more difficult, or that reveal the degree to which this country tolerates a lack of transparency.A few examples:\u2022 Campaign FinanceAustralia\u2019s campaign finance system is riddled with loopholes and delayed disclosures.At the federal level, it takes more than six months (up to 19 months in fact) for the public to learn how much parties have raised and from whom. Donors are identified only if they have contributed more than 13,500 Australian dollars, or about $10,000, which means individuals and corporations can anonymously make multiple donations without the public knowing. At the same time, Australian politicians are not required to explain what they do with the money.\u2022 Suppression OrdersFor example, there is a major case of global interest working its way through the courts now. It\u2019s subject to a suppression order, and I cannot legally tell you about it.In other cases, courts have ordered that already published journalism be removed from Australian news sites, even though the information in them could be found elsewhere \u2014 undermining public trust in both journalism and the justice system.\u2022 Defamation Without any equivalent to the American First Amendment, freedom of speech in Australia is more negotiable and often subject to litigation.Suing for defamation is relatively easy in Australia, with presumptions favoring those who sue. Journalists, media organizations \u2014 and increasingly anyone who publishes on social media platforms \u2014 routinely lose in court or expect to lose and settle. The costs can be high, even prohibitive, stamping out some stories before they are ever written.Now, it may be that there are strong arguments for restricting information and limiting journalism \u2014 arguments that I, as a journalist, may have a harder time fully agreeing with.But regardless of whether you think our tribe is full of sensationalists to be protected against or heroes to be lauded, it\u2019s worth asking: Why are governments increasingly so insecure about letting us all see what they are up to?On that happy note, here are some examples of journalism worth fighting for, and smiling at, along with a weekly recommendation that crosses generational lines.____________It almost sounds like science fiction, but it\u2019s really just science: climate change.______Read it and then Tweet it out so the bots can see it.______What do love and cryptocurrency share? More than you might think.______This week, in addition to all things espionage, we have news, science, sports, Netflix, a new Australia Diary and some serious Margot Robbie coverage.______I just finished reading \u201cWonder,\u201d by R.J.

{"Headline": "Why People Love to Jump Off Cliffs", "Date": "2018-02-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWhat do you do to unwind? Watch Netflix? Bike? Hike? Golf? Go for a run? Dine out with friends? Garden? Dance? Read? There are myriad ways to decompress and recover from the stresses and strains of everyday life. But for some, it\u2019s not recreation unless they\u2019re risking their lives.\u201cWe are living in a virtual, confused, hyper-technological, postmodern world where we\u2019re all looking for real experiences,\u201d said Orin Starn, professor of cultural anthropology and history at Duke University. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuum of hipsters buying land to farm organic blueberries to musicians wanting to play original pre-jazz, old-time music to now, maybe getting out on glacier and trying to climb it.\u201dNotably, the popularity of extreme sports is happening as participation in tamer, traditional sports like golf, basketball, baseball and football has been declining. There are no rules or penalty flags on a rock face or in the barrel of massive wave. You do it right, or you die. It requires maximum focus and, at least for a little while, erases all other concerns. Therein, perhaps, lies the appeal.The company forecasts that by 2020, extreme sports will challenge professional and collegiate sports as the most watched category of sports content. This is thanks in part to the multiple hours of heart-stopping video uploaded daily to the internet, documenting not only death-defying feats but also perpetuating a dangerous game of one-upmanship.But none of these explanations is likely the whole story. And while the research is slim and lacking much scientific rigor, studies of extreme-sports enthusiasts suggest they have diverse biologies, personalities and backgrounds.\u201cThere is no single profile that predicts engagement in extreme sports,\u201d said Dr. Erik Monasterio, a psychiatrist and clinical lecturer at University of Otago in New Zealand, who is also an avid mountain climber. \u201cThere are all sorts of paths to it.\u201dHe and others who study extreme sports point to cultural, sociological and even technological factors as the most likely explanations for the recent surge in participation. \u201cEfforts to eliminate risk are an obsession in the Western world,\u201d Dr. Monasterio said. \u201cWe have to make playgrounds and public spaces perfectly safe and there\u2019s all this litigation around physical and mental injuries in relation to all kinds of activities. That sterile environment is frustrating and makes people crave stimulation and excitement.\u201dHigh-risk sports are also seen as a reaction against living life mediated through a mobile device rather than having real experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s an escape from a social media-obsessed society where so much seems fake and contrived and we\u2019re indoors so much that the idea of risk-taking in the outdoors is very appealing,\u201d said Dr. Starn, though he added that it\u2019s disturbing that people feel they must go to such extremes to find release.\u201cPeople feel good about themselves afterward because they have the sense that they have control over their emotions, like, \u2018I can conquer my fear,\u2019 \u201d said Tim Woodman, professor of performance psychology at Bangor University in Wales. \u201cBut then they have this urge to go to back again and again because their true, underlying fear hasn\u2019t been dealt with.\u201dAlthough this largely subconscious fear most often has to do with relationships and intimacy, there is also the compounding unease these days about the state of the world. Political unrest and dysfunction, discord between races and between sexes and the plight of the planet can also make people seek to \u201cexternalize their internal fears\u201d by engaging in extreme sports, said Christine Le Scanff, dean of the school of sports sciences and movement at the University of Paris-Sud in France.\u201cIt\u2019s a way for people to burn away these worries about the world that occupy their minds,\u201d said Mr. Brice\u00f1o, who continues proximity flying despite having lost several friends, in addition to Mr. Polli, to the sport. \u201cIt gives you this rush and that rush makes you feel like you are alive and free and the happiness in that moment makes you think, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t mind if I don\u2019t have any more days of life because what I just did, it was so good, I could die right now.\u2019 \u201dKate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

From 2008 through 2012, Tucker\u2019s companies extended approximately five million loans to customers across the country, while generating more than $2 billion in revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. Most of this money flowed through accounts that Tucker maintained at the Bank.USB employees responsible for servicing Tucker\u2019s ongoing account activity disregarded numerous red flags that Tucker was using the tribes to conceal his ownership of the accounts. For example, Tucker spent large sums of monies from accounts in the names of Tribal Companies on personal items, including tens of millions of dollars on a vacation home in Aspen and on Tucker\u2019s professional Ferrari racing team.U.S. Bancorp said on Thursday that it had put in place measure to improve its anti-money laundering controls. The missteps under scrutiny took place between 2009 and 2014.\u2014 Peter EavisThe founders of Harry\u2019s turned their company into a fast-growing competitor to established giants like Gillette in the $2.4 billion shaving industry.Now they want to take on Gillette\u2019s parent company, Procter & Gamble.\u201cWe\u2019ve built a lot of infrastructure at Harry\u2019s that we think we can leverage into new categories,\u201d Jeff Raider, one of Harry\u2019s founders, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been excited about for a long time, and we\u2019re now at a point in our business where we can act on it.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedA week ago the major United States indexes fell into a correction, defined as a 10 percent decline from a recent high. The cause? Fears the economy was heating up, which would lead to a pickup in inflation and Federal Reserve raising rates faster than anticipated.But in the week since the S.&P. 500 has stage a comeback. The index is up 7.6 percent and on pace for best week since 2014, according to Bloomberg. In fact, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 2 percent the past two days despite the latest inflation data coming in much higher than expected.So what happened to those concerns about inflation? One explanation for why stock investors shrugged off the inflation data was a very weak report on retail sales. Investors seemed to take that as evidence the economy is not overheating and that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a very slow pace.Two weeks ago when the sell-off started, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow forecast for first-quarter G.D.P. fell to 3.25 percent from 5.4 percent two weeks ago.\u201cWhile it does appear that inflation is accelerating, it appears much less likely that the economy is really taking off and forcing the Fed into a more aggressive rate hiking cycle,\u201d write the strategists over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The bigger pictureA rising rate environment is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks. Jodie Gunzberg, the head of United States equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, points out that since 1971 the S&P 500:ProPublica\u2019s article centers on the bureau\u2019s handling of investigations into Wells Fargo. It reports that Mr. Mulvaney ordered restrictions on the accessing of personal data of Wells Fargo customers, a move that hampered the bureau\u2019s investigations. An exemption on the freeze was later granted to enforcement staff looking into Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance business. But ProPublica added:Mulvaney\u2019s order has had effects beyond enforcement, hampering the bureau\u2019s efforts to monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer protection rules and conduct research on financial products, according to several staffers. The freeze has even stymied state attorneys general, according to two C.F.P.B. staffers and one attorney for a state office.The tax overhaul requires funds to hold onto investments for three years to qualify for the lower rate. They\u2019ve been getting around it by creating single-member LLCs in Delaware to receive carried interest payouts.More from Miles Weiss of Bloomberg:Four LLCs have been created under the name of Elliott Management Corp., the hedge-fund giant run by Paul Singer. More than 70 have been established under the names of executives at Starwood Capital Group Management, the private-equity shop headed by Barry Sternlicht.The headline reason is his belief that Silicon Valley is too intolerant of conservatives and libertarians. But there\u2019s an interesting second reason in the article (emphasis added):The WSJ reports that Mr. Thiel will spend at least a bit more time working on a non-tech endeavor: a right-leaning media organization. He will still be involved in Founders Fund, the V.C. firm he co-founded, as well as stay on the boards of Facebook, the data consultancy Palantir and other tech companies.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cMy goal is to make it so the next generation grows up in a world where cancer is managed just like the common cold, and the body\u2019s natural regenerative engine remains empowered throughout our lives,\u201d said Dr. Hariri.Celgene, United Therapeutics, Sorrento Therapeutics, Human Longevity, the Dreyfus Family Office and Section 32 took part in the series-A funding.In other health care deal newsWhy? The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation report was higher than expected. But weaker retail sales tempered those fears \u2014 at least for equity investors.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeTo some, the bond market is a particularly prescient predictor of economic trends. So is it picking up on an inflationary surge that the Federal Reserve likely will take too long to recognize?But the overheating fears may be overdone. Yesterday\u2019s January inflation report was hardly conclusive. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that the January increase \u201cprobably overstates the underlying trend.\u201dStill, even though there are reasons to believe that while the U.S. economy is breaking out of its recent rut \u2014 thanks to big tax cuts and a revival of the global economy \u2014 it may not be as vibrant as it looks.The economic flyaroundNestl\u00e9 added that its future is likely to contain more deals in the several-hundred-million range of the Blue Bottle Coffee takeover. \u201cThe sweet spot is in small to mid-sized deals, but we don\u2019t want to rule out anything,\u201d its C.E.O., Mark Schneider, said.The deals flyaroundHe also offered this ambition: \u201cI want you to be able to take an Uber and get into the subway \u2014 if the trains are running on time, you\u2019ve got real-time data \u2014 get in the subway, get out and have an Uber waiting for you for right now. Or know that there\u2019s a bike right there for you that gets you where you\u2019re going in the fastest manner.\u201dWhether the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C. are the best venues for this type of regulation is something Congress will have to decide. Neither agency has experience in overseeing virtual currencies, so assigning responsibility to one (or both) will require increased appropriations to develop rules and effective oversight.\u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Altered Carbon,\u2019 Netflix\u2019s \u2018Blade Runner\u2019 Replicant", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAltered Carbon\u201d is a lesson in the importance of context.If it were on the Syfy channel, where it belongs, it would look above average. You\u2019d think, yeah, not bad. On Netflix, where its 10 episodes have been released, it still looks like an above-average Syfy series, which just makes you think, what the heck is this doing here?To give Netflix the benefit of the doubt, it\u2019s probably there for the cord cutters. If attracting them means recreating the entire ecosystem of television, then there\u2019s room for a low-rent \u201cBlade Runner\u201d knockoff with basic-cable production values and premium-cable nudity. Not everything can or needs to be \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201dBut if you\u2019re concerned with maintaining your reputation as a leading purveyor of prestige TV, you might want to think harder about what you slap the \u201cNetflix Original\u201d label on.A person\u2019s essence \u2014 personality, intelligence, memories \u2014 can be loaded onto a metal disc called a stack and, in the event of death or boredom, inserted into a new body. The rich, called Meths (for Methuselahs), can repeatedly clone themselves and live out an unchanging prime of life. The poor make do with any body they can get their hands on, whose age, race and even gender may be different from theirs.This scenario is the backdrop for a mystery in which, given the new realities, the murder victim is still alive and curious about who killed him. Laurens Bancroft (James Purefoy), a powerful Meth, creates his own private eye by reviving the stack of a long dead Japanese-Slavic super-soldier, Takeshi Kovacs (Will Yun Lee), and putting it in the cybernetically enhanced, cryogenically preserved body of a recently dead Nordic policeman (Joel Kinnaman).\u201cAltered Carbon\u201d tries to meld a dystopian class-warfare story and a hard-boiled detective story by simply piling on both the pseudo-philosophical blather (much of it delivered in voice-over by Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry as a rebel leader and Kovacs\u2019s former lover) and the film-noir clich\u00e9s. The entire twisted-rich-guy-with-beautiful-young-wife plot is a dangerously familiar setup, but the show is proud of its borrowings; when you have a noir rarity like \u201cI Wake Up Screaming\u201d playing in the background of a scene, you\u2019re trying to make a point (while showing off).Mr. Kinnaman wears a bad attitude as easily as most actors wear a shirt, but playing a reluctant Philip Marlowe-style gumshoe with the soul of a freedom fighter (the embodiment of the show\u2019s dual nature) doesn\u2019t suit him, and he lacks his usual spark. Dichen Lachman, as his sister and fellow rebel soldier, has a better feel for the material and shines in the frequent and graphically bloody action scenes.The violence in \u201cAltered Carbon\u201d is only marginally greater than what you\u2019d find on basic cable. But there\u2019s one significant, in-your-face difference between it and the sci-fi shows it otherwise resembles: the copious nudity, mostly, though not exclusively, female.\u201cAltered Carbon\u201d has some interesting ideas about the wages of immortality, such as the possibility of endless torture. But the resources and technology of the future it depicts appear to be devoted primarily to the pursuit of sexual gratification and exploitation, in milieus that recall 1970s Times Square and contemporary Las Vegas. As a narrative device, this provides a convenient rationale for routine (and numbing) nakedness, the way medieval fantasy provides the same cover for \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dAnd that, of course, may be another answer for what this show is doing on Netflix. With \u201cMarco Polo\u201d canceled, the gratuitous-nudity niche needed filling.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comics Select Their Audiences as Carefully as Their Jokes", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyThe audience, made up exclusively of drummers, chuckles. Minutes later, he cracks another rhetorical joke: \u201cIs it me or is it just so hard to get a snare drum to be exactly the right way?\u201dIt\u2019s not just him, but I confess I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. I recognize the rhythms of the joke, and can tease out the general meaning with the help of context, but as a nondrummer, this joke is not intended for me. Nor does it need to be.There\u2019s an old-school belief that great comedy should work for all audiences. It\u2019s never been entirely true. Taste varies wildly, and some of the best comedy, like the finest film or theater or art, can be obscure, esoteric or simply too odd, dirty or absurd to attract the biggest crowds. But in a splintered culture, where there are more options than ever catering to a multitude of types and inclinations, comedians are increasingly aiming for narrower niches.\u201cStandup for Drummers\u201d is the logical extension of this trend, a special representative of the moment, when you create your jokes but also curate your crowd. Of course you don\u2019t need to be in that room of drummers to see his special, which is what makes watching it on Netflix disorienting. Mr. Armisen, the \u201cPortlandia\u201d star who\u2019s also a drummer, delivers his material as if everyone is deeply conversant with double-kick drum pedals and high hats. He appears to want to be relatable, even when he isn\u2019t.Drummers laugh, too, and material about them isn\u2019t exactly everywhere. You won\u2019t find any other stand-up special with imitations of Keith Moon, Meg White and Larry Mullen Jr.; or one that pokes fun at the lighting in instructional videos for drummers. And for those who don\u2019t know anything about this world, there is fun to be had observing this clubby atmosphere from the outside.Mr. Armisen is much more seasoned as a sketch performer and actor than a stand-up and it often shows. His setups are repetitive, his transitions awkward and some of the jokes aren\u2019t fully formed. A bit about how he doesn\u2019t like blues isn\u2019t much more than that. \u201cAren\u2019t crazy people crazy?\u201d is a line that should be cut.But someone with such diverse talents would be wasted toiling away at a comedy club. Mr. Armisen\u2019s jokes are at their best when they bleed into sketches, when they lean on characters rather than punch lines in his own voice. In one premise, he says that doo-wop was once considered as edgy and angry as heavy metal. Then he puts on some doo-wop music and imagines what a kid from the 1950s getting his mind blown would look like. His performance is all flailing limbs and coiled attitude, evoking a whole type in a few brief flourishes.Part of what makes him gifted at these caricatures is his perceptive ear for the eccentric ways people talk, pointing out oddball pieces of rhetoric and habits of speech. He also displays a gift for accents. At one point, he puts up a video of a map of America and goes state by state, demonstrating the accent of every major city in the country. It\u2019s a marvel, and not entirely off point, since local differences are the kind of thing bands on tour know.It doesn\u2019t seem like a joke so much as a feat, and yet he\u2019s summing up entire regions with a slight change in intonation or affect. This is fairly subtle work, the kind that also reminds you that we\u2019re living in a big, complex country where even people in neighboring states talk differently.There\u2019s something wonderful about the idea of trying to speak to everyone. But in our divided, siloed culture, who really believes that\u2019s possible? Just as politicians play to their base, comedians now find their specific audiences, and because of social media and podcasts, they can communicate with them more directly than ever.The future of comedy is not in the size of your crowd, but in the depth of its passion. And the connection between performer and fan can be cemented with inside jokes, the shared, exclusive language of close friends. Something is lost in this shift away from monoculture and into aesthetic alcoves, but only the rigidly nostalgic will insist nothing has been gained.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s not just the tale of a Harvard-educated baby boomer who finds great success in doing whatever absurd or juvenile thing he feels like doing, leaving a trail of chaos and disappointment among his intimates. It\u2019s also a snapshot of a moment when comedy\u2019s freshest counterculture impulse was gleefully crass and willfully offensive, built on thumbed noses and middle fingers \u2014 what scanned at the time as a liberating response to a rigid and hypocritical culture, but will appear to a weighty chunk of today\u2019s viewers as the childish dregs of an entire cohort\u2019s glib, bratty chauvinism and coddled, almost toddlerish self-regard.The film\u2019s Kenney makes this \u201ceverything screwed up about our culture\u201d observation while considering 1960s high school yearbooks, spotting a comical hollowness and rot in the society he and his peers were trained to join. But today it could be Kenney himself who is a natural symbol of someone else\u2019s rot. It seems nearly impossible to translate the impulses of the one time to the other; the most the film can do is make small apologies for the difference. It might do better to offer a warning to the present: Whatever thrilling, corrective pull your cohort may be having on society right now is very probably, in one way or another, screwing something up for someone later.Nitsuh Abebe is a story editor for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Who Killed Biggie and Tupac? \u2018Unsolved\u2019 Might Know", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome myths are too powerful \u2014 too necessary \u2014 to ever be fully undone, no matter the facts gathered to address them.Such is the case with the still-officially-unsolved deaths of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G., Tupac and Biggie, gunned down six months apart two decades ago, a cruel extermination of hip-hop\u2019s elite.They became martyrs, and also \u2014 as the years passed and their killers were never brought to justice \u2014 symbols of a kind of institutional neglect, failed originally by the genre they loved and, in death, by the police.So the most conspicuous aspect of \u201cUnsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G.,\u201d a lightly fictionalized 10-part limited series on USA that has its premiere on Tuesday, is its certainty. Here is a show that offers answers, a ticktock of the various investigations into the killings that have resulted in no arrests but not, if \u201cUnsolved\u201d is to be believed, in no answers.The series is inspired by \u201cMurder Rap: The Untold Story of the Biggie Smalls & Tupac Shakur Murder Investigations,\u201d a book by Greg Kading, who led a task force investigating the shootings in the late 2000s. (There is an accompanying documentary as well.) In that book, Mr. Kading lays out his theories about who pulled the triggers, and why.Yet somehow, seeing those theories brought to dramatized life \u2014 seven episodes were provided for review \u2014 gives them more power.The love story here isn\u2019t between Biggie and Tupac, though ample screentime is given over to their early friendship. It\u2019s between the two detectives who never meet: Poole and Kading, who both begin to unravel in the face of a complex investigation, institutional pressure and family problems.Mr. Jonez captures the gentle grandeur of Biggie (born Christopher Wallace), and Mr. Rose has Tupac\u2019s familiar seductive glint in his eye. But this show about murdered rappers is really a cop show. What\u2019s more, \u201cUnsolved\u201d did not secure licensing rights for either rapper\u2019s music \u2014 though some lyrics are sprinkled into conversation \u2014 making them feel even more distant as subjects.In capturing the two investigations, though, \u201cUnsolved\u201d is effective in an unglamorous, no-frills way. And yet, as the episodes toggle between the ostentation of the hip-hop world and the grayness of police headquarters, it\u2019s hard to overlook that a story of this historical significance is rendered in such proletarian fashion.Add to that the fact that Mr. Kading\u2019s book and documentary were self-released, and that \u201cUnsolved\u201d isn\u2019t on a vanity platform like HBO or Netflix, or delivered with the luxe production values of the \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d series, but rather on USA, a basic cable staple.You would think that a show that advertises a convincing theory about these killings would be lavished with funding, be loudly publicized not just as art, but also as news. But instead, \u201cUnsolved\u201d remains in the shadows. Myth has a way of enduring.Advertisement"}

The core index, which excludes food and energy, also came in above forecasts, prompting Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan, to describe it as \u201chotter than Hades.\u201dWhile the stock market shrugged off the jump in inflation, bond markets got a bit of a jolt. The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note rose above 2.9 percent on Wednesday, well above the 2.4 percent at which it finished last year.Indeed, the index overshot expectations because two items \u2014 clothing and medical services \u2014 had very strong increases, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. Clothing was due for a big rebound because it seemed to lag a lot in recent months, Pantheon asserted. As for medical services, the jump there came from hospital costs, which Pantheon described as \u201cvery erratic.\u201dThe analysts at Hoisington Investment Management have in recent years highlighted stubborn weaknesses in the United States economy, and the firm still sees significant problems. They note, for instance, that disposable personal incomes, adjusted for inflation, only rose by 1.9 percent last year, an increase that was supported by borrowing.

Under the agreement, Fannie sends nearly all its profits to the government in the form of a dividend and operates with a limited capital buffer.After the quarter\u2019s planned infusion, Fannie will have sent $166.4 billion to the Treasury Department in total, compared with the $119.8 billion it has received from the government, according to the WSJ.The Consumer Price Index, a government yardstick of inflation, jumped 2.1 percent in January, from a year earlier. That is slightly above the 2 percent rate that Wall Street economists, surveyed by Bloomberg, forecast.

Ms. Wasser, 49, said her site was not designed for everyone.If your spouse comes home every day and beats you, she said, \u201cthis isn\u2019t for you.\u201d Instead, she said, it\u2019s for people who think they can agree on how to divide what they\u2019ve amassed together and who want control over the process. \u201cNobody knows our kids, our life, our finances better than we do,\u201d she said. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we try to figure this out?\u201dMs. Wasser, who has practiced family law for 23 years and is a divorced mother herself, said she was inspired to create It\u2019s Over Easy after writing her book \u201cIt Doesn\u2019t Have to Be That Way: How to Divorce Without Destroying Your Family or Bankrupting Yourself \u201d (2013), which advocated less-expensive, less-contentious divorces.After receiving a positive response from readers, she thought: \u201cLet\u2019s hit the market. Couples today date online and bank online. They don\u2019t mind putting in their assets and liabilities into a computer. They\u2019re do-it-yourselfers.

I thought, Maybe I can\u2019t afford to get divorced.\u201d(Her spouse declined to be interviewed on the record.)Ms. Jacobson\u2019s favorite part of the site is the progress tracker: a yellow series of icons that shows the percentage of progress made in each category, from Basic Info to \u201cThe Deal,\u201d as if losing weight on a diet. \u201cI used to laugh at conscious uncoupling,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said. \u201cBut now I understand the concept of trying to undo something meaningful in a respectful way. This allows us to do it in a financially feasible way.\u201dJonathan, 50, a small-business owner in the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles, who did not want to give his last name because he owns a business with his soon-to-be-ex, is a few months away from his divorce. (California has a mandatory six-month waiting period.)He and his wife of 19 years have two children and two homes.

I want to live my life.\u201dIt\u2019s Over Easy offers a directory to paying users with listings for movers, health-insurance brokers, child therapists and more. \u201cYou need people to help you rewrite your will,\u201d Ms. Wasser said, \u201cin case you die in probate. You need self-tanners so you can get ready to date again, and co-parenting counselors to tell you how to handle parent-teacher conferences.\u201dSo far there have been two completed divorces (both in California), with others awaiting processing by the court. The spring may bring a new wave of customers eager to be divorced by the end of the calendar year: any payer of spousal support who completes a divorce after Dec. 31, 2018, will no longer be able to claim the support as a deductible expense, thanks to the new tax bill.Lest one think the site\u2019s primary market will be millennials with no children or significant assets, on its first day 30 percent of users were 35 to 44, according to analytics provided by the company, and 22 percent were 45 to 54.

{"Headline": "The Promise of Self-Compassion for Stressed-Out Teens", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a lunchtime workshop at Princeton for overscheduled, underslept college students a few years ago, I was teaching a three-step practice of self-compassion. The practice encourages a stance of self-kindness in the face of setbacks. One 19-year-old college athlete looked askance.\u201cSo, you want me to be nice to myself when I mess up?\u201d she asked. I nodded.The problem, researchers say, is that while self-criticism may give us a swift kick in the pants, it elevates symptoms of anxiety and depression in the long run. And this generation of adolescents can hardly afford much more unhappiness: Today\u2019s teenagers are plagued by more distress than any generation on record.Psychologists have now turned their attention to self-compassion in adolescents. Their initial findings reveal an unusually powerful intervention for stressed out young adults, a potential crown jewel of resilience interventions.Adolescence is a developmental moment of peak stress, and a teen\u2019s heightened self-consciousness (\u201cDo I look weird? Did I just sound stupid in class?\u201d) cranks up the volume of the inner critic. Self-compassion encourages mindfulness, or noticing your feelings without judgment; self-kindness, or talking to yourself in a soothing way; and common humanity, or thinking about how others might be suffering similarly.This last step is particularly salubrious for adolescents: Many believe that \u201cI\u2019m the only one going through this,\u201d which exacerbates feelings of isolation and shame.The teens I work with are prone to catastrophizing when facing a problem (\u201cI\u2019ll never get into college,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never get a good job\u201d). For them, the mindfulness step of self-compassion \u2014 which asks them to zero in on a feeling instead of an imagined, exaggerated outcome \u2014 is especially grounding. My students find self-kindness most challenging, so I ask them to imagine how they would comfort a close friend struggling with the same challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no one whom we treat as badly as ourselves,\u201d Dr. Neff told me.Skeptics like the Princeton athlete in my workshop worry that self-compassion is indolence in disguise: an excuse to lower your standards or give up instead of \u201csucking it up\u201d and dealing. As an educator from a mostly immigrant, bootstrapping family, I once might have agreed with her. Self-compassion is precisely the kind of New-Agey trend some of my crustier relatives might have called piffle, a way to brush off mistakes instead of owning them.I have been stunned by the reaction of students of all ages to the practice. In a public high school auditorium in Hopewell Valley, N.J., in November, I led more than 600 juniors and seniors through a self-compassion meditation. I asked them to place their hands on their hearts, and to feel the pressure and warmth of a kind hand. Their silence was respectful and profound. Many students were crying. They had never thought to approach their own setbacks with gentleness.At a local elementary school in Northampton, Mass., I volunteer teaching self-compassion to children as young as 5. Kindergartners share embarrassing moments (\u201cI fell off the monkey bars in front of my friends\u201d) and practice hugging themselves as a form of self-soothing. First graders sit in a circle holding hands, reminding each other they are not alone.But self-compassion may be most critical in adolescence, when researchers say it is at its lowest levels. This is especially true for teen girls, who show the lowest levels of self-compassion of any group of youth, and who experience a sudden drop in the trait between middle and high school.Inspired by a similar curriculum for adults created by Dr. Neff and the psychologist Christopher Germer, the program\u2019s evaluations revealed lowered stress in middle and high school participants, compared with those in a control group. Participants also had lower anxiety and depression, and elevated resilience and healthy risk taking.To teach their children how to show themselves grace in the face of a challenge, I coach parents to model self-compassion in the face of everyday setbacks. Instead of cursing at yourself when you lose your keys, verbalize mindfulness: \u201cI am feeling so frustrated right now.\u201d When describing a disappointment at work, demonstrate what self-kindness sounds like: \u201cI did my best, and I\u2019ll make sure not to make that mistake next time.\u201d When you burn dinner, recognize common humanity: \u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not the only bummed out parent feeding their kids pizza tonight.\u201dIf more students use self-compassion to reframe their failures, they may discover more nourishing sources of motivation and healthier strategies to pursue their goals.An earlier version of this article omitted the names of two people who were co-creators of self-compassion programs. They are Lorraine Hobbs, who worked on the teen curriculum, and Christopher Germer, on the adult version.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m hearing from people who were friends of my brother in high school who didn\u2019t realize he was dead. Friends of mine from elementary school and high school.Netflix opened the door for the rest of the world to see the movie. It just so happened the rest of the world includes people who have written to say my mother changed their lives. People saying yes, thank you for showing that this is not something that black people have been imagining. It\u2019s really humbling.\u201cStrong Island\u201d has been doing more and more of the work. I think that\u2019s the shift you hear in my voice. That I haven\u2019t been the one to have to carry it all. It\u2019s out in the world and can speak for itself. It does take the pressure off me in a way. I definitely feel like I\u2019m more present than the 1992 Yance or the 2012 Yance, when I walked away from a very stable job into what felt like a great unknown. Being out as a trans man isn\u2019t new in my personal life, but it\u2019s new in the public sphere. I started part of my transition before the film was complete, and now I\u2019m further along in my transition. I\u2019m also more comfortable in my skin. The past 10 years has been about the movie, the, movie, the movie. And then I get to be in the world as my authentic self. I think that\u2019s the lightness that you hear.How does it feel to be so inspiring for people?Have you heard any reaction from law enforcement in Suffolk County?Does the film\u2019s release and success ease the weight of your grief, or change it at all?Grief for me is a moment-to-moment experience. I wish my parents were here to see it. I wish my mother were here to see this because she participated in the film. I have a lot of surrogate parents, but there\u2019s no one like your mother. At the Gotham Awards they played a clip of my mom; it was incredible. The entire room came to a standstill. It was amazing to see the effect my mother has on people. On the other hand, it really magnifies how absent she is.Was the name \u201cStrong Island\u201d a metaphor for your family?\u201cStrong Island\u201d [was temporary] because it was slang for Long Island and I needed a title for my first grant application. Then it became known as that in the doc community. You realize you can\u2019t change the title. In hindsight I\u2019m glad I chose it, though it wasn\u2019t a metaphor for my family. It helped the people locate the story and keep the title short.

{"Headline": "28 Days, 28 Films for Black History Month", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "The critical and box-office success of \u201cGet Out\u201d and the very existence of big-studio productions like \u201cBlack Panther\u201d are good reasons to revisit the remarkable, complex story of black filmmaking in America. For Black History Month, we have selected 28 essential films from the 20th century pertaining to African-American experiences. These aren\u2019t the 28 essential black-themed films, but a calendar of suggested viewing. We imposed a chronological cutoff in an effort to look back at where we were and how we got to here.Race movies disappeared shortly after World War II, and soon the mainstream industry turned toward social issues. Yet even as the civil rights movement gathered force, black characters and their experiences were seen through a white lens, often myopically. Consider this sobering fact: Between 1948 (when Micheaux\u2019s last film appeared) and 1969 (when Gordon Parks\u2019s \u201cThe Learning Tree\u201d arrived on the big screen), almost no movies directed by African-Americans were released commercially in the United States.Our selections for subsequent decades are exclusively the work of black directors. For the later 20th century, we have chosen titles that represent waves and countercurrents: Blaxploitation, the independent film scenes in Los Angeles and New York in the \u201970s and \u201980s, the flowering of commercial and independent movies in the \u201990s.

{"Headline": "Streaming Your Valentine\u2019s Day", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingCinephiles, like other mammals, need love. As such, we also need movies about love, and yes, in this category we often expect somewhat higher standards than those reflected in works like \u201cFailure to Launch\u201d or \u201cFriends With Benefits.\u201dAs Valentine\u2019s Day looms, I\u2019ve compiled my list of outstanding romantic films available on streaming video services. I begin with offerings on FilmStruck and its attendant Criterion Channel. A real find there is the \u201cHistory Is Made at Night,\u201d a still-underseen film from 1937 that\u2019s never been on a presentable DVD. It\u2019s one of the most romantic Hollywood movies ever, also one of the warmest and in some respects the funniest. Any attempts to sum up the plot of this film will sound daft. Story elements include a jealous husband, cheesy ventriloquism used for flirtation, two men who take over a restaurant for the sole purpose of attracting a single client, and an ocean liner forced to plow into an iceberg. But the chemistry between its stars, the ultra-Gallic Charles Boyer and Jean Arthur, playing up her cornfed American quality (early on Boyer\u2019s character nicknames her \u201cKansas\u201d), remains remarkable to this day. And Frank Borzage\u2019s direction of Gene Towne and C. Graham Baker\u2019s far-fetched screenplay is a model of seamless conviction.The Michael Powell-Emeric Pressburger picture \u201cI Know Where I\u2019m Going!\u201d from 1947, is a strong contender for the most romantic British picture ever made. Wendy Hiller\u2019s lead character thinks she knows where she\u2019s going \u2014 off to the Scottish Hebrides to marry for money. A detour in the company of a near-penniless laird (Roger Livesey) changes her plans. The raw beauty of the Scottish locations sets off the tumultuous love story in inimitable cinematic style. Other greats in FilmStruck\u2019s catalog include Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s sweet and graceful \u201cStolen Kisses,\u201d a 1969 picture in which Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, as the Truffaut alter-ego Antoine Doinel, tentatively pursues the lovely Claude Jade, but is intrigued by an older woman, Delphine Seyrig, and Howard Hawks\u2019s \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d (1940), starring Cary Grant as a newspaper editor who pursues his ex-wife and former star reporter, Rosalind Russell, in frantic, eccentric screwball-comedy style.Fandor\u2019s other romantic offerings include some old-school classics. An older Cary Grant indulges in some romantic intrigue with Audrey Hepburn in \u201cCharade\u201d (1963), a sort of Hitchcock homage directed by Stanley Donen with more emphasis on bubbly flirtatiousness than espionage. Two spectacular outings for the romantic comedy queen, Carole Lombard, are also here. \u201cNothing Sacred,\u201d the 1937 movie directed by William Wellman, features Lombard bamboozling Fredric March, playing a New York City journalist who naturally falls in love with her. \u201cMy Man Godfrey,\u201d a class-conscious 1936 comedy, sees Lombard as a shallow socialite who hires a \u201cforgotten man\u201d (William Powell) to play butler, only to tumble for him and become a better person in the process.As is not unsurprising, classic romance has little purchase on Netflix, but the service does offer \u201cThe African Queen,\u201d the director John Huston\u2019s cockeyed adventure in which a preacher woman (Katharine Hepburn) and an affable drunkard (Humphrey Bogart) make a terrifically odd couple while fleeing World War I Germans in a rickety boat, the source of the 1951 movie\u2019s title.And, if you\u2019re using a library card to access the streaming service Kanopy, that site offers the aforementioned \u201cCharade,\u201d \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d and \u201cStolen Kisses.\u201d It also has the disarming 2012 comedy \u201cGayby,\u201d a not-quite romance in which a gay man and his female best friend from college try to conceive a child together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Comcast Seeks Control of Broadcaster Sky, Countering Murdoch and Disney", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhoever prevails, it will shake up Disney\u2019s plans. Either 21st Century Fox will have to pay more for Sky, or Disney will lose a valuable international property to Comcast.In a statement, 21st Century Fox said that it \u201cremains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky,\u201d which it made in 2016.The saga over Sky has been one of the most drawn out deal-making dramas in media.Mr. Murdoch, the 21st Century Fox executive chairman, has tried for years to take full control of the broadcaster, which he started in 1989. By owning the rest of Sky, 21st Century Fox would be better positioned to take on the likes of Netflix, Amazon and other streaming giants.In 2011, Mr. Murdoch was forced to withdraw a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky as a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain. The scandal eventually led to the closing of The News of the World, the first newspaper Mr. Murdoch acquired in Britain in the late 1960s.21st Century Fox had hoped to complete the Sky deal before the Disney sale was finalized. But Comcast\u2019s move just adds uncertainty to an already complicated process.Disney, which declined to comment on Comcast\u2019s proposal, must now decide how much it cares about Sky. It is also not clear if Disney would want to end up being partners with Comcast, in the event that Comcast wins majority control of Sky and Disney ultimately has Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake.Comcast has circled 21st Century Fox in the past. Last year, the cable giant was in preliminary talks to buy the entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the minority stake in Sky. Disney ultimately prevailed.At the very least, Comcast has most likely made it more expensive for 21st Century Fox to buy all of Sky. Under the terms of its proposed bid, Comcast said, it would pay 12.50 pounds, about $17.50, a share in cash. That would represent a premium of 13 percent over its closing price on Monday and is about 16 percent above 21st Century Fox\u2019s current offer of \u00a310.75.On Tuesday, shares of the British broadcaster jumped by nearly one-fifth. The stock surge suggested investors expected 21st Century Fox to back away or come back with an even better offer.Comcast shareholders seemed less pleased. The company\u2019s stock price dropped more than 6 percent in midday trading, to about $37. Disney shares fell 4 percent, to about $105.50, and Fox shares declined 2.6 percent, to about $37.80.An influential media analyst, Craig Moffett, who follows Comcast for MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note that the Sky offer had positive aspects, including offering Comcast\u2019s entertainment unit, NBCUniversal, broader distribution in Europe.Still, \u201cComcast will have to twist themselves into knots to explain why satellite distribution won\u2019t be just as obsolete in Europe as it already is in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Moffett said. \u201cPerhaps worst of all, this morning\u2019s bid doesn\u2019t really put to rest the idea that they might still try a topping bid for Fox\u2019s U.S. assets, including the rest of Sky\u201d if the Justice Department ends up approving AT&T\u2019s takeover of Time Warner.\u201cThe notion that Comcast might make a topping bid for Fox has weighed heavily on Comcast shares,\u201d he added.For either Comcast or Disney, Sky offers a platform for international expansion.\u201cWe look at Sky as a media company: Sky News, Sky Sports, Sky Movies,\u201d Brian L. Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous presence in the content creation, not just the distribution.\u201dIn a research note on Tuesday, Polo Tang, a UBS analyst, said that Sky could be \u201cstrategically interesting\u201d to a variety of bidders, given its content and its broadcast and streaming distribution network. It also recently retained the rights to the Premier League at a lower cost than analysts had expected.Mr. Tang said that the benign outcome of the Premier League auction potentially \u201cgives Fox scope to raise its offers.\u201dComcast said it was seeking control of more than half of Sky\u2019s shares with Tuesday\u2019s offer but was ultimately interested in acquiring all of the British broadcaster.Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What I Learned from Watching My iPad\u2019s Slow Death", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyMy old iPad just turned five, and it\u2019s starting to die. If it could wonder about such things, it might question this prognosis. Its memory, after all, still retrieves information as quickly as it ever did. Its face hasn\u2019t aged a day, projecting as vividly as it did in 2012, when Apple called it \u201cstunning\u201d and \u201cgorgeous.\u201d It hasn\u2019t suffered vision loss; the camera still works. The touch-screen works. Buttons work. Speaker, headphone jack, charging port: All still do what I ask of them. On examination, almost nothing about the device seems to have changed. And yet it\u2019s starting to give up, and so am I.It hasn\u2019t been used up; it\u2019s just too old. A pristine iPad from the same era, forgotten in a storeroom and never touched, would be equally useless. The moment it came online, it would demand to be updated; as soon as it was, it would find itself in the same grim predicament as my device, which has been at work for half a decade.Fifteen years ago, before I would replace a desktop computer or a laptop, it would have quite conspicuously broken down, its fans getting louder, its spinning hard drive grinding to a halt. When I would replace it with something newer or faster or more capable, it would enter a promising second life: it could be repurposed as a spare, a computer for a friend, a terminal for playing old games or for doing undistracted work. It could be given to someone who could make use of it.As I did when I first got it, I still use my old iPad for passive consumption: reading, watching videos, checking feeds. My routine has barely changed, but one by one, formerly easy tasks have become strained. Social apps have become slow, videos take longer to load and Safari can\u2019t seem to handle the most important and fundamental services of the modern web.As my iPad has aged, I\u2019ve started to notice it more, not because I\u2019m growing fonder, but because I\u2019m getting frustrated: by the fact that it won\u2019t do what it ought to or even what it used to. But what I find most frustrating of all is the gradual disappearance of all options other than buying a new iPad. I understand the reasons for this. I understand the concept of \u201cplanned obsolescence\u201d less as a conspiracy than as the unfortunate but universal prerogative of dominant, profit-driven companies that make their money from selling hardware.In a world more accommodating toward my old iPad, I might squeeze another five years out of it by replacing the one part of these devices that tends to fail: the battery. I could purchase a kit from a site like iFixit, with a fresh battery and tools to pry my iPad apart, for $39.99. But the repair is quite involved and requires, among 71 other steps, heating up the device in order to pry its screen free of its glue. I could send it to Apple, which says out-of-warranty iPad battery service is $99 plus $6.95 in shipping plus local taxes, which totals more than I would get if I sent it to an Apple partner called Brightstar to be \u201crecycled\u201d: a $45 gift card to the Apple store. Lower down the rung is Gazelle, a company that buys old devices and resells them, often abroad. A tool on their website offered me $30, conditionally.Perhaps the best option is to sell my old iPad overseas to a consumer who understands what it is: not quite an iPad, but nevertheless a machine that will still chat, that will manage FaceTime, that can receive email or maybe take payments for a shop. But before long, it will lose the ability to do these things. It will still be a wonder of industrial design and a technological marvel, right up until the moment it is destroyed for scrap.John Herrman is a David Carr Fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Laurie Metcalf Was Hiding in Plain Sight", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "FeatureFrom \u201cLady Bird\u201d to \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d to a revival of \u201cRoseanne,\u201d the 62-year-old actress is finally showing off the extent of her range.Supported byOn a Saturday in early February, in a rehearsal space overlooking Times Square, light streaming through the double-height floor-to-ceiling windows, Metcalf was laboring over B, one of the three nameless characters in Edward Albee\u2019s 1994 Pulitzer Prize-winning play, \u201cThree Tall Women.\u201d A restaging, directed by Joe Mantello and co-starring Alison Pill and Glenda Jackson, will open on Broadway in March, and the cast was gathered at the end of the second week of rehearsal. Metcalf, her short dark hair curling around her ears, in a gray cowl-neck sweater and skinny gray jeans that looked baggy on her, deftly glided around the working set \u2014 an elderly woman\u2019s bedroom with a small vanity, a love seat, an armchair, a double bed \u2014 bracingly awake. She had traded in the Uggs she wore in that morning for a pair of thick-heeled black pumps, part of her costume.\u201cThree Tall Women,\u201d inspired by Albee\u2019s adopted mother, with whom he had a deeply fraught relationship, is a metaphysically complicated play that starts with a conversation between an old woman, A; her health aide, B; and a younger lawyer, C; and becomes an interrogation of identity, memory, personality and time. Despite not having much plot, it has a twist. Metcalf describes it as \u201cslippery.\u201d She is drawn to material that she doesn\u2019t entirely comprehend but that has a mood, a line, a joke, a stage direction that inspires strong emotion in her. \u201cThat\u2019s the hook,\u201d she says. \u201cNinety-seven percent of the play I don\u2019t understand yet, but we\u2019ll figure it out in the room. The other 3 percent I know exactly how to play it and how to help the audience have that initial gut feeling I had when I read it.\u201dIn the case of \u201cThree Tall Women,\u201d she was drawn in by the play\u2019s melancholy exploration of aging and the unexpected humor of its bare-bones writing style \u2014 like the moment when C says to B, \u201cI imagine I\u2019ll marry and I\u2019ll be very happy,\u201d to which B replies only, \u201cWell.\u201d To Metcalf, that \u201cWell\u201d was full of comedic possibility, a whoopee cushion at a chair convention. In the rehearsal room, Metcalf found dozens of variations on throwaway phrases, energetically and speedily trying out \u201cwe know\u201ds and \u201chonestly\u201ds in different registers and moods \u2014 furious, intimidating, apologetic, silly, exasperated, entreating. At one point, she delivered a \u201cwhee!\u201d and twirled around, her arms fully extended above her head. Mantello, who has directed her in two other Broadway plays, describes her as a \u201cmonster in the room. She supplies you with such a variety and wealth of choices, and she doesn\u2019t need a lot of guidance.\u201dThe theater, the medium that is closest to Metcalf\u2019s heart, is one of the few art forms left that you can\u2019t see whenever you want to: You can\u2019t watch a play on YouTube or stream it on Netflix. You had to be there, or you can only ever hear tell of it. It\u2019s too late to see Metcalf\u2019s Tony Award-winning performance in last year\u2019s \u201cA Doll\u2019s House Part 2,\u201d Lucas Hnath\u2019s riotous sequel to the original Ibsen play, in which she hilariously and brashly manspread onstage like a cowboy in a corset. Despite 40 years of theater roles, she\u2019s best known for having played the lovably blundering Aunt Jackie in the blue-collar \u201990s sitcom \u201cRoseanne,\u201d a part that made her famous and, in the fashion of hit TV, familiar.But it is Metcalf\u2019s role in Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d her first film in nearly a decade, that has lately encouraged us to see her anew. In her Oscar-nominated performance as Marion McPherson, mother of the teenage Lady Bird, she gives a performance so layered, vital and precise that it retroactively casts a spotlight on the meticulous but accessible, methodical but electric work she has been doing for decades. At 62, Metcalf is now being widely recognized for what she has always been, an actress of remarkable power, range and skill, a pre-eminent chronicler of the American working woman. Metcalf would be the first to say that her current tear \u2014 which includes three Emmy nominations in 2016 for \u201cGetting On,\u201d \u201cHorace & Pete\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d; that Tony Award in 2017; the current Oscar nomination; \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d; and a new season of \u201cRoseanne,\u201d the first in two decades, arriving in March \u2014 all goes back to being given such meaty parts at an age when most actresses are being forced into retirement. But she knew exactly what to do with these parts when she got them. \u201cShe is so hard-working,\u201d says Will Frears, who directed Metcalf in a 2015 Broadway adaptation of \u201cMisery.\u201d \u201cShe is extraordinary in her desire to be extraordinary.\u201dMantello told me that one thing he particularly loves about rehearsing with Metcalf are the moments when she\u2019s engrossed in a scene and hears him laugh: \u201cShe sort of glances out at me and laughs with me. She\u2019s both in it and aware she\u2019s entertaining me at the same time.\u201d I saw this double-consciousness in the rehearsal room, when B, A and C are reminiscing about losing their virginity, and A turns to B and asks if it hurt. Metcalf, kindly, but with a knowing tease in her voice, responded, \u201cOh ... well, a little.\u201d Mantello guffawed. Metcalf locked eyes with him and cackled back. But as her laughter faded, her face settled into something much sadder, nearly tearful. It was impossible to tell when, exactly, she fell back into the character or if she had ever really broken away from her at all.But Metcalf was too practical and shy to imagine she would become an actor. Raised in Southern Illinois by her mother, a librarian, and her father, a budget director for the state university system, she went to college at Illinois State University and studied anthropology and German. She thought she would become an interpreter, which, as she likes to point out, she did. But she ended up doing a couple of shows in the theater department, impressing Terry Kinney, a fellow student who was pals with Jeff Perry and Gary Sinise. In 1976, Metcalf joined them and five other actors in a theater company housed in a church basement in Highland Park, outside Chicago. The group saved money by taking the name of a failed theater company that had already incorporated as Steppenwolf.Austin Pendleton, who became a member of the company in the \u201980s, says working with Steppenwolf was \u201clike opening a broom closet and finding the future of American acting.\u201d Joan Allen, John Malkovich, Glenne Headly and Tracy Letts are just some of the company\u2019s other members, nearly all of whom are recognizable from television, movies or theater. In the beginning, they all had day jobs. Metcalf was a legal secretary who could bang out 120 words a minute. When work was over, they would head to the basement theater and work some more, a commune, an incestuous sibling society (Metcalf dated Kinney first and then Malkovich, before marrying Perry, the father of her oldest child, the actress Zoe Perry). They picked their plays, cast them, directed when they drew the short straw, drank beer, ushered, took tickets, cleaned the bathroom and sold subscriptions. They cast themselves in parts no one else would have let them play. Metcalf was a septuagenarian in \u201cTrue West\u201d and a 14-year-old girl. She stole a show as the ugliest, flirtiest woman in the world, gave a monologue with yarn in her mouth and played Laura from \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d as profoundly mentally ill, a performance that drew critics from Chicago and that the people who saw it still speak of in reverent tones.Metcalf was in her late 20s when her oldest daughter was born. She left her at home with a sitter every night that she appeared in the 1983 Off Broadway staging of Lanford Wilson\u2019s \u201cBalm in Gilead,\u201d a performance that has become the stuff of Broadway legend. A vast ensemble piece, set around a scruffy New York City diner, it was memorably punctuated by Metcalf\u2019s 20-minute monologue as the inane, sweet prostitute Darlene, who prattles on and on until both she and the audience are in tears. After being cast in \u201cRoseanne\u201d \u2014 during just a two-week visit to California to audition for some movies \u2014 she moved to Los Angeles, where she still lives. She raised three children with her ex-husband Matt Roth, who played her abusive boyfriend on \u201cRoseanne.\u201d Her oldest son is now grown, and Metcalf lives with her teenage son and 12-year-old daughter. When she won the Tony Award for \u201cA Doll\u2019s House Part 2,\u201d she thanked them for allowing her to be away so much.Metcalf has previously referred to herself as a workaholic, but when I asked her if this was true, she amended: \u201cI can\u2019t even call it work. I\u2019m a creative-a-holic. I love the tearing into new material.\u201d She recalls filming a three-person scene during the first season of \u201cRoseanne,\u201d in which she didn\u2019t have much dialogue. During a break, the director came over and said to her, \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to be acting during this part, because you\u2019re not on camera.\u201d Recalling this moment three decades later, she still can\u2019t keep the outrage from her voice. \u201cThat\u2019s the strangest thing I\u2019ve ever heard! What would I do, just drop out? Just pull the plug and go dead for a while as they\u2019re sitting two feet away from me?\u201dThere is a brawny, brainy populism to her high artistry, reflected in the everyday women she likes to play. Aunt Jackie is a hysterically funny working-class neurotic, lost and searching. In a 20-minute monologue in \u201cHorace & Pete,\u201d Metcalf uses only her face to tell a genuinely erotic tale of middle-aged desire. In HBO\u2019s \u201cGetting On,\u201d which ended in 2015, her Jenna James, a geriatric doctor with the bedside manner of a rude telemarketer, is a cringe-comedy buffoon, whom Metcalf gives a soul. In \u201cLady Bird,\u201d Metcalf plays Marion McPherson with enough verve and eye rolls to transcend the clich\u00e9 of the nagging mother, suggesting with her performance that adolescent energy may not fade, so much as age into a more potent vintage. Her characters are high-strung women in the thick of busy lives, whose interiors Metcalf, from the midst of her own busy life, evokes with care, ingenuity and intensity. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to blow out a camera lens or make the audience\u2019s hair go straight back from my sheer volume, sheer energy level,\u201d Metcalf says, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t hold onto your hat.She was both exhausted and full of ideas. \u201cNo matter how many times you\u2019ve done it, the early stages of getting a show up on its feet is very hit and miss,\u201d she said. \u201cThere seem to be thousands of options on every page to discover. All of a sudden, you find yourself like: I\u2019m sitting in the same spot for about 10 pages, and I know that I would be bored looking at this. So now what do I do? I have to challenge myself to figure it out. Try it, try it, try it. Keep trying different things. It\u2019s a big puzzle.\u201d When I asked her when she last tried something that completely failed, she answered immediately: \u201cToday, two hours ago.\u201dMetcalf was still getting a handle on B. \u201cI\u2019m starting to see the possibilities of being a caretaker who cares and a caretaker who doesn\u2019t care and that they can exist in the same person,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen can I show when she doesn\u2019t care?\u201d She reached into her bag for the play, which was dog-eared and highlighted, and began to flip through it. \u201cO.K.,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s a line in here where I say, \u2018They want to take it off, her arm.\u2019 The other character says, \u2018What?\u2019 It\u2019s a clue, maybe, as to how my character could be super-perverse. If I wanted to go down that road, how do I play it with the wink so the audience knows that I\u2019m trying to affect that other actor in a certain way?\u201d And then Metcalf said the line in character, breaking into it as easily and instinctually as she might tuck the hair behind her ear. \u201cThe arm. They want to take the arm off.\u201dWatching Metcalf do this, so effortlessly twist a line, made me think not so much about how acting is magic but how magic takes practice. The best tricks are built upon thousands of hours of training, rehearsal and preparation. In this way, acting is not unlike sports. Metcalf was described to me as an athlete more times than I can count, and watching her riff on that line was like watching someone hit a jump shot without even trying, on pure muscle memory, where the muscle Metcalf is flexing is her encyclopedic grasp of human behavior.Even Metcalf\u2019s hobbies lend themselves to her work. She took her one sip of wine and launched into them. She does the crossword puzzle every morning and always has a jigsaw puzzle going at home. She knits, she crochets and, \u201cin an obsessive craze,\u201d she taught herself how to spin wool. \u201cYou have to learn it in your hands, and then once you do, you don\u2019t have to think about it anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cIt keeps my hands busy, which keeps my brain busy, and I can just sit and run lines or obsess about school lunches or whatever loop I find myself in.\u201dThis is the quintessential Metcalf anecdote, an example of her expending her intelligence, work ethic and creativity to make deeper sense of this woman and the play, giving each a more comprehensive dignity. Sharr White, who wrote the 2011 play \u201cThe Other Place,\u201d in which Metcalf starred as a scientist in a health crisis, described working with her as \u201cthe process of articulating through every moment and building it technically from the ground up, so it can start resonating emotionally. That\u2019s what she does, builds it brick by brick by brick until it\u2019s this solid, imposing performance.\u201d She lays those bricks just so, until those bricks levitate. \u201cYou pour yourself into your work, you invest yourself 150 percent, and when you do,\u201d Metcalf says, \u201cyou sleep well at night.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Up? College in the Age of Tinder", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn campusSome found love; others learned valuable lessons about time stamps.It may not be on any syllabus, but college has always been a time for young people to learn about relationships and sex. But as the internet increasingly influences the ways we interact, it also transforms how students date and find partners. We asked students at nine colleges and universities how technology affects the campus dating scene.Madeline Apple, University of Michigan, Class of 2018Dating apps may have killed the college dating scene. Because it\u2019s so easy to swipe left or right on a seemingly endless pile of potential partners, it\u2019s become harder to actually meet anyone. As students, we are told over and over that college is a time for us to expand our social groups, to meet new people and grow into adults. But the indecisiveness that is built into dating app culture can stunt us \u2014 we\u2019re trapped in an endless cycle of swipes! Commitment, already a scary concept to many, becomes even more difficult with the false illusion that the dating possibilities are endless.Frankly, dating apps can also just make things incredibly awkward. My freshman year I swiped through hundreds of people. At one of the last tailgates of the year, a random man walked by me and yelled: \u201cHey! We matched on Tinder! You are Tinder girl!\u201dI was mortified. Suddenly everyone around me knew that I was on Tinder. And I had swiped through so many people, I had no idea who this guy was. He was just another nameless \u201cmatch\u201d that I would never get to know. Because, needless to say, I walked away and never spoke to that guy again.Tinder is supposed to bring people together, but it actually pushes them emotionally further apart. The fact that there could be hundreds, if not thousands, of potential dates in your pocket gives an illusion of possibility. In reality, students just become more isolated in a world of fake interactions and awkward run-ins with old matches. We\u2019re not getting out of our comfort zone to meet new people. Why approach someone in person when you can hide behind a Tinder profile?Catherine Gumarin, Mercer University, Class of 2019Mary Walz, University of Iowa, Class of 2020College students don\u2019t date. Instead, we \u201chang out.\u201d One of the most popular ways to hang out is to \u201cNetflix and Chill,\u201d a trope so common it became a meme. A typical hangout of the Netflix variety begins with one student going to another\u2019s residence, which is usually small and in a state of disarray. Next, the couple sit on the bed or futon (in the case of nicer dorms) and decide what movie or show to watch. This decision-making process can take up to half an hour and is often the most stressful time. With so many different genres, there is the problem of choice. But ultimately the most important consideration \u2014 the stressful element \u2014 is this question: What will be appropriate background noise for making out? The wrong choice could kill the mood. You don\u2019t want to be mid-makeout while the jewel-encrusted crab from \u201cMoana\u201d is singing about how shiny he is.If I could tell my younger self one thing upon entering college, it would be don\u2019t expect much from these campus boys. My first encounter with college dating was with someone who was the exact Urban Dictionary definitions of unreliable and unpredictable. Eventually his move became frequent late-night messages. He\u2019d text, \u201cYou got any water?\u201d What kind of question is that? It\u2019s definitely lame code for \u201cCan we hang out?\u201d and a poor excuse for romance. Later on I was infatuated with another guy, a charmer, to the point that I thought it was the start of an actual relationship. From this smooth talker, I learned the three stages of seriousness in college dating.The first stage is \u201changing out.\u201d In this phase you get to know each other as friends, and sometimes kiss. (Side note: I don\u2019t kiss my friends.) The second stage is \u201ctalking.\u201d In this phase you are not exclusive with the person, but you\u2019re also not on the market to \u201chang out\u201d with anyone else. The last stage is \u201csnatched.\u201d No, \u201csnatched\u201d is not slang for any dubious behavior. It means \u201cin a relationship\u201d \u2014 like Facebook-official status. The charmer never wanted to move past the \u201changing out\u201d stage, but I hung on for a while. Hopefully, I\u2019ll never make the mistake of investing my time in someone like that again. The most important lesson in college dating is to make your own experiences, and not let them make you. Emma Thom, Sweet Briar College, Class of 2018I fell in love with the small classroom environment of Sweet Briar College and the picturesque scenery of its surroundings in the middle of nowhere, Virginia. But as a heterosexual female at an all-women\u2019s college, my dating life was nonexistent until I was introduced to Tinder and Bumble. Initially I hated the concept of dating apps. The upside to them was blind dates (yikes) and the downside was the opportunity to get rejected in three seconds or less by a potential match. But as I began to create my dating profiles, choosing the most attractive pictures of me and my golden retriever, I started to have some fun. I hadn\u2019t yet warmed up to the idea of driving an hour or two to grab a drink with a stranger, but the conversations were light and the attention was wonderful. After hundreds of swipes left and right \u2014 and plenty of opening lines that received no response \u2014 I finally matched with a guy I was eager to meet. He was a Virginia Tech student who seemed intelligent, witty and happened to be 6-foot-4 \u2014 tall enough for my highest heels. Conveniently, my best friend is also a student at Tech, so when I told her about this new guy, she immediately responded with \u201cCome to Blacksburg! You can meet up with him, and if he sucks, stay with me.\u201d So I drove two hours to meet a guy I\u2019d only been messaging for a week and a half. I\u2019d never heard the sound of his voice, or seen the way he walked or chewed his food. What would he think about my smile or the awkward snorting sound I make when I laugh too hard? I pulled into the parking lot of the Thai restaurant hoping that I didn\u2019t have pit stains and flaking mascara. When I saw him waiting for me, I almost did a double take \u2014 not because he didn\u2019t look like the guy in the pictures, but because he looked better. He was tall, blond, with green eyes and a smile wider and more welcoming than I\u2019d imagined. We had dinner and drinks, and several months later, we\u2019re still doing the same. Dating apps aren\u2019t for everyone, but they gave me the opportunity to meet someone I wasn\u2019t sure existed.Caleb Keyes, Otterbein University, Class of 2018In high school I had always wanted to date but struggled to believe anyone would want to date me. When I got to college those fears were compounded by a feeling of trepidation that if I tried to date someone and we broke up, it would be hard to see them around campus. A friend encouraged me to download Coffee Meets Bagel, which was described as a dating app for people who are easily overwhelmed. I got a date and she suggested we get ice cream, even though it was snowing outside. It was old-school romantic in a way I hadn\u2019t expected. She looked beautiful with snowflakes falling on her hair and her cheeks red from the cold.Roxanne Powell, San Jose State University, Class of 2018 There is something to be said for technology and the way it has made our lives easier. But for all the time we spend on our devices, talking and looking at people across the country or globe, we can miss the people right in front of us. Sure, you can be attracted to someone online, but without meeting them in person, looking them in the eyes, holding their hand or giving them a hug, how can you know if that connection holds up IRL?Someone I was dating made a friend online which developed into something more, and I was blindsided by it. It was painful to see the person I cared about, the person I saw a future with, share more of his time with someone he had never met than with me.I kept wondering what I had done wrong, what I could have done differently, what this other person might have that I lacked. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the flexibility of an online relationship simply seemed easier to him. I couldn\u2019t compete with someone who could be accessed with the push of a button. Nor do I want to.Caroline Roddy, Bates College, Class of 2021Ping! You have a new match. Be the first one to say hello.During my first semester at Bates College I matched with a guy on Tinder who plays the same sport as me, ice hockey, and also has a Labrador retriever. Even though he lived an hour away, we agreed to meet at my college, and later go on a surprise adventure. He drove up in a car with a custom license plate and a CD collection stocked with Black Eyed Peas albums and obscure metal bands. We embarked on our adventure and were driving down a rural road in Maine when he suddenly pulled over. \u201cGreat,\u201d I thought. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to get into the hands of a serial killer. What will my mother say now?\u201d He led me on a hike along a trail to a quarry. It wasn\u2019t ideal for a first date: The exercise, coupled with the get-to-know-you conversation, left me out of breath and sounding like a dying cat. As we walked along, I tried to gauge his interest in politics, mumbling something about the upcoming local election and telling him that one of the candidates went to my college. He didn\u2019t seem interested in this tidbit, but otherwise, we had a good time together. We found out we both enjoyed the artist Lorde and shared a love of Thai food. Eventually, we turned around and he dropped me back off on campus. After exchanging occasional texts for a month, I received a message from him: \u201cHey so can I ask you something?\u201d I hesitated, thinking: \u201cIs he defining the relationship already? That was quick.\u201dI replied with a cool, \u201cyea what\u2019s up?\u201d Casual enough, I thought. Unassuming.He told me he\u2019s not liberal so we should avoid talking about politics. Ah, right. Not a serial killer, but perhaps a Trump voter. That relationship ended there.Kasey Roper, University of Virginia, Class of 2021I\u2019m a freshman at the University of Virginia, but my girlfriend attends college out West. In order to sustain our relationship we rely on technology and the Postal Service. Technology has definitely made maintaining a relationship easier, since we can talk frequently and immediately. But it is also prone to glitches: Messages sometimes don\u2019t send or they get cut off because of the Apple-Android divide, which, coupled with the fact that I refuse to update iOS, leads to accidental miscommunication. If we\u2019re in the middle of an important conversation, that \u201cunsent\u201d message can cause a lot of hurt feelings that don\u2019t just disappear when one of us explains that \u201cI wasn\u2019t ignoring you, the message just didn\u2019t send.\u201d It\u2019s a major inconvenience, but we have learned to be understanding about it. The saving grace of a long-distance relationship is the letters. About every two weeks, I get an email saying I have a package, and, unless it\u2019s the beginning of the semester and my textbooks haven\u2019t come in yet, I know it\u2019s from her. I eagerly wait until my classes are over for the day and rush to the mailroom to pick it up. Then I hide out in my room, my desk full of reminders of her \u2014 a pride flag made out of Legos, our initials spelled out in thumbtacks, pictures of us \u2014 and read the letter. In these notes to each other we say everything that needs to be expressed more intimately than can be said over a text or a video chat, as well as random thoughts we\u2019ve had that get lost in everyday conversation. We also send care packages to cheer each other up during difficult times. She recently sent me a mixtape of songs relevant to our relationship, and I made one for her, too. Advertisement"}

Tronc is likely to use the sale proceeds to pay down its debt.\u2014 Sydney EmberAfter days of sometimes wild moves in stock markets, investors on Wall Street refocused on the ongoing strength in the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A sometimes-panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated through the day, and the S.&P. 500 ended Tuesday\u2019s session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs.Investors appeared to reassess whether the previous day\u2019s violent decline\u2014the S.&P. suffered its worst decline since August 2011\u2014reflected actual fundamentals or was merely a long-overdue outbreak of investor jitters.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk higher, as measures of volatility\u2014the ups and downs of stock prices\u2014hit historically low levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop in which growth and inflation remained lackluster, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But the peaceful climb ended over the past week amid worries that solid economic growth in the United States and abroad could be showing early signals of growing inflation pressure. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data\u2014such as the U.S. jobs report on Friday\u2014showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.The Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became the latest prominent company to report solid earnings amidst the market turmoil. The strong numbers support the belief that plunging stock markets do not reflect weakness in the real economy.Disney made $1.89 per share in the last three months of 2017, after excluding a tax benefit. That number is 22 percent higher than the $1.55 per share earnings in the same period of 2016. It is also well in excess of the $1.61 per share that Wall Street analysts had forecast for the latest quarter.Disney did best in its parks and resorts business, which reported $1.35 billion of operating income, which was 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period. The earlier period\u2019s results were somewhat depressed by the impact of Hurricane Matthew, Disney said. In its press release, the company noted that higher profits at its domestic parks and resorts were driven by an increase in guest spending and an increase in attendance, which underscores consumers\u2019 willingness to spend more. On the other hand, the company said parks and resorts are dealing with higher labor costs and other expenses. That may not be lost on investors who are starting to see inflation as a threat to stock prices.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Numbers\u2022 Snap reported revenue rose 72 percent to $285.7 million, easily exceeding the $252.9 million expected by analysts.\u2022 The company lost 13 cents per share, below estimates of 16 cents a share.\u2022 Snap added 8.9 million daily active users for a total of 187 million, compared to the 184.2 million estimated.The ContextSnap\u2019s shares have struggled since its initial public offering in March 2017. The stock fell below its I.P.O price of $17 a share last summer and has remained below that level since. If Snap\u2019s after-hours gains hold up on Wednesday, the stock will be on the cusp of crossing back over its I.P.O. level.The stock market\u2019s slide over the past week has given investors plenty of anxiety.Stocks have lost roughly $4 trillion in value. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 endured their worst point declines in their histories Monday and their largest percentage drops since 2011. C.B.O.E. Volatility Index surged more than 100 percent Monday, the biggest increase in its history.But there are reasons investors shouldn\u2019t get too concerned.Strategists over at Goldman Sachs wrote:\u201cThe stock market correction appears to be more technical and positioning-driven rather than fundamentally-based.We believe the fundamental drivers of the equity market remain intact and reiterate our S&P 500 year-end 2018 forecast of 2850.\u201dHere\u2019s a video of the launch:When stock markets are plunging, sober-minded investors try to gauge the underlying strength of bellwether companies, to see whether all the selling is justified.That is why many eyes will be on the earnings of the Walt Disney Company, which reports after the close of regular trading Tuesday. If the company releases stronger-than-expected results for the three months through the end of December, it will reinforce a general sense of optimism about corporate America .Stellar results from Disney would add to a strong earnings report on Tuesday from General Motors, which helped push the company\u2019s shares 3 percent higher. Micron Technology, a large maker of computer chips, on Monday upped its outlook for the current quarter. Its shares soared 7.7 percent on Tuesday.Though Disney is not a high growth company, its results offer insight into the strength of consumer spending. As a result, if the company reports earnings that are below the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, it may add to the unease among investors..Of course, a lot more companies are going to have to report strong earnings to convince investors to jump back into the stock market. One of the reasons that stocks rallied in recent months is that analysts are expecting a 20-percent plus jump in profits in 2018, an eye-popping rise. The more large companies that hit their numbers in this earnings season, the more likely the stock market will find a floor.\u2014 Peter EavisAt a hearing of the Senate banking committee on Tuesday, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama asked the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the market turmoil.\u201cIs this perhaps more than an ordinary correction?\u201d Mr. Shelby asked.Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C. said that he could not tell what had caused the big declines, but he said that the market infrastructure had held up well under the strain of heavy trading.\u201cAs I sit here today, there\u2019s nothing that came out of this that concerns me,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the C.F.T.C. said that his staff had a late night on Monday checking in with all the exchanges, and had not heard anything that concerned them.\u201cThe system worked as it was designed to do,\u201d he said.\u2014 Nathaniel PopperFollowing a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that he has been in touch with market participants this week and that they are reacting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems. He said it was possible that algorithmic trading was partially responsible for the recent volatility in the stock market.\u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said.Despite that volatility, it does not appear that the Trump administration is ready to give up on the stock market as a measure of its success.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been looking at the long-term impact of the stock market, it\u2019s still up over 30 percent since the election and we continue to think American is a great place to do business,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with companies\u2019 response with more and more investments in the U.S.\u201dAsked about the roiled stock market at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the Trump administration was not concerned and that it remains focused on the long-term trajectory of the economy.\u201cWe are very focused on long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we have enacted, including tax reform are very positive for long-term economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He said that he was closely monitoring for orderly market functioning and that there were \u201cno systemic issues\u201d that were reported to him.\u201cI\u2019m happy to report I got the green lights,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The Treasury secretary said that given how much the market has rallied in the last year, he does not think the recent drop in prices raises financial stability concerns.Asked if the Trump administration will take the blame for the recent drop in stocks after taking credit for the rally, Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\u201cI think we\u2019ll still claim credit for the fact that it\u2019s up over 30 percent since the election,\u201d he said of the stock market.\u2014 Alan RappeportWhen stock markets sell off as they have the past two trading sessions, there is often more than one cause. But one popular trade is taking a lot of blame for Monday\u2019s plunge: short volatility.Investors had piled money into exchange-traded products designed to rise when the C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, falls. The VIX, known as the market\u2019s fear gauge, measures how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead. Those wagers paid off handsomely, rising 180 percent last year as the VIX plumbed historic lows.That quickly reversed Monday.

His family controls 39 percent of Fox\u2019s Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox\u2019s assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast.Elsewhere in the deal world\u201cI talked to women engineers at Uber who were getting invited to strip clubs and bondage clubs in the middle of the day.

{"Headline": "Netflix Is Getting Huge. But Can It Get Great?", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Murphy, welcome to the Upside Down.That\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s not mine, and ordinarily, I don\u2019t much care how an entertainment Croesus moves around its ducats. TV outlets make big deals all the time.Is it most similar to an online-video platform, like YouTube? A network, like NBC? A channel, like HBO? (These questions apply as well to other streamers, like Hulu and Amazon Prime, but to Netflix above all.)The Murphy and Rhimes deals suggest something else: It\u2019s an entire parallel TV universe, and it\u2019s still expanding.Think of Netflix as the Upside Down in its sci-fi series \u201cStranger Things.\u201d By this I don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a nefarious or dangerous force. But it is a kind of alternative TV dimension, overlaying and replicating the known world of traditional television, that tries to acquire one of everything that exists in the universe of TV.Initially, the company did this through literal acquisition: buying streaming rights to hit TV series. Then it did it through imitation: reviving Fox\u2019s \u201cArrested Development\u201d and creating originals, like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d in the mold of premium cable. Now it\u2019s imitating through acquisition, spiriting away the likes of Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes to its well-remunerated plane.The history of TV is one of upstarts and competitors, and my first instinct was to liken Netflix to something like cable, which rose as a serious competitor to broadcast TV in the 1980s.But there\u2019s an important difference between cable channels and Netflix (besides whom you write your check to). Cable channels have brands. That was what made them different from broadcast networks, which tried to be, and had to be, everything. Cable channels had specialties and sensibilities: CNN was news; ESPN was sports; HBO was adult sophistication (give or take an \u201cEntourage\u201d).A cable brand might evolve \u2014 Bravo went from an arts channel to the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d channel \u2014 but the idea was to offer a specific aesthetic to a specific audience.Something for everyone \u2014 that was the ethos of broadcast TV in the old three-network era. The obvious analogy, then, is that Netflix isn\u2019t cable at all; it\u2019s a broadcaster, pitching a big tent.That business imperative had aesthetic results: It gave us family sitcoms and comfort-food cop dramas. It\u2019s less true today, in the era of smaller audiences \u2014 but it\u2019s still much more true of NBC than, say, of IFC.Netflix, on the other hand, is breathtakingly broad and microscopically niche at the same time. It\u2019s selling a platform to everyone, but by providing products for very specific tastes.Netflix assumes a future in which we\u2019re watching our faves on our own screens, rather than gathering around an electronic fireplace \u2014 and as long as the monthly payment clears, it\u2019s all the same to the company. It\u2019s less a big tent than a Dothraki tent city, to borrow a metaphor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dWhat does this mean for Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes? Maybe not much at all. They were both powerful producers with a lot of freedom who will now have a lot of freedom and more money.Mr. Murphy was, in a way, the Netflix-iest of producers to begin with: He\u2019d made everything from a broadcast network sitcom (\u201cThe New Normal\u201d) to an action show (\u201c9-1-1\u201d) to a marquee cable drama (\u201cFeud\u201d) to an HBO film (\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d). He may be able to branch out even more, but he was hardly fettered.What Ms. Rhimes does at Netflix will be interesting. She\u2019s the consummate network TV producer, having essentially defined the current voice of ABC with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201dShe might do something very different with the license of streaming \u2014 but if she doesn\u2019t, that will fit in all the same at Netflix, which resurrected the broadcast favorite \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d with much the same tone, give or take a few curse words. One curious thing about Netflix is that every sensibility \u2014 niche and mass, G-rated and NSFW \u2014 exists on the same platform and the same plane.What I do care about is whether Netflix can nurture original, distinctive art, especially if it continues growing into a huge, all-encompassing alterna-TV.And I worry whether it can do that when derivation is the business strategy itself: selling people new versions of things they already like. It\u2019s fine that Netflix can toss around enough money to reactivate David Letterman. But does it have the kind of culture that could discover a new David Letterman?It may be that Netflix\u2019s approach means more competence and fewer out-and-out stinkers. And I have no reason to believe that Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes will become any less creative because Netflix backed up a money truck.But if Netflix is truly becoming a parallel TV universe, I hope its algorithm finds room for the experimental and untried. It\u2019s hard to be groundbreaking when your whole purpose is to take people where they\u2019ve already been.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney Reports Mixed Earnings and a Full Project Pipeline", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 \u201cPardon our pixie dust.\u201dWhen the Walt Disney Company undertakes construction projects at its theme parks, it displays signs with that message as a promise of the magic to come.Disney reported mixed quarterly earnings on Tuesday as losses associated with the development of the planned streaming services \u2014 the first of which, arriving in the spring, will involve ESPN and cost $4.99 a month \u2014 hurt Disney\u2019s cable television division, where operating income fell 1 percent to $858 million. Disney\u2019s movie studio also reported weaker results, as did the company\u2019s consumer products business.On the bright side, operating income increased 21 percent, to $1.35 billion, at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts because of higher attendance and ticket prices at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland Paris, among other properties. (Disney is expected in the coming week to increase ticket prices again, particularly for peak vacation times, as a way to spread out attendance.) Disney Cruise Line also had a strong quarter.Analysts, however, were focused on Disney\u2019s various growth plans during a post-earnings conference call, peppering Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, with questions about the company\u2019s $52.4 billion offer for 21st Century Fox assets last month. He had few specific answers.\u201cWe don\u2019t really have any update on the regulatory front,\u201d Mr. Iger said, adding that he intends to be \u201cpatient\u201d as antitrust officials scrutinize the acquisition. Mr. Iger did say that he had met with several Fox executives in recent weeks, \u201cgaining insight that will be invaluable when it comes to integrating our organizations.\u201dWhen the conversation turned to ESPN Plus, Disney\u2019s sports streaming service, Mr. Iger emphasized that users would be able to personalize their experience. ESPN Plus will exist inside the ESPN app, which is being rebuilt.For its first fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 30, Disney had net income of $4.42 billion, or $2.91 a share, compared with $2.48 billion, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier. Most of the increase was attributable to a $1.6 billion one-time tax benefit associated with the rewrite of the federal tax code. Excluding the tax benefit, Disney had per-share results for the quarter of $1.89. Revenue totaled $15.35 billion, a 4 percent increase.Analysts had predicted per-share profit of $1.61 and revenue of $15.45 billion. Disney shares increased about 3 percent in after-hours trading, to $109.28.The company\u2019s vast television division, Disney Media Networks, has been buffeted by subscriber declines at ESPN, a problem that continued during the quarter as more people cut cable and relied on streaming services like Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. Advertising revenue at ESPN also dropped; Disney cited a timing shift in college football playoff games as one reason. Lackluster ratings at Disney-owned ABC also caused headaches for Disney Media Networks, which reported a 12 percent decline in operating income, to $1.19 billion.Disney\u2019s movie studio had operating income of $829 million, down 2 percent from a year earlier. Box office successes in the quarter included \u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d which collected $852.7 million worldwide (26 percent more than \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d took in a year earlier). But Walt Disney Studios suffered from weaker home entertainment results \u2014 \u201cCars 3\u201d did not sell as well on DVD as \u201cFinding Dory\u201d did a year earlier.An earlier version of this article misstated the price of Disney\u2019s shares following after-hours trading. The price was $109.28, not $106.17.Advertisement"}

Compared with the modern digital soundscape, though, his era is positively muted. Bombastic, attention-grabbing inorganic noises are becoming the norm, disruptive sonic alerts trigger Pavlovian feedback, and simulated sounds are supplanting analog ones.Mobile games may be where sounds have changed most over the last decade. Phones have a small dynamic range, meaning the difference between the softest and loudest portions is limited compared with, say, a high-quality movie theater sound system.Why can you so often overhear other people\u2019s games? Prof. Cohen-Sinclair said that designers accentuate the midrange sound frequency, which translates best to earbuds and small speakers, and to which humans are most sensitive. Because mobile games often compete with external noise, they also contain louder sounds that often carry beyond the player\u2019s earbuds.Something similar was certainly at play with the ringing landline of yesteryear, but phone calls come at a far slower pace, take more time and rarely involve the caller (let alone hundreds of them) affirming how much they \u201clike\u201d you.Whereas the old guard privileged pleasing musicality or organic sounds and tried to create distinctive signatures that somehow represented their brand, the new wave seems primarily concerned with securing the viewer\u2019s attention immediately, at a minimum of time, through jarring, synthesized noises that are ultimately interchangeable with those of other companies.Many digital sound effects, such as the camera shutter, can be classified as \u201cskeuomorphs,\u201d or imitation objects that unnecessarily use ornamental design features of the originals (such as fake stitching on pleather seats). Their ubiquity suggests a postmodern aural backdrop in which the artificial is increasingly replacing the real. For people who grew up hearing only the real sounds, the new distinctions are likely clearer.\u201cSomeone who\u2019s 80 and someone who\u2019s 12 are going to have different responses to a sound,\u201d said Will Mason, a visiting professor of music theory at Oberlin. But the 12-year-old isn\u2019t necessarily at a disadvantage, he said: \u201cWe want to privilege the real sounds over the synthesized ones, and we want to think a shift to a landscape characterized by these \u2018artificial sounds\u2019 is a dystopian element. But I wonder why it is that we want to call it dystopian. There seems to be some knee-jerk, intuitive way in which that\u2019s the default stance and in which the real is preferable.\u201dAs we blithely send our personal data to companies on a whoosh and a bleep, we think less and less about hearing so many other disembodied and artificial noises in the background. We may not love Big Brother, but seem to be O.K. with his cacophonous little siblings.Advertisement"}

And I was like, \u2018Am I!\u2019\u201dWhen Mr. Wright, Mr. Futterman and Mr. Gibney entered Hulu\u2019s headquarters in Santa Monica, Calif., their expectations were not high. \u201cIt was a meeting we considered discretionary,\u201c said Mr. Wright, 70, who goes by Larry.The author and his two collaborators sat in a tiny conference room with Mr. Erwich and Beatrice Springborn, Hulu\u2019s head of original programming. During the meeting Mr. Erwich did not hold back his enthusiasm. \u201cHe was like a fanboy of Larry\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Futterman recalled.The Hulu executives surprised the \u201cLooming Tower\u201d team by offering them the works. A straight-to-series order, with no lengthy development process? Done. A promise not to buckle under pressure from the federal agencies who may not like how the series would portray them? Done. The biggest dollar commitment? Done.They ended up at a nearby Italian restaurant. Seated at a sidewalk table in the evening light, Mr. Wright and Mr. Gibney ordered martinis, Mr. Futterman had a Peroni, and they talked it over. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Hulu? Is it growing? Is it not growing?\u2019\u201d Mr. Futterman recalled. \u201cWe talked about whether this was a mistake or not.\u201dThe Disney-Fox deal raises the question of what will happen to Hulu, given that Disney is already developing two streaming services. Another potential issue is whether or not two of Hulu\u2019s owners \u2014 Disney, which owns ABC, and Comcast, which owns NBC Universal \u2014 will be able to play nicely with each other after they become owners with uneven stakes in the platform.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly awkward,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, a global financial services firm. \u201cThe question is which way it goes: Does Comcast buy out Disney? Or does Disney buy out Comcast?\u201d\u201cBeginning last year, we said this was a time for Hulu to really grow up and be aggressive and be much more offensive in its approach, rather than being defensive,\u201d Randy Freer, the chief executive of Hulu, said.The company has been fighting its way to prominence ever since it began as an answer to YouTube in 2007.\u201cHulu really started as, and has been for the better part of a decade, a hedge,\u201d Mr. Freer said. \u201cIt started as a hedge against YouTube \u2014 they were going to dominate digital video. Then it was a hedge against Netflix \u2014 you didn\u2019t want one buyer of content.\u201dMr. Futterman, the screenwriter, said Hulu had won \u201cThe Looming Tower\u201d partly because of its guarantee of a speedy development, which appealed to him after his recent dealings with HBO.Mr. Futterman \u2014 who was an executive producer, along with his wife, Anya Epstein, of HBO\u2019s \u201cIn Treatment\u201d \u2014 said he had grown frustrated by the cable network after it tied up projects he had put together with Ms. Epstein, including a stalled adaptation of the Jennifer Egan novel \u201cA Visit from the Goon Squad.\u201d\u201cI developed two projects with HBO with Anya after \u2018In Treatment,\u2019\u201d Mr. Futterman said. \u201cThat was one of among about 200 they were developing.\u201d After noting the promises made by Hulu, he added, \u201cWhat situation would you rather be in?\u201dTo Mr. Daniels, the Emmy-winning actor who plays the F.B.I. agent John O\u2019Neill in \u201cThe Looming Tower,\u201d Hulu is playing in the same league as its chief rivals. \u201cThe money feels the same. The production value feels the same,\u201d Mr. Daniels said. \u201cYou got all the trucks that a big movie does. Somebody\u2019s spending money on this.

The 15-year-old black boy is left there after a white police officer commits a hit-and-run, quickly covered up by his fellow cops. In the distance is the Statue of Liberty, her back turned to the crime scene.The 10 episodes of \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d traverse the blast radius of the death of Brenton Butler, the teenager struck down, and his race changes everything. Episodes shift among the perspectives of the complicit police; the investigators, led by the inexperienced African-American assistant district attorney (Clare-Hope Ashitey) with a drinking problem; and Brenton\u2019s anguished parents (Regina King and Russell Hornsby).\u201cMy interest as a writer has always been with the cost of a life,\u201d Ms. Sud said. \u201cHow do families grieve? How do people move on in the aftermath of death?\u201dMs. Sud tends to lean into the darkness naturally. Her first short story as a child was about a dead pony, told from the perspective of the pony. (The opening line: \u201cI died yesterday.\u201d)Ms. Sud, sitting in a rooftop boardroom overlooking the downtown skyline here, laughed at the recollection. \u201cI was such a dork,\u201d she said.The high-rise had been her home for several weeks as she shot a movie, and she was missing her family and her corgis back home in Los Angeles. Small and almost uncannily youthful, Ms. Sud could, at 50, pass for 30. She was at once warm and deeply serious; a gracious, smiley person with a macabre bent.As a teenager growing up Cincinnati, Ms. Sud tried \u2014 for fun \u2014 to write a screenplay about a friendship between two prostitutes. So she called the police station, resulting in several ride-alongs with a vice cop, and meetings with a madam in a brothel.Ms. Sud\u2019s parents had no idea what their 16-year-old daughter was up to. Her father, a doctor, came to Ohio (via Toronto) from India and her mother, a nurse, was from the Philippines. Ms. Sud describes herself as an odd kid, a brown face in a sea of Midwestern white, and an introvert. To avoid lunchroom trauma, Ms. Sud spent a lot of time alone in the library, reading and writing. At home, she voraciously consumed TV shows like \u201cMASH\u201d and \u201cHill Street Blues.\u201dWhile at Columbia University\u2019s Barnard College, majoring in women\u2019s studies and political science, Ms. Sud audited a film class. She was the only woman in the room and the first screening was Brian De Palma\u2019s \u201cBody Double.\u201d As she watched an abused woman murdered by a man with a giant drill, Ms. Sud\u2019s film career aspirations evaporated. \u201cHaving women subjected to that extreme violence and obvious hate made me feel like I didn\u2019t belong and I should try something else,\u201d she said.She spent a few years working in journalism and as a film distributor at Third World Newsreel, a media center that highlights the work of minorities. Inspired by the filmmakers she promoted (she namechecked Julie Dash and Ada Gay Griffin), Ms. Sud was determined to try film again. Divorced and raising a young son (now 26), she became a film student at New York University, working in the equipment rental department to subsidize a partial scholarship. (She remarried in 2005.) A Master Class with Spike Lee was a turning point, the encouraging antithesis of the De Palma fiasco. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018This is an example of what\u2019s possible for someone like me.\u2019\u201dMs. King (\u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d \u201cSouthland\u201d) was watching Ms. Sud with pride. \u201cYoung girls of color might not even know the idea of showrunner exists,\u201d Ms. King said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful message to be able to say, Veena Sud is the boss.\u201dSeries like \u201cShots Fired\u201d and \u201cAmerican Crime\u201d (which also starred Ms. King) have plumbed the nuances of racially charged murders involving the police, but both were on network TV. Ms. Sud pictured \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d (developed with Fox 21) from the outset as a streaming show, unencumbered by format and profanity restrictions. \u201cIt\u2019s novelistic,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a writer, any sort of forced break for a commercial is deeply unsatisfying.\u201dNetflix had been a partner with AMC on the third season of \u201cThe Killing\u201d and then its home when AMC canceled the series in 2012. Cindy Holland, vice president of original series at Netflix, said the streaming network was eager to keep Ms. Sud in the fold, citing both her storytelling and her efficiency as a producer. And Ms. Holland wasn\u2019t deterred by the show\u2019s political spine or concerns that audiences may not want to spend a weekend bingeing a dramatic take on the divisive issues of race and police violence.\u201cWe don\u2019t shy away,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re wanting to reflect the times in which we live, and we\u2019d expect nothing less from Veena than a complicated, sometimes hard-to-tell story.\u201dShe was so impressed with Ms. Sud\u2019s writing, and her first-in, last-out work ethic, that she eventually gave her the show to run for two seasons. \u201cShe was always pitching pedophilia and baby killing stories, which weren\u2019t exactly CBS\u2019s brand but we got a few through,\u201d Ms. Stiehm said.Asked about the origins of this lifelong appetite for the grisly side, Ms. Sud is circumspect. \u201cWell, this is kind of a lame answer, but both my parents lived through wars,\u201d she said. Her father was jailed in India when he was a child, and during World War II, her mother and her family were taken prisoner by the Japanese in the Philippines. \u201cMy mom was tortured as a baby,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had dreams all her life of running from soldiers. I grew up hearing horror stories. Maybe I heard too much.\u201d\u201cI was surprised and saddened by it,\u201d she said of the vituperative reaction, particularly on social media. \u201cSaying \u2018I\u2019m not going to apologize for the choices I\u2019ve made\u2019 created such a furor over my uppityness, it was almost like I was being taught a lesson,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think male showrunners\u2019 audiences are encouraged to \u2018Take out the pitchforks!\u2019 and chase them down.\u201dShe has no regrets about how the season ended, and in fact, appears to be doubling down with \u201cSeven Seconds,\u201d an unabashedly controversial undertaking that will elicit no apology from Ms. Sud.While living there during film school, Ms. Sud often marveled at the Statue of Liberty\u2019s posture, facing only the residents of New York. \u201cThe American dream was being extended to the immigrants of Europe but not to the black and brown citizens, many immigrants themselves, of this city, this country,\u201d she said.\u201cI felt desperate to tell this story,\u201d Ms. Sud said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time to hear people of color and women telling stories that speak to our experience, or close to our experience. We know these stories. The truth of them is ours to tell.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury while in police custody.

While he was unquestionably powerful in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein was not a household name in Canada until last fall. Why has his downfall set off debate and action in Canada and elsewhere outside of the United States?A. I actually think it was less about Weinstein and more about the women who chose to speak out. This was one of the few, perhaps only, cases in recent history where the victims were vastly more famous than the abuser \u2014 and I think that was one of the many factors that contributed to the explosion. Social media played a part in the ripple effect, continuing to spread the message and to shift the conversation away from those famous women to the rest of us. And the rest of us are key to this. The #MeToo movement has sustained because sexual assault and harassment is a universal experience.While debating sexual harassment legislation in Parliament this week, some of the legislators expressed concern that the #MeToo movement might flame out as rapidly as it rose up. What will it take to affect sustained changes?I think we\u2019ve already seen that that\u2019s not the case. As journalists, we so often wait for when reader fatigue sets in, when our audience tires of a particular story line or the next scoop comes along. That truly hasn\u2019t happened in this case. The stories keep coming, the complicity continues to be uncovered, and the major shift I\u2019ve seen is the focus from pure accusations to what\u2019s next. In what ways has policy not kept up with the times? If we know that most sexual harassment training doesn\u2019t work \u2014 which we do \u2014 how will institutions work to eradicate the behavior? I don\u2019t think this conversation is going away, but I do think it will shift from problem to solution.Are Americans paying any attention to the debates in Canada and elsewhere in the world?I think that social media has helped keep the conversation global. In France it was #BalanceTonPorc, in Spain and Latin America #YoTambien, in Italy #QuellaVoltaChe, in Israel #\u05d2\u05dd\u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u2014#MeToo has stretched from Canada to China.Within that context the On The Market feature of our Real Estate section headed out to take a look at two condos in Toronto.Below are a couple of highlights.From Tom Roach, Waterloo, Ontario:\u201cThe real issue is not Nafta. Our politicians and pundits have been explaining for years that the old manufacturing jobs are gone for good: Canada needs to look in other directions if it is to grow.\u201dFrom Dale Coles, Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia:\u201cI will always buy Canadian first whenever possible.

But the series\u2019 revival finds a new one while visiting Cory, a NASCAR-loving Georgia police officer: a Make America Great Again cap.Karamo Brown, the show\u2019s culture expert, playfully puts the hat on as Bobby Berk, the interior designer, watches slack-jawed. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to make America great again,\u201d Cory says.The scene captures how the new \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d now on Netflix, deals with the baggage America has accumulated in its closets since 2003. It doesn\u2019t look away from the new culture clashes. But for the most part, it wears them lightly.Fifteen years later, marriage equality is the law of the land. And on the surface, uninterrupted forward progress is the premise of the new \u201cQueer Eye.\u201d\u201cThe original show was about fighting for tolerance,\u201d Tan France, the fashion expert, says in the premiere. \u201cOur fight is for acceptance.\u201dSo this new \u201cQueer Eye\u201d is interesting both for what has changed and what hasn\u2019t \u2014 in the show and among viewers.But this time, the five pile into a mammoth pickup truck and head for Atlanta and environs. Coastal culture meets MAGA America from the first case: Tom, a shaggy-bearded, sweet-hearted divorced man looking for love and partial to \u201credneck margaritas\u201d (tequila and Mountain Dew).There\u2019s more to the 2018 version than gay-straight dynamics (hence, no \u201cfor the Straight Guy\u201d in the title). One touching episode involves a gay man, preparing to come out to his family, who has always dressed to avoid \u201clooking gay\u201d \u2014 a recognition that there is more than one way (or five) to live one\u2019s sexuality.The most provocative, if unsteady, episode involves Cory, the policeman with the MAGA hat. It opens with the five getting pulled over in their truck \u2014 by, it turns out, Cory\u2019s friend and fellow officer, who nominated him for the makeover.Mr. Brown, who is driving, is black. He does not find it a hilarious joke to be pulled over by a seemingly hostile white officer. (Production was in on the disturbing prank; the hosts were not.) But he later has a heart-to-heart with Cory, who doesn\u2019t like being \u201clumped in\u201d with over-aggressive cops and sympathizes with Black Lives Matter. \u201cIf we could sit down and have a conversation like me and you just did,\u201d Cory says, \u201cthings would be a lot better in society.\u201dMaybe. It feels good to think so for 45 minutes, anyway. If the original \u201cQueer Eye\u201d was about easing conservative America\u2019s discomfort, this one is often about liberal America\u2019s unease with what conservative identity politics has awakened.Some moments here \u2014 the guys walking into an American Legion hall, say \u2014 have a tinge of post-2016 dread. Are we all cool with each other? What do people feel permission to say now? How many of these folks interpreted the slogan as \u201cMake America Straight Again\u201d?Here, the encounters always turn out sweet. That\u2019s the show\u2019s mission; this isn\u2019t documentary. The insights are sometimes pat, and the emotional-transformation arcs can feel forced. (A shy client, for instance, gets boxing lessons as a metaphor for \u201cgetting in the ring.\u201d)But \u201cQueer Eye\u201d has changed its sensibility just enough to fit an America that has become both more officially tolerant and more tribal, with less sense of neutral ground.When I first heard about this remake, it sounded superfluous, 15 years and a zillion makeover shows later. But there\u2019s something cathartic about its Purple America spirit, contrived and reductive as it can be. Yes, country guys can have fantastic senses of flair and color! Gay guys can have fun driving a huge whomping pickup truck!It\u2019s a formula, but damned if it doesn\u2019t do the job and generate the tears, most of them happy.Advertisement"}

Toto, what happened to Kansas?Raf Simons buried it under 50,000 gallons of popcorn.64 PhotosThen a model in a bright orange hazmat suit and waders appeared. Let\u2019s rephrase: Welcome to the pop-calypse.Also the two-tone cowboy shirts and placket trousers that Mr. Simons has used in every collection since his Calvin debut, and skinny striped sweaters and sweaters with Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner knit in, plus apron dresses with nothing underneath, so the breasts were exposed (a strange segue into Naughty Nellie from the general store). Quilting squares were pieced onto crisp white shirts and reworked as bias-cut chiffon evening gowns. The effect was all very survivalist.

The kind of fashion that has been largely missing from the runways this week.Instead it has seemed like most designers were strolling around, heads turned to the sky, la-la-la-ing and minding their own business (in every sense of that phrase) rather than pushing themselves to confront the cultural mutation occurring around them. Maybe it takes an outsider\u2019s perspective, or gumption. It\u2019s risky to pontificate on national identity.Fashion often likes to talk about how it offers an escape from everyday ugliness, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with beauty for beauty\u2019s sake.

Mod tartans mixed it up with bejeweled 1950s starlet sheaths; leopard furs with striped coed sweaters; flirty slip dresses with swaddling puffer stoles; camo leathers with sunflower gowns, all with matching medley footwear (pumps and winkle-pickers and boot stompers and kitten heels).There was something for everyone \u2014 even a KO sweatshirt (get it)? \u2014 but in a time of turmoil, such style schmaltz can seem a little empty. Confrontation often isn\u2019t pretty, but it gets you somewhere.63 PhotosThough instead of wading through snack food, Mr. Vevers\u2019 models had to wend their way through a forest of denuded trees, like something out of the Brothers Grimm or \u201cThe Blair Witch Project.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s why the bags and knapsacks they all carried were cavernous enough to fit a large part of their worldly goods inside.(For what it\u2019s worth, big bags are a trend this season. They were everywhere, including at Monse, which had a top-handled carnie-striped version that also can be folded and squished under the arm.

In that time, streaming rivals like Netflix, Hulu and Apple have continued to gobble up television projects.Amazon has made the occasional splash at the Golden Globes and the Emmys with shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d but it has failed to gain the same kind of standing that Netflix and even Hulu have within Hollywood\u2019s creative community.It will be up to Ms. Salke, 53, to essentially hit the reset button.\u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeff Blackburn, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for business development and entertainment, said in a statement.A Fox executive, Dana Walden, and an A&E executive, Nancy Dubuc, had discussed the position with Amazon before each dropped out of talks.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited about the future at Amazon Studios,\u201d Ms. Salke said in a statement. \u201cIn the studio\u2019s relatively short existence they have innovated, disrupted and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop culture. I am both honored and emboldened by the opportunity to lead this extraordinary business.\u201dFor the last seven years, Ms. Salke has been second in command at NBC, where she and Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, engineered an impressive turnaround.Mr. Greenblatt, who joined NBC in 2010, and Ms. Salke, who came on board as president from Fox in 2011, found a network in deep trouble and well past its \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u201cER\u201d and \u201cFriends\u201d heyday.But now, propelled by \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and shows like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d NBC is poised to win the 18-to-49-year-old demographic among the four broadcast networks for a second consecutive season.Ms. Salke was one of the biggest champions of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d an emotional family drama whose popularity has surprised many industry veterans \u2014 as has its ability to sustain that success in its second season. On Sunday, NBC gave \u201cThis Is Us\u201d the post-Super Bowl slot, where it garnered an impressive audience of 27 million viewers.Ms. Salke has also helped deploy a strategy that brought NBC\u2019s comedy lineup back to life. After the lineup collapsed when \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d went off the air, she said the network would develop comedies that weren\u2019t meant to appeal to everybody. NBC has since found traction with offbeat comedies like \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and \u201cSuperstore.\u201d\u201cJennifer Salke is a world-class entertainment executive and deserves enormous credit for helping put NBC back on top,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said in a statement.But whether her success at helping turn around a broadcast network \u2014 which also relies on a healthy diet of Dick Wolf dramas \u2014 will translate to a streaming service is an open question.Amazon has been viewed in Hollywood as something of a sleeping giant, one of the few companies that could match Netflix financially if it deployed its cash properly. Netflix is poised to spend $8 billion on content this year.But Amazon has had several expensive missteps. \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s unfinished novel, debuted to little fanfare and was canceled. Likewise, several comedies, including \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson\u201d and \u201cI Love Dick,\u201d have been canceled in the last month.At the same time, Hulu has found real momentum. It is introducing several shows this year, including \u201cThe Looming Tower,\u201d a mini-series based on Lawrence Wright\u2019s book about the lead-up to the Sept. 11 attacks, this month and the second season of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d in April.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On TV, France\u2019s New President Is Young, Centrist and Female", "Date": "2018-02-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 \u201cI am not afraid of being a progressive. I am not afraid of being a republican. I am not afraid of you,\u201d a 39-year-old centrist presidential candidate told a far-right rival on French television recently.But it wasn\u2019t Emmanuel Macron, the former banker, now 40, whose rapid rise and eventual victory in the 2017 election shook the French political world. It was Mr. Macron\u2019s fictional alter ego, Am\u00e9lie Dorendeu, in the hit series \u201cBaron Noir.\u201dAs the gritty political drama ends its second season on the French TV network Canal+ this week, its similarities with recent political developments in France have many politicians and politics junkies marveling at its realism and the way it sheds light on the unexpected current state of French politics.The first season was centered around Rickwaert\u2019s fall and desire for revenge, with the skulduggery of local Dunkirk politics in the background. But the second brings viewers inside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace with the election of Am\u00e9lie Dorendeu (Anna Mouglalis), a center-left politician and ally of Rickwaert, whose political ideas are reminiscent of Mr. Macron\u2019s.\u201cLike everybody else, we didn\u2019t see Macron coming,\u201d said Eric Benzekri, one of the show\u2019s two screenwriters. \u201cWhat we saw is the political space which Macron had, and we gave our president, Am\u00e9lie Dorendeu, the same space in the series.\u201dMr. Benzekri said he drew some inspiration from his own political experience: Until 2008, he was involved with the Socialist Party, from which the show\u2019s main characters emerge.Although isolated in the second season, Rickwaert remains influential as he tries to adapt to the new political deal. \u201cPolitics is like jazz,\u201d he tells Dorendeu. \u201cWhen you hit a wrong note, you have to persist with it, and then it becomes a cult improvisation, which everyone will try to hit.\u201dIn 2016, the acclaimed graphic novel \u201cThe President\u201d pictured the far-right Marine Le Pen at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace; another, \u201cQuai d\u2019Orsay,\u201d depicted with humor the life of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.But previous attempts to depict French politics realistically on TV fell short. \u201cWe have been late on French television in representing tormented, ambivalent characters in politics,\u201d said Jean-Baptiste Delafon, one of \u201cBaron Noir\u2019s\u201d screenwriters. \u201cWe either had filthy, nasty villains, or nice politicians with beautiful ideas.\u201dNetflix\u2019s first French-language production, \u201cMarseille\u201d (2016), which attempted to create a French version of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d was a critical flop.The appeal of \u201cBaron Noir\u201d lies in its well-balanced mix of local and national politics, according to Marjolaine Boutet, an associate professor of contemporary history at the University of Picardie Jules Verne, who specializes in television, and who compared the show with two well-known American political dramas. \u201cIt\u2019s not as idealistic as \u2018The West Wing,\u2019 and it\u2019s not as cynical as \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s right in the middle.\u201dAlthough France\u2019s recent political history has featured corruption allegations against former prime ministers and even against the former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac, the most recent presidential campaign brought an unpredictable twist, leading the fiction of \u201cBaron Noir\u201d to compete with real events.In \u201cBaron Noir,\u201d Philippe Rickwaert ends up in prison at the end of the first season, and the president has to resign because of the same scandal. \u201cIt shows that whatever you try to hide, there are consequences, because we live in a democracy that has rule of law,\u201d Mr. Benzekri said about the path he and Mr. Delafon gave the characters.Although corruption was one of the main themes of \u201cBaron Noir\u2019s\u201d first season, the screenwriters chose to avoid it in the latest one. \u201cWhatever we would have imagined, it would have never been as crazy as Fillon and his suits,\u201d Mr. Benzekri said.The show has demonstrated some imagination by making the president a woman. France has never had a female head of state.\u201cAm\u00e9lie Dorendeu is a woman, but she is first and foremost the president, so we treated her as a president, and not as a female president,\u201d said Mr. Benzekri, adding that by not treating gender as a key factor, he and Mr. Delafon were betting on \u201cpost-sexism.\u201d\u201cAs soon as things exist in fiction,\u201d Ms. Mouglalis added, \u201csociety is more ready to accept them in reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spotify Is Getting Paid to Save the Music Industry: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify files to go public.\u2022 Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles.\u2022 The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one?\u2022 What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?\u2022 The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope.\u2022 And is Jared Kushner\u2019s weakness his family business?Perhaps more than any other streaming service, Spotify has revived the fortunes of recording artists. It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday.The numbers are included in Spotify\u2019s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing\u2019s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, \u201cconsists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.\u201dThe filing says Spotify had \u20ac3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was \u20ac2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. \u201cThis decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,\u201d the filing said.But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that.\u2014 Peter EavisAccounting nerds delving into Spotify\u2019s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy.Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of \u20ac324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled \u20ac179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda?It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung \u20ac439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year.\u2014 Peter EavisDirect listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market.Spotify won\u2019t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days.Here\u2019s a look at the details:Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang.Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify\u2019s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public.In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby.Dick\u2019s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT:\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201dOver five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero.Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest.\u2022 Mr. Ackman\u2019s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet.How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high.Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIs it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no.BackgroundSnap\u2019s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock.The criticism has also overshadowed Snap\u2019s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent.BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock\u2019s annual report:As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as \u201ccommon ownership\u201d. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.The filing goes on to say:If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock\u2019s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years.What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy.To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes.Is it working? Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year.Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony.\u2014 Peter EavisSky is both a telecom operator \u2014 selling TV, internet and phone services \u2014 and a media company with its own original news, sports and entertainment programming.

{"Headline": "Wall Street Halts a Global Rout", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter days of sometimes wild moves in stock markets, Wall Street had a good day on Tuesday. Investors refocused on the continuing strength of the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher.A panicky global market sell-off \u2014 begun Monday when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 \u2014 dissipated on Tuesday, and the S.&P. 500 ended the session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles.The decline in stock markets on Monday was steep, but not the worst one-day percentage drop in the S.&P. 500. In the history of the index, 38 one-day drops were worse.For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk ever higher, as measures of volatility \u2014 the ups and downs of stock prices \u2014 hit remarkably calm levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop of lackluster growth and inflation, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.But that peaceful climb ended in recent days. Investors have become worried that the solid economy in the United States could be showing early signals of inflationary pressure and that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than previously expected. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data \u2014 such as the Labor Department\u2019s jobs report on Friday \u2014 showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.But Tuesday\u2019s results put a brake to the slide, at least for now.The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said it was possible that algorithmic trading programs were partly responsible for recent volatility in the stock market. \u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role \u2014 as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said Tuesday, adding that market participants are acting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems.In a sign of investor confidence, yields on the 10-year Treasury note rose on Tuesday. Spooked investors had bought supersafe government bonds in recent days after being startled by the market sell-off, bringing yields lower. So, the rise in yields suggests investors are regaining their nerve.Jack Ewing, Alexandra Stevenson and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018One Day at a Time\u2019: Gloria Calderon Kellett on Crafting Latino Stories in a Changed America", "Date": "2018-02-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsk a ShowrunnerAfter an impressive debut season, Netflix\u2019s remake of the 1970s and \u201980s multicamera sitcom \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d returned for a second season \u2014 and with it, more jokes about the joys and struggles of life as a modern Cuban-American family.Rather than focus on one main through line, as the first season did, Season 2 spends more time getting close to its individual characters, all of whom are given a chance to face their problems. Penelope (Justina Machado) struggles to cope with her mental health and re-enter the dating world; her daughter, Elena (Isabella Gomez), has trouble finding her romantic footing as well. Alex (Marcel Ruiz) maintains his post as his abuela\u2019s favorite grandchild, but even he\u2019s not safe from anti-Latino discrimination. And despite having rejected the advances of Dr. Berkowitz (Stephen Tobolowsky), Lydia (Rita Moreno) comes down with a case of unbridled jealousy after learning he\u2019s been taking another woman to the opera.Led by the series\u2019s two showrunners, Gloria Calder\u00f3n Kellett and Mike Royce, the writing team has created a compelling family sitcom that\u2019s in equal measures thoughtful, serious and funny. In a recent phone conversation, Ms. Kellett, who is herself Cuban-American, talked about the stunning Season 2 finale, as well as some of the political challenges facing Latinos today and what\u2019s ahead for the Alvarez family in Season 3. Following are edited excerpts from the spoiler-filled interview.After all the attention \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d got for its first season, what was it like to come back for Season 2?Oh, it was so nice. I love my cast, and I love my writers. We have such a great room. We just missed each other, so we just sat down and talked about where we were at in our lives. How that manifested into stories. Mike [Mike Royce] and I like to meet in between and get a sense of what we would like our season arc to be. We then get to talk to them [the writers] about \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking,\u201d and we\u2019ll give them a rough skeleton of where we want to go. It was really nice to sit down and brainstorm about what\u2019s going on in this world and how that would affect this family.So you sketch out what\u2019s next for Season 2, then what happens?Going into Season 2, we knew we wanted to end with Lydia having the stroke and that the final episode would be an homage to the \u201cMaud\u201d episode that he and I both love. It\u2019s where everyone gets to do a monologue. So along the way, we knew we wanted to build in some of the stroke stuff. We knew we wanted to have Penelope in a relationship and for it to amicably \u2014 over something like having children \u2014 end. That just felt like something a lot of women I know who are nearing 40 are experiencing.Same with Elena. We knew we wanted her to have a girlfriend and to start this positive relationship with her. We knew we wanted to make a baby step with Victor [Penelope\u2019s ex-husband and the children\u2019s father, played by James Martinez]. It\u2019s not a complete resolution, but something that seemed hopeful. We came in with those things, sat with the writers, and they tell us what\u2019s going on in their lives and what\u2019s been important. We find a middle ground and break the stories, and that\u2019s that.The country\u2019s politics have changed since the premiere of Season 1. How did you decide to incorporate that into the show \u2014 like the episode when Alex gets called an ethnic slur?That was based on a real incident. That happened to my brother at a beach in San Diego. We\u2019ve lived in San Diego for 20 years. He called me up post-Trump, \u201cI was just at the beach, and someone told me to go back to Mexico!\u201d He was laughing about it because he doesn\u2019t care. But it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d We try on the show to show many points of view. Obviously, the show has a liberal bent, but we try to show all sides of an issue so all sides of the conversation can start. This is something we thought would affect this family, so how would they talk about it? What would that look like?Do you worry whether any of the characters might become unrelatable as you\u2019re preparing for the next season?I don\u2019t think so. It all starts from a real place. The Lydia stuff that\u2019s the most outrageous is stuff that\u2019s actually happened in my real life. My mom had a stroke and didn\u2019t tell me for 12 years! That\u2019s real! I was just talking with her and she said, \u201cAye, when I had a stroke \u2026 \u201d \u201cWait, what stroke?\u201d \u201cAh, your wedding was happening, I didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d \u201cOye, mom, you better tell somebody!\u201d All that is real. It seems dramatic, but in a wonderful way in the arms of Rita Moreno, it has that diva turn.Well, that\u2019s just my experience. Really, my house is not a sad place ever. We feel so blessed, we feel so grateful. We have a really good time. In the media, Latino families are always in crisis \u2014 there\u2019s gang violence, people weeping. That\u2019s just not what I know it to be. I wanted to reflect my experience, too, and to throw that in the ring. It seems a lot of people relate to that, too.Last season, you addressed immigration with Elena\u2019s friend Carmen and her parents\u2019 deportation. This time, you have Lydia and Schneider (Todd Grinnell) going through the citizenship process. Was that something you wanted to keep exploring?In my family, not all of the Cubans became citizens. My parents became citizens, but I have aunts and uncles who did not. When you become a U.S. citizen, you have to renounce your Cuban citizenship. They\u2019re green card holders \u2014 they pay taxes, social security and they can\u2019t vote. When Trump started deporting people, my cousins got really concerned. \u201cShould we have mom become a citizen?\u201d There was all this worry. What if Lydia had never become a citizen? Then it would be fun to have her and Schneider go on that journey together.Another story line you kept exploring this season was Penelope\u2019s depression, and how she\u2019s still struggling with the social stigma and the need to rely on antidepressants to help her.We really wanted to get that right. It also seemed like something veterans really struggle with; Latinos have a lot of issues with discussing it or going on medications. We wanted to explore what that was like for this character. Also, she\u2019s at a great point in her life, so it\u2019s that placebo of \u201cEverything is going great, and I don\u2019t need to do any of this stuff anymore.\u201d Then, we saw what the reality of that looked like for her. She couldn\u2019t talk to her mom about it, and she couldn\u2019t talk to her boyfriend about it because she was embarrassed. It was also a way to deepen her relationship with Schneider because he was the only person she could talk to about it.Is there a story you\u2019re looking forward to continuing in Season 3?Well, we have a few things built in already. Penelope is in school, so she still will be in school, or maybe graduate. We get to see her journey to being a nurse practitioner. Seeing what else is out there for her dating life as well. Deepening Elena\u2019s relationship. Maybe Alex will get to have a little love in his life. And of course, we\u2019ll be taking into consideration what's happening in the next month or two months from now. The news is crazy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Do You Think Technology Affects Dating?", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStudent OpinionHave you had any experience with dating? Have you ever used dating apps? If so, what has it been like for you? If not, why not?It may not be on any syllabus, but college has always been a time for young people to learn about relationships and sex. But as the internet increasingly influences the ways we interact, it also transforms how students date and find partners. We asked students at nine colleges and universities how technology affects the campus dating scene.In \u201cNo One Wants to Be Known as Tinder Girl,\u201d Madeline Apple from the University of Michigan, Class of 2018, shares this experience:Dating apps may have killed the college dating scene. Because it\u2019s so easy to swipe left or right on a seemingly endless pile of potential partners, it\u2019s become harder to actually meet anyone. As students, we are told over and over that college is a time for us to expand our social groups, to meet new people and grow into adults. But the indecisiveness that is built into dating app culture can stunt us \u2014 we\u2019re trapped in an endless cycle of swipes! Commitment, already a scary concept to many, becomes even more difficult with the false illusion that the dating possibilities are endless.Frankly, dating apps can also just make things incredibly awkward. My freshman year I swiped through hundreds of people. At one of the last tailgates of the year, a random man walked by me and yelled: \u201cHey! We matched on Tinder! You are Tinder girl!\u201dIn \u201cI Found My First Date on an App,\u201d Caleb Keyes from Otterbein University, Class of 2018, writes:In high school I had always wanted to date but struggled to believe anyone would want to date me. When I got to college those fears were compounded by a feeling of trepidation that if I tried to date someone and we broke up, it would be hard to see them around campus. A friend encouraged me to download Coffee Meets Bagel, which was described as a dating app for people who are easily overwhelmed.I got a date and she suggested we get ice cream, even though it was snowing outside. It was old-school romantic in a way I hadn\u2019t expected. She looked beautiful with snowflakes falling on her hair and her cheeks red from the cold.Though college is often depicted as a place of sexual exploration, and dating apps seem to encourage passing from one relationship to another, my generation defies that. A study in the journal Child Development found that 18-year-olds today are less likely to have dated than 15-year-olds in the 1990s. The good news is, even if we\u2019re dating later, it\u2019s no less magical to stand in the snow with someone you like, as the world seems to stop.\u2014 What have your experiences \u2014 or those of your friends and peers \u2014 with technology and dating been like?\u2014 How do you think technology \u2014 like apps, Netflix, social media and texting \u2014 affects dating and relationships? In your opinion, does it improve or worsen romantic interactions? How so?\u2014 What lessons have you learned from dating? Is there any advice you can take from these college students\u2019 stories?\u2014 If you could date in a different time period, would you? If so, what era would it be and why? If not, why not?Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

{"Headline": "Did You Watch \u2018Black Panther\u2019? Let\u2019s Talk Spoilers", "Date": "2018-02-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor those of you war dogs who\u2019ve mastered your Warrior Falls dance, let\u2019s talk about the movie\u2019s most memorable moments and burning questions. Have thoughts? Share them in the comments section.The world building starts at the very beginning \u2014 with that dazzling animated sequence that illustrates the history of Wakanda and its five tribes \u2014 and continues through visually arresting set pieces like the ones at Warrior Falls and the ancestral plane. The New York of the Avengers movies is about as exciting as a strip mall by comparison.Now that the director Ryan Coogler and the production designer Hannah Beachler have put an afrofuturist paradise on Marvel\u2019s chessboard, the question is what will the company do with it? Will it become, as some on social media have suggested, the black \u201cStar Wars,\u201d with spinoff movies and TV shows that further explore the movie\u2019s mythology and cast of characters?T\u2019Challa\u2019s little sister Shuri \u2014 an irreverent tech prodigy who\u2019s part Q from the James Bond movies and part Penny from \u201cInspector Gadget\u201d \u2014 arguably steals the movie. It should be a star-making performance for Letitia Wright (she previously appeared in the most recent season of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d in the episode \u201cBlack Museum\u201d). In the comics, Shuri eventually succeeds T\u2019Challa as Black Panther. Might she get her own spinoff movie? Or a teen-oriented cartoon show? At the very least, expect her to play a prominent role in the inevitable sequel.It\u2019s not just the portrayal of the African diaspora in \u201cBlack Panther\u201d that pushes boundaries, it\u2019s that of the women. This is the rare superhero movie that doesn\u2019t treat the female characters like ornaments or seasoning and even passes the Bechdel test.What did you make of Okoye (Danai Gurira of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) and her all-female fighting squad? Okoye\u2019s wig-throwing and car-surfing-in-a-red-dress scenes in South Korea were among the film\u2019s most indelible. But was her romance with W\u2019Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) believable? Was it necessary?M\u2019Baku, the chief of the renegade mountain tribe, starts out as a third-tier villain in the movie but ends up being unexpectedly heroic and pivotal to the plot. If not for him, T\u2019Challa would have been belly up in a river somewhere while Killmonger waged World War III from the Wakandan throne.The 31-year-old actor who plays M\u2019Baku, the Tobagonian-born, American-raised Winston Duke, is a relative unknown (he\u2019s had supporting roles on the TV shows \u201cPerson of Interest\u201d and \u201cModern Family\u201d) but infuses the role with gravitas, wry charm and incendiary wit. If there\u2019s any justice in the world, he\u2019ll be starring in a rom-com next year.A character that several critics have called the most compelling Marvel villain to date, Erik Killmonger is a unique and thoroughly American revolutionary. His bloodthirsty vision (of sweet revenge for centuries of oppression visited upon African-descended peoples around the world) is provocative because, viewed from the right angle, it offers a convincing approximation of justice.Was his primary critique of Wakanda \u2014 that it has selfishly shirked its responsibilities to other African nations and the diaspora \u2014 ultimately correct? Or was T\u2019Challa right that isolation to the point of invisibility was the only way to ensure that Wakanda never met the fate of its subjugated sister nations? Killmonger\u2019s final line \u2014 \u201cBury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from ships, because they knew death was better than bondage\u201d \u2014 is among the film\u2019s most trenchant, and one of the hardest to believe actually exists in a Marvel movie.In a film almost entirely populated by black faces, the two main white characters \u2014 one a marauding thief (Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue), the other an intermittently useful ally (Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross) \u2014 are a study in contrasts. Ross, the butt of several jokes in the movie (Shuri taunts him as a \u201ccolonizer\u201d), exists as a kind of corrective to the \u201cwhite savior\u201d characters that are standard in earlier Western films about Africans. What did you think of the character and how did your theater react to the jokes at his expense?In the first of two post-credit sequences, T\u2019Challa addresses the United Nations with a speech that includes this line: \u201cThe wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.\u201d Is that a pointed reference to the proposed border wall? Or just an apropos aphorism for Wakanda\u2019s climactic embrace of internationalist foreign policy?Let us hear your Wakandan war cries about all the things we called out above (and anything we did not) in the comments section.videoAdvertisement"}

Mr. Durant and his business partner, Rich Kleiman, started an entertainment company, Thirty Five Media, in April. Last month, YouTube tapped them to develop sports programming, including the creation of channels focused on athletes like Karl-Anthony Towns, an N.B.A. All-Star with the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.N.B.A. players as Hollywood hotshots? It\u2019s not a far-fetched notion at a time when one of the world\u2019s biggest movie stars, Dwayne Johnson, is a former pro wrestler.\u201cCelebrity and name recognition is currency in Hollywood,\u201d said Todd Boyd, a cinema and media studies professor at the University of Southern California. Mr. Boyd, whose work focuses on race and popular culture, added that the entertainment business was under pressure to diversify its ranks and the stories it put on screen.\u201cThe question is where this goes in the long term,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201cHow long will the content boom last? Will diversity continue to matter?\u201dAnd success on the court in no way ensures success on screens, Mr. Boyd noted.\u201cAs the number of platforms and distribution channels grows \u2014 social media, Amazon, Netflix \u2014 there is a big need for unique content and quality storytelling that can cut through the noise,\u201d said Mr. Carter, who serves as SpringHill\u2019s chief executive and has known Mr. James since boyhood. \u201cWe saw an opportunity to tell stories about people who look like us and think like us.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s working on a bunch of novels \u2014 fiction, but rooted in sport \u2014 and will be building shows and films from there, original from his own head,\u201d said Molly Carter, Granity\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cThis is better than any All-Star Game I was ever in,\u201d he said after posing with Allison Janney, an Oscar acting nominee for the ice-skating biopic \u201cI, Tonya.\u201dHollywood has a long history of casting athletes, who come with built-in fan bases and often exude a natural magnetism on screen. Johnny Weissmuller, an Olympic swimmer, starred in a dozen \u201cTarzan\u201d movies starting in the 1930s.Among basketball players, Michael Jordan appeared as himself in the original \u201cSpace Jam,\u201d which took in $337 million worldwide in 1996, after adjusting for inflation. Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson have tried acting, producing and hosting over the years, to mixed results.\u201cLeBron has done such a great job so far,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, wow, this can actually be done.\u201dMr. Kleiman, who is also Mr. Durant\u2019s manager, added that a generation of athletes had also watched music stars build business empires. \u201cKevin paid attention to the Jay Zs and the Puffys that came up ahead of him and provided a blueprint,\u201d Mr. Kleiman said.Thirty Five Media also aims to increase revenue on the channel with a twist on the endorsement deal.\u201cYou may not get Kevin Durant the spokesman \u2014 he can only personally represent so many brands authentically \u2014 but you can get branded content,\u201d Mr. Kleiman said.\u201cHe started telling me the very interesting story about his early days playing basketball and how his mom kept a really good eye on him,\u201d Mr. Grazer said. \u201cAnd that got us talking about another way to do \u2018Friday Night Lights,\u2019 which was a series and movie about a boy\u2019s identity and how things that seem imperceptible can be so seismic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Transgressive Appeal of the Comedy Murder Podcast", "Date": "2018-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAt first blush, this approach to covering murder can seem a little tactless. I mean: People died! But especially for women, humor has emerged as an easy coping mechanism for relentlessly being told by pop culture that they\u2019re probably going to be raped and murdered by a stranger, as ludicrous as that is.\u201cMartinis & Murder\u201d is just one of a new crop of comedy podcasts, largely by and for women, that bite back at the gendered nature of the true crime genre even as they indulge and obsess.Seen through that lens, it makes sense that the hosts of these shows often operate at a remove, filtering serious crimes through a veil of irony. True crime operates on a plane of feminine stereotype more than it does reality. These podcasts cut through that kind of craven calculation and inject levity instead. The tagline of \u201cMy Favorite Murder,\u201d for example, is \u201cStay sexy and don\u2019t get murdered.\u201dThough murder-themed, these podcasts feature lengthy digressions into personal anecdotes and strange and insignificant details of the crimes. (What\u2019s a jitney? What was your high school superlative? Remember pagers?) \u201cMy Favorite Murder\u201d episodes have been getting longer over the series\u2019 run; they now regularly stretch to an hour and a half. That itself functions as a kind of sly commentary \u2014 that these sensationalized crimes aren\u2019t actually as important as the relatively mundane everyday concerns of the women on the shows.Along the way, these podcasts have hit upon a smart business model: Instead of putting great resources into reporting out an under-covered case, \u00e0 la \u201cSerial,\u201d they churn through the seemingly endless stream of existing true crime tales, rehashing old cases with the help of Wikipedia pages, Netflix documentaries, local papers, other podcasts and of course, Oxygen specials. Accuracy is not exactly these podcasts\u2019 strong suit, but mistakes and inconsistencies are just more material for jokes. On a recent \u201cMy Favorite Murder,\u201d Ms. Kilgariff ridiculed Ms. Hardstark for using the term \u201cupper legs\u201d when describing a body part stuffed into a suitcase:Casually covering the ghastly flips the script. Instead of playing victims, the podcasters are taking control of the media narrative. Their project feels loosely related to the phenomenon of web sleuthing, except instead of trying to actually crack a case, they\u2019re processing the crime\u2019s impact on society and themselves.They delight in pretending that they\u2019re a little bit bad, too. The running joke of the Zodiac episode of \u201cMartinis & Murder\u201d involves the hosts\u2019 accusing each other of responsibility for the never-solved crimes. The women of \u201cMy Favorite Murder\u201d draw out the word \u201cmurderrrrrrr\u201d into an almost seductive drawl. As a host of \u201cWine & Crime\u201d put it on a recent episode devoted to female perpetrators, \u201cThere are some truly monstrous women out there, too, y\u2019all, and you\u2019re listening to three of them.\u201dMany podcasters have discovered that drinking enhances the experience. In each episode, the \u201cMartinis & Murder\u201d hosts consume a custom cocktail prepared by their producer and mixologist, Matt the Bartender, to fit each particular crime: a hibiscus-infused vodka drink nods to the Arizona setting of the Jodi Arias murder; a drink called Satan\u2019s Whiskers is chosen for an occult-related crime. But for the wider murder comedy podcasting community, the typical beverage of choice is wine, which is fitting: Alongside true crime obsession, wine consumption is a longstanding pop-culture-approved form of feminine indulgence, most recently reinforced on shows like \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201dIn any case, the alcohol helps loosen the hosts\u2019 inhibitions, and it gives them some cover for speaking out of turn, too. The injection of alcohol transports the podcast to a kind of alternate-reality space where the rules of feminine propriety are suspended \u2014 and where murder is something to laugh off, not seriously fear.A previous version of this article referred imprecisely to how long episodes of \u201cMy Favorite Murder\u201d run. They regularly stretch to an hour and a half, not two and a half hours.Advertisement"}

Last week, NBC pulled ahead of CBS in total viewers through the first 20 weeks of the 2017-18 season, the first time it has had the lead since 2002.Mr. Greenblatt has another reason for optimism: He is holding onto a trove of in-house statistics he believes are the key to proving to advertisers that broadcasters can make the transition to the streaming universe.Nielsen ratings, which measure the number of viewers who tune in for shows at the time of their broadcasts, are down for the networks yet again \u2014 10 percent this season. NBC has responded by learning to make money from viewers who stream its programs \u2014 and now it is learning how to put a number on it. The key is gathering statistics from services like NBC.com, the NBC app, video on demand and Hulu to determine how much money its shows are pulling in from streamers.Take \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d According to the network\u2019s data crunchers, NBC has earned around 47 percent of the revenue generated by its 2016 pilot episode from advertising through digital views.

About three-quarters of the revenue NBC made from the 2015 pilot of \u201cBlindspot,\u201d for instance, has been earned the old fashioned way.But NBC was less savvy back then in extracting money from viewers who preferred streaming. By the time of the first \u201cThis Is Us\u201d season, NBC had wised up, striking a deal that allowed it to earn money from Hulu ads shown during episodes of the hit tear-jerker.Generating revenue from streaming is relatively new for the networks, said Jeff Bader, NBC\u2019s president of program planning, strategy and research.\u201cWhen I came to NBC five years ago, we were in this place with: How are we going to manage this business that\u2019s been in decline?\u201d he said. \u201cWe were doing everything we could not to be the record industry and have our stuff pirated and not monetized.\u201dParticularly depressing was the number of younger viewers who seemed to be changing their viewing habits.\u201cFor years, we were seeing our average age go up, up up,\u201d Mr. Bader said. \u201cYounger viewers were drifting. \u201dOnce the network examined the data, however, it saw that younger viewers hadn\u2019t abandoned NBC. They were just watching shows on their own schedules.NBC understands the reason for the advertising community\u2019s skepticism concerning the number of people who watch shows via streaming, however.\u201cThat is the frustrating part of the whole ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have a third-party objective measuring system that everyone has adopted that we all buy into.\u201dUntil that third-party system emerges, Mr. Greenblatt said that his sales department has gone all-in on selling advertisers on a statistical portrait that is prettier than the one painted by Nielsen.\u201cThis started for me purely on looking at viewership numbers, because I wanted to be able to make the argument, \u2018People aren\u2019t just bailing on network TV,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen it occurred to us, it\u2019s not just a viewership number we\u2019re defending. It\u2019s part of the business model now and it\u2019s going to be move that way more and more.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Every day feels like when a group of strangers suddenly work together to push a beached whale back into the sea.\u201dBut the moment that most excited the hosts was a surprise phone call from a special guest: President Trump (Alec Baldwin), who said he was \u201cdoing my P90X morning exercises right now.\u201d However, as viewers could see, he was clearly lying down in the Lincoln Bedroom and tweeting with an Egg McMuffin on his chest.Gardner congratulated Baldwin on the recent State of the Union address, gushing, \u201cYour speech was maybe the best speech in the history of this country.\u201dBaldwin replied, \u201cYou know a lot of people are saying, including Paul Ryan, that it was better than Martin Luther King\u2019s \u2018I Dream of Jeannie\u2019 speech.\u201dIn other memorable moments from this episode:\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d delved more deeply into history \u2014 America\u2019s and its own \u2014 in a pre-Super Bowl sketch set at the Second Continental Congress in 1775 and featuring the former \u201cS.N.L.\u201d cast members Rachel Dratch and Tina Fey.Informed that the colonists have just won the Battle of Bunker Hill, a delegate played by Beck Bennett sighed, \u201cNow we have to hear the boasting of the Patriots of New England.\u201d Enter a rowdy contingent of braggadocious colonial types, including Portman, Dratch and Moffat, who recounted the victory. \u201cWe get pushed back way behind our line, like 40 yards,\u201d he said in a thick New England accent. \u201cBut our guy, Captain Thomas Brady, he\u2019s got like the best cannon and we come back like we always do.\u201dNot to be outdone, Fey and the cast members Kenan Thompson and Mikey Day strode into the room as the Philadelphia delegation, vowing that they too had victory in their sights. \u201cSo grease up them poles \u2019cause Philly\u2019s gonna win and then one of these guys is going to punch a police horse,\u201d Fey said.Explaining why they identified themselves with Eagles \u2014 the team that will face the New England Patriots at the Super Bowl on Sunday \u2014 Fey said, \u201cWe Philadelphians are swift, we are deadly, and our eyes are all a little too close together.\u201dThis memo came from 40-year-old virgin Devin Nunes, who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. I\u2019ve got to say, I don\u2019t really trust this guy to untangle a vast conspiracy. I wouldn\u2019t really trust him to untangle a pair of headphones. Now I\u2019m trying to put myself in his shoes, and it\u2019s pretty easy because his shoes are Velcro. But I don\u2019t really understand how any of this is important, so I\u2019m just going to treat this memo like every other memo I\u2019ve received at work and completely ignore it. At this point, if you actually want to get my attention, the bar is set at \u2018Porn star spanks president with magazine.\u2019 Also, this is a four-page memo that just cherry-picks information from a FISA document that\u2019s like 50 or 60 pages long. It\u2019s like when you see a blurb for \u2018Transformers 5,\u2019 and it says, \u2018It blew my mind,\u2019 when the full quote is, \u2018It blew my mind that God allowed this.\u2019\u201dMr. Jost\u2019s co-anchor, Michael Che, continued: \u201cFirst of all, you know damn well Donald Trump didn\u2019t read this memo. It\u2019s four pages long. And the only time Donald Trump reads four pages in a row is when he\u2019s ordering breakfast.\u201dPortman replied, \u201cAll first ladies have a platform. Yours is bullying, mine was little hats. Your approval rating is through the roof.\u201dStrong answered, \u201cYes, yes, people like me because they\u2019re like, \u2018That lady look how I feel.\u2019\u201dStick around for additional appearances from the former first ladies Hillary Clinton (Kate McKinnon), Michelle Obama (Leslie Jones) and, for some reason, an ax-wielding Martha Washington (Aidy Bryant).Strong explained, \u201cIt\u2019s important in France to question, to debate, to challenge popular opinion. Me, I don\u2019t want romance to die. But me, if I went too far or hurt any woman, that was absolutely not my intention.\u201dMcKinnon added, \u201cAnd me, I stand by everything I have said.
