{"Headline": "Cyberattack Caused Olympic Opening Ceremony Disruption", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cyberattack caused the internet disruptions during the Winter Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony on Friday night, Olympic officials and security experts said.Jihye Lee, a spokesman for the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee, confirmed Sunday that \u201cthe technology issues experienced Friday night were caused by a cyberattack.\u201dMr. Lee did not elaborate on the cause but said that the attack had been quickly addressed and that systems had been stabilized by Sunday.The cyberattack took out internet access and telecasts, grounded broadcasters\u2019 drones, shut down the Pyeongchang 2018 website, and prevented spectators from printing out reservations and attending the ceremony, which resulted in an unusually high number of empty seats.Security experts said they had uncovered evidence that the attack had been in the works since late last year. It was directed at the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee and incorporated code that was specifically designed to disrupt the Games or perhaps even send a political message.In an interview, Talos researchers noted that there was a nuance to the attack that they had not seen before: Even though the hackers clearly demonstrated that they had the ability to destroy victims\u2019 computers, they stopped short of doing so. They erased only backup files on Windows machines and left open the possibility that responders could still reboot the computers and fix the damage.\u201cWhy did they pull their punch?\u201d asked Craig Williams, a senior technical leader at Talos. \u201cPresumably, it\u2019s making some political message\u201d that they could have done far worse, he said.Talos\u2019s findings matched those of other internet security companies, like CrowdStrike, which determined on Monday that the attacks had been in the works since at least December. Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike, said his team had discovered time stamps that showed the destructive payload that hit the opening ceremony was constructed on Dec. 27 at 11:39 a.m. Coordinated Universal Time \u2014 which converts to 6:39 a.m. Eastern Time, 2:39 p.m. in Moscow and 8:39 p.m. in South Korea.Beginning in November, CrowdStrike\u2019s intelligence team witnessed Fancy Bear attacks that stole credentials from an international sports organization, Mr. Meyers said. He declined to identify the victim but suggested that the credential thefts were similar to the ones that hackers would have needed before their opening ceremony attack.On Wednesday, two days before the ceremony, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs made an apparent attempt to pre-empt any accusations of Russian cyberattacks on the Games. In a statement, released in English, German and Russian, the agency accused Western governments, press and information security companies of waging an \u201cinformation war\u201d accusing Russia of \u201calleged cyber interference\u201d and \u201cplanning to attack the ideals of the Olympic movement.\u201dThis was not the first Olympic opening ceremony that was a target for hackers. In the lead-up to the 2012 London Games, investigators uncovered attack tools and the blueprints to the Olympic stadium\u2019s building management systems on a hacker\u2019s computer.It appeared that hackers planned to take out the power to the stadium, said Oliver Hoare, who led cybersecurity matters for the London Games. But officials successfully prevented an attack.Motoko Rich contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts in Hand, Companies Spend More on Themselves Than on Wages", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump promised that his tax cut would encourage companies to invest in factories, workers and wages, setting off a spending spree that would reinvigorate the American economy.Companies have announced plans for some of those investments. But so far, companies are using much of the money for something with a more narrow benefit: buying their own shares.Those so-called buybacks are good for shareholders, including the senior executives who tend to be big owners of their companies\u2019 stock. A company purchasing its own shares is a time-tested way to bolster its stock price.But the purchases can come at the expense of investments in things like hiring, research and development and building new plants \u2014 the sort of investments that directly help the overall economy. The buybacks are also most likely to worsen economic inequality because the benefits of stocks purchases flow disproportionately to the richest Americans.What companies do with the trillions of dollars they\u2019re bringing back to the United States, and the money they will save each year on their tax bills, will in large part determine whether the plan is a success or a failure.As the tax cuts kick in, companies have laid out a variety of uses for the money. Some are paying out one-time bonuses to employees. Others are raising salaries. Others plan to open new factories.In the fourth quarter, American companies\u2019 investments in things like factories and business equipment grew by 6.8 percent. That was the fastest growth rate since 2014, but far from the giant surge in capital spending that was promised ahead of the tax overhaul.But the buying back of shares is also at record levels.Almost 100 American corporations have trumpeted such plans in the past month. American companies have announced more than $178 billion in planned buybacks \u2014 the largest amount unveiled in a single quarter, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm.Such purchases reduce a company\u2019s total number of outstanding shares, giving each remaining share a slightly bigger piece of the profit pie.On Monday, Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire might be open to buy some of its shares. The remarks helped send Berkshire\u2019s stock \u2014 and the broader market \u2014 higher.\u201cI\u2019m expecting buybacks to get to a record for 2018,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m disappointed, there\u2019s a lot of people with me.\u201dThe flurry of planned buybacks has been good for the stock market. Early this month, stocks were down more than 10 percent from their January peak. The prospect of companies flooding markets with \u201cbuy\u201d orders helped the market recoup some of its losses.The broader impact on the economy is less clear. Economists believe a rising stock market benefits the economy, helping support consumer and business confidence. But the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of American households, who own 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40 percent of all stocks.Ultimately, the effect of the rising stock market depends on how those wealthy investors use their windfall. It helps the economy more, for example, if they put the money toward productive new companies than if they invest in government bonds.Companies typically decide to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories based on whether they will make the company more profitable \u2014 not merely because the companies are sitting on a pile of money that they otherwise would have paid in taxes.At a news conference Thursday, the head of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, acknowledged that many companies were spending their money on buying their own shares.\u201cRight now we\u2019re going to have an adjustment where you see probably more dividends and share buybacks than wage increases,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cBut going forward we\u2019re going to see a lot of capital formation and wage growth.\u201dThat is not what happened in 2005, when a one-time tax holiday allowed companies to repatriate money on the cheap. That plan, championed by President George W. Bush, was sold as a way to get American companies to invest more in the domestic economy.Studies have shown that the tax change lifted companies\u2019 stock prices but did not expand their American work forces.Until the early 1980s, the practice of buying shares with corporate money was considered borderline illegal because it was thought to potentially open the company up to charges of manipulating share prices.But in 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that gave the green light to most share repurchases, as long as they followed certain rules.Historically, American companies had paid out profits with a quarterly check, known as a dividend. But after the S.E.C.\u2019s rule change, companies started using more of their profits to buy their own shares, in the process giving their shareholders a bigger piece of the company.Buybacks soon soared. By 2016, the most recent year for which there is complete data, companies spent $536 billion on purchasing their own shares, according to data from S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.That was about 5 percent less than those companies spent on new plants, research and development and other investments. By contrast, 20 years ago, companies spent four times as much on such investments as they did on buybacks.\u201cWe have some causal evidence that because of short-termism companies are doing some stock repurchases that maybe they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Heitor Almeida, a professor of corporate finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s causing them to reduce investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Chips Available to Others", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Monday, the internet giant said it would allow other companies to buy access to those chips through its cloud-computing service. Google hopes to build a new business around the chips, called tensor processing units, or T.P.U.s.\u201cWe are trying to reach as many people as we can as quickly as we can,\u201d said Zak Stone, who works alongside the small team of Google engineers that designs these chips.And these days, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are not just big internet companies. They are big hardware makers.Right now, Google\u2019s new service is focused on a way to teach computers to recognize objects, called computer vision technology. But as time goes on, the new chips will also help businesses build a wider range of services, Mr. Stone said.At the end of last year, hoping to accelerate its work on driverless cars, Lyft began testing Google\u2019s new chips.Using the chips, Lyft wanted to accelerate the development of systems that allow driverless cars to, say, identify street signs or pedestrians. \u201cTraining\u201d these systems can take days, but with the new chips, the hope is that this will be reduced to hours.\u201cThere is huge potential here,\u201d said Anantha Kancherla, who oversees software for the Lyft driverless car project.T.P.U. chips have helped accelerate the development of everything from the Google Assistant, the service that recognizes voice commands on Android phones, to Google Translate, the internet app that translates one language into another.They are also reducing Google\u2019s dependence on chip makers like Nvidia and Intel. In a similar move, it designed its own servers and networking hardware, reducing its dependence on hardware makers like Dell, HP and Cisco.This keeps costs down, which is essential when running a large online operation, said Casey Bisson, who helps oversee a cloud computing service called Joyent, which is owned by Samsung. At times, the only way to build an efficient service is to build your own hardware.\u201cThis is about packing as much computing power as possible within a small area, within a heat budget, within a power budget,\u201d Mr. Bisson said.Typically, engineers train these algorithms using graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which are chips that were originally designed for rendering images for games and other graphics-heavy software. Most of these chips are supplied by Nvidia.In designing its own A.I. chips, Google was looking to exceed what was possible with these graphics-oriented chips, speed up its own A.I. work and lure more businesses onto its cloud services.At the same time, Google has gained some independence from Nvidia and an ability to negotiate lower prices with its chip suppliers.\u201cGoogle has become so big, it makes sense to invest in chips,\u201d said Fred Weber, who spent a decade as the chief technology officer at the chip maker AMD. \u201cThat gives them leverage. They can cut out the middleman.\u201dThis does not mean that Google will stop buying chips from Nvidia and other chip makers. But it is altering the market. \u201cWho\u2019s buying and who\u2019s selling has changed,\u201d Mr. Weber said.Over the years, Google has even flirted with the possibility of designing its own version of the chips it buys from Intel.Mr. Weber and other insiders question whether Google would ever do this, just because a C.P.U. is so complex and it would be so much more difficult to design and maintain one of these chips. But at a private event in San Francisco last fall, David Patterson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who now works on chip technologies at Google, was asked if the company would go that far.\u201cThat\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

From 2008 through 2012, Tucker\u2019s companies extended approximately five million loans to customers across the country, while generating more than $2 billion in revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. Most of this money flowed through accounts that Tucker maintained at the Bank.USB employees responsible for servicing Tucker\u2019s ongoing account activity disregarded numerous red flags that Tucker was using the tribes to conceal his ownership of the accounts. For example, Tucker spent large sums of monies from accounts in the names of Tribal Companies on personal items, including tens of millions of dollars on a vacation home in Aspen and on Tucker\u2019s professional Ferrari racing team.U.S. Bancorp said on Thursday that it had put in place measure to improve its anti-money laundering controls.

The cause? Fears the economy was heating up, which would lead to a pickup in inflation and Federal Reserve raising rates faster than anticipated.But in the week since the S.&P. 500 has stage a comeback. The index is up 7.6 percent and on pace for best week since 2014, according to Bloomberg. In fact, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 2 percent the past two days despite the latest inflation data coming in much higher than expected.So what happened to those concerns about inflation? One explanation for why stock investors shrugged off the inflation data was a very weak report on retail sales. Investors seemed to take that as evidence the economy is not overheating and that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a very slow pace.Two weeks ago when the sell-off started, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow forecast for first-quarter G.D.P. fell to 3.25 percent from 5.4 percent two weeks ago.\u201cWhile it does appear that inflation is accelerating, it appears much less likely that the economy is really taking off and forcing the Fed into a more aggressive rate hiking cycle,\u201d write the strategists over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The bigger pictureA rising rate environment is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks. Jodie Gunzberg, the head of United States equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, points out that since 1971 the S&P 500:ProPublica\u2019s article centers on the bureau\u2019s handling of investigations into Wells Fargo. It reports that Mr. Mulvaney ordered restrictions on the accessing of personal data of Wells Fargo customers, a move that hampered the bureau\u2019s investigations. An exemption on the freeze was later granted to enforcement staff looking into Wells Fargo\u2019s auto insurance business. But ProPublica added:Mulvaney\u2019s order has had effects beyond enforcement, hampering the bureau\u2019s efforts to monitor financial firms for compliance with consumer protection rules and conduct research on financial products, according to several staffers. The freeze has even stymied state attorneys general, according to two C.F.P.B. staffers and one attorney for a state office.The tax overhaul requires funds to hold onto investments for three years to qualify for the lower rate. They\u2019ve been getting around it by creating single-member LLCs in Delaware to receive carried interest payouts.More from Miles Weiss of Bloomberg:Four LLCs have been created under the name of Elliott Management Corp., the hedge-fund giant run by Paul Singer. More than 70 have been established under the names of executives at Starwood Capital Group Management, the private-equity shop headed by Barry Sternlicht.The headline reason is his belief that Silicon Valley is too intolerant of conservatives and libertarians. But there\u2019s an interesting second reason in the article (emphasis added):The WSJ reports that Mr. Thiel will spend at least a bit more time working on a non-tech endeavor: a right-leaning media organization. He will still be involved in Founders Fund, the V.C. firm he co-founded, as well as stay on the boards of Facebook, the data consultancy Palantir and other tech companies.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cMy goal is to make it so the next generation grows up in a world where cancer is managed just like the common cold, and the body\u2019s natural regenerative engine remains empowered throughout our lives,\u201d said Dr. Hariri.Celgene, United Therapeutics, Sorrento Therapeutics, Human Longevity, the Dreyfus Family Office and Section 32 took part in the series-A funding.In other health care deal newsWhy? The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 inflation report was higher than expected. But weaker retail sales tempered those fears \u2014 at least for equity investors.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeTo some, the bond market is a particularly prescient predictor of economic trends. So is it picking up on an inflationary surge that the Federal Reserve likely will take too long to recognize?But the overheating fears may be overdone. Yesterday\u2019s January inflation report was hardly conclusive. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that the January increase \u201cprobably overstates the underlying trend.\u201dStill, even though there are reasons to believe that while the U.S. economy is breaking out of its recent rut \u2014 thanks to big tax cuts and a revival of the global economy \u2014 it may not be as vibrant as it looks.The economic flyaroundNestl\u00e9 added that its future is likely to contain more deals in the several-hundred-million range of the Blue Bottle Coffee takeover. \u201cThe sweet spot is in small to mid-sized deals, but we don\u2019t want to rule out anything,\u201d its C.E.O., Mark Schneider, said.The deals flyaroundHe also offered this ambition: \u201cI want you to be able to take an Uber and get into the subway \u2014 if the trains are running on time, you\u2019ve got real-time data \u2014 get in the subway, get out and have an Uber waiting for you for right now. Or know that there\u2019s a bike right there for you that gets you where you\u2019re going in the fastest manner.\u201dWhether the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C. are the best venues for this type of regulation is something Congress will have to decide. Neither agency has experience in overseeing virtual currencies, so assigning responsibility to one (or both) will require increased appropriations to develop rules and effective oversight.\u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.

{"Headline": "The Myth of the Hacker-Proof Voting Machine", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2011, the election board in Pennsylvania\u2019s Venango County \u2014 a largely rural county in the northwest part of the state \u2014 asked David A. Eckhardt, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University, to examine its voting systems. In municipal and state primaries that year, a few voters had reported problems with machines \u2018\u2018flipping\u2019\u2019 votes; that is, when these voters touched the screen to choose a candidate, the screen showed a different candidate selected. Errors like this are especially troubling in counties like Venango, which uses touch-screen voting machines that have no backup paper trail; once a voter casts a digital ballot, if the machine misrecords the vote because of error or maliciousness, there\u2019s little chance the mistake will be detected.Eckhardt and his colleagues concluded that the problem with the machines, made by Election Systems & Software (ES&S), was likely a simple calibration error. But the experts were alarmed by something else they discovered. Examining the election-management computer at the county\u2019s office \u2014 the machine used to tally official election results and, in many counties, to program voting machines \u2014 they found that remote-access software had been installed on it.Remote-access software is a type of program that system administrators use to access and control computers remotely over the internet or over an organization\u2019s internal network. Election systems are supposed to be air-gapped \u2014 disconnected from the internet and from other machines that might be connected to the internet. The presence of the software suggested this wasn\u2019t the case with the Venango machine, which made the system vulnerable to hackers. Anyone who gained remote access to the system could use the software to take control of the machine. Logs showed the software was installed two years earlier and used multiple times, most notably for 80 minutes on November 1, 2010, the night before a federal election.The software, it turns out, was being used not by a hacker but by an authorized county contractor working from home. Still, the arrangement meant anyone who might gain control of the contractor\u2019s home computer could use it to access and gain control of the county\u2019s election system.It was just another example of something that Eckhardt and other experts had suspected for many years: that many critical election systems in the United States are poorly secured and protected against malicious attacks.But for as long as experts have warned about security problems, voting machine makers and election officials have denied that the machines can be remotely hacked. The reason, they say, is that the systems are not connected to the internet \u2014 an assurance the public has largely accepted. This defense was never more loudly expressed than in 2016, when the government disclosed that Russian hackers were probing American voter-registration systems and had breached at least one of them. Concerned that hacking fears could make the public less likely to vote, the United States Election Assistance Commission and state election officials rushed to assert that there was no need to worry about the votes because voting machines themselves were isolated from the internet.The reality, as the incident in Venango County makes clear, is far more complicated.(In a statement, ES&S said, \u2018\u2018None of the employees who reviewed this response, including long-tenured employees, has any knowledge that our voting systems have ever been sold with remote-access software.\u2019\u2019)Installing remote-access software and modems on systems that program voting machines and tally final results is a serious security issue and one that election officials are beginning to understand, as evidenced by Venango\u2019s response to Eckhardt\u2019s warning. But there\u2019s an even more fundamental way that many voting machines themselves are being connected to the internet and put at risk of hacking, and there\u2019s no sign that election officials at the state or federal level are aware the risk exists.On election nights, many polling places around the country transmit voting results to their county election offices via modems embedded in or connected to their voting machines. Election officials and vendors insist that the modem transmissions are safe because the connections go over phone lines and not the internet. But as security experts point out, many of the modems are cellular, which use radio signals to send calls and data to cell towers and routers belonging to mobile carriers \u2014 Verizon, Sprint, AT&T. These routers are technically part of the internet. Even when analog (landline) modems are used instead of cellular ones, the calls still likely pass through routers, because phone companies have replaced much of their analog switching equipment in recent years with digital systems.Because of this, attackers could theoretically intercept unofficial results as they\u2019re transmitted on election night \u2014 or, worse, use the modem connections to reach back into election machines at either end and install malware or alter election software and official results.\u2018\u2018Almost any phone call, whether on a cellular network or a so-called landline, goes through a part of the internet,\u2019\u2019 says Andrew Appel, a computer-science professor at Princeton University and longtime voting-machine security expert. \u2018\u2018It may be a part that\u2019s supposedly behind the walls of some phone provider,\u2019\u2019 Appel added. But, he said, \u2018\u2018if the security of the phone provider is not perfect \u2014 and nobody\u2019s security is perfect \u2014 then that phone call can be interfered with like any other transmission on the internet.\u2019\u2019Alternatively, a hacker could subvert telecom routers to intercept and alter election results as they pass through telecom equipment. Like any other digital device, telecom routers have vulnerabilities, and they have become a prime target in recent years for nation-state hackers from Russia and other countries. In 2012, hackers from Britain\u2019s GCHQ spy agency targeted routers belonging to the Belgian telecom Belgacom to intercept mobile traffic passing through them.In either scenario, experts say, attackers could also potentially use an IMSI-catcher or subverted telecom router to hack back into election systems and alter software to affect election outcomes.The document doesn\u2019t address the risk of someone hacking into voting machines via the modem, but vendors insist that the machines have protections to prevent this. Election officials also assert that routine procedures they perform would detect if someone altered transmitted votes or machine software. Experts, however, say the procedures are inadequate to detect altered software, and that vendor claims about security can\u2019t be trusted, because of their long history of implementing security poorly. Federal labs responsible for certifying voting equipment don\u2019t test the vulnerability of the modems to hacking, so there\u2019s no independent verification of vendor claims.\u2018\u2018What I\u2019ve seen in the past 10 years is that the vendors have absolutely fumbled every single attempt in security,\u2019\u2019 says Jacob D. Stauffer, vice president of operations for Coherent Cyber, who has conducted voting-machine security assessments for California\u2019s secretary of state for a decade. In a report Stauffer and colleagues published last year about their recent assessment of ES&S machines, they found the voting machines and election-management systems to be rife with security problems.\u2018\u2018The incorrect assertion that voting machines or voting systems can\u2019t be hacked by remote attackers because they are \u2018not connected to the internet\u2019 is not just wrong, it\u2019s damaging,\u2019\u2019 says Susan Greenhalgh, a spokeswoman for the National Election Defense Coalition, an elections integrity group. \u2018\u2018This oft-repeated myth instills a false sense of security that is inhibiting officials and lawmakers from urgently requiring that all voting systems use paper ballots and that all elections be robustly audited.\u2019\u2019With both kinds of voting systems, digital votes are stored on memory cards or flash drives that are collected from machines after an election and are supposed to be used for official results. But many machines also have embedded or externally connected modems to transmit unofficial results rapidly on election night.Not every polling place with embedded modems uses them to transmit results. Richard Rydecki, Wisconsin\u2019s state elections supervisor, says counties in his state decide individually whether to transmit election results. Fred Woodhams, spokesman from the Michigan Department of State, said the same is true in his state. But even if a precinct doesn\u2019t use its modems, having them embedded in voting machines is still a risk, experts say.\u201cIf it is available for use\u201d by an attacker, says Stauffer, \u201cit can be used.\u201dES&S insists that its security measures would prevent hackers exploiting or interfering with modem transmissions. According to a one-page document the company provided, the voting machines digitally sign voting results before transmitting them via modem and encrypt them in transit using SFTP \u2014 secure file transfer protocol. The election-management systems that receive results then check the signature to authenticate the data transmission. This theoretically means results couldn\u2019t be swapped out and replaced with different ones. That is, unless an attacker can obtain ES&S\u2019s signing key.These keys, explains noted cryptographer and computer-security expert Matt Blaze, \u2018\u2018need to be stored in the machine, and if they\u2019re stored in the machine and under control of the software, any compromise of that software could be used potentially to extract\u201d them. Blaze, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, says that ES&S machines he examined for Ohio\u2019s secretary of state a decade ago had a number of security problems, including with key security.As for using the modems to hack into machines and compromise their software, ES&S says its modems are configured to only initiate calls, not receive them, and can make calls only after an election ends, preventing anyone from dialing in or having them dial out at other times. The company also says results are not sent directly to the election-management systems but to a data communications server that operates as a DMZ, or \u2018\u2018demilitarized zone,\u2019\u2019 separated from the internet and the election-management system by firewalls. The election-management system accesses the DMZ to collect the results.ES&S advises election officials to configure the external firewall that protects the DMZ to only accept connections from IP addresses assigned to the voting machines. And election officials in Rhode Island, which uses ES&S\u2019s DS200 machines with modems, told me that the modems only transmit for about a minute, which wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to hack into voting machines or results servers.But Stauffer and others say none of this would prevent a skilled hacker from penetrating the machines via their modems. Although overwriting the machine\u2019s firmware, or voting software, would be difficult to do in just a minute, Stauffer says installing malware on the underlying operating system would not. An attacker might be able to do this directly through the modem to the voting machine, or infect the election-management system on the other end and install malware that gets passed to voting machines when officials program future elections. In either case, the malware could disable modem controls on the voting machines and make the devices secretly dial out to whatever number an attacker wants whenever he wants, while also altering system logs to erase evidence of these calls. This would let an attacker connect to the machines before or during an election to install malicious voting software that subverts results.In such a scenario, the demilitarized zone concept, which ES&S says protects the election-management system, could actually become a liability, since it\u2019s trusted by the election-management systems that communicate with it, says J. Alex Halderman, professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. Halderman calls the DMZ a \u2018\u2018very risky setup in an election context, given that an attacker who infiltrates the EMS can tamper with election results or spread malware to voting machines.\u2019\u2019The firewalls surrounding the DMZ can have their own vulnerabilities, and Halderman points out that if an attacker can send corrupt data through the firewall to the DMZ, then he can exploit vulnerabilities in the election-management system when the two communicate. This isn\u2019t speculation, Halderman insists: A study done in 2007 for Ohio found multiple vulnerabilities in ES&S\u2019s Unity election management system that would let an attacker send it malformed election data in order to run malicious code on the system. \u2018\u2018The fact that these election management systems are networked at all should be alarming to anyone who understands election cybersecurity,\u2019\u2019 Halderman says.Douglas W. Jones, a computer-science professor at the University of Iowa, has examined multiple voting systems for state and local election officials over the years. \u2018\u2018Nothing I know about the machines would defend against\u2019\u2019 an attack where a hacker altered voting software.. \u2018\u2018So this is a vulnerability that should be taken quite seriously.\u2019\u2019Even if ES&S were to prevent someone from loading unsigned voting software, an attacker could still install malware on a voting or election-management machine via the modem connection, according to experts, if the underlying operating system software had unpatched security vulnerabilities. In fact, many voting machines across the country run on years-old unpatched Windows and Linux operating systems, partly because counties don\u2019t have the staff to maintain the systems and have long believed that the systems are secure, and partly because (due to long delays in getting new or altered versions of voting machines certified) voting machine vendors often sell systems without the latest patches installed.ES&S says it\u2019s working with customers to patch their firewalls, but if they use the firewalls \u2018\u2018according to recommended procedures,\u2019\u2019 they can mitigate the vulnerability. Those procedures include configuring the firewalls to only accept connections from known and trusted IP addresses \u2018\u2018and shutting off the system when not in use.\u2019\u2019Jones says the better solution is for states to seriously reassess their use of modems if they want to protect upcoming elections, particularly because hackers wouldn\u2019t need to successfully alter voting machine software to have a detrimental effect; they could just leave behind evidence that they got in.\u2018\u2018This is an extraordinarily powerful tool if all you want to do is simply discredit democracy,\u2019\u2019 Jones says. \u2018\u2018All you have to do is create the appearance of something having happened, even if it hasn\u2019t happened.\u2019\u2019Kim Zetter has covered cybersecurity for more than a decade.
