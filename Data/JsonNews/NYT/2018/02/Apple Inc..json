{"Headline": "As the Streaming Wars Heat Up, Ryan Murphy Cashes In", "Date": "2018-02-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe battle between the Hollywood establishment and the streaming-media giants has caused big changes in the entertainment industry in recent months, driving up the prices of major stars and series producers while leaving traditional companies in danger of losing relevance.Mr. Murphy was in an ideal bargaining position not only because he possesses a fecund imagination able to spin out one successful series after another, but because Apple and Amazon have lately proved themselves willing to spend their way into rivalries with the old-line movie studios and television networks.Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, \u201cThe goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201dThat statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes.Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos\u2019s signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood.\u201cWhat Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there\u2019s a new template in town,\u201d Ms. Walden said. \u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator.\u201dRick Rosen, the head of TV at the agency WME, said it had become clear that Netflix was now able to outspend the companies that had been around since the early days of the movie business.\u201cAs a representative of talent, if you have top-top talent, you must talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d be negligent if you didn\u2019t. Top talent wants to pitch to Netflix.\u201dAnother competitor in the expanding streaming industry, Hulu \u2014 which is available only in the United States \u2014 has gained momentum recently with original series like the much-decorated \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and now has 17 million subscribers. While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters.With the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts.The mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry \u2014 one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space.\u201cWere the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,\u201d said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. \u201cIf the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us.\u201dMr. Murphy declined to comment for this article.Disney \u2014 a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger \u2014 has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney\u2019s own television studio has not been a reliable supplier.The day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network\u2019s long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d) and Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d).\u201cWith more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,\u201d he said.The money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: \u201cWhen this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I\u2019m interested in that and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201dThe Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year \u2014 and when the streaming services are spending in manic style.And it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right.The question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion \u2014 a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In an Era of \u2018Smart\u2019 Things, Sometimes Dumb Stuff Is Better", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIt still feels magical to light up your living room by saying \u201cAlexa, turn on the lights.\u201d But with all the hype surrounding so-called smart things \u2014 everyday devices that are connected to the internet \u2014 it\u2019s easy to forget that sometimes the dumb stuff is just better.Tech companies are adding internet connections to just about everything you can imagine so that they can be controlled with smart speakers or phones. Thermostats, surveillance cameras, mosquito zappers, coffee makers \u2014 you name it.But before we get carried away setting up the Wi-Fi connections on all our appliances, lights and fashion accessories, let me play Luddite for a second. Some of the most mundane devices are designed to accomplish a simple task extremely well \u2014 and in some cases they still execute those duties better than their high-tech brethren.So let\u2019s take a moment to appreciate some of the best dumb things. Here are my top picks.Yet a normal wristwatch is still superior at one crucial task: Telling the time.The Apple Watch\u2019s screen wakes up when you tilt your wrist at an angle, which indicates you are trying to check the time. That helps conserve battery life. But any Apple Watch wearer is familiar with situations where this feature gets frustrating.While riding a bicycle, for example, you often have to let go of the handle bar and lift the watch toward your face to check the time. When you\u2019re standing on a bus or subway train and holding onto a pole, it is difficult to tilt your wrist at the correct angle to look at the time. Or when you\u2019re in a meeting and want to see if you\u2019re staying on schedule, flicking your wrist isn\u2019t very subtle.Until the Apple Watch manages to constantly display the time without sapping the battery, a normal wristwatch is better for telling the time in all those scenarios. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see me wearing a normal watch at work but an Apple Watch at the gym.Many cars are now equipped with a touch-screen on the console that essentially mirrors your smartphone screen. Android phone users get to use Android Auto, and iPhone users hook into CarPlay.The problem with this concept is there are a limited number of apps that work with these smart infotainment systems. For example, if on CarPlay you prefer to use Google Maps or Waze, you\u2019re out of luck and are stuck with Apple Maps.Voil\u00e0, your phone has become your infotainment system, capable of running your favorite navigation and music apps and using voice controls to place calls over speakerphone. The screen is large enough to clearly read maps, and you can update the operating system on your own. What more do you need?A camera on your nightstand that is constantly pointed at your bed? It\u2019s like asking for your privacy to be violated. You might as well shop for your groceries in your underwear or post all your smartphone photos publicly on the web.Amazon promises the camera software on the Echo Spot can be turned off whenever you aren\u2019t using it. But it\u2019s an obvious feature for hackers to target with malware.So if your primary goal is to have a device that wakes you up on time to go to work, just get an old-school alarm clock.But there are reasons a cheap kitchen timer can be superior.Cooking timing can vary depending on your heating element, among other factors. So if you have to check your food for doneness and change the kitchen timer, an old-school timer \u2014 either the analog variety or the type with a digital time display and two or three physical buttons \u2014 can be easier. It simply dings or beeps when the time is up and it\u2019s quicker to add or subtract a few minutes by turning a dial or pressing a button or two.You can also constantly see how much time is left on the timer, whereas with the Echo, you have to open a smartphone app to see the remaining time or ask Alexa to tell you how much time is left. Over the long term, using a smart speaker as a timer gets tedious.When people buy new iPads or Amazon Fire tablets, they often give their older tablet a second life by designating it for the kitchen. There, the ancient tablet gets mounted to the refrigerator with a magnet and becomes a glorified recipe reader.Having tried this experiment, it\u2019s a hassle. You often have to clean the tablet after smearing food on the screen. The battery eventually needs to be recharged. And if you want to double or halve a recipe, you have to do some mental math, which makes multitasking more challenging when you are busy in the kitchen.Printing out or jotting down a recipe on a piece of paper is just simpler. You can easily scribble additional notes, like changes and improvements to the recipe. Assuming you have decent handwriting, it\u2019s easy to read the steps and ingredients.And if it gets covered in food, you can just throw it away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reunited? CBS and Viacom Are Talking About It", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new chapter opened Thursday in the drama over the future of the $37 billion Redstone media empire, with CBS Corporation and Viacom announcing plans to explore a reunion, reigniting a plan that fizzled a little more than a year ago.In simultaneously released statements, CBS and Viacom \u2014 which were part of the same company from 2000 to 2006 \u2014 said that their boards had created special committees of independent directors to \u201cevaluate a potential combination.\u201d Yet the companies cautioned that there could be \u201cno assurance that this process will result in a transaction or on what terms any transaction may occur.\u201dIn rekindling the possibility, though, both companies are acknowledging that they must get bigger to remain competitive in a media industry that now prioritizes scale.In the past year, The Walt Disney Company has agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox in a deal that would form an entertainment colossus for the age of streaming. AT&T is still pursuing an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. At the same time, traditional media companies are contending with technology companies like Apple and Facebook that have moved into the entertainment business.\u201cWhile it never was the case that you need scale to have a successful business, it becomes a more credible proposition to investors to say that you need it,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cInvestors believe that scale equals clout and clout equals pricing power with both suppliers and customers.\u201dThe ailing 94-year-old media mogul Sumner M. Redstone took control of Viacom in 1987, through National Amusements, the private theater chain started by his father. He then went on to acquire CBS in 2000 in a nearly $40 billion deal. Mr. Redstone split the two companies apart in 2006 amid uncertainty about the future of both businesses.Yet those plans relied largely on winning over Leslie Moonves, the chairman and chief executive of CBS, whom Ms. Redstone wanted to lead the combined company. Mr. Moonves expressed skepticism about how such a deal would benefit both Viacom, which had been struggling, and CBS, which had been delivering strong results. In addition, Mr. Moonves was seeking strategic and operational freedom over the combined companies.But both companies face challenges keeping pace in an increasingly digital world, especially amid the merger frenzy that has swept across the media industry. \u201cAs the world around CBS and Viacom will soon be inhabited by giant companies with endless balance sheets, the reality of the current arms race has recently weighed on these two stocks,\u201d Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research said in a recent research note.In a statement on Thursday, National Amusements said that it supported \u201cthe processes announced by CBS and Viacom to evaluate a combination of the two companies, which we believe has the potential to drive significant, long-term shareholder value.\u201dMr. Wieser, the media analyst, noted that a deal could also be aimed at more firmly establishing a successor to Mr. Moonves, 68. \u201cShari Redstone is more firmly in control,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has her person in place at Viacom and potentially a successor she\u2019d like to see to Les Moonves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: How Monday\u2019s Stock Plunge Ranks?", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 There have been far blacker Mondays.\u2022 Kenneth C. Griffin is growing concerned about inflation.\u2022 The Fed\u2019s regulatory action against Wells may have some bite.\u2022 Broadcom puts more pressure on Qualcomm\u2022 How worried should JPMorgan clients be about health care?\u2022 How much more will Wells Fargo have to do?Measured by points, those are steep drops \u2014 the biggest on record for the indexes. The previous largest point declines for each benchmark came in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis.But Monday\u2019s plunge was far less impressive on a percentage basis. The Dow\u2019s fall ranked as its 100th biggest, while the S. & P. 500\u2019s slide was the 127th biggest in the index\u2019s history, according to S & P Dow Jones Indices.Here is how Monday\u2019s sell-off stacks up against two other major tumbles.But points are not the best way to compare the magnitude of a stock index\u2019s declines across eras. As the stock market has risen, big point moves have translated into increasingly smaller percentage changes. The Dow and the S. & P. 500 have more than doubled from their closes on Sept. 29, 2008.\u201cBlack Monday\u201d was a petrifying moment \u2014 an even bigger decline in both points and percentage than the stock market crash of 1929. But unlike the 1929 crash, the slide in 1987 did not contribute to a wider economic slump. The stock market recovered its losses by early 1989.\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Peter EavisAs the U.S. stock markets look wobbly for the first time in nearly two years, at least one major investor is sounding a bearish tone.In a Jan. 31 letter to investors, Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago hedge-fund firm Citadel, wrote that even though the broader economic backdrop continues to be positive, he sees several warning signs that could turn stock prices downward.The end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy is one factor, Mr. Griffin wrote, that could pressure stocks. But the prospect of inflation, or a rapid rise in the prices of goods and services, is making him especially nervous.\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the nascent signs\u201d of rising inflation in a variety of countries, he wrote. As a result, he added, money managers at Citadel, which runs a variety of hedge funds, are \u201ccarefully positioning\u201d for a surprise, sharp upturn in inflation.Mr. Griffin added that he is also concerned about geopolitical risks, writing that his money managers need to be able to handle negative events if they do occur, \u201cincluding a trade policy misstep or a military conflict.\u201d He did not elaborate.In an interview with CNBC in November, Mr. Griffin said the stock market was in the \u201cseventh inning\u201d of a rally. He said through a spokesman on Monday that he still thinks there are several innings to go before a downturn begins and that he is more bearish on bond prices than stocks at the moment.\u2014 Kate KellyWith 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.The numbers\u202275 percent of companies are reporting earnings above estimates, above the five-year average.\u2022 Companies that are beating estimates are doing so by a 4 percent margin, below the five year average.\u202280 percent of companies have reported revenue above estimates, a record high.\u2022 All 11 sectors are reporting earnings growth.Wells Fargo\u2019s stock is down more than 7 percent Monday, suggesting that investors believe the growth cap will have some bite. With the economy strengthening and interest rates rising, banks can expect to earn higher profits as they make more loans and suffer fewer losses from defaults. Indeed, this optimistic scenario has helped send bank stocks on a tear in recent months. Now, the question is to what degree Wells Fargo will have to sit out the good times.Wells Fargo executives on Friday suggested that the cap would have limited financial impact, saying it would reduce this year\u2019s net profits by $300 million to $400 million, which works out at less than 2 percent of 2017\u2019s earnings. One reason the earnings hit might be small is that the bank can stay within the cap by selling short-term, lower-risk investments that don\u2019t earn much. Another way the bank intends to limit the negative impact is by reducing the amount of deposits on which the bank pays out a relatively high interest rate.Crucially, Wells Fargo said that it hopes to increase the size of its loan book. The hope is that, by shedding the low-risk investments, the bank will create the room to make more mortgages, credit card loans and loans to businesses, while staying within the limit.But it may not turn out to be as straightforward as that.The growth cap comes after a lackluster year for Wells, which reduced its loans 1 percent last year, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent at Bank of America. Investors waiting for catch-up growth at Wells may have to wait still longer. Also, much depends on whether Wells Fargo can now satisfy the Fed\u2019s concerns. Any indication that the bank is struggling to comply with the regulator\u2019s demands could set off more turmoil at the bank. There is also a possibility that the tactic of shedding of low-risk investments while making more loans could increase the overall risk of Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet.Brian Kleinhanzl, a banks analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote on Sunday that the Fed\u2019s action will \u201cmean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,\u201d adding, \u201cWells will also have to maintain the balance sheet while other banks are growing, and we view this as defensive versus peers.\u201d\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 A takeover price of $82 a share, up from its original offer of $70\u2022 A \u201csignificant\u201d breakup fee if a deal were to be halted for antitrust reasons\u2022 A \u201cticking fee\u201d that Broadcom would pay in cash if a deal took more than a year to closeIt said the new \u201cbest and final\u201d offer would be withdrawn if Qualcomm either pushed its annual shareholder meeting back from March 6 (when Broadcom hopes to unseat the entire board) or if it paid more than $110 a share for NXP Semiconductor.Other cryptocurrencies are falling as well. Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin are all down Monday.How far can Bitcoin fall?Simon Tobler, a trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told Bloomberg: \u201cIf we don\u2019t hold the $8,000 level, Bitcoin may fall to $5,000, where the next big support is. The market is lacking big buyers.\u201dMore from Anna Wilde Mathews, Dana Cimilluca and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:In a reflection of the sensitivity of the subject, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon hit the phones Tuesday to assuage clients\u2019 concerns, people familiar with the matter said. So did some of the firm\u2019s health care bankers, who get paid handsomely to help clients with mergers and other deals and worry the move could cost them business.More from Emily Flitter, Binyamin Appelbaum and David Enrich:The settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.From her interview with Judy Woodruff:\u201cI don\u2019t want to label what we\u2019re seeing a bubble \u2014 as a bubble.\u201cBut I would say that asset valuations generally are elevated, and this is a characterization that we have offered up, for example, last summer in our monetary policy report.\u201d\u2022 Getting bigger by merging with another media company doesn\u2019t solve CBS\u2019s problems.

{"Headline": "Businesses Look at Washington and Say, \u2018Never Mind, We\u2019ll Do It\u2019", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisCan private businesses solve public policy problems better than the government? It\u2019s a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House.There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success \u2014 a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school \u2014 there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be.In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves.\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201dJoining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care?In announcing they would try, they delivered an implicit rebuke of the complex and costly American health care system, suggesting that the best minds in business could do better.\u201cCompanies are now thinking much more about how to solve larger social problems,\u201d said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. \u201cWhen Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, three leaders in their industries, looked around, they realized that health care is a big issue facing them all.\u201dTheir efforts stem from a feeling that, with partisan bickering and constant campaigning consuming Washington, the onus is on businesses to fill the void left by an ineffective government.The notion that big business might shape government policy is nothing new, of course. Lobbyists have been working to sway lawmakers for decades, and the corporate world was an influential force in the tax overhaul passed last year.Yet for the most part, these efforts were narrowly aligned with a company\u2019s self-interest, usually in the form of lowering taxes and loosening regulations. And rarely have business leaders tried to assume operational control of a government function, let alone something as complex and unwieldy as health care.In recent years, however, more chief executives have begun speaking out on issues that at first glance have little to do with the bottom line, including immigration policy, climate change and gay rights.\u201cThe lack of leadership on the national political level has left this vacuum,\u201d said Kathleen Clark, a professor at the Washington University Law school. \u201cFortunately, there are some business leaders who see that there\u2019s a role for them to play.\u201dThe most vivid expression of this new willingness to speak out came last summer after white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Trump equivocated in his response to the violence.Chief executives may seem like unlikely ethical leaders; Wells Fargo, Equifax, Uber and many more companies have faced questions from Congress about practices that have harmed consumers and in some instances cost taxpayers billions of dollars.But companies have also been wading into moral debates for decades. General Motors and Pepsi pulled out of South Africa during the apartheid era. Apple, Disney and Xerox were early in extending health care benefits to gay and lesbian couples.Similar efforts by chief executives today recall \u201can earlier era of corporate statesmanship,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a fellow at New America, a research and policy institute. \u201cA lot of these business leaders viewed a business as having a somewhat broader public mission.\u201dNow, he said, thanks to \u201cthe rise, over the last 15 years, of the importance of social responsibly and social mission, there is a broad movement in business.\u201dEven Amazon\u2019s much-publicized efforts to select a city for a second headquarters could, in a roundabout way, influence local policymakers. Given that the company is unlikely to set up shop in a state with socially conservative laws that might alienate some employees, \u201cAmazon could have an effect not just on prices but on what legislators pass,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.George Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has been promoting democratic ideals around the globe. And Mr. Zuckerberg, through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, is working on ambitious long-term projects involving science, education and justice.There is a big difference, though, between supporting social causes and research and operating a sprawling public works system. Critics will contend that some of these efforts smack of arrogance, and that businesses ought to stay in their lane and focus on offering excellent products and services, not meddle in public policy.\u201cThere is this hubris, thinking that they can do it better,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.There is also a certain irony to the fact that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan said the new company they had formed would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201dThe profit motive, after all, is what leads to efficiency and innovation, according to conventional business school wisdom. Operating as a nonprofit \u201cflies in the face of the logic of the capitalist economy,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.It most likely will take years to determine if the three companies can make good on their promise of building a better health care system. Even if they succeed, the rewards may be limited to their employees \u2014 a large figure, but a small portion of the American work force.Nonetheless, the companies\u2019 push is among the most audacious efforts by the private sector to date, and Mr. Dimon did not shy away from the scope of their ambition.\u201cThe three of our companies have extraordinary resources,\u201d he said on Tuesday when the initiative was announced. \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It now has 20 Moxy hotels around the world and plans to open 90 more by the end of 2021.Millennials, broadly defined as those born in the last two decades of last century, have, as a group, tended to put more emphasis on experiences. And this has become a challenge for businesses.\u201cThe Kardashians paint a false picture of millennials,\u201d said Joan Kuhl, founder and president of Why Millennials Matter, a New York research agency. \u201cI don\u2019t see this group with a lavish affluent lifestyle.\u201dMillennials, many of whom saw their parents struggle with jobs and mortgages during the recession, generally have less interest in buying the big house, flashy sports car and designer clothing that previous generations sought as status symbols of success. Nevertheless, they will pay for the right experiences and technology.\u201cIt\u2019s where you go on vacation, what you do and what technology you have,\u201d said Allen Adamson, one of the founders and managing partners of Metaforce, a brand marketing and consulting firm, and one of the authors of \u201cShift Ahead: How The Best Companies Stay Relevant in a Fast Changing World.\u201d Those experiences need to be \u201cInstagram-worthy,\u201d too. The quirkier, flashier and more offbeat the experience, the better, he said.And businesses are catching on.IMAX, for instance, rolled out six virtual reality theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Manchester and Toronto over the last year as a pilot project to attract millennials. And it has plans to open four more.IMAX charges roughly $10 for a 10-minute VR experience, which is far cheaper than the $1,500 or more needed to buy an in-home VR technology system with a high-end PC and headset. A visitor steps into a pod, snaps on a VR headset and is virtually transported on a 360-degree journey that can include flying over volcanoes, diving into the world of criminals and hit men from the John Wick films, or stepping into the shoes of virtual game superheroes like Batman and Wonder Woman.Afterward, the players receive a video of their VR experience, which they can share with friends on social media. \u201cMillennials want really special experiences and ones that are hard to replicate,\u201d said Rich Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX.When it comes to automobiles, many millennials don\u2019t care about high-end cars the way that previous generations did, but they do want the in-cabin technology and luxury features that often go with them, said Sam Russell, Buick\u2019s marketing director.So Buick started marketing the brand as \u201cattainable luxury\u201d to attract younger buyers, and it added features normally seen in cars like Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and BMW to many of its models in recent years, like 4G LTE Wi-Fi, Apple CarPlay and Ionizer air purifiers.As for the Moxy, its very existence is aimed at millennials.\u201cWe\u2019re delivering a killer experience at a price point that\u2019s affordable,\u201d said Toni Stoeckl, global brand leader of Marriott\u2019s Distinctive Select Brands.To keep rates down, Moxy\u2019s rooms are tiny, averaging only 183 square feet. But its lounges, bars and public spaces are large and encourage a social atmosphere, where guests can mingle and even play board games with friends and strangers. Guests check in electronically through their phones or through the hotel bar instead of at a front desk. There are special events, like midnight pajama parties, where guests are invited to the bar for a nightcap, as well as yoga classes, tarot card readings and \u201cConBody\u201d events, where ex-convicts lead prison-style boot-camp fitness classes.At the Moxy Times Square, a neon-pink light marks the entryway and art graces the ceiling and walls. And its five rooftop dining and nightclub spaces, operated by the Tao Group, contain a rotating carousel bar and outdoor mini-golf course with a clear view of the Empire State Building.\u201cIt\u2019s funky and quite quirky,\u201d said Karl Fegredo, 27, from London, who recently stayed at the hotel.Even Moxy\u2019s hotel openings are edgy and memorable. At the Moxy New Orleans party, snake charmers, tarot card readers and sword swallowers took part in its \u201cFreak Show\u201d theme. The Berlin Moxy \u201ccoming out\u201d party featured drag queens, dominatrixes and tattoo artists as part of an S.&M. theme.\u201cMoxy is about transforming yourself in a playful environment,\u201d Mr. Stoeckl said.Many brands hope that by capturing millennials now, they can turn them into lifelong customers.\u201cI think everybody understands they really need to home in on millennials,\u201d Mr. Gelfond said, \u201cif they want to create a successful long-term business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was named president in 2006.\u201cI have had a wonderful 15 years at Blackstone so far and still savor every minute of it. One of my most important responsibilities is succession, and I am blessed to have a spectacular leader and investor like Jon Gray to whom I can hand the reins,\u201d Mr. James said.The Federal Reserve chairman took his position this year facing plenty of economic factors that could stoke inflation, including:\u2022 Resurgent global economies\u2022 Years of cheap and plentiful credit\u2022 Joblessness falling to multiyear lows, making it easier for workers to get a raise or a bonus, which could push up companies\u2019 costsThen the Fed\u2019s job got harder. Congress passed a large tax cut that will add a jolt of stimulus to an economy that no longer needs extra juice. The stock market loved it and kept zooming higher.But turbulence hit. On Feb. 5, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted over 1,100 points, or 4.6 percent.That brought some much-needed caution\u2022 Investors in the stock market, down 7.6 percent from its high, now know the party can\u2019t go on uninterrupted.\u2022 People are having a real debate about inflation.In other words, nose-diving stocks did Mr. Powell a favor: They threw some cold water on the animal spirits that Congress whipped up.The notes of cautionThe best scenario for the Fed is that the rate hikes forecast for this year are enough to also limit the stimulus from the tax overhaul.Meanwhile, to finance the deficit, the Treasury Department now has to sell more billions of dollars of extra bonds. The huge new government demand for credit could push up interest rates in the markets. The Fed may be fine with that, given that it is expected to raise interest rates this year. But if interest rates in the bond market spike higher than investors expect, or the Fed is happy with, Mr. Powell would face his first big challenge as Fed chairman.\u2014 Peter EavisIn its prime, Chipotle Mexican Grill positioned itself as the paragon of clean, casual, cool dining, a darling of Wall Street, a restaurant industry innovator.Basically, nothing like Taco Bell.How the tables have turned.

{"Headline": "Why We May Soon Be Living in Alexa\u2019s World", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtMy wife and I were just settling into bed one night when Alexa, the other woman in my life, decided to make herself heard.Without being summoned, the Amazon Echo Dot at my bedside \u2014 one of the half-dozen devices that Alexa inhabits in our house \u2014 lit up its spectral blue ring, as if it had heard its triggering wake word, \u201cAlexa.\u201d But instead of offering help with some household chore, the voice assistant began to wail, like a child screaming in a horror-movie dream.\u201cHuh,\u201d I said to my wife when it was over. She said something less kind.But here\u2019s what\u2019s really strange: By the next morning, we had forgotten all about it.It is a measure of how thoroughly Amazon\u2019s voice assistant has wormed herself into our lives, and into much of the culture beyond, that I never considered unplugging her after the scream. Instead I chalked the incident up to a harmless bug \u2014 one of the many mysteries of living with an artificial intelligence life form that can be summoned at a breath. (An Amazon representative offered to investigate, but said the company had never heard of such a thing happening before and didn\u2019t think Alexa was even capable of making such a sound.)Something bigger is afoot. Alexa has the best shot of becoming the third great consumer computing platform of this decade \u2014 next to iOS and Android, a computing service so ubiquitous that it sets a foundation for much of the rest of what happens in tech.It is not a sure path. Amazon could screw this up, and rivals like Google have many cards to play to curb Alexa\u2019s rise. Amazon\u2019s strategy \u2014 something like a mix between Google\u2019s plan for Android and Apple\u2019s for the iPhone \u2014 is also unusual. And there are lingering social concerns about voice assistants and, as I discovered, their sometimes creepy possibilities. How many people, really, are willing to let an always-on device in their house?Despite this, Alexa\u2019s ubiquity is a plausible enough future that it is worth seriously pondering. In an effort to do so, I recently dived headlong into Alexa\u2019s world. I tried just about every Alexa gadget I could get my hands on, including many not made by Amazon, such as an Alexa-enabled pickup truck, to see what life with her will be like once she\u2019s everywhere.What I found was a mess \u2014 many non-Amazon Alexa devices aren\u2019t ready for prime time \u2014 but an inviting one. Late-night shrieks notwithstanding, one day very soon, Alexa or something like it will be everywhere \u2014 and computing will be better for it.\u201cWe had a spectacular holiday,\u201d Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, said when I called last month to chat about the assistant\u2019s future.Amazon is famously cagey about sales numbers, but Mr. Limp braved a slight disclosure: \u201cWe\u2019ve said we\u2019ve sold tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices, but I can assure you that last year we also sold tens of millions of just Echo devices. At that scale, it\u2019s safe to now call this a category.\u201dMr. Limp\u2019s distinction is confusing but important. At Amazon, Alexa lives in two places. She is part of a device category, the Echo smart speaker, which now comes in a variety of permutations, from the $49 Echo Dot to the screen-bearing Echo Show, which sells for $229. (These prices are merely guidelines; in its bid for ubiquity, Amazon often offers steep discounts, with the Dot selling for $29 during last year\u2019s holidays.)But like Google\u2019s Android operating system, Alexa is also a piece of software that Amazon makes available for free for other device makers to put into their products.Alexa is spreading so quickly that even Amazon can\u2019t keep track of it. Mr. Limp said that as he wandered the floor at the CES electronics trade show in Las Vegas this year, even he was surprised by the number of different Alexa devices.\u201cTo me, that says the strategy is working,\u201d he said.There are some costs to this strategy, which prizes speed over polish. The universe of Alexa-enabled products is shaggy. Many third-party devices get low reviews on Amazon. Many don\u2019t include some of Alexa\u2019s key functions \u2014 I tested devices that don\u2019t let you set reminders, one of the main reasons to use Alexa. Technical limitations also prevent non-Amazon devices from taking advantage of some of Alexa\u2019s best new features, like the ability to call phones or other Alexas (creating a kind of home intercom system).Mr. Limp said Amazon was aiming to fix these limitations, but conceded that its strategy necessarily led to some low-end devices. \u201cYou\u2019re right, sometimes the ramifications of this will be that some devices will be out there that aren\u2019t perfect,\u201d he said.But there are also advantages to Alexa\u2019s model for ubiquity. Imagine if you could gain access to your smartphone on just about any screen you encountered. Move from your phone to your TV to your laptop to your car, and wherever you went, you\u2019d find all your apps, contacts and data just there, accessible through the same interface.That model isn\u2019t really possible for phones. But because Alexa runs in the cloud, it allows for a wondrously device-agnostic experience. Alexa on my Echo is the same as Alexa on my TV is the same as Alexa on my Sonos speaker.And it\u2019s the same even on devices not in your home. Ford \u2014 the first of several carmakers to offer Alexa integration in its vehicles \u2014 lent me an F-150 pickup outfitted with Alexa. The experience was joyously boring: I called up Alexa while barreling down the highway, and although she was slower to respond than at home, she worked just the same. She knew my musical tastes, my shopping list, the apps and smart-home services I had installed, and just about everything else.It was the best showcase of the possibilities of always-on voice computing. In the future, wherever you go, you can expect to talk to a computer that knows you, one that can get stuff done for you without any hassle.This is not the best outcome for the future; it would be better for all of us if the next computing platform didn\u2019t come from one of the current tech giants, and if start-ups didn\u2019t have to rely on Amazon or Google for this key piece of tech.But that seems unlikely. If Alexa is headed for ubiquity, it\u2019s good that Google may be, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts in Hand, Companies Spend More on Themselves Than on Wages", "Date": "2018-02-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump promised that his tax cut would encourage companies to invest in factories, workers and wages, setting off a spending spree that would reinvigorate the American economy.Companies have announced plans for some of those investments. But so far, companies are using much of the money for something with a more narrow benefit: buying their own shares.Those so-called buybacks are good for shareholders, including the senior executives who tend to be big owners of their companies\u2019 stock. A company purchasing its own shares is a time-tested way to bolster its stock price.But the purchases can come at the expense of investments in things like hiring, research and development and building new plants \u2014 the sort of investments that directly help the overall economy. The buybacks are also most likely to worsen economic inequality because the benefits of stocks purchases flow disproportionately to the richest Americans.What companies do with the trillions of dollars they\u2019re bringing back to the United States, and the money they will save each year on their tax bills, will in large part determine whether the plan is a success or a failure.As the tax cuts kick in, companies have laid out a variety of uses for the money. Some are paying out one-time bonuses to employees. Others are raising salaries. Others plan to open new factories.In the fourth quarter, American companies\u2019 investments in things like factories and business equipment grew by 6.8 percent. That was the fastest growth rate since 2014, but far from the giant surge in capital spending that was promised ahead of the tax overhaul.But the buying back of shares is also at record levels.Almost 100 American corporations have trumpeted such plans in the past month. American companies have announced more than $178 billion in planned buybacks \u2014 the largest amount unveiled in a single quarter, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm.Such purchases reduce a company\u2019s total number of outstanding shares, giving each remaining share a slightly bigger piece of the profit pie.On Monday, Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire might be open to buy some of its shares. The remarks helped send Berkshire\u2019s stock \u2014 and the broader market \u2014 higher.\u201cI\u2019m expecting buybacks to get to a record for 2018,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m disappointed, there\u2019s a lot of people with me.\u201dThe flurry of planned buybacks has been good for the stock market. Early this month, stocks were down more than 10 percent from their January peak. The prospect of companies flooding markets with \u201cbuy\u201d orders helped the market recoup some of its losses.The broader impact on the economy is less clear. Economists believe a rising stock market benefits the economy, helping support consumer and business confidence. But the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of American households, who own 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40 percent of all stocks.Ultimately, the effect of the rising stock market depends on how those wealthy investors use their windfall. It helps the economy more, for example, if they put the money toward productive new companies than if they invest in government bonds.Companies typically decide to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories based on whether they will make the company more profitable \u2014 not merely because the companies are sitting on a pile of money that they otherwise would have paid in taxes.At a news conference Thursday, the head of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, acknowledged that many companies were spending their money on buying their own shares.\u201cRight now we\u2019re going to have an adjustment where you see probably more dividends and share buybacks than wage increases,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cBut going forward we\u2019re going to see a lot of capital formation and wage growth.\u201dThat is not what happened in 2005, when a one-time tax holiday allowed companies to repatriate money on the cheap. That plan, championed by President George W. Bush, was sold as a way to get American companies to invest more in the domestic economy.Studies have shown that the tax change lifted companies\u2019 stock prices but did not expand their American work forces.Until the early 1980s, the practice of buying shares with corporate money was considered borderline illegal because it was thought to potentially open the company up to charges of manipulating share prices.But in 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that gave the green light to most share repurchases, as long as they followed certain rules.Historically, American companies had paid out profits with a quarterly check, known as a dividend. But after the S.E.C.\u2019s rule change, companies started using more of their profits to buy their own shares, in the process giving their shareholders a bigger piece of the company.Buybacks soon soared. By 2016, the most recent year for which there is complete data, companies spent $536 billion on purchasing their own shares, according to data from S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.That was about 5 percent less than those companies spent on new plants, research and development and other investments. By contrast, 20 years ago, companies spent four times as much on such investments as they did on buybacks.\u201cWe have some causal evidence that because of short-termism companies are doing some stock repurchases that maybe they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Heitor Almeida, a professor of corporate finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s causing them to reduce investment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tiny Red Dots Took Over Your Life", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyAs the ranks of tech-industry critics have expanded, it has become harder to tell what common ground they occupy. Across various political divides, there is a sense that Facebook, Twitter and Google exert too much influence on the national discourse; closely connected to this is the widespread concern that we users have developed an unhealthful relationship with our phones, or with the apps on them. But on any more specific claim than that, consensus becomes impossible. The sudden arrival of a new class of tech skeptic, the industry apostate, has only complicated the discussion. Late last year, the co-inventor of the Facebook \u201clike,\u201d Justin Rosenstein, called it a \u201cbright ding of pseudopleasure\u201d; in January, the investment firm Jana Partners, a shareholder in Apple, wrote a letter to the company warning that its products \u201cmay be having unintentional negative consequences.\u201dAll but conjuring Oppenheimer at White Sands, these critics offer broadsides, warning about addictive design tricks and profit-driven systems eroding our humanity. But it\u2019s hard to discern a collective message in their garment-rending: Is it design that needs fixing? Tech? Capitalism? This lack of clarity may stem from the fact that these people are not ideologues but reformists. They tend to believe that companies should be more responsible \u2014 and users must be, too. But with rare exceptions, the reformists stop short of asking the uncomfortable questions: Is it possible to reform profit-driven systems that turn attention into money? In such a business, can you even separate addiction from success?Perhaps this is unfair \u2014 the reformists are trying. But while we wait for a consensus, or a plan, allow me to suggest a starting point: the dots. Little. Often red. Sometimes with numbers. Commonly seen at the corners of app icons, where they are known in the trade as badges, they are now proliferating across once-peaceful interfaces on a steep epidemic curve. They alert us to things that need to be checked: unread messages; new activities; pending software updates; announcements; unresolved problems. As they\u2019ve spread, they\u2019ve become a rare commonality in the products that we \u2014 and the remorseful technologists \u2014 are so worried about. If not the culprits, the dots are at least accessories to most of the supposed crimes of addictive app design.When platforms or services sense their users are disengaged, whether from social activities, work or merely a continued contribution to corporate profitability, dots are deployed: outside, inside, wherever they might be seen. I\u2019ve met dots that existed only to inform me of the existence of other dots, new dots, dots with almost no meaning at all; a dot on my Instagram app led me to another dot within it, which informed me that something had happened on Facebook: Someone I barely know had posted for the first time in a while. These dots are omnipresent, leading everywhere and ending nowhere. So maybe there\u2019s something to be gained by connecting them.That year, we got the very first glimpse of the iPhone\u2019s home screen, in Steve Jobs\u2019s hand, onstage at MacWorld. It showed three dots, ringed in white: 1 unread text; 5 calls or voice mail messages; 1 email. Jobs set about showing off the apps, opening them, eliminating the dots. Eventually, when the iPhone was opened to outside developers, badge use accelerated. As touch-screen phones careered toward ubiquity, and as desktop interfaces and website design and mobile operating systems huddled together around a crude and adapting set of visual metaphors, the badge was ascendant.On Windows desktop computers, they tended to be blue and lived in the lower right corner. On BlackBerrys, red, with a white asterisk in the middle. On social media, in apps and on websites, badge design was more creative, appearing as little speech bubbles or as rectangles. They make appearances on Facebook and across Google products, perhaps most notoriously on the ill-fated Google Plus social network, where blocky badges were filled with inexplicably, desperately high numbers. (This tactic has since spread, obnoxiously, to news sites and, inexplicably, to comment sections.) Android itself has remained officially unbadged, but the next version of the operating system, called Oreo, will include them by default, completing their invasion.What\u2019s so powerful about the dots is that until we investigate them, they could signify anything: a career-altering email; a reminder that Winter Sales End Soon; a match, a date, a \u201cwe need to talk.\u201d The same badge might lead to word that Grandma\u2019s in the hospital or that, according to a prerecorded voice, the home-security system you don\u2019t own is in urgent need of attention or that, for the 51st time today, someone has posted in the group chat.New and flourishing modes of socialization amount, in the most abstract terms, to the creation and reduction of dots, and the experience of their attendant joys and anxieties. Dots are deceptively, insidiously simple: They are either there or they\u2019re not; they contain a number, and that number has a value. But they imbue whatever they touch with a spirit of urgency, reminding us that behind each otherwise static icon is unfinished business. They don\u2019t so much inform us or guide us as correct us: You\u2019re looking there, but you should be looking here. They\u2019re a lawn that must be mowed. Boils that must be lanced, or at least scabs that itch to be picked. They\u2019re Bubble Wrap laid over your entire digital existence.To their credit, the big tech companies seem to be aware of the problem, at least in the narrow terms of user experience. In Google\u2019s guide for application developers, the company makes a gentle attempt to pre-empt future senseless dot deployment. \u201cDon\u2019t badge every notification, as there are cases where badges don\u2019t make sense,\u201d the company suggests. Apple, in its guidelines, seems a bit more fed up. \u201cMinimize badging,\u201d it says. \u201cDon\u2019t overwhelm users by connecting badging with a huge amount of information that changes frequently. Use it to present brief, essential information and atypical content changes that are highly likely to be of interest.\u201dThese companies know better than anyone that dots are a problem, but they also know that dots work. Late last year, a red badge burbled to the surface next to millions of iPhone users\u2019 Settings apps. It looked as though it might be an update, but it turned out to be a demand: Finish adding your credit card to Apple Pay, or the dot stays put. Apple might as well have said: Give us your credit card number, or we will annoy you until you do.The lack of consensus within the mounting resistance to Big Tech can also be found within the perimeter of the dot. After all, it\u2019s where the most dangerous conflations take place: of what we need, and what we\u2019re told we need; of what purpose our software serves to us, and us to it; of dismissal with fulfillment. The dot is where ill-gotten attention is laundered into legitimate-seeming engagement. On this, our most influential tech companies seem to agree. Maybe our self-appointed saviors can, too.John Herrman is a David Carr Fellow at The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case Against Google", "Date": "2018-02-20", "News": "FeatureCritics say the search giant is squelching competition before it begins. Should the government step in?Supported byIn the years that followed, those overlapping enthusiasms led to cohabitation, a raucous wedding and parallel careers at big technology firms. The thing is, though, when you\u2019re young and geeky and fall in love with someone else young and geeky, all your nerdy friends want you to set them up on dates as well. So Adam and Shivaun, who took Adam\u2019s last name after marriage, approached the problem like two good programmers: They designed a dating app.The app was known as MatchMate, and the idea was simple: Rather than just pairing people with similar interests, their software would put together potential mates according to an array of parameters, such as which pub they were currently standing in, and whether they had friends in common, and what movies they liked or candidates they voted for, and dozens of other factors that might be important in finding a life partner (or at least a tonight partner). The magic of MatchMate was that it could allow a user to mix variables and search for pairings within a specific group, a trick that computer scientists call parameterization. \u201cIt was like asking your best friend to set you up,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cSomeone who says, \u2018Well, you probably think you\u2019d like this guy because he\u2019s handsome, but actually you\u2019d like this other guy because he\u2019s not as good-looking, but he\u2019s really funny.\u2019\u2009\u201dWithin computer science, this kind of algorithmic alchemy is sometimes known as vertical search, and it\u2019s notoriously hard to master. Even Google, with its thousands of Ph.D.s, gets spooked by vertical-search problems. \u201cGoogle\u2019s built around horizontal search, which means if you type in \u2018What\u2019s the population of Myanmar,\u2019 then Google finds websites that include the words \u2018Myanmar\u2019 and \u2018population,\u2019 and figures out which ones are most likely to answer your question,\u201d says Neha Narula, who was a software engineer at Google before joining the M.I.T. Media Lab. You don\u2019t really care if Google sends you to Wikipedia or a news article or some other site, as long as its results are accurate and trustworthy. But, Narula says, \u201cwhen you start asking questions with only one correct answer, like, Which site has the cheapest vacuum cleaner? \u2014 that\u2019s much, much harder.\u201dFor search engines like Google, finding that one correct answer becomes particularly difficult when people have numerous parameters they want satisfied: Which vacuum cleaner is cheapest but also energy-efficient and good on thick carpets and won\u2019t scare the dog? To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.Soon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?As far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.Froogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201dAdam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.The Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.In a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.At the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.In its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201dStandard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201dIn 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201dThe Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.For decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.Consider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.What eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.The Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.\u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201dGoogle executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.One way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201dLeft unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.Shivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.As the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.But they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.Then there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201dThe more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201dTradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)Shivaun and Adam filled notepads with the names of companies that had complained about Google\u2019s tactics \u2014 eJustice, a vertical-search engine for legal information; NexTag, the fellow price-comparison site; BDZV, a group of German newspapers. They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.\u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.Google responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201dThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.Along the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.Even when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.By the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201dReback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201dIn public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.In the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.And most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201dMicrosoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.Or consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201dIt was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.The implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.\u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201dSome legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201dThose are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.Rather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.Put differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.For the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201dOne of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sublime and Scary Future of Cameras With A.I. Brains", "Date": "2018-02-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSomething strange, scary and sublime is happening to cameras, and it\u2019s going to complicate everything you knew about pictures. Cameras are getting brains.Until the past few years, just about all cameras \u2014 whether smartphones or point-and-shoots or CCTV surveillance \u2014 were like eyes disconnected from any intelligence.But all this is changing. There\u2019s a new generation of cameras that understand what they see. They\u2019re eyes connected to brains, machines that no longer just see what you put in front of them, but can act on it \u2014 creating intriguing and sometimes eerie possibilities.It doesn\u2019t take long to imagine the useful and very creepy possibilities of cameras that can decipher the world. Digital cameras brought about a revolution in photography, but until now, it was only a revolution of scale: Thanks to microchips, cameras got smaller and cheaper, and we began carrying them everywhere.The companies making these devices are aware of the privacy dangers. Many are moving into the field gingerly, slathering their products with safeguards that they say reduce the creepiness.Take Google\u2019s Clips, which I\u2019ve used for the past week and half. It\u2019s one of the most unusual devices I\u2019ve ever encountered. The camera is about the size of a tin of mints, and it has no screen. On its front, there\u2019s a lens and a button. The button takes a picture, but it\u2019s there only if you really need it.Instead, most of the time, you just rely on the camera\u2019s intuition, which has been trained to recognize facial expressions, lighting, framing and other hallmarks of nice photos. It also recognizes familiar faces \u2014 the people you\u2019re with more often are those it deems most interesting to photograph.Clips, which sells for $249, makes taking pictures unconscious and all but invisible. Carry it around wherever you go; the camera has a handy case with a big bendy clip, so it can be affixed to your jacket, set on a tabletop, carried in your palm or placed anywhere else with a view.From there, it\u2019s all A.I.Clips watches the scene, and when it sees something that looks like a compelling shot, it captures a 15-second burst picture (something like a short animated GIF or Live Photo on your iPhone).I took a trip with my family to Disneyland last week, and over two highly photographable days, I barely took a photo. Instead, this tiny device automatically did the work, capturing a couple hundred short clips of our vacation.Some of them were quite good, getting the high points of our trip in the same way I might have with my phone. Here\u2019s a clip of my son driving a car.But what was really interesting was the stuff I wouldn\u2019t have consciously captured. I got dozens of pictures like these:Aesthetically, these pictures aren\u2019t masterworks. Emotionally, they\u2019re on a higher plane. Clips caught moments of my kids goofing off and fighting in Disney\u2019s endless lines, playing catch at home, dancing like adorable maniacs \u2014 moments too spontaneous or seemingly slight for me to have caught with my camera, but that will probably paint a more accurate and edifying picture of our lives in 30 years.But you don\u2019t have to be as crazy as I am to share slivers of this fear \u2014 that your kids or your pets are constantly doing things that you\u2019ll later want to remember, but that smartphones often miss. An intelligent camera gets these times because it doesn\u2019t ask you to break the moment to capture them.But, obviously, setting up a camera that doesn\u2019t need to be specifically triggered to take a picture is problematic. It raises the worry of spying \u2014 that Google can spy on you, or that you can use it to spy on others.Google addresses that creepiness in two ways. The device is mostly unconnected from the internet. It can take pictures without a connection, and it requires your phone for viewing or saving the clips. But even then, all its A.I. happens on the device, and it doesn\u2019t even need you to have a Google account, the company said.\u201cWe spent a lot of time thinking about privacy, and making sure this was a device people would actually want,\u201d said Eva Snee, who heads Google\u2019s research on how people interact with Clips. \u201cWhat we learned was that cameras don\u2019t creep people out when they\u2019re used deliberately and the person is part of the process.\u201dClips also raises the memory of other products in this vein, including Snap\u2019s Spectacles and Google Glass, the search company\u2019s failed attempt to get consumers to use glasses that can take photos.To ensure that, Clips is designed to look like a camera. When it\u2019s on, it flashes a white LED to signal that it could be recording. It also does not record audio, because that might have felt too much like spying.Lighthouse, which I\u2019ve also used for a few weeks, is meant to be an upgrade over the internet-connected home security cameras that have become popular. Those devices can be annoying because they freak out every time they spot any movement.Lighthouse\u2019s special trick is a camera system that can sense 3-D space and learn to recognize faces \u2014 intelligence meant to avoid false alarms. It also has a nifty natural-language interface, so you can ask it straightforward questions: \u201cWhat did the kids do when I was gone?\u201d will show you clips of your kids when you were gone.Lighthouse, which sells for $299 and requires a $10 monthly subscription, feels like a work in progress. It was mostly accurate in differentiating people in my house, but it was also tripped up into thinking I had an intruder by a mylar balloon floating around my living room.The company is young, and I expect its software to improve. I can see it being of genuine use to people who wonder what\u2019s happening at home when they\u2019re away. Want to know if your dog is jumping on your couch? Ask Lighthouse; it can recognize dogs jumping around couches, and will instantly show you the clip. (Well, it can get close. I don\u2019t have a dog, so when I asked Lighthouse that question, it pulled up a clip of my kid kicking his stuffed tiger off the couch.)But what if it\u2019s your spouse, not your pooch, you\u2019re worried about? I trust my wife, but for the sake of this column, I asked the device to show me any clips of her in the house with an unfamiliar person. There she was one evening, with the babysitter, whom Lighthouse hadn\u2019t seen before.It was a case of straight-up spying on my family. But it\u2019s an obvious possibility with a camera that understands the world so well.Alex Teichman, Lighthouse\u2019s chief executive, said it could add safeguards against inter-family spying, for instance by restricting face identification only to unrecognized faces. He also pointed out that the system has numerous fine-grained privacy controls that allow you to turn off any recording when certain family members are present.I found his response credible. Both Lighthouse and Clips are well crafted against abuse. It should be noted that neither one allows for much more spying than we can already accomplish with smartphones; constant social surveillance is the norm in 2018.But they are guides to the future. Tomorrow, all cameras will have their capabilities. And they won\u2019t just watch you \u2014 they\u2019ll understand, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Google\u2019s Bosses Became \u2018Unpumped\u2019 About Uber", "Date": "2018-02-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, used to be like brothers. Google invested in Uber. The internet giant\u2019s top lawyer even served on Uber\u2019s board of directors.But that \u201cbig brother, little brother\u201d relationship deteriorated into paranoia as both companies pursued the creation of autonomous vehicles, Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former chief executive, said on Wednesday.The dissolution of Uber\u2019s relationship with Google demonstrates the finicky nature of the ties that bind \u2014 or break \u2014 tech conglomerates and promising start-ups.It\u2019s something Google understands well. Years ago, Google was tightly aligned with Apple. But the relationship soured as Google started developing smartphone software. Steve Jobs, who was Apple\u2019s chief executive, rightly believed that Google\u2019s Android would become a competitive threat to the iPhone.When Google initially invested in Uber in 2013, Larry Page, Google\u2019s chief executive at the time, and David Drummond, Alphabet\u2019s top lawyer, were mentors, Mr. Kalanick said. Alphabet remains an investor in Uber.The two companies, he said, had a \u201clittle brother, big brother\u201d dynamic because Uber was \u201ctrying to get more of their time than they were willing to give.\u201dAfter Mr. Page repeatedly spurned meetings to discuss combining Uber\u2019s ride-hailing service with Google\u2019s work on self-driving vehicles in some sort of partnership, Mr. Kalanick said, his company started to develop its own autonomous car technology.Uber hired a team of robotics experts from Carnegie Mellon University, deepening the division between the two companies.\u201cGenerally, Google was super not happy, unpumped about us doing this,\u201d said Mr. Kalanick, who stepped down as Uber\u2019s chief executive in June. He recalled that Mr. Page had been \u201cangsty\u201d and asked him: \u201cWhy are you doing my thing?\u201dAs Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Levandowski discussed ways to work together, they exchanged hundreds of text messages. The messages were presented in court on Wednesday and were mostly a variation on how important it was to win the race for self-driving cars.Mr. Kalanick said he did not recall, however, what he had meant by some of the text messages he sent to Mr. Levandowski, including one that read, \u201cBurn the village.\u201dIn another exchange, Mr. Levandowski sent Mr. Kalanick a link to a scene from the movie \u201cWall Street\u201d in which Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, argues \u201cgreed, for the lack of a better word, is good.\u201dWhen asked whether he had watched the scene, Mr. Kalanick said he thought so. His emoji response was a hint. \u201cI mean there is a winky-face there,\u201d he said.Once Uber and Otto struck a basic agreement for an acquisition in April 2016, months before the deal was announced, Mr. Kalanick told Uber executives in a meeting that \u201cgolden time is over \u2014 it\u2019s now wartime.\u201d At another meeting, he discussed how it was necessary for Uber to find and use \u201ccheat codes.\u201dMr. Kalanick explained that this phrase was not as nefarious as it sounded. Cheat codes \u201care elegant solutions to problems that haven\u2019t been thought of,\u201d he said. Tesla, for example, has customers pay tens of thousands for cars but loads those vehicles with sensors that provide data to support its self-driving car efforts.Mr. Kalanick said he had another testy conversation with Mr. Page in October 2016, after Uber announced its acquisition of Otto. Interestingly, Mr. Page was worried that Uber was developing its own flying car technology.Mr. Kalanick insisted that Uber wasn\u2019t working on flying cars, but he said Mr. Page was mad that Uber was hiring Google employees and taking its intellectual property. To which, Mr. Kalanick said, he responded, \u201cYour people are not your IP.\u201dIP is an abbreviation for intellectual property.As Uber\u2019s lawyers questioned him, Mr. Kalanick recalled how he had had so much fun as the company\u2019s chief executive. He liked \u201cbeing in the trenches\u201d with small teams. But when asked about the Otto acquisition and the hiring of Mr. Levandowski, Mr. Kalanick was understated.\u201cIt\u2019s not as great as we had thought at the beginning,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "PepsiCo Dips Its Toes Into the Sparkling Water Market", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the 1980s, the big brands battled for dominance in the cola wars.Now, a new fight is emerging: The fizzy water wars.On Thursday PepsiCo is introducing Bubly, a new brand of sparkling water that comes in eight flavors, including apple, strawberry and mango, in brightly colored cans with lowercase lettering and greetings on the pull tabs. (\u201cHey u!\u201d \u201cyo!\u201d)Bubly marks the most direct attack yet on LaCroix, a brand of flavored sparkling waters that has, in recent years, seen sales soar as it developed a near cultlike devotion among millennials.For PepsiCo, Bubly is a big bet. The beverage and snacks giant will put its formidable marketing and distribution machine behind the rollout. Bubly will land on shelves this month, and two ads will appear during the Oscars broadcast on March 4.PepsiCo executives say Bubly, with no artificial flavors, sweeteners or calories, fits into its broader corporate initiative to offer consumers healthier snack and beverage products.But it is also an acknowledgment that sales of carbonated soda are falling as consumers increasingly shun sugary drinks in favor of healthier options, including water. In 2016, bottled water sales by volume surpassed carbonated soda for the first time, according to Beverage Marketing Corporation\u2019s DrinkTell database. And volume sales for carbonated soft drinks declined for the 13th consecutive year in 2017.While Europeans have consumed sparkling water for years, the product has only recently started to catch on in the United States. Sales of domestic sparkling bottled water \u2014 not including imports like San Pellegrino \u2014 doubled between 2015 and 2017 to $8.5 billion, according to the DrinkTell database.One of the biggest beneficiaries of the surge in interest in fizzy water has been LaCroix. With its vivid, neon-colored cans and unique flavors like apricot, peach pear and pamplemousse (French for grapefruit), LaCroix has generated an avid following on Instagram and Twitter. Some websites have created cocktails, mixing various flavors of LaCroix with alcohol.LaCroix, which has been around for about 35 years, was acquired in bankruptcy proceedings in the mid-1990s by National Beverage, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. It has muddled along for years, and in regulatory filings by National Beverage, LaCroix was often mentioned far behind two other brands, Shasta and Faygo.But in recent years, sales of LaCroix have ballooned. National Beverage stock has more than doubled in the past two years.\u201cLaCroix is a fascinating story because it has been around for so long,\u201d said Gary Hemphill, the managing director of research at Beverage Marketing. \u201cIt just happened to be the right product for the right time.\u201dLaCroix\u2019s growth surge hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed on Wall Street, where some analysts predicted that National Beverage could be an acquisition target for PepsiCo, Coca-Cola or another manufacturer looking to enter the market quickly with a well-established brand. But other analysts say Nick Caporella, the 82-year-old founder and chief executive of National Beverage, who once ran a telecom and cable company and who owns 74 percent of the company\u2019s stock, has not signaled any interest in selling.National Beverage did not return a call seeking comment.Even though consumers continue to turn away from sugary, syrupy sodas, the stocks of PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are trading near historic highs, in part because they have been able to maintain or even increase pricing on soda. For PepsiCo, whose popular brands include Gatorade, Tropicana, Doritos, Lay\u2019s and Aquafina, North American beverages made up a significant amount of the company\u2019s $63 billion in revenues in 2016.Recently, PepsiCo has shown a preference toward developing new products and brands in-house. Last year, the company debuted Lifewtr, a purified water with electrolytes that was a response to the success Coca-Cola has had with its Smartwater brand.Coca-Cola acquired Smartwater as part of its acquisition of Glaceau, the maker of Vitaminwater, in 2007 for $4.1 billion. Coca-Cola also owns Dasani water, and has introduced some flavors of sparkling water.\u201cWe\u2019re confident in our ability to innovate from within,\u201d said Todd Kaplan, the vice president of the water portfolio for PepsiCo North America Beverages, who oversaw the launch of Lifewtr and, now, Bubly.While many analysts see continued strong growth for flavored sparkling water, they also note the segment will most likely get more crowded as other beverage makers and store labels fill the space.\u201cThere is going to be a lot of competition in the space from private label,\u201d said Duane Stanford, the executive editor of Beverage Digest. \u201cEvery store brand will have its version of LaCroix.\u201dThe risk is that flavored fizzy waters could eventually face the same fate as their flat bottled siblings. There, a market that became saturated with competitors selling the same thing \u2014 water \u2014 resulted in sharply lower prices and profit margins.But with Bubly, PepsiCo executives are betting consumers won\u2019t tire of flavored sparkling water anytime soon.\u201cThe category really has the wind at its back right now,\u201d Mr. Hemphill of Beverage Marketing said. \u201cThere is room for at least two key players, maybe three. The fact that LaCroix has been so successful doesn\u2019t mean there can\u2019t be room for another brand.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Let\u2019s review the week\u2019s tech news.All this got me wondering: What\u2019s the point of cable TV anymore?For a time, cutting the cord was one of those hipster affectations that came with sacrifices. A kind of asceticism was implied in the name. The cord, the familiar cable bundle of yore, required paying a whole lot for a bunch of bad TV you\u2019d never watch, just so you could have very convenient access to the handful of shows you sometimes did watch.Then along came DVDs and the internet, and now you could unbundle \u2014 you\u2019d pay a lot less for just the things you really wanted to see, provided you were O.K. hazarding some minor inconveniences.But as Netflix keeps driving trucks of money to TV\u2019s top producers \u2014 it plans to spend $8 billion on new content this year \u2014 the script has flipped. More and more, it\u2019s the people who haven\u2019t cut the cord who are missing out. Today, if you subscribe just to regular TV and don\u2019t bother with Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other online services, you\u2019re missing some of TV\u2019s biggest and most acclaimed shows. Plus, you\u2019re paying more.Cable subscriptions have been declining for years, and last year the decline accelerated. But the YouTube expansion shows that cutting the cord keeps getting easier, and the Netflix deal shows how non-cable services keep getting more attractive. This suggests an even faster pace of decline for cable. The bottom is going to fall out of the market, probably very soon.Chrome, Google\u2019s popular web browser, can now block ads. This seems weird because Google is the internet\u2019s largest advertising company. So how does an advertising company design ad-blocking software? Very, very carefully, it turns out, in a process rife with conflicts.So Google\u2019s new ad blocker is designed to block some ads, not all of them. The software will eliminate a dozen types of ads that the company deems intrusive or disruptive. But most ads, including most from Google, would skate through just fine.It\u2019s an interesting fight, but it may also be an irrelevant one. What\u2019s unclear is whether Google\u2019s limited ad blocker will stem the rising popularity of more restrictive ad blockers. For many people who hate online ads, it could already be too late for half measures.The New York Times\u2019s tech reporting team is gathering in San Francisco this week for a team-building offsite. I\u2019m looking forward to forgetting to catch Mike Isaac in a trust fall. We\u2019ll also be talking about some of the major themes we\u2019re aiming to cover in the tech world this year \u2014 artificial intelligence, crypto and the responsibility of tech companies, for example.But enough about us.

And for premium priced products in a saturated market, generating higher sales can be tough, as weak demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone X shows.\u2014 Peter EavisWith the stock market regaining much of the ground it lost after its steep sell-off earlier this month, it might seem like investors are done worrying about higher inflation.They may want to keep fretting, though.Higher inflation would lead to higher bond yields (bond investors require a larger payout to protect themselves against inflation.) In turn, the higher bond yields would make stocks look more expensive (why pay up for stocks when bond payments are increasing in value?) As a result, stocks could sell off, if the yields on bellwether bonds like the 10-year Treasury note keeps spiking.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.86 percent, from 2.87 percent on Friday. Stocks moved higher. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index closed up 1.2 percent and is now just 3.2 percent off the high it reached just before its plunge at the start of this month.\u2014 Peter EavisBut the two remain far apart on price.From the statement accompanying the letter:The Qualcomm Board believes the meeting led to further progress toward a possible negotiated transaction on key issues other than price. The Board authorized providing Broadcom with a mark-up of Broadcom\u2019s previously released draft merger agreement that, if agreed to by Broadcom, would resolve all issues between the two companies other than price.ButBroadcom reiterated in the February 23 meeting that its reduced $79.00 per share proposal is its best and final proposal. The Qualcomm Board is unanimous in its view that each of Broadcom\u2019s proposals, including its prior $82.00 per share proposal, materially undervalues Qualcomm, and the Board encourages Broadcom to enter into mutual due diligence and price negotiations.Lt.

{"Headline": "Broadcom Raises Its Qualcomm Offer to $121 Billion", "Date": "2018-02-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBroadcom raised its takeover bid for the rival chip maker Qualcomm to about $121 billion on Monday, piling pressure on Qualcomm to agree to what would be the technology industry\u2019s biggest-ever takeover and one that could affect the future of smartphones.\u201cAny rational board would consider what we\u2019ve put forward,\u201d Hock Tan, Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, said by telephone.Broadcom\u2019s move would create a tech giant whose products would be used in nearly all of the world\u2019s smartphones. Whether a deal goes ahead, however, remains an open question: Qualcomm\u2019s leadership fiercely opposes it, while analysts have said that even if shareholders approved the deal, it could be rejected on antitrust grounds.The battle underscores the growing importance of semiconductor technology to all manner of modern devices, even as the rising cost of developing computer chips winnows the number of producers to a well-heeled elite. Global chip sales surged 21.6 percent to $412.2 billion in 2017, the Semiconductor Industry Association said Monday.Qualcomm developed technology that became a foundation for all digital cellular communications, a position that allowed the company to both sell chips and charge a patent royalty for nearly all smartphones sold. That model generated an outsize flow of profits that Qualcomm poured into developing new generations of wireless chips, as well as microprocessors that handle calculations in mobile devices.Broadcom went after Qualcomm\u2019s business model on Monday in a voluminous set of slides, and has indicated it would seek to make peace with Apple, which is a major Broadcom customer for other types of wireless chips. But some major Chinese manufacturers have expressed concerns about the deal, reflecting Broadcom\u2019s track record of cutting spending on research and raising chip prices. Samsung also now appears to be siding with Qualcomm, which last week announced a new patent deal with the South Korean company and Samsung\u2019s agreement to stop opposing Qualcomm in court proceedings in the country.Qualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.For Mr. Tan, who built Broadcom over nearly a decade from a series of takeovers, Qualcomm\u2019s problems are ones that he and his team can fix \u2014 and that Qualcomm has not shown it can on its own.\u201cWe have a lot of respect for the tech and the innovation that comes with the 5G technology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we believe, given our track record, we can do much more.\u201dBroadcom did more than raise its offer price on Monday. It also pledged to pay a \u201csignificant\u201d breakup fee if regulators veto a deal, as well as to pay additional cash if the two companies have not closed a transaction a year after announcement. It also committed to other steps to closing a transaction, including selling overlapping businesses.Those moves are meant to highlight Broadcom\u2019s commitment to the deal. Such assurances may prove important, given questions among analysts and investors over whether a combination could win regulatory approval.Mr. Tan argued that Broadcom had held constructive talks with regulators around the world, and that his company had a track record of quickly closing deals. He also dismissed Qualcomm\u2019s repeated concerns about antitrust issues.\u201cBased on what Qualcomm has been spinning the last six months, they\u2019ve been short on specifics and heavy on rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Tan said.Broadcom also said that it would withdraw its offer if Qualcomm rescheduled its annual shareholder meeting from March 6, or if it paid more than the $110 a share that it has already bid for NXP.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ryan Murphy Heads to Netflix in Deal Said to Be Worth Up to $300 Million", "Date": "2018-02-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe streaming giant Netflix has won yet another battle against old Hollywood.On Tuesday night, Netflix announced that it had poached the hit-making producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox.The five-year deal is worth as much as $300 million, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. That would be one of the biggest deals ever made for a television producer.While the agreement will come as a disappointment to the studio where Mr. Murphy has spent most of his career, it also delivers a serious blow to the Walt Disney Company, which reached a deal in December to acquire most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion.Mr. Murphy\u2019s contract with Fox expires in the summer, and he will make the move to Netflix in July.The prolific producer behind \u201cGlee,\u201d \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d and the anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d Mr. Murphy would have been a key piece in the expanded Disney empire, and Fox executives made several attempts to keep him in the corporate family. Amazon also courted him seriously, which played a role in driving up the price for the 52-year-old writer, director and producer from Indianapolis.\u201cThe history of this moment is not lost on me,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in a statement. \u201cI am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me.\u201dThe moment was certainly right for someone like Mr. Murphy to find himself in the final months of a contract. The Hollywood economy is buzzing, with fast-moving digital disrupters taking on the studios that have been dependable providers of mass entertainment since the silent-movie era.The upshot is that proven show runners and big stars are in an enviable bargaining position.A factor in Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to join Netflix was the uncertainty brought on by the agreement between Disney and Fox. He had close working relationships with Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox; Dana Walden, the chairwoman of Fox\u2019s TV group (and the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children); and John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX network, a cable channel under the Fox banner.If the Disney-Fox deal wins governmental approval, as expected, it is not a sure thing that those executives will stay in their roles. Mr. Rice said at the Code Media conference on Tuesday that he didn\u2019t know whether he would remain with the company after the planned merger went through.The exclusive, five-year deal for the high-profile producer is yet another coup for Netflix. In addition to signing Ms. Rhimes last summer, the company has brought aboard Dave Chappelle, David Letterman, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler with lucrative deals.Mr. Murphy did not have his hands tied at Fox, which allowed him to push boundaries. And he did not lack for respect: The first season of the FX anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson,\u201d for which Mr. Murphy served as an executive producer, was a huge hit with critics and won nine Emmys. The Netflix deal, though, will allow him potentially bigger budgets and gives him the latitude to try movies, television or even documentaries.In his statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Murphy expressed his gratitude toward Netflix\u2019s chief executive officer, Reed Hastings; its chief content officer, Ted Sarandos; and its vice president for original content, Cindy Holland.\u201cI am awash in genuine appreciation for Ted Sarandos, Reed Hastings and Cindy Holland at Netflix for believing in me and the future of my company, which will continue to champion women, minorities and L.G.B.T.Q. heroes and heroines,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am honored and grateful to continue my partnership with my friends and peers at Fox on my existing shows.\u201dIn his own statement, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cRyan Murphy\u2019s series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history. His unfaltering dedication to excellence and to give voice to the underrepresented, to showcase a unique perspective or just to shock the hell out of us, permeates his genre-shattering work.\u201dMr. Murphy\u2019s vast slate at Fox will not disappear overnight. All future seasons of \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFeud\u201d will continue to air on FX. His procedural drama, \u201c9-1-1,\u201d which is only six weeks old and is becoming something of a sleeper hit, will continue on Fox. And his new drama about the 1980s New York vogue scene, \u201cPose,\u201d with a largely transgender cast, will proceed at FX.Mr. Murphy began his career as a journalist before moving into television script writing. His first show, \u201cPopular,\u201d on the WB, didn\u2019t last long but has become the source of cult fascination. \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d one of the earliest successes for FX, gave Mr. Murphy his first hit and transformed FX from a crusty basic cable outpost into a premier entertainment destination. In 2009, when Mr. Murphy brought some Broadway pizazz \u2014 along with an affection for misfit adolescents \u2014 to Fox\u2019s prime-time lineup with \u201cGlee,\u201d he entered the top ranks of show runners.Throughout his career, he has shown a penchant for taking the stuff of camp and making it popular. No one expected an eight-hour limited series about the rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis \u2014 \u201cFeud,\u201d on FX \u2014 to be a hit, but it was.Mr. Murphy signaled his restlessness last month, at the Television Critics Association media event in Los Angeles, when he expressed angst over his future. For years, he said, he thought he would \u201cliterally be buried on the Fox lot.\u201d Once Rupert Murdoch made the decision to sell the company, however, Mr. Murphy was not so sure.He approached Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, with a question that suggested his discomfort with his new corporate trappings:\u201cAm I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in \u2018American Horror Story\u2019?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Let\u2019s talk about tech.The HomePod reviews are in, and the verdict is: It\u2019s middling!Apple\u2019s smart speaker was originally due to ship last year. Now, after a delay and lots of speculation that it would face a rough go against Amazon\u2019s Echo, Apple\u2019s device is finally on sale.But most reviewers appraising the device this week suggested that it was best to wait. There are some interesting features in HomePod, but it has a long way to go to beat the competition.What doesn\u2019t it do well? Pretty much everything else, reviewers said. It\u2019s expensive \u2014 $349 versus $85 for an Echo. It\u2019s locked into Apple\u2019s music service, while competing systems let you play songs from a variety of sources.And most frustratingly, it\u2019s not very smart. Where Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s devices can answer a variety of questions and perform lots of different tasks (like order up an Uber or Lyft), HomePod\u2019s brain, Siri, needs evolution. Brian was particularly upset that the device kept playing music he didn\u2019t like. And for Nilay, the biggest complaint was that HomePod couldn\u2019t set two timers at once \u2014 basically table stakes in the smart speaker game.None of these are fatal. Siri is a cloud-based service, which means Apple can keep improving it from afar. Echo, too, wasn\u2019t so great to begin with. So I wouldn\u2019t count Apple out. The smart assistant war has barely started.Travis Kalanick took the stand, drank a whole lot of water, offered his thoughts on greed and Google, and introduced the world to the crazy lexicon of tech bros: \u201cunpumped,\u201d \u201cangsty\u201d and, most mysteriously of all, \u201claser is the sauce.\u201dAt the heart of the case is one question: Did Uber steal trade secrets from Waymo, Google\u2019s self-driving car spin-off, when it purchased Otto, a self-driving company founded by former employees of Waymo?The trial is expected to go on for weeks, but early on, Waymo seemed to score some wins. Kalanick conceded that during a \u201cjam sesh\u201d with Anthony Levandowski, the former Waymo engineer alleged to have stolen its secrets, he discussed the key technology at issue in the case, laser sensors. That\u2019s apparently when Kalanick jotted a note that included his conclusion that \u201claser is the sauce\u201d \u2014 it suggested Levandowski had convinced Kalanick of the importance of Waymo\u2019s tech.I\u2019m sure Uber\u2019s lawyers were unpumped about that.Here\u2019s something noteworthy from social media land. Snap and Twitter have long appeared at a disadvantage to the 800-pound social media gorilla, Facebook, and the smaller companies\u2019 financial results often proved it.There\u2019s some serious stuff here. This is the biggest rocket ever launched by a private company, and it paves the way for an even-larger rocket planned by Musk, called B.F.R., which could help realize Musk\u2019s dream of colonizing Mars. (As my colleague Kenneth Chang explained in this family-friendly newspaper about B.F.R.: \u201cThe B stands for big; the R for rocket.\u201d)But let\u2019s forget the serious stuff for a second. Look at the video of the Tesla\u2019s flight. What a world!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Settling With Uber, Waymo Faces Bigger Challenges", "Date": "2018-02-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow for Waymo, which grew out of Google\u2019s seminal autonomous vehicle project and is nearly a decade into an effort that aims to change the very nature of transportation, a much bigger fight looms outside the courtroom.Waymo\u2019s competition extends well beyond Uber \u2014 and a good part of that competition is directed by engineers it used to employ. Much of the artificial intelligence technology that has come out of Waymo\u2019s work and from research run by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is now available from other sources, making it easier for companies, even start-ups, to compete.\u201cWaymo may have a technical advantage,\u201d said Jason Doran, who helped run the delivery service Sidecar and joined General Motors when the carmaker acquired the start-up. \u201cBut they have to figure out a business model.\u201dIt is not uncommon for a tech pioneer to miss out on becoming the company that cashes in on the technology it has been working on. The industry is littered with stories of people with a great idea that someone else turned into a great business.The concept for the databases used by most of the world\u2019s big corporations came out of IBM. But another company, Oracle, turned that software into a big business. Researchers at the Silicon Valley lab of Xerox famously pioneered the technology that went into many of Apple\u2019s computers.And executives at Alphabet would certainly remember that Google was hardly the first internet search engine. It was just better than anything that came before it.Other than an ownership stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, that came with settling the lawsuit, Waymo has not made substantial money from those years of research.That is worth noting, because so many of the companies competing with Waymo are relying on the brainpower of its former employees. Dave Ferguson, a former Waymo engineer, oversees a start-up called Nuro, which is building a driverless car for shipping and delivering goods. Chris Urmson, a longtime Waymo engineer, is the chief executive of a start-up called Aurora. Brian Salesky, a third Waymo engineer, is now at Argo, an autonomous vehicle start-up backed by $1 billion in funding from Ford Motor.The question was whether he took trade secrets with him. Waymo accused Uber of conspiring with Mr. Levandowski to steal its trade secrets and feed them into a driverless car project already underway inside the ride-hailing company. With Friday\u2019s settlement, Uber has promised that its cars will operate without the help of Waymo\u2019s intellectual property.There are other issues for Waymo. Unlike Ford, General Motors or Toyota, Waymo does not manufacture and sell cars. Unlike Uber and Lyft, it does not operate a vast ride-hailing services where it could readily deploy vehicles equipped with its own self-driving technology.As the big automakers and the ride-hailing companies accelerate their self-driving projects, Waymo may need to find a way of inserting itself into these efforts or to build and operate a new self-driving service of its own.\u201cThere\u2019s the self-driving tech. But you also have to scale that tech. And you have to offer a service that people really want to use,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cYou have to get all of that right.\u201dWaymo executives were not available for interviews for this article. John Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, is scheduled to speak on Monday evening at a conference on artificial intelligence hosted by The New York Times.\u201cWaymo has the partnerships and technology needed to launch the world\u2019s first self-driving service this year,\u201d a Waymo spokesman said in a statement, pointing to how the company has fully self-driving cars on some public roads, has secured vehicles from Fiat Chrysler and has partnered with Avis, AutoNation, Lyft and others. \u201cAfter years of research and development, Waymo is now focused on operations and deployment.\u201dWhen Waymo was still operating under Google, its head start in this race was obvious. Google began testing its self-driving prototypes on public roads in 2010, and this is what set off so many other efforts.\u201cThis is profoundly important,\u201d said Mr. Urmson of Aurora, which is supplying self-driving technology to Volkswagen, Audi and Hyundai. \u201cWe can build on top of that revolution.\u201dThese techniques are spreading across the industry. And anyone can immediately tap into enormous amounts of computing power through cloud services operated by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and, yes, Google.Many car manufacturers believe they will eventually catch up because they can deploy so many more cars equipped with sensors that can record real-world activity.\u201cWhat the car companies have is the potential to harvest more data than anyone else,\u201d Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, the Silicon Valley research and development operation created by the Japanese car company, said in an interview last fall. \u201cIt may be this that matters the most.\u201dWaymo is unlikely to manufacture its own cars. But it may end up running its own self-driving service. Alphabet recently led a $1 billion investment in Lyft, and it could deploy its driverless cars through this existing ride-hailing option. Waymo is also running a private trial of its cars near Phoenix, and it has long hinted that it will offer some sort of undefined public service in the area.Operating this kind of service is no small thing, and some question whether Waymo is equipped to do so. \u201cThis is where the Ubers and the Lyfts have an advantage,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.He cautioned that the departures from Waymo may have an unintended consequence for the entire industry: Many smart people are needed in the same place to figure things out.\u201cYou need to have a lot of the best minds together to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my fears is that we have spread the field a little thin. As a result, we have actually slowed down the speed with which we can solve this problem.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz.Advertisement"}

The core index, which excludes food and energy, also came in above forecasts, prompting Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan, to describe it as \u201chotter than Hades.\u201dWhile the stock market shrugged off the jump in inflation, bond markets got a bit of a jolt. The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note rose above 2.9 percent on Wednesday, well above the 2.4 percent at which it finished last year.Indeed, the index overshot expectations because two items \u2014 clothing and medical services \u2014 had very strong increases, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. Clothing was due for a big rebound because it seemed to lag a lot in recent months, Pantheon asserted. As for medical services, the jump there came from hospital costs, which Pantheon described as \u201cvery erratic.\u201dThe analysts at Hoisington Investment Management have in recent years highlighted stubborn weaknesses in the United States economy, and the firm still sees significant problems. They note, for instance, that disposable personal incomes, adjusted for inflation, only rose by 1.9 percent last year, an increase that was supported by borrowing.

Under the agreement, Fannie sends nearly all its profits to the government in the form of a dividend and operates with a limited capital buffer.After the quarter\u2019s planned infusion, Fannie will have sent $166.4 billion to the Treasury Department in total, compared with the $119.8 billion it has received from the government, according to the WSJ.The Consumer Price Index, a government yardstick of inflation, jumped 2.1 percent in January, from a year earlier. That is slightly above the 2 percent rate that Wall Street economists, surveyed by Bloomberg, forecast. The January rate is equal to December\u2019s increase of 2.1 percent.The number didn\u2019t roil the markets, but they did move lower.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its prices, jumped to 2.87 percent after the inflation figure came out.

The E.T.P.\u2019s demise helped send CBOE\u2019s shares sliding 18 percent over the next four days amid speculation that losses like those suffered by the E.T.P.\u2019s investors could lead to greater regulatory scrutiny for the VIX going forward.The markets flyaroundMore from our colleague Cecilia Kang, who broke the story:AT&T has also asked for internal communications between Mr. Delrahim\u2019s office and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, according to two people with knowledge about company\u2019s demands.

{"Headline": "One Cause of Market Turbulence: Computer-Driven Index Funds", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA decade ago, the center of gravity on Wall Street were raucous trading desks and stock exchange floors. These days, the locus has shifted to far quieter places, where computers are in charge.The transition has been years in the making, but its effect has been on full display over the past week. After propelling the market to historic highs, passive investment strategies \u2014 which follow a simple set of rules and are carried out by sophisticated computer programs, not humans \u2014 are among the factors fueling the market\u2019s recent plunge.This is the new reality of today\u2019s stock market: Funds that track financial indexes have become a dominant force, and they can act as accelerants, adding momentum to the market\u2019s rise and fall.This week, as markets shuddered, exchange-traded index funds were responsible for 38 percent of total stock trading on some days, an astonishing figure given that these funds were just a curiosity 10 years ago. Indexing giants like BlackRock and Vanguard now own vast swaths of the market and are the largest shareholders in just about all the major companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.In many ways, this stampede toward passive investing \u2014 in which people put their money into funds that track indexes and broader market themes as opposed to relying on human stock pickers \u2014 is uncharted territory. Now the key question is how this transformed market holds up during a financial storm that lasts more than a few days.\u201cThese flows have had a big effect on the market,\u201d said Peter Tchir, a strategist at Academy Securities. \u201cAnd when people want to get out, there is a similar effect.\u201dCheaply priced exchange-traded and index funds have pumped trillions of dollars into the stock market since early 2009. They now own close to 40 percent of stocks in the United States, according to research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Unlike mutual funds, E.T.F.s are listed on public exchanges, which makes many of them very easy to trade even if the securities they hold may not be. On Thursday, for example, the second most actively traded security in the equity market was a BlackRock fund that invests in large companies in emerging markets.There was a lot to keep an eye on.BlackRock, which manages $6 trillion overall, is the leading issuer of exchange-traded funds, with $1.3 trillion under management. But as the market fell and trading in BlackRock funds accelerated, there was little sign of panic or emotion among the E.T.F. specialists at the firm.They fielded phone calls from clients and let the computers do their work.Martin Small, who oversees United States-based E.T.F.s at the firm, said the high share of E.T.F. trading was positive for the markets. That is because on days when fearful investors want to sell, large, easy-to-trade E.T.F.s serve as a critical release valve.\u201cEverything worked,\u201d Mr. Small said. \u201cVolumes were higher and more people were watching, but our funds did what they were supposed to do.\u201dInvesting on the basis of what machines, as opposed to humans, do has been a trend in financial markets for years. What\u2019s different now is that so much money has poured into a specific type of computer-driven trading.From cost-conscious millennials to the world\u2019s largest pension and sovereign wealth funds, E.T.F.s have become a preferred investment choice. In addition to all the major stock and bond indexes, they enable investors to get a piece of the action in arcane areas like junk bonds, bank loans and stocks in Pakistan. There is even an E.T.F. that tracks companies that make whiskey.The popularity of E.T.F.s has concentrated unparalleled financial power in BlackRock and Vanguard, the two biggest providers of index funds and E.T.F.s. Together, they sit on $10.5 trillion in assets and control 65 percent of the 1,700 exchange-traded funds that exist.Relying on sophisticated computer programs, they funnel investor money into the stocks and bonds that make up indexes around the world. As the flows have grown in volume, much of these funds have gone toward index heavyweights like Amazon, Apple and Facebook, pushing their valuations ever higher.Active fund managers \u2014 human stock pickers \u2014 will be marginalized, the argument goes. And that could cause harm, because they are the ones who buy when others sell. So when stocks suddenly plummet, there will be fewer funds to step in, extending the fall.An analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein even compared passive investing to Marxism, in its sweeping conformity and its degradation of the independent-minded, active investor.\u201cFor years, this has been an E.T.F. market \u2014 its robots buying stocks just as they were programmed to do,\u201d said Steven Bregman of Horizon Kinetics, a firm that hunts for undervalued stocks. \u201cBut so much money has gone into just a few hundred stocks. Everyone owns the same stuff. So when they want to get out, who are they going to sell to?\u201dCompounding these worries is the rise of algorithm-driven trading strategies at large hedge funds. They get their buy and sell signals not from a human but from indexes that measure sharp swings in the market. Earlier this week, they were big sellers when the so-called VIX index \u2014 a measure of anticipated market volatility \u2014 skyrocketed.E.T.F. proponents argue that their industry\u2019s growth is just the latest stage of the stock-indexing revolution that began in the early 1970s. That was when John C. Bogle founded Vanguard and began to launch index funds.So when stocks sank this week, he barely glanced at his trading screens. Whether the market goes up or down does not matter to him because the computers control his suite of exchange-traded funds \u2014 not him.\u201cIf the market goes down 4 percent, I don\u2019t even care,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cThat is the beauty of systems. Once you build it, there is literally nothing left to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should You Get a Cheaper Phone? Be Sure to Look Into the Camera", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixThe evolution of the smartphone can be summed up by two trends: Phones just keep getting bigger. They are also getting pricier.Rising prices make the smartphone one of the most expensive household products. But unlike televisions, which plummet in price and attract bargain hunters, many consumers are willing to up their spending on phones.\u201cThey become more and more essential to people\u2019s everyday life, so price sensitivity just continues to erode,\u201d said Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm.And there\u2019s a silver lining for those who want to spend less: Cheaper smartphones have never been better. If you spend between $200 and $300, you can get a capable, fast smartphone for basic tasks like placing calls, using maps and sending texts. Of course, there are trade-offs, like lower-quality screens and less impressive cameras.Is a budget phone right for you? Here\u2019s an overview on the pros and cons of going cheap, with some phone recommendations from Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests products.Let\u2019s start with the downsides of buying a cheaper phone.\u25a0 You won\u2019t get the best camera. Budget phones lack the advanced camera sensors found on high-end smartphones. So if you go cheap, your phone camera probably won\u2019t be very fast, won\u2019t do a great job at taking photos in low light and will lack features like optical image stabilization, which helps photos remain clear even when your hands are shaky. \u201dThe camera is a big one,\u201d said Andrew Cunningham, a Wirecutter editor. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking photos, especially in low light, performance is going to fall off a cliff.\u201d\u25a0 Obviously, you won\u2019t get cutting-edge features like the infrared face recognition system on the iPhone X or the fancy stylus on Samsung\u2019s big-screen Galaxy Note. You also won\u2019t get the fastest computing processor, so your phone won\u2019t be as capable of running games with heavy graphics.\u25a0 You also won\u2019t get the brightest and most vibrant display. The fanciest smartphones have OLED screens, which have better color accuracy and contrast.\u25a0 You won\u2019t get many software updates, which are important because they introduce new features and security enhancements. For phone makers, the priority is issuing big software updates to more powerful smartphones. At best, with a cheap Android phone you will probably get one major software update and a few security updates over 18 months.With all that said, there are plenty of benefits to buying a good budget phone.\u25a0 You will get a decent camera. Many cheaper phones have high-resolution sensors that can take clear, rich photos. \u201cA cheap phone today is going to have a better camera than a cheap phone from three years ago,\u201d said Nathan Edwards, a senior editor for Wirecutter. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re truly awful.\u201d\u25a0 You\u2019ll get a good enough screen for reading websites, watching videos and looking at photos. Budget phones still use LCD, an older display technology that has greatly matured and still looks quite good.\u25a0 Your phone will be fast enough for important tasks like placing calls, sending and receiving email, browsing the web and running lightweight apps. If you aren\u2019t an app-aholic or a gamer, maybe that is all you will need.So here\u2019s the upshot. There is a strong argument for spending more on your smartphone: If it is your most important technology tool for work and play, you should probably invest in a superior device. But if you want a phone only for basic tasks and you\u2019re not in a hurry to adopt the latest and greatest technology, a cheaper phone may serve you well.\u201cA lot of things you\u2019d have to pay 600 or 700 bucks for three or four years ago, you\u2019ll get for $200 or less now,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said. \u201cIf you just want the basics, a budget phone is going to do just fine for most people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is the Perfect Color Worth?", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureThat day, as the team decided on colors for Spring/Summer 2019, the theme was love. It was a balmy May morning, but Shah, with thin graying hair and glasses, was dressed in a navy blue buttoned sweater with a thick scarf wrapped loosely around his neck. He frequently interrupted with questions as the handpicked members of his team took turns presenting \u201cmood boards\u201d they had brought with them. Like oversize pages from a scrapbook, these displays included photographs, drawings, artworks, ribbons, textiles, paint samples, bits of plastic, lengths of rope, tourist tchotchkes and, in one instance, a piece of frilly lingerie.There were spirited, far-ranging discussions of art, film, music, theater, books, fashion, museum exhibitions and advertising \u2014 anything that might hint, even remotely, at where color was headed. Amid the clamor of voices, Shah asked an American forecaster in the room to give the view from across the Atlantic.\u201cWhat is the zeitgeist going on in the United States about color?\u201d Shah asked. \u201cAre they big colors? Are they strong colors? Prime colors?\u201d\u201cI think what\u2019s going on in the United States now is that it\u2019s all happening,\u201d the woman replied. \u201cIt\u2019s almost reflective of the conflict going on around us \u2014 where you\u2019re not having one definite color correction, but you\u2019re seeing examples in various areas. I think it\u2019s mostly about mixes.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s not about solids,\u201d Shah said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you put colors together?\u201d\u201cExactly, and different from what it\u2019s been before,\u201d the woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a counterculture type of a feeling \u2014 you deliberately use colors that would not ordinarily work together.\u201d\u201cAccidental colors,\u201d Shah said, coining a phrase.\u201cThat\u2019s a good way of putting it, yes,\u201d the woman agreed.The conclave broke for lunch, and Shah walked around the table alone, scratching his chin and muttering to himself while sorting mood boards into piles of similar colors \u2014 \u201cediting,\u201d he said. Occasionally he would wince at having mislaid a board, then pick it up again and set it down someplace else. He worked hurriedly, and by the time the others returned from their meals, he was finished, having arranged the materials into precise groups from which the winning shades could be selected. That afternoon, he and his collaborators finalized the palettes. In six weeks, the forecast would be available to anyone interested enough to part with $795.Color forecasters like Shah and his team at Pantone have tremendous influence over the visible elements of the global economy \u2014 the parts of it that are designed, manufactured and purchased \u2014 though their profession itself is all but invisible. If you\u2019re familiar with color forecasting at all, it\u2019s most likely thanks to a scene in the 2006 film \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d in which the fashion-magazine mandarin Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, explains to her young, fashion-skeptical assistant why the assistant, played by Anne Hathaway, happens to be wearing a sweater in a very particular shade of blue known as cerulean. Cerulean, Priestly explains, first showed itself a few years earlier in a collection by Oscar de la Renta and was soon adopted by a number of other influential designers before it \u201cfiltered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner, where you no doubt fished it out of some clearance bin,\u201d she says.\u201cThat blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sort of comical how you think that you\u2019ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you\u2019re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room.\u201d In reality, it was selected by Pantone. Six years before the release of \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d Pantone\u2019s forecasters named cerulean the company\u2019s first-ever Color of the Year.In the nearly two decades since then, as digital design and social media have expanded the ranks of color obsessives, Pantone has become not just a company but a sensation, its brand bestriding the globe like a behemoth. Its color forecasts, too, have retained their reputation as some of the most influential in the world, even as the field of competitors has grown crowded \u2014 not just with other companies but, thanks to the internet, with people on social-networking sites like Tumblr and Pinterest who have a knack for spotting color trends and enough followers to matter. For the class of fashion and industrial designers who make up Pantone\u2019s customer base, picking the right color \u2014 and exactly the right shade of that color \u2014 can feel like one of the most important decisions they\u2019ll make all year. Companies will pay almost anything to get it right, and the rarefied, vaguely mystical art of doing just that happens to be Pantone\u2019s business.More discoveries soon followed: magenta, Hofmann\u2019s violet, Lyons blue, malachite green, Bismarck brown and aniline black. By the 1880s, dye houses in Germany, which was by then the center of the chemical industry, and French textile mills were issuing seasonal color cards and ribbon samples of various synthetic shades. When the outbreak of World War I cut off the supply of German dyestuffs, threatening the color industry with collapse, a consortium of American mills and manufacturers formed the Textile Color Card Association, which developed the first industrywide color library and trend forecast, based solely on dyes that could be manufactured domestically. After the armistice, the group continued to be a hub for the best intelligence on color trends emanating from Europe\u2019s fashion capitals and, in 1955, renamed itself the Color Association of the United States. Similar organizations soon took form in other countries around the world.The modern color industry had arrived, if only in a confined sort of way. Born out of the fashion business, it remained rooted there for decades even as it exerted powerful influence on distant parts of the consumer economy, such as the automotive and home-furnishings sectors. But at the turn of the millennium, the color industry\u2019s center of gravity shifted seemingly overnight with a big bang in the field of industrial design: the release, in 1998, of Apple\u2019s iMac G3 desktop computer.Available in 11 translucent shades, from Bondi Blue to Tangerine, the iMac ushered in a new era in which consumers began to value everyday purchases not strictly, or even primarily, for their utility but as a form of self-expression. \u201cThat colorful plastic was everywhere in industrial design for the next several years,\u201d Virginia Postrel, the author of several books on aesthetics, told me. \u201cNot just consumer electronics but all sorts of ordinary objects like irons and trash cans. It was an easy and cheap way to make things look fun and fresh.\u201d Eventually, the enthusiasm faded; Apple itself shifted its palette to neutral whites, blacks and silvers. But the larger idea that the iMac inaugurated \u2014 namely that color choices are serious business and can determine the success or failure of any product in any industry \u2014 continues to ripple through the marketplace.Steve Jobs\u2019s revolution in commercial aesthetics would have been impossible without another one that occurred 35 years earlier. A nagging problem had troubled the color industry from its inception: how to communicate accurately the subtleties of perception. In his 1963 book, \u201cInteraction of Color,\u201d the Bauhaus artist and Yale professor Josef Albers wrote: \u201cIf one says \u2018Red\u2019 (the name of a color) and there are 50 people listening, it can be expected that there will be 50 reds in their minds. And one can be sure that all these reds will be very different.\u201d There are innumerable colors, he continued, but only about 30 names for them. And even if you could describe all of those colors, wouldn\u2019t your sense of them still differ from someone else\u2019s? As the British journalist Kassia St. Clair writes in \u201cThe Secret Lives of Color,\u201d \u201cYou could no more meaningfully secure a precise universal definition for all the known shades than you could plot the coordinates of a dream.\u201dThe man who came closest to doing just that was Lawrence Herbert. In 1956, Herbert, who had recently graduated with a degree in biology and chemistry from Hofstra University on Long Island, took a job as a press operator and color matcher at M\u2009&\u2009J Levine, a New York-based advertising firm and the parent company of a small printing concern called Pantone Press. As the company\u2019s founders turned to other lines of business, Herbert took over the printing division and in a few short years, pioneered a cheaper, more accurate printing method that allowed him to produce a full spectrum of colors from 10 basic pigments. Not long after that, he bought out the company\u2019s printing unit, along with its name, and in 1963 introduced the Pantone Matching System.Herbert\u2019s system was at once transformative and elegantly simple. It measured precisely the mixture of pigments necessary to produce a specific shade, each of which was assigned a reference number. Pantone then compiled the colors and numbers into books. Rather than provide inks directly, it sold the means by which a printer could faithfully and consistently reproduce any color in Pantone\u2019s library. In doing so, Herbert tamed color\u2019s mysterious nature and turned it into a commodity, in essence quantifying what had until then been unquantifiable.Pantone and its parent company, X-Rite \u2014 a maker of color-management systems and software that acquired Pantone in 2007 \u2014 now have 17 offices and production facilities around the world and offer products used by 10 million designers and manufacturers every day. Pantone\u2019s color library, which continues to grow by the year, contains roughly 10,000 unique shades. The company\u2019s expansion has been helped along by globalization and the offshoring of manufacturing. With designers in Europe, say, marketers in the United States and factories in China, a company can easily communicate color choices up and down the supply chain, so long as everyone involved references the same Pantone chip \u2014 Albers\u2019s 50 reds reduced to one.I met Beverly Bell, Pantone\u2019s manager of color and quality standards for textiles, in a dimly lit room adjacent to the factory floor. Nearby, an employee in a white lab coat was standing at a countertop light box, checking a fresh batch of cotton-based color standards for flaws. The box emits D65 light, which, Bell said, simulates the midday sun in Western Europe \u2014 supposedly the purest possible illumination and the industry standard for assessing color.Such exacting controls are in place at every stage of production. Cotton swatches, for example, after being dyed, are conditioned overnight in a machine that exposes them to D65 light and a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit at 50 percent humidity. Afterward, they are measured with a spectrophotometer, which compares colors against the Pantone standard with hyperaccuracy. If they pass inspection, the swatches are then hermetically sealed inside plastic, ultraviolet-resistant envelopes, which protect against fading. Colors applied to paper and plastic undergo similar testing.The final quality safeguard is the human eye. Every Pantone employee is required to pass an annual exam called the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Color Vision Test. The test taker has to arrange four rows of samples, 85 in all, into descending order based on their shade. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s actually working with color has to get a \u2018superior\u2019 rating,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo that means no more than three errors.\u201d That morning, trying my luck on a blue/purple row, I made only one mistake, and might have congratulated myself had Bell not already told me that Pantone\u2019s reigning color-test champion, a woman named Madlin Tadros, who works in the textiles department, has never erred in 21 years.The unremarkable appearance of Pantone\u2019s offices belies the excitement the brand engenders around the world. Designers, regardless of their industry, always seem to have Pantone\u2019s color books within reach, like some sacred text of a secret society. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you look at it,\u201d an interior designer told me. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine working with anything else.\u201d The company\u2019s color standards are often employed by exacting obsessives for decidedly off-label purposes too. A fish company recently enlisted Pantone to assist with a guide for sushi freshness. And Calvin Klein, according to Lisa Marsh\u2019s 2004 book, \u201cThe House of Klein,\u201d used to keep a Pantone chip taped to the wall next to the office coffee maker \u201cto ensure he\u2019d get just the right mix of coffee and milk every time.\u201dIn the past decade, Pantone has become a consumer brand in its own right: It now licenses clothes, shoes, cosmetics, kitchenware, furniture, cellphones, jigsaw puzzles, children\u2019s books, skateboards, key chains and thumb drives, in Pantone colors and bearing its logo. Pantone does not report financial information, but Fast Company wrote in 2015 that a full 15 percent of its millions of dollars in annual revenue now derives from commercial licensing.And the cult of Pantone extends far beyond the company\u2019s own merchandise. An online fan club of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for example, has taken to calling itself by the team\u2019s official shade of blue, Pantone 294. An authorized Pantone-themed boutique hotel in Brussels immerses its guests in a kaleidoscopic array of colors, right down to their bedspreads and coffee mugs. Several Instagram users, each with tens of thousands of followers, regularly pair their photographs with the corresponding Pantone chips, and a Brazilian photographer named Ang\u00e9lica Dass has made portraits of more than 3,000 people in 13 countries, all sorted by skin color according to the Pantone Matching System.This alchemy of color chips into cultural cachet is largely the work of Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, a small in-house consultancy, founded in 1986. A native New Yorker with shoulder-length brown hair, Pressman arrived at Pantone nearly 20 years ago, shortly after the color industry\u2019s iMac-inaugurated big bang, and since then has worked to make Pantone a household name. Her division produces several seasonal forecasts, as well as a magazine called Viewpoint Colour, which anticipate trends up to three years in advance. It has also helped brands \u2014 from Tiffany and Victoria\u2019s Secret to Barbie, Schweppes and the Royal Mail in Britain \u2014 develop proprietary shades. On the day I visited, Pressman showed me an uncut sheet of soon-to-be-released Pantone chips for Love Symbol No.2, a shade adapted from the purple paint on one of Prince\u2019s favorite pianos and commissioned by his estate after his death.That a company engaged in the manufacture of something so intangible \u2014 and, for most consumers, so useless \u2014 as color standards could develop a widespread and devoted following among people far removed from its intended clientele speaks to a larger cultural phenomenon: a growing popular enthusiasm for color in its own right and for its own sake, free of the constraints of form or function. Color\u2019s liberation owes much to the rise of the internet, particularly the explosion of photo sharing on social media. As this digital revolution took shape, Pantone found itself perfectly positioned to exploit it. \u201cPantone did not create desire for color,\u201d said Ellen Sideri, founder and chief executive of ESP TrendLab in the garment district in New York. \u201cIt has, though, facilitated the use of color globally by creating a common digital color language.\u201d A result is that \u201cour culture has become supervisual, and more than ever before. Color has become a definer of many things.\u201dEach December for nearly two decades, the Pantone Color Institute has tried to capture the moment in the form of its Color of the Year, which it has described as \u201ca color snapshot of what we see taking place in our global culture that serves as an expression of a mood and an attitude.\u201d This year\u2019s pick is Ultra Violet (18-3838), a bluish purple that, the company asserts, is associated with the counterculture, nonconformity, mindfulness and visionary thinking, and that \u201csuggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead and the discoveries beyond where we are now.\u201d The release of the Color of the Year occasions a media frenzy and, after it, a torrent of bandwagon-hopping service journalism: For months after this year\u2019s selection, Google Alerts continued to crowd my inbox with articles suggesting how I might use Ultra Violet to update my wardrobe, redecorate my living room, create floral bouquets or crochet a scarf. A Swedish art director created a recipe for an Ultra Violet-colored smoothie.Sometimes Pantone\u2019s pick validates an established trend, as Rose Quartz (13-1520) did for the shade popularly known as Millennial Pink in 2016 \u2014 about as risky a choice as the N.B.A.\u2019s picking LeBron James for Most Valuable Player. In other cases, like Ultra Violet, the company has treaded nearer to the leading edge, more a demonstration of power, perhaps, than astuteness. \u201cThe actual tones themselves I\u2019ve not loved,\u201d Jane Monnington Boddy, the London-based color director at WGSN, a tracker of global fashion trends, told me. But over all, she said, she was impressed with \u201cthe philosophy behind them and how they\u2019ve captured what\u2019s happening in life.\u201dThe Pantone Color Institute is less the elite unit its name implies than a loose network of specialists drawn from Pressman\u2019s contacts. They live in roughly 20 countries and travel the world, she told me, from the established fashion capitals of Europe to other \u201ctrend forward\u201d cities like Shanghai, Buenos Aires, Melbourne and Cape Town, scouring the fashion, technology, houseware, home-furnishing and automotive industries for glimmers of nascent color trends. \u201cI\u2019m very circumspect about who I bring in,\u201d Pressman told me. \u201cThat person has to be of a certain caliber.\u201dI visited Eiseman in July, when she was teaching her annual class on trend forecasting and color psychology at the Bainbridge Island Museum of Art, and she allowed me to sit in. When I met her at the museum, Eiseman, with her thick-framed glasses, jewelry and bobbed, sandy blond hair, bore more than a passing resemblance to Anna Wintour. Her long-sleeved shirt and patterned pants, precisely coordinated, offered an eye-catching blend of oranges, greens and blues, as if she meant her attire to double as a kind of couture business card.I sat in the back row of a classroom on the museum\u2019s second floor and watched her students file in. There were two dozen of them, most in their 20s or 30s, all but one of them women. Rami Kim, the founder of a color institute in Seoul who was on her third pilgrimage to Bainbridge, had brought along seven other South Koreans. Sitting to my right was a former nurse from South Africa, now an interior designer, who said she was hoping to learn more about color combinations, and to my left, a young woman who worked for a small family-owned party-supply company, who told me she was interested in the application of color to edible paper. The lone man in the class was a software engineer contemplating a change of careers to something \u201cmore creative.\u201d All the students paid $1,775 for the privilege of being there, and several of them spoke of their instructor with a respect bordering on reverence. \u201cThere\u2019s no one who can talk about color like she can,\u201d one of them told me.Promptly at 8 a.m., Eiseman switched off the lights and asked a student to close the blinds. \u201cThe colors will be more vibrant if we get more darkness,\u201d she said. For the next six hours, clicking through illustrative photographs from her travels to more than 60 countries, Eiseman delivered a cascade of assertions: Kids everywhere in the world gravitate to red, blue and yellow crayons; people living near the Equator tend to prefer brighter colors; readers have better recall if texts are printed in something other than black and white; gamblers place higher bets under red lights than under blue ones; there was no word for the color \u201corange\u201d in Europe until the fruit arrived sometime in the Middle Ages; blue shutters in the American southwest are meant to ward off evil spirits; many fire departments have begun painting their engines yellow-green because red, the traditional color, too often appears brown in twilight. At one point, when Eiseman paused to take questions, a young woman raised her hand.\u201cAre there people you can\u2019t teach color to, people who just don\u2019t get it?\u201d she asked.Eiseman thought for a moment, and said, \u201cYou get resistance from people when you\u2019re working, people who think that color is immaterial, not as important as everything else, but you can usually find something to talk about in their background, mostly coming out of their childhood, that will trigger a response.\u201dThe idea that colors exert powerful, often subliminal forces on the human mind is at once Eiseman\u2019s ardent belief and her professional stock in trade. As she wrote 18 years ago in \u201cPantone Guide to Communicating With Color,\u201d \u201csome experts believe that humans have an \u2018ancient wisdom,\u2019 that throughout eons of evolutionary history going back to the beginning of time, we have an associative memory concerning space, form, patterns and colors.\u201d Leveraging that wisdom and revealing the unspoken meanings and emotions conveyed by slight, almost imperceptible variations in color has been her life\u2019s work.Eiseman was born and raised in Baltimore. As a teenager, she dabbled in modeling and won a voice scholarship to the Peabody Institute, but turned it down after deciding against pursuing a career in music. A few years later she met Herb Eiseman, her future husband, a Hollywood talent agent who went on to lead the music publishing division at 20th Century Fox. The couple married and moved to the Los Angeles area, where Eiseman finished her bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology at Antioch University and, afterward, earned a counseling certificate from U.C.L.A. She and Herb had two children, and while they were in school, Eiseman began teaching classes part time at an occupational-training center for women in the San Fernando Valley.It was there that she began thinking systematically about color. \u201cThe concept that I developed was called the \u2018color clock,\u2019 and it was based on color as it appears in nature,\u201d she told me. \u201cHow Monet painted the haystacks, various things at various times of day, and how the color seemed to change because of the light.\u201d She applied the idea to women\u2019s clothes and cosmetics, \u201cusing my students as guinea pigs to see if it really held weight.\u201dIn 1983, she published a book called \u201cAlive With Color.\u201d Soon, she was fielding phone calls asking her to weigh in on the color of everything from living rooms to medical equipment. One caller was Pantone\u2019s Larry Herbert, who invited her to meet with him in New York. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know Pantone existed,\u201d she said. It turned out that Herbert, who\u2019d seen her book, was on the hunt for someone with expertise in the psychology of color, in part to help elevate his company\u2019s public profile. Eiseman jumped at the chance, and 33 years later, she\u2019s still Pantone\u2019s ambassador at large.Eiseman believes that our reaction to colors \u201cgoes beyond the psychological into the physiological\u201d and that colors carry inherent messages that all humans innately understand \u2014 the whispers of that \u201cancient wisdom.\u201d She doesn\u2019t deny the important influence of memory and social factors on color perception, but often, she says, \u201cour response is involuntary, and we simply have no control over it.\u201d As evidence, she points to word-association tests she has administered over the years during her work with Pantone. I asked to see a sample test and some results, but Eiseman refused and said they were proprietary. You can get a feel for her methods, though, from a 2015 interview she gave to Nautilus magazine. \u201cYou take a Pantone color chip and you ask, \u2018Give us the first word that pops into your mind when you look at this color,\u2019 and you see whether that corresponds to a positive, negative or indifferent response,\u201d Eiseman said. \u201cIf you show people a chip of Pantone Sky Blue, about 90 percent or more will respond in the same way: It\u2019s the color of the sky, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s a light color, it reminds you of that openness. It\u2019s a near-universal response that you get.\u201dYep, that\u2019s me down to the ground, I thought as I read it. But what about people who don\u2019t like blue? \u201cPerhaps you want to change your job, a relationship or even your life, and long for more excitement,\u201d Eiseman writes. \u201cYou wish that you were wealthy or brilliant (or both), because that would enable you to have all the good things in life without working so hard.\u201dAll that from a color? And the fortunetelling continues. Do you like green? \u201cYou are the good citizen, concerned parent, involved neighbor, the joiner of clubs and organizations.\u201d Have an aversion to red? You may be \u201cirritable, exhausted or bothered by many problems.\u201d Yellow? \u201cYou are optimistic, hopeful and encourage others to do their best.\u201d Perhaps strangest of all, though, is Eiseman\u2019s observation about those of us who dislike blue-green shades like turquoise or teal: \u201cA little voice inside you (was it your mother, your father or your roommate?) keeps telling you to clean up your room.\u201dThe flip tone of these pronouncements, combined with the lack of any grounding in scientific rigor or research apart from Eiseman\u2019s own observations, may tempt you to dismiss color psychology altogether, consigning it to the bin with other junk sciences, like phrenology or cold fusion. But a great many people take it seriously \u2014 so many, in fact, that for all my searching, I found only one person willing to question it. When I put Eiseman\u2019s assertions to David Comberg, a senior lecturer of design at the University of Pennsylvania, he scoffed and said that color preferences are highly subjective, unpredictable and, in his experience, \u201cprimarily influenced by culture and emotion and are not easily quantified.\u201d When we see red, for instance, are we reacting to the color itself or to a personal experience, perhaps buried in the subconscious, that we associate with it? \u201cAnd what about taste, smell and sound? Artificial intelligence and neuroscience may one day answer all this, but I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Comberg said. \u201cIt all seems subjective and irrational.\u201dBut among people in Eiseman\u2019s profession, as with the hordes of credulous color enthusiasts who populate the internet, her views are not only uncontroversial but well within the mainstream. \u201cWe are born to understand that green equals calming, because it\u2019s found in nature; red equals danger, because it\u2019s the color of blood,\u201d Jenny Ross, a creative- design manager in the footwear department at New Balance, told me. \u201cYellow equals energy, because it\u2019s the color of the sun.\u201d WGSN\u2019s Jane Monnington Boddy agreed, saying, \u201cPeople do have an inbuilt, preprogrammed understanding of colors, as animals do in nature.\u201d What else explains our instinct to recoil from red-and-black snakes, she asked, or from yellow-and-black flying insects?Ultimately, though, whether blue makes you think of the sky or Papa Smurf, by this point, color psychology may matter less to Pantone\u2019s success than something much less mysterious. \u201cHow do you sell color?\u201d David Shah had asked me rhetorically when I met him in London. \u201cYou can be 10 times cleverer than me. You can be much more intelligent, much more creative. But it\u2019s Pantone, with a million Instagram followers. If you\u2019re hidden away, even though your color is better, you don\u2019t win the argument.\u201dAt a certain point, Pantone\u2019s prognostications began to take on the weight of self-fulfilling prophecies. Much like investors who base financial decisions on the assessments of Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s, Pantone\u2019s clientele seems to understand that, for all the time and effort the company expends in identifying color trends, it\u2019s the judgments themselves, regardless of the research behind them, that matter most. \u201cBecause of our platform, we\u2019re able to promote,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s self-perpetuating \u2014 when people believe you\u2019re right, they buy you. You get to be right!\u201dWhen I brought up the Color of the Year, Shah trod carefully at first \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything about what I think about this, O.K.?\u201d \u2014 then went on: \u201cYou might go: \u2018Oh, my God! That\u2019s the most awful color in the world! Who would choose it?\u2019 And then you\u2019re like, \u2018I better be careful, because it\u2019s the Pantone Color of the Year, and everybody\u2019s looking at it, and if I don\u2019t, I could be left out.\u2019 When you\u2019ve got a platform like that, you can say it\u2019s the color of my toenails! Can I afford not to do it, even if I don\u2019t believe in it? It\u2019s a lot of smoke and mirrors.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the ownership of Pantone. Pantone is a subsidiary of X-Rite, Inc.; it is not a privately owned company.Bruce Falconer, formerly an editor at The Atlantic and a reporter for Mother Jones, is the senior editor of The American Scholar. This is his first article for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What I Learned from Watching My iPad\u2019s Slow Death", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyMy old iPad just turned five, and it\u2019s starting to die. If it could wonder about such things, it might question this prognosis. Its memory, after all, still retrieves information as quickly as it ever did. Its face hasn\u2019t aged a day, projecting as vividly as it did in 2012, when Apple called it \u201cstunning\u201d and \u201cgorgeous.\u201d It hasn\u2019t suffered vision loss; the camera still works. The touch-screen works. Buttons work. Speaker, headphone jack, charging port: All still do what I ask of them. On examination, almost nothing about the device seems to have changed. And yet it\u2019s starting to give up, and so am I.It hasn\u2019t been used up; it\u2019s just too old. A pristine iPad from the same era, forgotten in a storeroom and never touched, would be equally useless. The moment it came online, it would demand to be updated; as soon as it was, it would find itself in the same grim predicament as my device, which has been at work for half a decade.Fifteen years ago, before I would replace a desktop computer or a laptop, it would have quite conspicuously broken down, its fans getting louder, its spinning hard drive grinding to a halt. When I would replace it with something newer or faster or more capable, it would enter a promising second life: it could be repurposed as a spare, a computer for a friend, a terminal for playing old games or for doing undistracted work. It could be given to someone who could make use of it.As I did when I first got it, I still use my old iPad for passive consumption: reading, watching videos, checking feeds. My routine has barely changed, but one by one, formerly easy tasks have become strained. Social apps have become slow, videos take longer to load and Safari can\u2019t seem to handle the most important and fundamental services of the modern web.As my iPad has aged, I\u2019ve started to notice it more, not because I\u2019m growing fonder, but because I\u2019m getting frustrated: by the fact that it won\u2019t do what it ought to or even what it used to. But what I find most frustrating of all is the gradual disappearance of all options other than buying a new iPad. I understand the reasons for this. I understand the concept of \u201cplanned obsolescence\u201d less as a conspiracy than as the unfortunate but universal prerogative of dominant, profit-driven companies that make their money from selling hardware.In a world more accommodating toward my old iPad, I might squeeze another five years out of it by replacing the one part of these devices that tends to fail: the battery. I could purchase a kit from a site like iFixit, with a fresh battery and tools to pry my iPad apart, for $39.99. But the repair is quite involved and requires, among 71 other steps, heating up the device in order to pry its screen free of its glue. I could send it to Apple, which says out-of-warranty iPad battery service is $99 plus $6.95 in shipping plus local taxes, which totals more than I would get if I sent it to an Apple partner called Brightstar to be \u201crecycled\u201d: a $45 gift card to the Apple store. Lower down the rung is Gazelle, a company that buys old devices and resells them, often abroad. A tool on their website offered me $30, conditionally.Perhaps the best option is to sell my old iPad overseas to a consumer who understands what it is: not quite an iPad, but nevertheless a machine that will still chat, that will manage FaceTime, that can receive email or maybe take payments for a shop. But before long, it will lose the ability to do these things. It will still be a wonder of industrial design and a technological marvel, right up until the moment it is destroyed for scrap.John Herrman is a David Carr Fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon and Apple Gush Over Holiday Sales", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 For Apple and Amazon, the holidays are the time to shine, the period when shoppers have the greatest appetite to buy their devices and, in Amazon\u2019s case, anything else that can be stuffed into a box and delivered to homes.During the final few months of last year, neither disappointed.\u201cOur 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,\u201d Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said. \"We don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often \u2014 expect us to double down.\u201dAmazon, a company once known for routinely posting losses, more than doubled its profit thanks to strong growth in its cloud computing division and a newer business for the company \u2014 advertising. It also benefited from a large gain resulting from changes to the United States tax code.For the quarter that ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, net income rose to $1.86 billion, the highest profit in its history and more than double the $749 million from a year earlier. A big part of the increase, $789 million, came from the tax benefit. Revenue jumped 38 percent to $60.45 billion from a year earlier.Amazon\u2019s shares soared nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the results. \u201cAmazon\u2019s best-in-class large-cap growth story remains unchanged,\u201d Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, wrote in a research report.While Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter.Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier.By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion.Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices.Apple, in contrast, is without equal in making profits from tech hardware.For the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter.\u201cCustomer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call.Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones.The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones.Apple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps.Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units.But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season.Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that in light of the new tax code, the company would announce plans for its repatriated cash, including dividends and buybacks, in April.Nick Wingfield reported from Seattle, and Brian X. Chen from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of Woke Capital", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are not two stories, though; they\u2019re different aspects of the same one. Corporate activism on social issues isn\u2019t in tension with corporate self-interest on tax policy and corporate stinginess in paychecks. Rather, the activism increasingly exists to protect the self-interest and the stinginess \u2014 to justify the ways of C.E.O.s to cultural power brokers, so that those same power brokers will leave them alone (and forgive their support for Trump\u2019s economic agenda) in realms that matter more to the corporate bottom line.Over time, though, free trade and globalization and deindustrialization made that postwar system less economically viable; the decline of labor and the collapse of the New Deal coalition made it less politically necessary; and the cultural revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s made its implicit moral values (heteronormativity for workers, a kind of penny-pinching puritanism for bosses) seem less congenial and more oppressive. And so we entered a period of corporate hegemony in both political parties, with fewer political compromises required for doing business.But there are other ways to compromise besides on wages, and at an accelerating pace our corporate class is trying to negotiate a different kind of peace, a different deal from the one they struck with New Deal liberalism and Big Labor. Instead of the Treaty of Detroit we have, if you will, the Peace of Palo Alto, in which a certain kind of virtue-signaling on progressive social causes, a certain degree of performative wokeness, is offered to liberalism and the activist left pre-emptively, in the hopes that having corporate America take their side in the culture wars will blunt efforts to tax or regulate our new monopolies too heavily.Much of this signaling is sincerely motivated. I\u2019m sure that lots of people in the corporate ranks at Delta or Alamo sincerely abhor the N.R.A., just as most of the people who demanded James Damore\u2019s firing from Google or Brendan Eich\u2019s ejection from Mozilla regarded both men as beyond-the-pale bigots.\u201cAs much as we fear corporations gone wild,\u201d Poulos concludes, \u201cwe love corporations that love us.\u201d And in a rich society people may prefer that their #brands prove this love by identifying with favored social causes rather than through the old-fashioned expedient of paying their workers a little bit more money.Or some people may prefer it, at least \u2014 the professional classes, blessed with material comfort, and those groups designated as being on the official winning side of history. For others, though, the Peace of Palo Alto has rather less to offer. It confirms the blue-collar suspicion that liberalism is no longer organized around working-class economic interests, and it encourages cultural conservatives in their feeling of general besiegement, their sense that all the major institutions of American life, corporate as well as intellectual and cultural, are arrayed against their mores and values and traditions.Between them these trends and sentiments will help sustain the Republican Party even as it lurches deeper into demagogy and paranoia \u2014 by making a vote for the G.O.P. the only way to protest a corporate-backed liberal politics that seems indifferent to the working man and an ascendant cultural liberalism that has boardrooms as well as Hollywood and academia in its corner.But of course so long as this same Republican Party remains itself pro-corporate in its economic ideology \u2014 as the Trumpified G.O.P., despite his populist forays, has determinedly remained \u2014 the corporate interests themselves stand to lose little from these polarizing trends. Their wokeness buys them cover when liberalism is in power, and any backlash only helps prop up a G.O.P. that has their back when it comes time to write our tax laws.The win-win scenario for woke capitalism can\u2019t last forever. But it might be quite the racket while it lasts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Marches Forward on A.I., the White House Is Silent", "Date": "2018-02-12", "News": "Last summer, China unveiled a plan to become the world\u2019s leader in artificial intelligence, challenging the longtime role of the United States.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In July, China unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence and create an industry worth $150 billion to its economy by 2030.To technologists working on A.I. in the United States, the statement, which was 28 pages long in its English translation, was a direct challenge to America\u2019s lead in arguably the most important tech research to come along in decades. It outlined the Chinese government\u2019s aggressive plan to treat A.I. like the country\u2019s own version of the Apollo 11 lunar mission \u2014 an all-in effort that could stoke national pride and spark agenda-setting technology breakthroughs.\u201cIt is remarkable to see how A.I. has emerged as a top priority for the Chinese leadership and how quickly things have been set into motion,\u201d said Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security who helped translate the manifesto and follows China\u2019s work on artificial intelligence. \u201cThe U.S. plans and policies released in 2016 were seemingly the impetus for the formulation of China\u2019s national A.I. strategy.\u201d\u201cWe are still waiting on the White House to provide some direction\u201d on how to respond to the competition, said Tim Hwang, who worked on A.I. policy at Google and is now the director of the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative, a new organization created by the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and others to fund ethical research in artificial intelligence.American companies like Amazon and Google have done more than anyone to turn A.I. concepts into real products. But for a number of reasons, including concerns that the Trump administration will limit the number of immigrant engineers allowed into the United States, much of the critical research being done on artificial intelligence is already migrating to other countries, including tech hot spots like Toronto, London and Beijing.To China\u2019s growing tech community, driving the industry\u2019s next big thing \u2014 a mantra of Silicon Valley \u2014 is becoming a tantalizing possibility.\u201cThanks to the size of the market and the rapid experimentation, China is going to become one of the most powerful \u2014 if not the most powerful \u2014 A.I. countries in the world,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft and Google executive who now runs a prominent Chinese venture capital firm dedicated to artificial intelligence.The 2016 A.I. reports were shepherded by President Barack Obama\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy.The O.S.T.P., which has overseen science and technology activities across the federal government for more than four decades, is now run by the deputy chief technology officer Michael Kratsios. He had worked as a Wall Street analyst before serving as chief of staff for an investment fund run by Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist who supported Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential run. The administration has yet to name an office director or fill four other assistant posts.In a recent interview, Mr. Kratsios was adamant that any concerns over the administration\u2019s approach to A.I. were unfounded.\u201cArtificial intelligence has been a priority for the Trump administration since Day 1,\u201d he said. Mr. Kratsios added that the administration was particularly concerned with the development of A.I. in national security and as a way of encouraging economic prosperity.Many staff members in Mr. Kratsios\u2019s office are exploring issues related to artificial intelligence, he said. Mr. Kratsios also meets with a committee, set up by the Obama administration, that coordinates A.I. policy across the government.\u201cThe key thing to remember is that the front line of A.I. policy is at the agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe White House is a convener and a coordinator.\u201dIn an echo of plans laid out by the Obama administration, China\u2019s government said it intended to significantly increase long-term funding for A.I. research and develop a much larger community of A.I. researchers.There are several ways to do that, according to the Obama administration and China. First, educate more students in these technologies. Second, recruit experts from other countries.At the same time, both policy statements urged companies to share more technology and data. Huge pools of data are need to \u201ctrain\u201d A.I. systems, and in the United States much of this is locked up inside companies like Facebook and Google. Mr. Lee said China already has an enormous advantage here because its large population will generate more data and its companies are more willing to share.Artificial intelligence has been a focus of Chinese technologists for some time. By 2013, China was already producing more research papers than the United States in the area of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the main technology driving the rise of A.I., according to the Obama reports. Deep learning, which allows machines to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, is one of the main technologies driving the rise of artificial intelligence.It is unclear how much China as a whole is spending. But one Chinese state has promised to invest $5 billion in A.I., and the government of Beijing has committed $2 billion to an A.I. development park in the city. South Korea has set aside close to $1 billion of its own. Canada, already home to many of the top researchers in the field, has also committed $125 million to, in part, attract new talent from other countries.It is also difficult to say just how much the government of the United States is spending. Government organizations like the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation continue to fund new research in universities and the private sector. According to an O.S.T.P report, the federal government spent about $1 billion a year in 2015. The Trump administration says that spending jumped to $3 billion in 2017. But the current administration said that was not an apples-to-apples comparison to the 2015 tally, because it was not certain how the Obama administration made it calculations.\u201cWe may have a bunch of small initiatives inside the government that are doing good, but we don\u2019t have a central national strategy,\u201d said Jack Clark, a former journalist who now oversees policy efforts at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence lab co-founded by Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt is confusing that we have this technology of such obvious power and merit and we are not hearing full-throated support, including financial support.\u201d\u201cThey are headed in precisely the wrong direction,\u201d said Thomas Kalil, who led O.S.T.P\u2019s Technology and Innovation Division under President Obama. \u201cThat is particularly concerning given that China has identified this as a strategic priority.\u201dGoogle operates another important lab in Montreal. Its London lab, DeepMind, may be home to more top-notch A.I. researchers than any other lab on earth. And Google recently unveiled new labs in both Paris and Beijing. Facebook, after creating its own lab in Canada, recently pumped 10 million euros, or more than $12 million, into its existing operation in Paris. And Amazon is opening a lab in Germany.Inside these facilities, researchers still create technology for their American employers. As the labs grow and the products get better, some employees can be expected to leave to start their own companies and hire their own employees.Google\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s work in China has already led to Chinese start-ups like Malong, which is building image recognition systems, and a major A.I. investment fund run by Mr. Lee.\u201cWhen it is close to you, something like Microsoft Research has real economic value,\u201d said Mr. Clark, of OpenAI.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}

While he was unquestionably powerful in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein was not a household name in Canada until last fall. Why has his downfall set off debate and action in Canada and elsewhere outside of the United States?A. I actually think it was less about Weinstein and more about the women who chose to speak out. This was one of the few, perhaps only, cases in recent history where the victims were vastly more famous than the abuser \u2014 and I think that was one of the many factors that contributed to the explosion. Social media played a part in the ripple effect, continuing to spread the message and to shift the conversation away from those famous women to the rest of us. And the rest of us are key to this. The #MeToo movement has sustained because sexual assault and harassment is a universal experience.While debating sexual harassment legislation in Parliament this week, some of the legislators expressed concern that the #MeToo movement might flame out as rapidly as it rose up. What will it take to affect sustained changes?I think we\u2019ve already seen that that\u2019s not the case. As journalists, we so often wait for when reader fatigue sets in, when our audience tires of a particular story line or the next scoop comes along. That truly hasn\u2019t happened in this case. The stories keep coming, the complicity continues to be uncovered, and the major shift I\u2019ve seen is the focus from pure accusations to what\u2019s next. In what ways has policy not kept up with the times? If we know that most sexual harassment training doesn\u2019t work \u2014 which we do \u2014 how will institutions work to eradicate the behavior? I don\u2019t think this conversation is going away, but I do think it will shift from problem to solution.Are Americans paying any attention to the debates in Canada and elsewhere in the world?I think that social media has helped keep the conversation global. In France it was #BalanceTonPorc, in Spain and Latin America #YoTambien, in Italy #QuellaVoltaChe, in Israel #\u05d2\u05dd\u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u2014#MeToo has stretched from Canada to China.Within that context the On The Market feature of our Real Estate section headed out to take a look at two condos in Toronto.Below are a couple of highlights.From Tom Roach, Waterloo, Ontario:\u201cThe real issue is not Nafta.

{"Headline": "NBC Executive Takes Over Amazon Studios", "Date": "2018-02-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon had been on the hunt for a new executive, placing a strong emphasis on finding a woman, since October. In that time, streaming rivals like Netflix, Hulu and Apple have continued to gobble up television projects.Amazon has made the occasional splash at the Golden Globes and the Emmys with shows like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d but it has failed to gain the same kind of standing that Netflix and even Hulu have within Hollywood\u2019s creative community.It will be up to Ms. Salke, 53, to essentially hit the reset button.\u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeff Blackburn, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for business development and entertainment, said in a statement.A Fox executive, Dana Walden, and an A&E executive, Nancy Dubuc, had discussed the position with Amazon before each dropped out of talks.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited about the future at Amazon Studios,\u201d Ms. Salke said in a statement. \u201cIn the studio\u2019s relatively short existence they have innovated, disrupted and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop culture. I am both honored and emboldened by the opportunity to lead this extraordinary business.\u201dFor the last seven years, Ms. Salke has been second in command at NBC, where she and Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, engineered an impressive turnaround.Mr. Greenblatt, who joined NBC in 2010, and Ms. Salke, who came on board as president from Fox in 2011, found a network in deep trouble and well past its \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u201cER\u201d and \u201cFriends\u201d heyday.But now, propelled by \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and shows like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d NBC is poised to win the 18-to-49-year-old demographic among the four broadcast networks for a second consecutive season.Ms. Salke was one of the biggest champions of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d an emotional family drama whose popularity has surprised many industry veterans \u2014 as has its ability to sustain that success in its second season. On Sunday, NBC gave \u201cThis Is Us\u201d the post-Super Bowl slot, where it garnered an impressive audience of 27 million viewers.Ms. Salke has also helped deploy a strategy that brought NBC\u2019s comedy lineup back to life. After the lineup collapsed when \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d went off the air, she said the network would develop comedies that weren\u2019t meant to appeal to everybody. NBC has since found traction with offbeat comedies like \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and \u201cSuperstore.\u201d\u201cJennifer Salke is a world-class entertainment executive and deserves enormous credit for helping put NBC back on top,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said in a statement.But whether her success at helping turn around a broadcast network \u2014 which also relies on a healthy diet of Dick Wolf dramas \u2014 will translate to a streaming service is an open question.Amazon has been viewed in Hollywood as something of a sleeping giant, one of the few companies that could match Netflix financially if it deployed its cash properly. Netflix is poised to spend $8 billion on content this year.But Amazon has had several expensive missteps. \u201cThe Last Tycoon,\u201d adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s unfinished novel, debuted to little fanfare and was canceled. Likewise, several comedies, including \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson\u201d and \u201cI Love Dick,\u201d have been canceled in the last month.At the same time, Hulu has found real momentum. It is introducing several shows this year, including \u201cThe Looming Tower,\u201d a mini-series based on Lawrence Wright\u2019s book about the lead-up to the Sept. 11 attacks, this month and the second season of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d in April.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotify Is Getting Paid to Save the Music Industry: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Spotify files to go public.\u2022 Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods will stop selling assault-style rifles.\u2022 The end of an era for Ackman; the start for another one?\u2022 What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?\u2022 The Federal Reserve is walking a monetary tightrope.\u2022 And is Jared Kushner\u2019s weakness his family business?Perhaps more than any other streaming service, Spotify has revived the fortunes of recording artists. It is funneling billions of dollars from its subscribers to music companies, which, for the most part, faced a bleak future. But a charity Spotify is not. The company appears to be taking a bigger and bigger cut of the revenue it receives from listeners, according to numbers first made public on Wednesday.The numbers are included in Spotify\u2019s financial filing with Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of listing its shares on the United States stock market. They strongly suggest that Spotify has successfully flexed its muscle as it negotiates the price it pays record companies for music. This shows up starkly in the filing\u2019s discussion of an expense item called cost of revenues, which, the filing says, \u201cconsists predominately of royalty and distribution costs related to content streaming.\u201dThe filing says Spotify had \u20ac3.67 billion of premium streaming revenue last year. The cost of that revenue last year was \u20ac2.87 billion. The difference between those numbers, the gross profit on streaming revenue, was equivalent to 22 percent of that revenue. That is well up from 16 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015. And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. \u201cThis decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,\u201d the filing said.But can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that.\u2014 Peter EavisAccounting nerds delving into Spotify\u2019s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy.Two metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of \u20ac324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled \u20ac179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda?It looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung \u20ac439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year.\u2014 Peter EavisDirect listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market.Spotify won\u2019t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days.Here\u2019s a look at the details:Despite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang.Through late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify\u2019s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public.In doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby.Dick\u2019s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT:\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201dOver five years ago, Bill Ackman boldly announced that he was shorting Herbalife, declaring the company a pyramid scheme and vowing to see its stock price down to zero.Today, Mr. Ackman finally gave up on that quest.\u2022 Mr. Ackman\u2019s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet.How did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high.Shares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIs it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no.BackgroundSnap\u2019s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock.The criticism has also overshadowed Snap\u2019s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent.BlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock\u2019s annual report:As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as \u201ccommon ownership\u201d. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.The filing goes on to say:If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock\u2019s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.That is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years.What to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?One interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy.To help prevent that, Fed officials can say things aimed at prompting investors to give more consideration to certain outcomes.Is it working? Arguably, if investors were more concerned, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note would be higher than the 2.88 percent it traded at on Wednesday morning. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will be 3.25 percent at the end of this year.Anyone surprised that the yield gets there far more quickly should not be after Mr. Powell\u2019s testimony.\u2014 Peter EavisSky is both a telecom operator \u2014 selling TV, internet and phone services \u2014 and a media company with its own original news, sports and entertainment programming.

{"Headline": "The Atlantic Plans a Hiring Spree", "Date": "2018-02-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA media company is expanding its newsroom. You read that right.The Atlantic plans to add as many as 100 employees to its staff over the next 12 months, its president, Bob Cohn, told employees during a staff meeting on Wednesday. The hirings will represent a 30 percent increase in personnel at the publication, with half the jobs going to newsroom employees.\u201cWe have great ambitions to grow The Atlantic and make it better and these are the ways we think we can do it,\u201d Mr. Cohn said in an interview on Tuesday.The ramping up comes six months after Emerson Collective, an organization run by the philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic.With Emerson Collective as its new patron, The Atlantic has avoided the grim fates of its fellow news organizations. In a memo to the staff, Mr. Cohn said that circulation is at an all-time high \u2014 it rose 13 percent last year \u2014 and that visits to TheAtlantic.com rose by 25 percent in 2017.The planned additions to the newsroom are meant to bolster the magazine\u2019s coverage of Washington, Hollywood, Europe and the tech industry.\u201cIt will be a mix of writers and editors and video producers and podcast producers and live events producers,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cThose are areas of coverage that we want to focus on, and we\u2019ll do it across all our platforms: digital, print, live events, video, audio, newsletters.\u201dOther jobs will go to engineers, designers and members of a new team the magazine has called Talent Lab, which is intended to \u201chelp us achieve one of our paramount goals: ensuring that our team is truly representative of America in all of its diversity,\u201d Mr. Cohn wrote.When it acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic, Emerson Collective \u2014 which focuses on education, the environment and immigration \u2014 expanded its portfolio of media and entertainment holdings. It is also an investor in Axios, a media company started by the Politico co-founder Jim VandeHei and its former star reporter, Mike Allen, and in Pop-Up Magazine. In 2016, it took a minority stake in Anonymous Content, the production and talent management company behind the movie \u201cSpotlight.\u201dThe organization also supports several nonprofit journalism organizations, including The Marshall Project, Mother Jones and ProPublica.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s HomePod Has Arrived. Don\u2019t Rush to Buy It.", "Date": "2018-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixOn my second day with Apple\u2019s new HomePod, I asked the artificially intelligent speaker to play some music. Siri, the virtual assistant that powers HomePod, enthusiastically replied, \u201cO.K., let\u2019s get going with some Dashboard Confessional.\u201dI cringed. \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody likes Dashboard Confessional.\u201dAt the time, I gave Siri a pass. After all, Apple\u2019s HomePod, a rival to smart speakers from Amazon and Google, is supposed to study your music preferences over time to create special playlists just for you. I had had only one day with HomePod.But after a week \u2014 during which I asked HomePod to play my favorite tunes from artists like Beck, Talking Heads and David Bowie \u2014 the smart speaker still did not learn. Instead, like a stubborn D.J., Siri kept playing music by artists outside my music palette: Taylor Swift and Leroy Francis, to name just two.That leads to my conclusion: The $349 HomePod, which costs roughly three times as much as its competitors and arrives in stores on Friday, is tough to recommend to you, dear reader.Apple\u2019s speaker is certainly an impressive piece of hardware. Audiophiles will appreciate that it has a woofer with a custom amplifier and seven tweeters. The result is a speaker with a deep bass and rich treble that is loud enough to fill a large room with superb sound. HomePod makes the Amazon Echo and Google\u2019s Home sound muffled and tinny in comparison.But Siri on HomePod is embarrassingly inadequate, even though that is the primary way you interact with it. Siri is sorely lacking in capabilities compared with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. Siri doesn\u2019t even work as well on HomePod as it does on the iPhone.Even now, Apple is shipping the HomePod unfinished. On Day 1, the device will lack some cool features, like the ability to link several HomePods to create a multiroom sound system that Apple says will fill an entire home with music. That feature will come in a software update later this year.And there are other limitations: The HomePod requires an iOS device, like an iPhone, an iPad or an iPod Touch, to set it up. To use your voice commands to play music, you will also need to subscribe to Apple\u2019s streaming music service, Apple Music.So how exactly did I reach my conclusion on HomePod? I tested it side by side with Echo and Home smart speakers, grading them on their ability to accomplish 14 tasks across several categories, including music, productivity, commuting, home automation and cooking. Let me walk you through the process and results.Apple also provided statistics on smart speaker usage from the research firm Parks Associates. That report also found that playing music and getting the weather were the top uses of smart speakers, while roughly 20 percent of people enjoyed using them for tasks like accessing a calendar and searching for recipes.Amazon says most of its Echo customers use at least one \u201cskill,\u201d or third-party app. So I added the ability to use Uber, the most popular ride-hailing service, as a test.Now onward to the tests themselves.I set up a HomePod, an Echo and a Home in my house and began with a battery of question-and-answer sessions. First up: traffic.All the speakers gave a similar traffic estimate for a drive to San Jose, Calif. \u2014 roughly a one-hour drive on the freeway. But when I asked HomePod to summon a car from Uber, Siri responded, \u201cI wish I could, but I can\u2019t help with rides here.\u201dThe other speakers were happy to help \u2014 so I followed up with: \u201cHey, Siri, what gives?\u201d HomePod\u2019s colorful touch screen lit up to show it had heard my question, but Siri remained silent.Next, it was time for some cooking questions. All the speakers were able to flawlessly set a kitchen timer. But when I asked HomePod how to make pasta, Siri blanked and said, \u201cI can\u2019t get the answer to that on HomePod.\u201dThen it was time to move on to some work-related tasks. I asked Siri to schedule a meeting for Tuesday. Siri responded: \u201cI cannot access your calendar from here. Sorry about that.\u201d It couldn\u2019t look at my calendar for the day, either. Google Home and Amazon Echo, in contrast, managed to schedule new events and read my calendar for the day: a meeting in the morning, followed by a photo shoot and a business dinner in the evening.When I asked Apple about Siri\u2019s hiccups, the company said that for the first version of HomePod, it focused on including tasks that people use smart speakers for the most, like playing music and asking about the weather, and that it would continue to evaluate what other features to add over time.I wondered whether HomePod would do better with home tasks and decided to ask all the smart speakers to turn on a Wi-Fi-connected light bulb from the smart light company Lifx. In this test, HomePod got a higher score because setting up the smart light, which involved using the iPhone camera to scan a code on the instruction manual, was seamless and much easier than it was with Google Home and Amazon Echo, which required installing a third-party app.Bonus: The light turned on when I asked.One of the most crucial tests for HomePod had to do with audio. That\u2019s because Apple has long emphasized that the smart speaker is first and foremost a music player.Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s head of marketing, said at a gathering at the company\u2019s audio lab last week that Apple started developing HomePod six years ago with the intention of making a speaker that specialized in playing music in a unique way. The project started well before Apple introduced other services like Apple Music, which was released in 2015, and HomeKit, the home automation platform that was unveiled in 2014, he added.Mr. Schiller said Apple wanted to stay true to the original goal of the project \u201cwithout ever compromising that it\u2019s a speaker first.\u201dAll three speakers did great playing music. Echo, Google\u2019s Home and HomePod were each able to play specific songs by artists, generate playlists for specific artists or music genres, and play podcasts. HomePod got a higher score in audio with its superior sound quality factored in.Yet that\u2019s also where Dashboard Confessional came in and where HomePod\u2019s biggest shortcomings became apparent. Whenever I asked HomePod to \u201cplay some music,\u201d it never played music that was relevant to my preferences or listening history.That wasn\u2019t the case with the Google and Amazon speakers. When I asked those speakers to play music, the gadgets simply resumed what I was last playing on Spotify, which was satisfying.In response to my concerns, Apple said HomePod studies a customer\u2019s music preferences over time. I figured a week should have been enough.From the tests, I graded the speakers on their ability to accomplish each task on a scale from 0 to 4. (I gave a 0 for tasks that could not be done at all, a 2 for tasks that could be done with some issues, and a 4 for tasks that could be completed flawlessly.)So how did they all stack up in terms of grade-point averages out of 4.0? The final results:\u25a0 Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 3.4\u25a0 Google\u2019s Home \u2014 3.1\u25a0 Apple\u2019s HomePod \u2014 2.9An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a musical artist whose music was played by Apple\u2019s HomePod speaker without being requested.

{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Earnings Disappoint. Blame It on the iPhone.", "Date": "2018-02-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut when people get used to near perfection, then \u201cpretty good\u201d becomes a disappointment.Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, fell short of Wall Street expectations for its fourth-quarter profit, sending the stock down in after-hours trading. Its profits were weighed down by an increase in traffic acquisition costs \u2014 the fees Google pays companies like Apple to ensure that its search engine is the default option when people open a browser on the iPhone.On Thursday, Alphabet attributed the increase in costs to a rising number of people doing searches on smartphones. Those queries require the company to pay more to reserve screen real estate compared to searches on desktop computers.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company expects those traffic acquisition costs will continue to climb. She framed the increased expense as a positive, a sign that Alphabet was establishing an important beachhead on smartphones.\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have a strong position in a rapidly growing market,\u201d said Ms. Porat. Shares of Alphabet initially fell as much as 5 percent in after-hours trading before settling in at about a 2 percent decline.Alphabet said Google\u2019s traffic acquisition costs in the quarter increased 33 percent from a year earlier, to $6.45 billion. Last year, Bernstein Research estimated that Google would pay about $3 billion to Apple in 2017 to remain the default search option on Apple\u2019s mobile devices.Excluding the tax charge, Alphabet said its earnings per share was $9.70, compared with Wall Street\u2019s expectations for $9.98. Revenue grew 24 percent to $32.32 billion.The results underscored the strength of Google\u2019s position in digital advertising, a market it dominates with Facebook. In the fourth quarter, users clicked on 48 percent more ads on Google sites \u2014 including search and YouTube \u2014 than a year earlier.In 2017, two-thirds of every ad dollar spent on the internet went through Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s advertising systems, according to research from Goldman Sachs. What\u2019s more, Goldman Sachs estimated that 87 percent of the additional spending in digital advertising this year will funnel through these two companies.Alphabet also announced that John Hennessy, the former Stanford University president and a board member since 2004, had been appointed the company\u2019s new chairman. Eric Schmidt stepped down as executive chairman in December. At the time, Alphabet had said it planned to appoint a nonexecutive chairman.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twittter: @daiwakaAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Enter Correction Territory: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-02-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 Stocks enter correction territory.\u2022 Qualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s revised offer.\u2022 Snap and Twitter: From also-rans to worthy contenders?\u2022 BlackRock is reportedly setting its sights on Berkshire Hathaway and the Blackstone Group.\u2022 A top WSJ editor heads to Lazard.\u2022 Brunswick Group has named Neal Wolin as its new C.E.O.The Dow Jones industrial average and S.&P. 500 went more the 400 days without a pullback of 5 percent.That streak ended this week, and on Thursday, the two indexes fell into correction territory, defined as a pullback of at least 10 percent from their high. For both, it is the first time they have crossed into a correction since early 2016.The Dow plunged more than 1,000 points Thursday, its second decline of more than 1,000 points this week. The S. & P. 500 dropped 100 points, its third decline of more than 100 points in its history.On a percentage basis, the Dow fell 4.15 percent, the S. & P. 500 dropped 3.75 percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.9 percent.The bigger pictureAnxieties about inflation have driven the much of decline over the past week and a half. The yield on the benchmark Treasury note climbed above 2.85 percent \u2014 its highest level since 2014 \u2014 for the second time this week. Higher yields can crimp economic activity by raising borrowing costs, while also making riskier assets like stocks less appealing to bonds.Many market watchers say that investors should not worry about the recent spate of volatility in the stock market. Such swings, they say, are normal. They point to strong corporate earnings and a strengthening economy both in the United States and abroad as reasons to be optimistic about stocks.Investor sentiment has reversed in recent weeks as the sell-off in stocks gained momentum.According to the American Association of Individual Investors\u2019 weekly survey, bullish sentiment, or the percentage of respondents that say stocks will rise over the next six months, declined to 37 percent. The drop ended a streak of eight straight weeks with bullish sentiment above its historical average of 38.5 percent.It began the year at nearly 60 percent, its highest level since 2010.The contextThe survey has proved to be a good contrarian indicator. That means overly bullish sentiment often signals that the stock market is ripe for a pullback, while overly bearish sentiment often indicates that market may soon rally.The chip maker said its board had rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised $121 billion offer.The reasons\u2022 \u201cThe Broadcom proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm.\u201d\u2022 The offer \u201cfalls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction.\u201dQualcomm said that it was willing to meet with Broadcom to see if its issues with the offer could be addressed.The contextQualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.Till this week, many investors wondered whether Snap and Twitter had much of a future at a time when Google and Facebook are sucking up such a large share of digital advertising dollars. But after Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even as they remain in the shadow of Facebook and Google.\u2014 Peter EavisBlackRock itself raises a different comparison, according to Sarah Krouse of the WSJ \u2014 to Warren Buffett:The \u201cbest known\u201d example of BlackRock\u2019s approach with this new vehicle is Berkshire Hathaway, according to a fund-raising document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Omaha conglomerate run by Mr. Buffett is well known for its long-term ownership of companies.BlackRock\u2019s Long-Term Private Capital fund would be a tenth of Berkshire\u2019s $101 billion in cash. But it too would look to buy and hold positions for more than 10 years. Over all, though, this seems more akin to private equity.The practice has grown on Wall Street with the rise of activist investors, with investment banks touting their defense capabilities to corporate clients.Before becoming finance editor at the Journal, Mr. Berman oversaw the paper\u2019s business coverage and was its M.&A. reporter prior to that.Mr. Berman, who will join as a managing director and be based in New York, will start on Feb. 26.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedAndrew, with a bit of contextDennis follows in the footsteps of Steven Rattner, who worked as a reporter at the NYT in the 1980s before going to work as a banker at Lazard and becoming an influential financier. (Today, Mr. Rattner overseas Michael Bloomberg\u2019s fortune.)Dennis was my fiercest reporting competitor over the last decade and is one of the most talented financial journalists in recent memory.Mr. Wolin, who will remain based in Washington, will take over from the London-based Susan Gilchrist, who will become chairwoman of Brunswick\u2019s global clients operations and focus on client work full time.Alan Parker, Brunswick\u2019s founder, said in a telephone interview of the move, \u201cIt reflects the growth of the business and the business opportunity in America.\u201dThe contextIn some ways, the appointment of Mr. Wolin reflects that trend. Beyond his time at the Treasury Department, he previously worked as a senior executive at The Hartford, an insurer. And he was previously a Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration.\u201cIncreasingly, I think senior executives and boards of directors have come to understand that a lot of their challenges and opportunitiess sit at the intersection of business and governments and society and so forth,\u201d Mr. Wolin said in a phone interview.Or as Mr. Parker put it, \u201cMore and more we hear ourselves described as a critical issues business.\u201dOther moves at Brunswick\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe recent stock market freak-out may have abated, but the dynamics that drove the sell-off \u2014 worries that faster global growth and hotter inflation will trigger faster-than-expected rate hikes \u2014 are alive and well in the currency markets.On Thursday, the Bank of England raised its growth forecasts for the United Kingdom, and Mark Carney, the bank\u2019s governor, said rates would likely have to be increased faster than previously expected.The British pound promptly popped by more than 1 percent against the dollar, and yields on British government bonds rose. Treasury bonds yields in the United States also rose, with the 10-year note offering yields of nearing 2.90 percent.The sight of bond yields nearing 3 percent should keep stock investors on edge amid the growing conviction we\u2019re moving out of the era of low-interest rates, which were such a key ingredient for the near-decade-long bull market in stocks.\u2014 Matt PhillipsThe bigger pictureWhat business cares about in the proposal:\u2022 Nearly $300 billion in additional spending over the next two years\u2022 $20 billion for infrastructure spending\u2022 A lifting of the debt ceiling until March 2019The agreement will cause federal budget deficits to grow even larger, on top of the effects of the sweeping tax overhaul that lawmakers approved in December.
