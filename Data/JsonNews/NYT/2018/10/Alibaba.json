{"Headline": "The Transformational Bliss of Borrowing Your Office Clothes", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "Rent the Runway\u2019s Unlimited service saves working women something more valuable than money: their time.Supported byOn a Friday morning in August, Sushma Dwivedi, a senior vice president at Edelman, the global marketing conglomerate, bustled around her Harlem apartment in a blue-and-white-striped cotton dress. With her toddler and newborn out with a nanny, Ms. Dwivedi, who was on maternity leave but preparing for a meeting with a senior colleague in a few days, intended to get some things done. High on her list: assessing the contents of a recently delivered dark-blue garment bag.Ms. Dwivedi, 37, is a member of Rent the Runway Unlimited, a service that, for $159 a month, allows subscribers to borrow up to four pieces of clothing and accessories from a designer-laden library of more than 450,000 items and keep them for as long as they want. If subscribers can\u2019t bear to part with something, they can buy it, generally for about half the retail price. (A cocoon-like wool cardigan from Jil Sander Navy sells in stores for $1,275, but costs $765 through Rent the Runway.) When members buy an item, or return it, via a prepaid shipping label in their garment bag, a spot for something new opens up.Though Rent the Runway was originally conceived as a solution for women who didn\u2019t want to invest in party-wear they might use only once, Unlimited has become a strategic solution for professional women such as Ms. Dwivedi, who manages 30 employees in Edelman\u2019s food and beverage department and regularly gets called into the offices of clients like Pepsi and Chobani.\u201cThe wardrobe thing, when I was trying to lose the baby weight, was frustrating,\u201d said Ms. Dwivedi, recalling her first pregnancy. \u201cI knew what I could buy when I was pregnant. I knew how big I was, but afterward, what was I going to do? Buy an entire wardrobe at five pounds thinner, five more pounds thinner, and on and on?\u201d She added, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to look frumpy or have someone turn around and say, \u2018Wow, she looked a lot better before.\u2019\u201dSince Rent the Runway introduced Unlimited two years ago, the service has amassed tens of thousands of subscribers in part by promising to solve the problem of what to wear to work, for everyone from new hires to C-suite executives. (The company declined to confirm its user numbers, but analysts said that perhaps 50,000 people are active subscribers.) It is fast displacing the start-up\u2019s original business model. Rent the Runway was founded in 2009 as a way for people to borrow couture on an item-by-item basis. This year, Unlimited, which also has an $89-a-month tier, will account for the majority of revenue.\u201cI just have too much stuff: stuff that I bought, that I don\u2019t like anymore, that I don\u2019t wear anymore,\u201d said Kristin Lemkau, the chief marketing officer of JPMorgan Chase and a self-described Unlimited \u201csuperfan\u201d of two years. On a recent Wednesday morning at her office, on the 36th floor of a glossy Park Avenue monolith, she wore a flouncy, frilly black dress sprayed with pastel-colored daisies. Lemkau, 51, who helps oversee a $5 billion budget, routinely speaks at conferences on her firm\u2019s behalf, sometimes in places like the South of France or the Swiss Alps, which come with their own, rarefied dress codes.Before signing up for Unlimited, she regularly met with a wardrobe consultant near her Rye, N.Y., home. \u201cI\u2019d go to her house and pick out stuff,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cI was never thrilled with the clothes. It was the same old black dress and black pants, and I started looking like I was in mourning all the time.\u201dShe ruffled her daisy-printed hem. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve bought this, but it\u2019s super cute, it\u2019s fun. I look forward to getting dressed every day instead of, \u2018What thing am I going to wear? Is my dry cleaning back?\u2019 I don\u2019t remember looking forward to getting dressed, ever.\u201dUnlimited frees mental space for women to think about more important matters: what to say in that big meeting; how to describe their employment history in a crucial job interview; how to, in the grand scheme of their professional lives, get ahead. \u201cWomen spend more time, more energy, more, just, time being distracted with shopping and thinking about the way they look compared to men,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cEven at work, men were basically just deciding what tie to wear, and now, for the most part, they don\u2019t even wear ties. Is this service another way to potentially level the playing field?\u201dBefore joining Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Dwivedi spent untold hours rifling through fast-fashion stores like H&M and Zara, searching for a trendy blazer or statement necklace to liven up her work wardrobe. These days, she typically \u201cshops\u201d on Rent the Runway\u2019s iPhone app, scrolling through silk blouses and floral dresses as if they were Spotify songs, assessing member-submitted photos of the clothes out in the real world.\u201cI\u2019m having drinks with my mentor on Wednesday. I wasn\u2019t sure what to wear to that, so I gave myself a couple of options. If this is as flattering as I think it could be, I\u2019ll probably wear this,\u201d Ms. Dwivedi said, holding up a striped, sleeveless linen shift dress in a clear plastic sheathe. \u201cAnd if not, this maxi\u201d \u2014 a floor length, flowy black dress emblazoned with tropical blossoms.This is the trade-off. While Ms. Dwivedi luxuriates in the designer clothing that does fit \u2014 she received a steady stream of compliments from co-workers on a pink, plaid Trina Turk coat that she wore while pregnant with her first child \u2014 the stuff that does not must be sent back to the warehouse before she can order something new. The process generally takes a day or two.The Rent the Runway app and website regularly prompt users to review what they borrowed, and with a few taps, Ms. Dwivedi could report that the dress was not true to size. Despite the inconvenience of waiting for another shipment, she prefers this process to trying on outfits in a store. \u201cI would rather have the shaming of it all and the judging experience on my own,\u201d she said.\u201cOver 50 percent of our customers provide data back to us after they rent, every single time,\u201d said Jenn Hyman, 38, who is Rent the Runway\u2019s chief executive and co-founder. \u201cWithout an incentive, our customers want to make this service better for other women, and they\u2019re telling us because they want us to fix the problem.\u201d She was standing in the company\u2019s 250,000-square-foot warehouse in Secaucus, N.J. \u2014 a structure it says is the largest dry-cleaning facility in the world. Rent the Runway calls it the Dream Fulfillment Center.It is garment-tracking infrastructure of staggering proportions. Unlike companies that have democratized access to movies (Netflix) or music (Spotify), Rent the Runway peddles in touchable, feel-able, not-streamable material goods \u2014 garments that lose buttons and rip and stain and go through God knows what after they slide onto the bodies of their temporary owners.\u201cThere are three times during the process where we\u2019re doing a quality inspection,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. Next to her, an employee was sniffing the contents of a garment bag, one of hundreds that UPS and FedEx deliver to the warehouse each morning. \u201cCustomers sometimes tell us that there\u2019s an item they didn\u2019t wear, but our smell test is more important,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cEvery single item goes through a cleaning and sanitation process.\u201dIndustrial washers spun, dryers tumbled and garments on hangers clicked as they made their way through a maze of scaffolding, en route to a machine that would spit them out encased in plastic. \u201cThe system knows that that blouse needs to wait for a pair of jeans to come in,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cIt won\u2019t send it over to shipping until all of the items in that order have been brought together. That\u2019s something someone\u2019s wearing to an event,\u201d she said, gesturing at an off-the-shoulder gown of salmon-colored chiffon. \u201cVegas!\u201d she trilled, pointing at a white-and-red-sequined bomber jacket.Of Rent the Runway\u2019s 1,200 employees, 770 are in Secaucus. A second such facility is due to open in Dallas next year, to speed up delivery times to users not on the East Coast. An additional 130 people work on the company\u2019s engineering, information technology and analytics teams. They continually tweak algorithms to identify pieces that customers might like and highlight them on the app\u2019s home screen, similar to recommendations offered by Amazon and Netflix.\u201cWe\u2019re collecting hundreds of thousands of data points every week: style, fit of the garment, what occasion you wore that to, what else is going on in your life, who are you?\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re creating one-to-one style personas for every user we have, which is helping us create an individual home page for you, where we can recommend clothing that you might like. Part of that is not just to recommend the things that you\u2019re already comfortable with, but to help you discover things that you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d love.\u201d Essentially, they\u2019re using data to engineer whimsy \u2014 that feeling of seeing something in a store window and rushing in to plunk down a credit card.Rent the Runway shares its findings with the designers whose clothing it stocks. (The company buys wholesale, like a department store.) \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing amount of data that traditional retailers don\u2019t always share: What other brands is she wearing, how many times do our dresses get dry-cleaned and still come back as new?\u201d said Jan-Hendrik Schlottmann, the C.E.O. of the high-fashion label Derek Lam. \u201cYou learn a lot from that and from reading the comments the clients make online. It\u2019s great market research, frankly.\u201dMr. Schlottmann said he doesn\u2019t worry that rentals will cannibalize sales. \u201cThe Rent the Runway customer is not a customer we\u2019re losing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to spend $1,500 on a dress, because she doesn\u2019t understand the value. We kind of think we\u2019re taking money away from fast fashion by letting her try on and rent clothes. Instead of having her buy Zara\u2019s copy of our dress, I\u2019d rather have her experience our construction, our fabric. Hopefully, she will buy it when she\u2019s ready.\u201dAs a private company, Rent the Runway declined to share its revenue or profit. Ms. Hyman also declined to specify how many Unlimited members there are, but said the subscription business was up 150 percent year over year. In March, an investment of $20 million, in part from the founders of the Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, reportedly put the company\u2019s valuation at $800 million.Even if Rent the Runway is small compared to established fashion brands, the NPD analyst Marshal Cohen considers the company\u2019s impact significant. \u201cThey are a disrupter. They have really changed the dynamic of what goes on in the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building wardrobes the way we used to, we\u2019re not buying as many shoes, as many bags, we\u2019re wearing a few staple items and mixing and matching them. We\u2019ve gotten so casual in the workplace that we\u2019re basically wearing loungewear.\u201dSeventy-five percent of the clothing that gets shipped out to Unlimited members falls into the broad bucket of business casual. Members have written in asking for more tailored options, and as a result, this fall, the company\u2019s business formal assortment \u2014 suits and pencil skirts by labels including Theory, Tibi and Iro \u2014 will increase 250 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s attire that a conservative lawyer could wear to the office everyday,\u201d Ms. Hyman said.Before joining Unlimited in 2016, Ariel Cohen, a 29-year-old account director for the New York public relations firm Magrino, spent about $500 a month at shops like Club Monaco and Anthropologie. She\u2019s cut that to $100 a month \u2014 and eliminated her monthly dry cleaning bill, also around $100. \u201cI make investments in things now that I consider \u2018forever pieces,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m able to have the more colorful and loud parts of my wardrobe be things that I can wear once or twice, post a pic to Instagram, and move on.\u201d She gestured at her Jason Wu pants: white, wide-legged, emblazoned with big, blue flowers. \u201cLike these, I\u2019d never buy.\u201dFor women entering the job force, Unlimited has been a crucial hack. \u201cTo go from college to my first career, it was really challenging,\u201d said Elisabeth Armstrong, 24, a former television reporter in Tennessee who recently transitioned to a finance job in Colorado. \u201cMy salary was not really conducive to buying a new wardrobe.\u201d\u201cI found myself falling into this pattern of fast fashion, buying a blazer here, a dress there,\u201d before signing up for Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Armstrong said. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging for us, as women. Men have the standard suit. With the emphasis on your personal brand, your presentation, I think there\u2019s more weight on appearance than there ever has been.\u201d\u201cI had exhausted the options that I own \u2014 my co-workers had seen them all,\u201d said Caroline Peck, a 25-year-old advertising associate in Birmingham, Ala. \u201cRecently, I was in San Antonio for a big client meeting. I rented this beautiful dress, and even my client complimented me. Then I told them about Unlimited.\u201d Ms. Peck ended up buying the dress, a black, full-skirted Erin Fetherston number with a white Peter Pan collar.Sarah Joyce, who works at a major technology company in Los Angeles, joined Unlimited last December, feeling frumpy and uninspired by her wardrobe. Her initial attitude, she said, was: \u201cRad. I\u2019m going to take more risks, I can send it back, I\u2019m going to do the Chlo\u00e9, the Veronica Beard.\u201d\u201cI was like, now I know how female baller executives look hot,\u201d said Ms. Joyce, 40. \u201cYou\u2019re faking it till you make it. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d She got so much praise on a maroon Cinq \u00e0 Sept maxi dress that she ended up buying it for $500. Then it happened again. \u201cI ended up buying everything,\u201d said Ms. Joyce. \u201cI bought a romper, blouses. It was a problem. Ninety percent of the stuff I rented, I never returned. Then it occurred to me this stuff has been worn by other people so many times, that\u2019s probably why it\u2019s cheap.\u201dIn June, wary of devouring Unlimited\u2019s collection of designer purses, Ms. Joyce canceled her membership. She also grew weary of attracting attention at the office. \u201cIt made such a fuss at work,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Oh, is that also Rent the Runway?\u2019 I felt like a walking billboard.\u201dSome women don\u2019t mind this, like Elizabeth Derby, a 29-year-old senior product marketing manager at Artsy, an art start-up. I spoke to her this summer, when she worked at Betterment, a financial services start-up in New York. \u201cThe funny thing is, there are a lot of men that work here, more men than women, and way more guys in the office know that I use Rent the Runway because they\u2019re always commenting on stuff and saying, \u2018I wish they had that for guys,\u2019\u201d Ms. Derby said. At the time, she was part of a Slack channel that Unlimited subscribers at Betterment use to rate outfits and collect garment bags for drop-off at a showroom Rent the Runway keeps on West 15th Street in Manhattan. (Returns taken there get processed faster than those sent to the warehouse.)\u201cThere\u2019s also the sustainability factor,\u201d said her tag-checking co-worker, Danielle Shechtman. \u201cIf you keep buying clothes and not using them, it\u2019s pretty harmful for the environment.\u201dMs. Derby nodded. \u201cEvery year I get rid of four or five garbage bags of clothes. I don\u2019t even know how I accumulate them.\u201dWith unlimited options comes a kind of perverse pressure: There\u2019s no excuse to not look good. I discovered this myself in April, when I signed up for Unlimited. One major upside: Since enlisting, I\u2019ve purchased only one piece of clothing, a dress I initially rented through Unlimited. But on the app, I routinely went down the rabbit hole of comparing one potential rental to another, reading review after review, scrolling through top picks, new arrivals and categories like \u201cDress Spotlight\u201d and \u201cTrending: Statement Tops.\u201d I had to force myself to stop.It happened again in real life in August, when I visited Rent the Runway\u2019s New York showroom, a Willy Wonka-esque emporium for fashion fiends. Intending to be in and out in 20 minutes, I instead stayed for more than an hour.When I got there, a smiling greeter prompted me to sign up for a fitting room on an iPad, so I could spend time browsing and not standing in line. Salespeople \u2014 if they can be called that, since none of the merchandise had price tags \u2014 went out of their way to unload my arms as they filled with hangers.But when I got to where I was staying, I tried the dress on again and started sweating almost immediately. I ended up wearing a cotton dress I\u2019d owned for three years to the meeting. Later, I inelegantly stuffed the Marni into my suitcase and eventually sent it back to the warehouse unworn.Rent the Runway can\u2019t be expected to solve the paralysis of choice or irrationality that plagues some of us; if anything, its future plans will exacerbate those tendencies. Ms. Hyman wants customers to be able to borrow more items, from an ever-expanding library of brands, at any time they choose.\u201cThe vision is that within a few blocks of where all of our subscribers live, all over the country, our members have access to a magical closet that has inventory that\u2019s personalized to them, that they can access 24 hours a day,\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re building out the technology to make seamless access to that closet as delightful and frictionless as possible.\u201d She added, \u201cRent the Runway closets should feel as organic in your day as going to Starbucks.\u201dThe ephemeral, on-demand closets of Ms. Hyman\u2019s dreams would be something altogether different, and freeing. They would allow us to use our old-fashioned physical closets, and our time and energy, for something else.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s New Gadget Is a Video-Chat Screen With a Camera That Follows You", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since 2004, Facebook has said it wants to bring the world closer together. To accomplish that goal, the company has relied mostly on the web and smartphone apps.But software is no longer enough. On Monday, Facebook introduced a pair of video-calling devices \u2014 Portal and Portal Plus \u2014 to help expand its reach into people\u2019s living rooms.Portal, which has a 10-inch screen, will sell for $199, while the other model, with a 15-inch display that can be rotated, will be priced at $349. Facebook plans to offer the gadgets on a stand-alone website in time for the holidays, and has a major marketing campaign in the works.The devices are Facebook\u2019s first major foray into designing, building and selling consumer hardware from scratch. If the Portals are successful, the company could encourage more people to use its social network regularly to keep in touch with friends and family, as well as for apps like Spotify and Pandora.To address privacy concerns with Portal and Portal Plus, Facebook said the products include an electronic kill switch for the front-facing camera, as well as a cover for the lens. In addition, video calls are encrypted, and the camera\u2019s A.I. technology runs on the device itself, not on Facebook\u2019s servers, the company said.The company said the utility of the devices, which work on a household Wi-Fi connection, would convince people of their importance in a home. The devices are built atop Facebook\u2019s Messenger platform, and the communication software is hooked into a user\u2019s web of Facebook connections. Once Portal is connected to a Messenger account, people can video chat with anyone in their network across devices, be it on Portal, a tablet, a smartphone or a desktop computer.Instead of building its own virtual assistant three years after Alexa\u2019s debut, Facebook worked with Amazon. Like other Amazon-powered products, Portal can be controlled by speaking the word \u201cAlexa\u201d before a question or a request, like \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in San Francisco?\u201d or \u201cSet a timer for 10 minutes.\u201dJonathan Collins, a research director for ABI Research, said it was wise for Facebook to collaborate with Amazon. While creating a digital assistant has helped Apple, Google and Amazon make their products look more attractive, there was no clear benefit for Facebook to make one of its own, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not an obvious link to what they do for people at present,\u201d which is to deepen people\u2019s relationships, Mr. Collins said.Facebook had worked on hardware previously, though its involvement with Portal goes much deeper and further. In 2013, the company and the manufacturer HTC produced the HTC First, a smartphone that ran on a new Facebook-based operating system. The phone flopped.The company also sells virtual-reality goggles, which it got into when the start-up Oculus was already building those products. Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014.Rafa Camargo, Facebook\u2019s vice president who oversees Portal, said that when his team said it wanted to work on a smart home product with a large screen, his peers reacted in disbelief \u2014 especially since Amazon and Apple were focused on speakers and not video.\u201cEveryone was like: \u2018You\u2019re nuts. The whole thing is just about smart speakers and just voice,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Camargo, who joined Facebook about two years ago.But he said that voice was just one feature of the product and that Facebook could offer customers a different type of experience.\u201cWe come from focusing on people,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

(Tesla\u2019s shares plummeted on Friday, giving short sellers $1.3 billion in profit.)But how much will really change?The deal \u2014 which will now be called the \u201cUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement\u201d \u2014 includes big concessions:\u2022 Canada will ease protections on its dairy industry and give the U.S. more access to its markets.\u2022 The U.S. won\u2019t eliminate an independent tariff dispute system or impose auto tariffs on Canada. (Aluminum and steel ones may remain, though.)Sunday\u2019s breakthrough came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada became involved in the talks over the weekend. He even asked Mexico, which had already reached an accord with the U.S., to intervene.The hacking is another headache for Facebook. The company has been buffeted over the last year by scandals including the abuse of user data and the manipulation of the social network for election meddling.California\u2019s new laws are tougher than those enacted by the Obama administration. They forbid internet service providers from intentionally slowing web services or blocking online content, and ban them from accepting money to make some services run faster.More on what it means, from Tony Romm and Brian Fung of the WaPo:The F.C.C.\u2019s efforts immediately put Washington on a collision course with the states. To start, more than 20 states filed lawsuits against the F.C.C., arguing that the agency had acted arbitrarily in repealing the net neutrality rules. Their efforts have won the support of companies like Mozilla and trade associations representing tech giants including Amazon, Facebook and Google.About 165 companies will be affected. Facebook and Tesla don\u2019t currently comply, for example, and will need at least three women on their board by 2021.The bill has detractors. Even Gov. Jerry Brown acknowledged that the law could face legal challenges.There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar. The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment.The mini-recession ended when China let banks borrow more and the Fed held interest rates steady. But Mr. Irwin notes that the dip may have had serious consequences \u2014 including making Donald Trump\u2019s economic message more attractive to those in the affected industries.\u2022 The median salary offer for a C.E.O. role at a Series C consumer products company is $325,000 in cash, with a 50 percent bonus and a 6 percent stock grant.\u2022 The median salary for a senior director of engineering at a young Series A start-up is about $200,000 in cash, with a 0.58 percent stock grant.Business Insider created interactive charts using the data, and they are worth studying to see how much these workers make \u2014 and how companies alter compensation as they get older.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Uber and Lyft Charge Toward Potential I.P.O.s Next Year", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUber and Lyft have for years battled for customers in the fast-growing ride-hailing business. Now the bitter rivals may fight for investors in their initial public offerings.Uber has received proposals from the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs that say the technology giant could be worth as much as $120 billion in an I.P.O., two people briefed on the matter who were not allowed to discuss it publicly said on Tuesday.At $120 billion, Uber\u2019s debut on Wall Street would be the biggest since the Alibaba Group of China began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014.The market for tech I.P.O.s has surged in 2018. Nearly 200 companies have raised more than $53 billion in initial public offerings in American markets, making it the busiest year for tech newcomers to Wall Street since 2014, according to data from Dealogic.But a blockbuster public offering for Uber, which has burned through billions of dollars since it was founded in 2009 and does not appear to be close to sustained profitability, would mark a significant increase in risk-taking for investors in publicly traded companies.The banks also suggested that Uber could list its shares for trading on the stock market earlier than its original plans for late 2019. That would put pressure on the company\u2019s main rival in the United States, Lyft, which recently picked JPMorgan Chase to lead its own initial public offering, said two other people briefed on the matter who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.This year, Lyft\u2019s latest fund-raising round valued the company at $15 billion. It had been planning to go public in the spring, putting distance between its I.P.O. and Uber\u2019s.Now the companies could find themselves in a race to the public markets, courting investors eager for a piece of two prominent tech industry darlings. The company that goes first is expected to have an advantage and could demand a higher price for its shares.\u201cThe first ride-sharing I.P.O. will get a lot of attention, so I think there\u2019s some marketing value to being the first one out of the gate,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides research and manages funds.Uber\u2019s I.P.O. is likely to be among the biggest financial events on Wall Street next year. At $120 billion, it would rival the total value of Facebook when it went public in 2012 with a market capitalization of $104 billion, Ms. Smith said.As a privately held company, Uber is not required to publicly disclose its quarterly results. But for some time it has revealed basic financial information to give investors a better sense of its health.At the time, Uber was struggling to overcome a range of management issues, and the SoftBank investment was a steep discount from earlier rounds, which priced the company as high as $70 billion.A $500 million investment made by Toyota in August valued Uber at $76 billion.The San Francisco company is aggressively trying to increase business for UberEats, its food delivery business, and is expanding into rentals of electric bikes and scooters, as well as bookings for freight shipments.Lyft said revenue for 2017 was $1 billion \u2014 a 168 percent increase from the year before \u2014 but did not disclose its profits or losses for the year. Financial analysts assume Lyft, like Uber, has burned through significant amounts of cash.Uber and Lyft are both working on autonomous vehicles. Executives believe that driverless cars could eliminate one of their biggest expenses \u2014 human drivers. But the technology is, for the moment, prohibitively expensive and far from wide commercial use.A lack of profits is unlikely to scare off investors.

Plans College for Artificial Intelligence, Backed by $1 Billion", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery major university is wrestling with how to adapt to the technology wave of artificial intelligence \u2014 how to prepare students not only to harness the powerful tools of A.I., but also to thoughtfully weigh its ethical and social implications. A.I. courses, conferences and joint majors have proliferated in the last few years.But the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is taking a particularly ambitious step, creating a new college backed by a planned investment of $1 billion. Two-thirds of the funds have already been raised, M.I.T. said, in announcing the initiative on Monday.The linchpin gift of $350 million came from Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, the big private equity firm. The college, called the M.I.T. Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing, will create 50 new faculty positions and many more fellowships for graduate students.It is scheduled to begin in the fall semester next year, housed in other buildings before moving into its own new space in 2022.The goal of the college, said L. Rafael Reif, the president of M.I.T., is to \u201ceducate the bilinguals of the future.\u201d He defines bilinguals as people in fields like biology, chemistry, politics, history and linguistics who are also skilled in the techniques of modern computing that can be applied to them.But, he said, \u201cto educate bilinguals, we have to create a new structure.\u201dAcademic departments still tend to be silos, Mr. Reif explained, despite interdisciplinary programs that cross the departmental boundaries. Half the 50 faculty positions will focus on advancing computer science, and the other half will be jointly appointed by the college and by other departments across M.I.T.Traditionally, departments hold sway in hiring and tenure decisions at universities. So, for example, a researcher who applied A.I.-based text analysis tools in a field like history might be regarded as too much a computer scientist by the humanities department and not sufficiently technical by the computer science department.M.I.T.\u2019s leaders hope the new college will alter traditional academic thinking and practice.\u201cWe need to rewire how we hire and promote faculty,\u201d said Martin Schmidt, the provost of M.I.T.Today, most dual-major programs involve taking courses in a computer science department in machine learning or data science in addition to a student\u2019s major. The M.I.T. college is an effort to have computing baked into the curriculum rather than stapled on. It will grant degrees, though what they will be or their names have not been determined.That appealed to Melissa Nobles, dean of M.I.T.\u2019s School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, who said she saw the new college as helping non-computer scientists bring A.I. tools to their fields \u2014 \u201cto what they really care about.\u201dThe college, Ms. Nobles said, offers the possibility of a renewal for humanities studies at M.I.T., where students flock to computer science and engineering.\u201cWe\u2019re excited by the possibilities,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how the humanities are going to survive, not by running from the future but by embracing it.\u201dDonors, like students, are attracted more to computer science programs than to many other disciplines. But the new college at M.I.T. is designed to spread the wealth.\u201cIt\u2019s a major fund-raising mechanism that gives M.I.T. a huge resource to apply A.I. to other fields,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, who was the executive chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and is a visiting innovation fellow at M.I.T.The college and its goals were shaped by a long-running conversation between Mr. Schwarzman, the principal donor, and Mr. Reif, the M.I.T. president. They first met in 2015 when Mr. Schwarzman was setting up the Schwarzman Scholars program, which awards scholarships for young people to gain a greater understanding of China.At the time, Mr. Schwarzman was becoming increasingly fascinated by the debate over the opportunity and challenge presented by artificial intelligence. A lengthy conversation with Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, piqued his interest, Mr. Schwarzman recalled, and he kept talking to experts and reading.\u201cI became convinced that this technology was so powerful it was really going to remake a lot of the world as we know it,\u201d he said.Over the next few years, Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Reif picked up the conversation about the trajectory of A.I. and its broad impact, when their paths crossed in places like New York and Davos, Switzerland.Over the past year, M.I.T.\u2019s leaders and faculty were brainstorming to chart a course for the university\u2019s future. The university had done individual initiatives in areas like the future of work and a research project on the human and machine intelligence.But Mr. Schwarzman urged Mr. Reif to go further, emphasizing the ethical issues raised by automated decision-making in everything from medical diagnosis to self-driving cars. He also stressed the workplace impact.\u201cWe really need to try to understand this technology, not just get hit by it,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said.Meanwhile, Mr. Reif was also focused on making a universitywide impact. His persistent question: \u201cHow do I make sure these tools are used by everyone in every discipline?\u201dThe new college structure was his answer. Mr. Schwarzman said he would be interested in contributing, and soon after, Mr. Reif made his pitch.\u201cWell, that is a big number,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said, recalling his initial reaction.After further study, he said yes.Mr. Schwarzman said he hoped that the M.I.T. move might trigger others to invest in America\u2019s A.I. future, not just commercially. He points to the major push the Chinese government is making, and notes the fruits of United States government-funded research in the past \u2014 technologies that helped America take the global lead in industries from the personal computer to the internet.\u201cI think we\u2019ve been lagging, for whatever reason,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the chief executive of the Blackstone Group. He is Stephen A. Schwarzman, not Steven. The error was repeated in a picture caption.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tencent Is Suffering a One-Two Punch From the Tech Stock Sell-Off", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTencent is exposed to a double dose of pain as a global tech rout gathers pace.On Wednesday, United States technology stocks fell sharply. But even against that backdrop and a similar plight afflicting Chinese rivals, the Hong Kong-listed gaming giant Tencent stands apart. It has lost $230 billion of market value from its peak in January, which is magnified by fickle Chinese traders and its exposure to emerging markets.Investors have wiped out about 40 percent of the tech titan\u2019s market value so far this year: it is now worth $348 billion. That compares to the less than 30 percent declines suffered by its U.S.-listed Chinese rivals Alibaba and Baidu over the same period. Slowing earnings growth and an unforeseen regulatory crackdown on mobile games, Tencent\u2019s core business, by the Chinese government triggered the slump. But it has since snowballed amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and concerns of a slowing economy in the People\u2019s Republic.Tencent\u2019s listing location is one reason it is getting hit harder than other tech companies. Analysts at BNP Paribas believe that it\u2019s currently the top-selling name on the Stock Connect scheme linking mainland exchanges to Hong Kong, which allows investors in China to trade the company\u2019s shares. That means Tencent is exposed to flighty Chinese investors, who tend to be quicker than most to buy and sell, making the good times richer \u2014 and the bad times poorer.A capital flight is also playing a part. Tencent is the top company in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, with a 4.5 percent weighting. The index has slumped 14 percent this year, largely because of outflows from riskier markets as the U.S. Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy. By contrast, Alibaba\u2019s weighting in the index is 3.7 percent and Baidu\u2019s only 1.2 percent.Tencent has responded to its decline with share buybacks. The company has been stepping up repurchases, spending $100 million since September, according to filings. But the amount it has bought \u2014 just 0.03 percent of its shares outstanding \u2014 is too small to make a real difference. Tencent shares still trade at almost 26 times forward earnings, according to Refinitiv data, but the premium is narrowing to its top rival Alibaba at 23 times.If that closes, Tencent will have one more thing to worry about.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Computer Stories: A.I. Is Beginning to Assist Novelists", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe idea that a novelist is someone struggling alone in a room, equipped with nothing more than determination and inspiration, could soon be obsolete. Mr. Sloan is writing his book with the help of home-brewed software that finishes his sentences with the push of a tab key.It\u2019s probably too early to add \u201cnovelist\u201d to the long list of jobs that artificial intelligence will eliminate. But if you watch Mr. Sloan at work, it is quickly clear that programming is on the verge of redefining creativity.Mr. Sloan, who won acclaim for his debut, \u201cMr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore,\u201d composes by writing snippets of text, which he sends to himself as messages and then works over into longer passages. His new novel, which is still untitled, is set in a near-future California where nature is resurgent. The other day, the writer made this note: \u201cThe bison are back. Herds 50 miles long.\u201dMr. Sloan likes it. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have written \u2018bare sky\u2019 by myself? Maybe, maybe not.\u201d\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was thinking at all, but it\u2019s interesting,\u201d the writer said. \u201cThe lovely language just pops out and I go, \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u201dHis software is not labeled anything as grand as artificial intelligence. It\u2019s machine learning, facilitating and extending his own words, his own imagination. At one level, it merely helps him do what fledgling writers have always done \u2014 immerse themselves in the works of those they want to emulate. Hunter Thompson, for instance, strived to write in the style of F. Scott Fitzgerald, so he retyped \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d several times as a shortcut to that objective.Writers are readers, after all. \u201cI have read some uncounted number of books and words over the years that all went into my brain and stewed together in unknown and unpredictable ways, and then certain things come out,\u201d Mr. Sloan said. \u201cThe output can\u2019t be anything but a function of the input.\u201dA tinkerer and experimenter, Mr. Sloan started down the road of computer-assisted creation driven by little more than \u201cbasic, nerdy curiosity.\u201d Many others have been experimenting with fiction that pushes in the direction of A.I.Mr. Sloan wanted to see for himself. He acquired from the Internet Archive a database of texts: issues of Galaxy and If, two popular science fiction magazines in the 1950s and \u201960s. After trial and error, the program came up with a sentence that impressed him: \u201cThe slow-sweeping tug moved across the emerald harbor.\u201d\u201cIt was a line that made you say, \u2018Tell me more,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sloan said.Those original magazines were too limiting, however, full of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes. So Mr. Sloan augmented the pool with what he calls \u201cThe California Corpus,\u201d which includes the digital text of novels by John Steinbeck, Dashiell Hammett, Joan Didion, Philip K. Dick and others; Johnny Cash\u2019s poems; Silicon Valley oral histories; old Wired articles; the California Department of Fish and Wildlife\u2019s Fish Bulletin; and more. \u201cIt\u2019s growing and changing all the time,\u201d he said.Unlike Mr. French a quarter-century ago, Mr. Sloan probably will not use his computer collaborator as a selling point for the finished book. He\u2019s restricting the A.I. writing in the novel to an A.I. computer that is a significant character, which means the majority of the story will be his own inspiration. But while he has no urge to commercialize the software, he is intrigued by the possibilities. Megasellers like John Grisham and Stephen King could relatively easily market programs that used their many published works to assist fans in producing authorized imitations.As for the more distant prospects, another San Francisco Bay Area science fiction writer long ago anticipated a time when novelists would turn over the composing to computerized \u201cwordmills.\u201d In Fritz Leiber\u2019s \u201cThe Silver Eggheads,\u201d published in 1961, the human \u201cnovelists\u201d spend their time polishing the machines and their reputations. When they try to rebel and crush the wordmills, they find they have forgotten how to write.Mr. Sloan has finished his paragraph:\u201cThe bison were lined up fifty miles long, not in the cool sunlight, gathered around the canyon by the bare sky. They had been traveling for two years, back and forth between the main range of the city. They ring the outermost suburbs, grunting and muttering, and are briefly an annoyance, before returning to the beginning again, a loop that had been destroyed and was now reconstituted.\u201d\u201cI like it, but it\u2019s still primitive,\u201d the writer said. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming next is going to make this look like crystal radio kits from a century ago.\u201dFollow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @davidstreitfeldAdvertisement"}

And now that competition could extend into a battle for investors as the companies push for stock market debuts in 2019.The first to go public would get dibs on investors eager for a piece of the ride-hailing business. That could be especially important for Lyft, given that its I.P.O. would most likely be swamped by its much bigger rival\u2019s, whose offering would be the biggest to hit the market since Alibaba\u2019s in 2014.Positive earnings reports, including from Goldman Sachs and Netflix, were factors, as were strong economic data, which showed a fourth straight month of industrial production gains and job openings at a record high.The ratio for the companies in the S.&P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.That level of investor risk-taking could augur well for the stock market, Mr. Eavis writes \u2014 but may evaporate if another big tech company, like Facebook, delivers disappointing earnings.To make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing without spiking prices, and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations summed up the fine line Mr. Trump must walk: \u201cIt\u2019s a neat trick if you can both sanction a country and partner with them at the same time.\u201dJudge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said that the settlements were \u201cfair, reasonable and will serve the interests of the public and investors.\u201d She did not mention Mr. Musk\u2019s more recent Twitter antics, such as a tweet where he appeared to call the agency the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201dGoogle has always made its Android operating system available for free. It\u2019s a way to get its apps on as many devices as possible, and to collect data about users and sell advertising. But in Europe, it will now charge handset manufacturers to install apps like Gmail and Google Maps.It\u2019s a response to a European antitrust ruling in July that hit Google with a roughly $5 billion fine for unfairly bundling free Android services to maintain its market dominance. (Google is appealing the decision, but it faced a deadline by which it had to change operations or risk further punishment.)The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.\u201cThe potential amount of debt is an iceberg with titanic credit risks,\u201d S.&P. credit analysts led by Gloria Lu wrote in a report Tuesday. Much of the buildup relates to local government financing vehicles, which don\u2019t necessarily have the full financial backing of local governments themselves.That may be a big worry: China\u2019s economy has slowed and defaults have risen this year.

{"Headline": "Private Businesses Built Modern China. Now the Government Is Pushing Back.", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldHONG KONG \u2014 The comments were couched in careful language, but the warning about China\u2019s direction was clear.\u201cThe phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Wu said, \u201cis worth noting.\u201dMr. Wu gave rare official voice to a growing worry among Chinese entrepreneurs, economists and even some government officials: China may be stepping back from the free-market, pro-business policies that transformed it into the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. For 40 years, China has swung between authoritarian Communist control and a freewheeling capitalism where almost anything could happen \u2014 and some see the pendulum swinging back toward the government.The debate has gone all the way to the top. On Thursday, President Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s leader, sought to reassure private entrepreneurs that Beijing would still support them. But he also offered a full-throated defense of the country\u2019s big state-controlled companies, which many economists believe crowd out private businesses.\u201cSuch statements as \u2018there should be no state-owned enterprises\u2019 and \u2018we should have smaller-scale state-owned enterprises\u2019 are wrong and slanted,\u201d Mr. Xi said during a visit to a facility owned by China National Petroleum Corporation, a major state-controlled oil company.Today, the private sector contributes nearly two-thirds of the country\u2019s growth and nine-tenths of new jobs, according to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, an official business group. So pressures on private businesses could create serious ripples.Leftist scholars, bloggers and government officials are providing theoretical and practical support. In January, Zhou Xincheng, a professor of Marxism at Renmin University in Beijing, declared that private ownership should be eliminated.Last month, Wu Xiaoping, then an unknown blogger, wrote that the private sector should be ended now that it had accomplished its historic mission of achieving growth. Mr. Wu\u2019s blog went viral.Also last month, Qiu Xiaoping, a vice minister of human resources and social security, urged \u201cdemocratic management\u201d of private enterprises, saying that they should be jointly run by business owners and their employees.But entrepreneurs say the pace of change in Chinese taxes \u2014 already among the world\u2019s highest \u2014 gives them little time to prepare. For example, next year China will step up efforts to collect social-benefit payments and shift the way they are calculated, resulting in higher costs. Stricter social security tax collections could erode China\u2019s corporate profits by 2.5 percent, according to Lu Ting, an economist at Nomura Securities in Hong Kong.That could particularly hurt smaller companies, which tend to be privately owned and often have thin profit margins. Chinese officials have promised to cut overall taxes, but the details have been scant.Some struggling entrepreneurs are doing what was once considered unthinkable: selling out to the state. So far this year, 46 private companies have agreed to sell shares to state-controlled firms, with more than half selling controlling stakes, according to the Shanghai Securities News, an official government newspaper. While the number is small considering the vast Chinese economy, it reverses a two-decade trend of state companies selling shares to private entrepreneurs.One was the Changchun Sinoenergy Corporation, an oil and gas company. Its controlling shareholders agreed to sell their stakes to a company run by the government of Hunan Province after a loan was called. The government has pledged to inject nearly $150 million into the company.China has also taken steps to gain greater control over its technology sector, which flourished largely free from government influence.The authorities have also tightened rules governing online commerce. A new law requires those who run online stores to register with the government and pay taxes. That could hit Alibaba Group, also one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies, because it runs an online bazaar, called Taobao, where merchants big and small have opened thousands of digital stores. In a statement, Alibaba said it hoped the introduction of the new law would bring positive development to the industry.Private entrepreneurs are loath to speak out for fear of attracting official condemnation. But signs of distress aren\u2019t hard to find.Optimists point to expressions of concern from China\u2019s top leadership as an indicator that the government will give businesses more room. Others believe the tougher environment will stay. Xiao Han, an associate law professor in Beijing, cited one of Aesop's fables, of a man trying and failing to stop a donkey from going over a cliff.\u201cBefore long,\u201d Mr. Xiao said, \u201cwe\u2019ll probably find a body of a China donkey under the cliff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Opens New Front in His Battle With China: International Shipping", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump plans to withdraw from a 144-year-old postal treaty that has allowed Chinese companies to ship small packages to the United States at a steeply discounted rate, undercutting American competitors and flooding the market with cheap consumer goods.The withdrawal, announced by the White House on Wednesday, is part of a concerted push by Mr. Trump to counter China\u2019s dominance and punish it for what the administration says is a pattern of unfair trade practices. The White House, in a statement, said \u201csufficient progress has not been made on reforming terms\u201d of the postal treaty and that it would begin the withdrawal process while seeking to \u201cnegotiate bilateral and multilateral agreements that resolve the problems.\u201dThe Universal Postal Union treaty, first drafted in 1874, sets fees that national postal services charge to deliver mail and small parcels to countries around the world. Since 1969, poor and developing countries \u2014 including China \u2014 have been assessed lower rates than wealthier countries in Europe and North America.While the lower rates were intended to foster development in Asia and Africa, Chinese companies now make up about 60 percent of packages shipped into the country, taking advantage of the lower rates to ship clothing, household gadgets and consumer electronics. Many websites now offer free shipping from China, in part because of the cheap postal rates, administration officials say.The decision to withdraw was made at the urging of Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line trade adviser, who sees the move as a way to thwart China and an opportunity to challenge the authority of international groups, like the World Trade Organization, that, in his view, fail to give the United States voting powers commensurate with the country\u2019s economic stature.State Department officials were expected on Wednesday to inform officials at the Universal Postal Union in Bern, Switzerland, a branch of the United Nations that administers the treaty, of their intention to pull out of the system and \"self-declare\u201d new, higher rates on China, a United States official said.According to the union\u2019s rules, members will have a year to renegotiate new terms before the withdrawal becomes permanent. \u201cIf negotiations are successful, the administration is prepared to rescind the notice of withdrawal and remain\u201d in the treaty, the White House statement said.The move will most likely inflame tensions with China, which the administration has accused of unfair trade practices and punished with tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, investment restrictions and other measures. Administration officials are still weighing whether Mr. Trump will meet with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in Argentina next month.It is not clear whether China will retaliate if the United States pulls out of the treaty. Administration officials said they were assessing rates for other countries and had not made any decisions about whether the policy would extend beyond China.Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval to withdraw because the last version of the treaty was never put up to a vote, administration officials said.The pact has been long been a source of frustration for presidents of both parties, and prompted complaints from small businesses, big retailers like Amazon and shipping giants like UPS. The treaty was last modified in 2016 to raise some shipping costs on Chinese exports. But Mr. Navarro and Mr. Trump dismissed those changes as insufficient to deal with the explosion of online free shipping offers of goods from China.The \u201csystem creates winners and losers,\u201d the report\u2019s author\u2019s concluded, especially China\u2019s national postal service and \"Chinese online retailers in the lightweight, low-value package segment at the expense of the U.S. Postal Service and American retailers.\u201dThe losses to retailers and manufacturers could be much more, as online commerce expands further.Industry groups, even ones that have questioned the president\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports, applauded the move as proportional and targeted.\u201cThis outdated arrangement contributes significantly to the flood of counterfeit goods and dangerous drugs that enter the country from China,\u201d said Jay Timmons, chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group. \u201cManufacturers and manufacturing workers in the United States will greatly benefit from a modernized and far more fair arrangement with China.\u201dBut the changes could have an even bigger impact on small retailers who have found themselves outgunned and undercut by Chinese competitors.Jayme Smaldone, who runs a 12-employee housewares company in Rahway, N.J., first became aware of the problem when he noticed websites selling Chinese knockoffs of his Mighty Mug, a desktop coffee cup he designed with an anti-topple base.\u201cSomething has to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can my government be subsidizing China and driving me out of business?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next Tech Talent Shortage: Quantum Computing Researchers", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChristopher Savoie, founder and chief executive of a start-up called Zapata, offered jobs this year to three scientists who specialize in an increasingly important technology called quantum computing. They accepted.Several months later, the Cambridge, Mass., company was still waiting for the State Department to approve visas for the specialists. All three are foreigners, born in Europe and Asia.Whether the delays were the result of tougher immigration policy or just red tape, Mr. Savoie\u2019s predicament was typical of a growing concern among American businesses and universities: Unless policies and priorities change, they will have trouble attracting the talent needed to build quantum technology, which could make today\u2019s computers look like toys.It is a story that is being told repeatedly in the tech industry in the United States. As companies push into new technologies, they are finding it harder to identify qualified engineers and researchers. They are also facing tougher immigration rules for foreign-born tech experts and competing with tech centers like Montreal, London, Paris and Beijing.International competition is a particularly thorny issue in quantum computing because one of these machines \u2014 in theory \u2014 could crack the encryption that protects sensitive information inside governments and businesses around the world. If a quantum computer can be built, it will be exponentially more powerful than even today\u2019s supercomputers.Last month, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy invited experts from government, industry and academia to Washington for a daylong policy meeting dedicated to quantum technologies. Several attendees, including Mr. Savoie, expressed concern that the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies could affect quantum research in academia and corporations.\u201cThe concern is: Are we still the destination for the best and the brightest in science and engineering and technology?\u201d said Roger Falcone, a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, who attended the meeting in Washington.The labor pool in quantum computing is even smaller. By some accounts, fewer than a thousand people in the world can claim to be doing leading research in the field.For decades, quantum computing was purely experimental. When it was first proposed in the early 1980s, the goal was to build a system based on the seemingly magical principles of quantum mechanics. Over the past several years, scientists have shown that they can build these machines, if only on a small scale.With traditional computers, transistors store \u201cbits\u201d of information, and each bit is either a 1 or a 0. Those are the fundamental slices of data that tell a computer what to do.When some types of matter are extremely small or extremely cold, they behave differently. That difference allows a quantum bit, or qubit, to store a combination of 1 and 0. Two qubits can hold four values at once. As the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.Scientists who build these systems specialize in the physics of those very small or cold things, which is nothing like the physics we experience from day to day.\u201cThere just aren\u2019t that many people who know how to do this,\u201d said Steven Girvin, a professor of physics at Yale University. \u201cThese machines are quasi-hand-built by Ph.D.s in physics.\u201dBecause these machines could eventually break today\u2019s encryption, some believe there are reasons to be careful as large numbers of foreigners move into the field and to find ways of building a larger pool of American-born talent that can handle sensitive breakthroughs.\u201cWe need to be cognizant\u201d of the potential for academic and industrial espionage, said Paul Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. \u201cThe answer is not to shut down the flow of people from abroad, but to find ways of better protecting intellectual property.\u201dAs American tech giants like Google, IBM, Intel and Microsoft accelerate their quantum computing efforts, work is speeding up in China and Europe as well. The Chinese government is working on a $10 billion national lab for quantum research in Hefei, set to open in 2020, and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is building a lab of its own. In 2016, the European Union invested 1 billion euros \u2014 roughly $1.2 billion \u2014 in quantum computing.Could those efforts race past progress in the United States and possibly threaten national security? \u201cIf you are talking about a quantum computer in Russia or China or anywhere else, you are talking about a weaponized technology,\u201d said Arthur Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington.The good news is no one has been able to build a commercially viable quantum computer so far, so there is time to fix the talent problem. Lawmakers and government officials are exploring strategies to help ensure that the pool of available talent grows.Jacob Taylor, a veteran quantum researcher who oversees quantum strategy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, played down concerns that other countries could beat the United States to quantum computing. \u201cWe have been the leader in this world for a long time,\u201d he said.In artificial intelligence research, many worry that too much talent is moving from academia into industry, lured by high salaries, bonuses and stock options. In the quantum field, policymakers like Dr. Taylor hope to address this problem by funding projects at university and government labs.\u201cI see the country at a crossroads with quantum information systems,\u201d said Brian DeMarco, a professor of physics at the University of Illinois who specializes in quantum computing and has worked with government organizations on the technology. \u201cI can see things not working out, where the balance is not good, and it derails our ability to compete.\u201dAdvertisement"}
